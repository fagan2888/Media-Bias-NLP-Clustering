Rob Portman, the affable Republican from Ohio, wasn\u2019t even a blip on pollster John Zogby\u2019s latest survey of the 2016 GOP presidential field.\n\nThe Zogby Analytics finding published on Wednesday by Forbes says that Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is leading the field with 20 percent support among likely GOP primary voters \u201cfollowed by \u2018establishment\u2019 candidates New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, with 13 percent each.\u201d\n\nBringing up the rear are Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker with 8 percent, Sen. Marco Rubio (FL) with 7 percent and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal with 4 percent.\n\nRelated: Paul and Rubio Take Early Lead in 2016 Spending\n\nYet Portman suddenly is getting a lot of media attention, now that the National Republican Party has announced its choice of Cleveland, Ohio, as the site of its 2016 national convention \u2013 especially given the importance of Ohio in his party\u2019s efforts to win back the White House.\n\nPortman\u2019s home state of Ohio traditionally has been a key swing state and bellwether that President Obama carried twice, in 2008 against Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and in 2012 against former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.\n\nPortman has been around presidential politics for much of his career \u2013 primarily in supporting roles or working in the background. He reportedly was on Romney\u2019s short-list of candidates to be his running mate in 2012, before Romney picked Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.\n\nRelated: New Jersey\u2019s Fiscal Woes Imperil An Already-Damaged Chris Christie\n\nPortman told The Washington Post Tuesday that he was \u201cnot particularly eager\u201d to run again but that \u201cif nobody running is able to win and is willing to address these issues, then I might have a change of heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving been involved in six presidential campaigns, I know what it\u2019s like,\u201d he told The Post\u2019s Robert Costa, adding that he would not make a decision about entering the 2016 GOP sweepstakes until later this year or in early 2015. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens, let\u2019s see who runs,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe conservative 58-year-old lawmaker served as White House budget director and U.S. Trade Representative under President George W. Bush. He speaks with authority on spending, tax, deficit, and trade issues.\n\nIn nearly16 years on Capitol Hill in both the House and Senate he has co-authored over a dozen bills that became law, including reforms for the Internal Revenue Service. More recently, he came out in favor of same-sex marriage after learning that his son Will is gay.\n\nRelated: The One Candidate Who Could Shake Up the 2016 Election\n\nPortman has shown an ability to work closely with Democrats, which he did in 2011 as part of the bipartisan congressional budget Super Committee. Yet he also hews to the GOP no-new-taxes line and faults President Obama for a failure of leadership.\n\nEven so, Portman projects a far softer, more collegial image than many of the conservative and Tea Party firebrands on Capitol Hill, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah.\n\nAs The Post reported, Portman more recently has promoted an anti-poverty agenda. During a speech before the American Enterprise Institute in May, he endorsed efforts to index the federal minimum wage to inflation and said that the GOP priorities should include prison reform and an understanding of the plight of nonviolent drug offenders.\n\nA downside for Portman is that he lacks true star power. Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer has compared him unfavorably to Romney for being \u201cstiff\u201d and unexciting\u201d \u2013 a true \u201cgreen-eye-shades\u201d politician. Yet Portman is bright, experienced and thoughtful. As Romney has said, Portman \u201chas demonstrated a kind of practicality that is appealing\u201d to many in the party.\n\nRelated: 78M Millennials Could Carry the 2016 Election. Here\u2019s Why\n\nZogby said Thursday he didn\u2019t include Portman or Cruz in his poll that was conducted in late June, but would include them in his next survey.\n\n\u201cPortman can be a player,\u201d Zogby said today in an interview. \u201cHe can win Ohio, is experienced, thoughtful, respected by all sides, a wonk. None of which means anything in Iowa, New Hampshire or to social and Tea Party conservatives. Otherwise he would have been the VP pick in 2012.\u201d\n\nHere are three good reasons Portman should be kept on the GOP presidential radar screen:\n\nPortman has appeal. If Jeb Bush doesn\u2019t run and Chris Christie doesn\u2019t bounce back from his \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal \u2013 both live possibilities \u2013 then mainstream moderate-conservative Republicans, including many in the financial sector, will need a candidate to rally around. Portman fits the bill perfectly.\n\nWhile Bush has generated interest among mainstream Republicans and business leaders, he\u2019s out of step with his party on immigration reform and other issues. Moreover, his wife, Columba, has a strong distaste for politics and reportedly is discouraging her husband from making the run. Meanwhile, the scandal over lane closures on the George Washington Bridge that seriously damaged Christie\u2019s presidential ambitions just won\u2019t go away.\n\n\n\nPortman is an easy sell in a general election compared to the party ideologues, according to University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. \u201cHe has wide and deep experience in government, is always one of the adults in the room, and is widely respected on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cHis stand in favor of marriage equality would actually give the GOP a shot at attracting many voters (especially the young) turned off by the Republican party\u2019s hard-right positions on social issues.\u201d\n\n\n\nOhio, Ohio, Ohio. Portman\u2019s home state traditionally has played a major role in presidential politics, and it is among a small group of crucial key swing states including North Carolina, Florida and Virginia that were decided by a margin smaller than 5 percentage points in 2012. Having an Ohioan lead the ticket would give the Republicans a good head start for a tough 2016 election season, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is expected to head the Democratic ticket.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sen.
