Chris Christie. How could we endorse him, she asked, when we criticized him so harshly in the same piece? Had we lost our minds?\n\nNot quite. An endorsement is not a love embrace. It is a choice between two flawed human beings. And the winner is often the less bad option.\n\nBut yes, we blew this one. When the endorsement ran, I could not get a cup of coffee in the People\u2019s Republic of Montclair without my liberal friends taunting me. Back then, I pushed back.\n\nYes, we knew Christie was a bully. But we didn\u2019t know his crew was crazy enough to put people\u2019s lives at risk in Fort Lee as a means to pressure the mayor. We didn\u2019t know he would use Hurricane Sandy aid as a political slush fund. And we certainly didn\u2019t know that Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer was sitting on a credible charge of extortion by Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno.\n\nEven before this scandal train got rolling, this endorsement was a close call and a split vote among the editorial board. We regard Christie as the most overrated politician in the country, at least until now, a man who is better at talking than governing. We criticized him for trashing the working poor, for his tea party approach to the environment, for his opposition to gay marriage and a livable minimum wage. And so on.\n\nBut there is more to it. Christie has made good progress on education with a focus on struggling cities, especially Newark and Camden. His pension and health reforms helped contain public costs that were spiraling out of control.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget his opponent, Sen. Barbara Buono. She was not up to the job of being governor \u2014 even in the view of many Democrats. She got the party\u2019s nomination because more credible candidates, including Cory Booker, backed out in the face of Christie\u2019s strength.\n\nAnd on education, the most important issue for any governor, Buono ran well to the left of President Obama. She embraced the state\u2019s regressive teachers\u2019 union and its relentless efforts to protect bad teachers and stunt the growth of even the best charter schools.\n\nThis is not about who we like better. Christie has boycotted the editorial board for years, an attempt to bully us into more loving coverage. So we\u2019ve had a front-row view of what a creep he can be. Buono is the more likable person by far.\n\nWe could have skipped the endorsement altogether, as the New York Times did. But voters have to push one button or the other, and we felt The Star-Ledger should belly up to the challenge and offer them our best advice. My guess is the Times would never punt on a presidential election for the same reason.\n\nSo we swallowed our hesitations and endorsed Christie, complete with our long list of deep reservations.\n\nNow, the governor is in a free fall in the polls, and liberals everywhere are rejoicing. And yes, it is delicious to see a bully like him lose the swagger.\n\nBut be careful. Because if you turn your focus to the presidential race in 2016, you might wind up facing the same dilemma we did in the fall.\n\nNow that Christie has been knocked back, the leading candidate for the GOP nomination is Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, recently famous for his bizarre rant about women\u2019s libido. And when he fades, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas will be waiting to pick up the pieces.\n\nLIVE CHAT: MORAN Have questions about The Star-Ledger's endorsement of Gov. Christie, or its regrets? Join Tom Moran here for a live chat Monday at noon. Ask @TomAMoran\n\nIf one of the tea party favorites gets the Republican nomination, then the country is at risk. Because as we have just seen, one scandal can flip the board in politics. What if Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee, and some dark secret emerges about her tenure as secretary of state? How does President Rand Paul sound to you?\n\nNow ask yourself this: If the Republican primary came to a choice between Paul and Christie, which candidate would you endorse?\n\nAt the risk of repeating a mistake, I\u2019d pick Christie in that primary, even now. And if you think that makes some sense, then you understand how excruciating the endorsement process can be.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2022 Live chat with Tom Moran Monday at noon: Why he regrets endorsing Christie\n\n\n\n\u2022 Rachel Maddow is puzzled by Star-Ledger's endorsement of Chris Christie\n\n\u2022 Poll: Did the Star-Ledger endorse the right candidate for governor?", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "barbara-buono, chris-christie, columns, governor, gwb-closure, hoboken-storm-funding, news", "title": "Chris Christie endorsement is regrettable: Moran", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Do you have questions about The Star-Ledger's endorsement of Gov.
