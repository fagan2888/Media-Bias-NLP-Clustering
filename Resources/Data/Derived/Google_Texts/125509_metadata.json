Director Don Mischer, in an American Archive of Television interview, called it one of the greatest disasters in television history.\n\nIt was TV\u2019s Titanic? If so, some impressive folks were on board. Bill Murray was part of the cast and so was his brother, Brian Doyle-Murray. According to imdb.com, among people who appeared on the Cosell show were Billy Crystal, Paul Anka, Bill Cosby, John Denver, Roberta Flack, Barry Manilow, Joe Namath, Ted Kennedy and Tulsa\u2019s Roy Clark.
