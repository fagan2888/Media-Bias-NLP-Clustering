(Photo: serazetdinov, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nCOUNTY \u2014 Commissioners Hancock and Garrett, without a doubt you retaliated against Sheriff Vigil, which is what the county administrators are known to do, but it's time that you get over your egos and start working for the Do\u00f1a Ana County residents.\n\nCOUNTY \u2014 To the caller who is asking why Julia Brown will not allow funding for the sheriff's legal representation, maybe she has read the \u201cCommon Sense\u201d pamphlet written by Thomas Paine.\n\nBUDGET \u2014 Congress just passed their budget, allotting $1.6 billion to resettle illegal immigrants. My 92-year-old mom gets $685 a month from Social Security that she paid in to for over 30 years, yet she gets no cost-of-living raise. What kind of country turns it's back on the most vulnerable?\n\nSPORTS COMPLEX \u2014 What gives with the sports complex in Mesilla? Two public meetings but the applicant does not show up. Now he meets with Larry Shannon privately. Is this transparent?\n\nGOV. MARTINEZ \u2014 Don't you people have anything better to do than bash Susana Martinez? She's a saint compared to Bill Richardson. Susana shows a little bit of human nature, has a little fun at a party.\n\n2016 \u2014 Jeb Bush is the only presidential candidate that shows me anything. Look what he did in Florida. He helped that state immensely but people are too dumb to figure that out and they're going instead for all the other bunch of clowns that are running.\n\nSOCCER \u2014 So the two recently banned big shots of FIFA plan to prove their innocence. My question, why didn't they prove their innocence before the ban?\n\nIMMIGRATION \u2014 Statistics show that violent crimes by undocumented immigrants have gone down 40 percent since 1993, but facts don't seem to matter to conservatives.\n\n2016 \u2014 Hillary managed to ignite the Twitter world, and not in a good way, when her campaign website posted \"7 things Hillary has in common with your abuela\", and \"#NotMiAbuela\" filled with negative comments. Many Hispanics were highly insulted by such blatant \"Hispandering.\"\n\nOBAMACARE \u2014 With the continuing insistence of Republicans that they will kill ObamaCare when in total power, hopefully the new surge of young voters who are signing up for ObamaCare will take notice.\n\n2016 \u2014 Donald Trump's unacceptable behavior tells me something about the crowd that continues to support him. It's a negative feeling that I have about him.\n\nSPORTS COMPLEX \u2014 It would be a great idea to have a sports complex. Right now we have a complex for soccer, which we pay between $700 to $900 per team for.\n\nCOUNTY \u2014 This county fiasco is getting worse every day. Now we, the taxpayers, are going to pay attorney fees for all individuals involved.\n\n2016 \u2014 Was watching Donald Trump and I'm sure he's using words that he never learned at his mother's knee. I would have had my mouth washed out with soap if I had. Of course, the Republicans love him and his potty mouth.\n\nPRESIDENT \u2014 I respect the service of our veterans, but I don't believe one has to be a veteran to be president of the United States. Franklin Roosevelt, World War II, and Woodrow Wilson, World War I, were not veterans. Even Abraham Lincoln only served as a soldier for a very brief few months. Putting these constraints on presidential candidates is absurd!\n\nGOV. MARTINEZ \u2014 Our governor is caught on police audio recordings obviously inebriated and very rude to responding officers when called because her staff were hurling bottles of the hotel balcony during a loud staff party. This after her secretary of state was sentenced for embezzlement.\n\n2016 \u2014 When Ted Cruz carpet bombs ISIS in Syria and Iraq, he should know he will be killing innocent Christians who are still living there. Not only will he be killing thousands of innocent Muslims but thousands from his own faith.\n\nBe heard: Call 575-541-5466 or email soundoff@lcsun-news.com to submit an item.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://lcsun.co/1YH5ISM", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "COUNTY \u2014\u00a0Commissioners Hancock and Garrett, without a doubt you retaliated against Sheriff Vigil, which is what the county administrators are known to do, but it's time that you get over your egos and start working for the Do\u00f1a Ana County residents.", "og": {"site_name": "Las Cruces Sun-News", "description": "COUNTY \u2014\u00a0Commissioners Hancock and Garrett, without a doubt you retaliated against Sheriff Vigil, which is what the county administrators are known to do, but it's time that you get over your egos and start working for the Do\u00f1a Ana County residents.", "title": "Sound Off: Dec. 26", "url": "http://www.lcsun-news.com/story/opinion/2015/12/25/sound-off-dec-26/77883958/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lcsun-news.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "COUNTY \u2014\u00a0Commissioners Hancock and Garrett, without a doubt you retaliated against Sheriff Vigil, which is what the county administrators are known to do, but it's time that you get over your egos and start working for the Do\u00f1a Ana County residents.", "creator": "@CrucesSunNews", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3bfd60a85e91a0a868c81fa432965bdc505df22b/c=0-546-2658-3204&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/15/LasCrucesSunNews/B9319713742Z.1_20151115231845_000_G3ICIILTP.1-0.jpg", "title": "Sound Off: Dec. 26", "site": "@CrucesSunNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=Las Cruces Sun-News for iPhone", "fb": {"app_id": 121681471253479}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Franklin Roosevelt, World War II, and Woodrow Wilson, World War I, were not veterans.\nMARTINEZ \u2014 Don't you people have anything better to do than bash Susana Martinez?\nCOUNTY \u2014 This county fiasco is getting worse every day.\nNot only will he be killing thousands of innocent Muslims but thousands from his own faith.\nRight now we have a complex for soccer, which we pay between $700 to $900 per team for."}
