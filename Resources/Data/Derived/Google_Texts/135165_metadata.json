Rand Paul (R-Y) said front-runner Donald Trump had \u201cno clue\u201d what nuclear triad was and that it \u201cworries me to have someone like Donald Trump or Chris Christie in charge of the nuclear arsenal.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPaul said, \u201cYou know, I think that we\u2019ve all let the polls consume us too much. I don\u2019t think the polls are very accurate. In Kentucky a week before the governor\u2019s race the polls were off by 13 points. That\u2019s where they\u2019re supposed to be accurate. I think we have an American Idol type of polls now. One candidate is getting an enormous amount of time on TV and people are saying, \u2018yeah, yeah, I might vote for him.\u2019 Those people don\u2019t get out and vote. About 10 percent of Republicans will vote in Iowa. You can be wildly off and disappoint some of us who aren\u2019t as high in the polls. If we skew the coverage forward the polls, it\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophesy. I think we need to examine over things and distribute the coverage better so we have a chance of getting a better president.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Trump understands what the nuclear triad is Paul said, \u201cThis is the worrisome thing. During the debate absolutely Trump had no clue what the nuclear triad is and he\u2019d been asked the question previously on the radio and had no idea what it was. Now they\u2019ve discovered what it is, they\u2019re ready to use it? I think this is worrisome not only trump but Christie and others on the stage who are really eager to have war. Really eager to show how strong they are and that gets away from the tradition we have of trying to limit power and reluctant to go to war. It gets to temperament. That\u2019s why it worries me to have someone like Donald Trump or Chris Christie in charge of the nuclear arsenal.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul: Trump Has No Clue What the Nuclear Triad Is", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Paul: Trump Has No Clue What the Nuclear Triad Is", "title": "Paul: Trump Has No Clue What the Nuclear Triad Is - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/rand1.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/12/20/paul-trump-has-no-clue-what-the-nuclear-triad-is/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paul: Trump Has No Clue What the Nuclear Triad Is", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/rand1.jpg", "title": "Paul: Trump Has No Clue What the Nuclear Triad Is - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Rand Paul,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Paul", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Rand Paul", "published_time": "2015-12-20T09:38:42-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "During the debate absolutely Trump had no clue what the nuclear triad is and he\u2019d been asked the question previously on the radio and had no idea what it was.\nThat\u2019s why it worries me to have someone like Donald Trump or Chris Christie in charge of the nuclear arsenal.\u201dFollow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN\nOne candidate is getting an enormous amount of time on TV and people are saying, \u2018yeah, yeah, I might vote for him.\u2019 Those people don\u2019t get out and vote.\nI think we need to examine over things and distribute the coverage better so we have a chance of getting a better president.\u201dWhen asked if Trump understands what the nuclear triad is Paul said, \u201cThis is the worrisome thing.\nI think this is worrisome not only trump but Christie and others on the stage who are really eager to have war."}
