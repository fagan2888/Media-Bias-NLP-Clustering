Tumpach, a Green Bay portfolio manager and research analyst, is no exception. But Tumpach doesn't rely on demographics alone. He looks for other factors that can enhance a stock's prospects.\n\nThe pharmacy benefits management industry is a good place to start, said Tumpach, who works in Associated Banc-Corp's private client and institutional services area. It is clearly a beneficiary of demographic trends: Older people take more pills, filling 28 prescriptions a year, compared to an average of 11.9 prescriptions for adults age 19 to 64, Tumpach said.\n\nAlso important is the industry's ability to help lower costs for payer groups, which include health insurers, and government and private employers.\n\n\"There's growing demand by payer groups to contain costs,\" Tumpach said\n\nExpress Scripts Holding Co., St. Louis, (ESRX, $70.56) is the biggest pharmacy benefit management organization in the United States, with more than 35% market share. The company's services include claims processing, home delivery of drugs, and management of formularies and health plans.\n\nAlthough its share price has been flat this year, Express Scripts stands to benefit from the many ways it could help contain prescription costs for insurance companies, Tumpach said.\n\n\"Because of its scale, Express Scripts has bargaining power and therefore can negotiate discounts and pass them on to customers,\" he said.\n\nThrough its control of the formulary, the list of drugs approved for a health insurance plan, Express Scripts can influence how much plan participants spend on prescription drugs.\n\nFor example, it can make sure that generic drugs are in the lowest-priced tier and their branded counterparts are in the higher-priced tiers. In 2014, Express Scripts excluded 48 drugs with a lower-cost alternative from its formularies, saving about $700 million annually for its payer groups, Tumpach said.\n\nExperts anticipate that, over the next few years, the U.S. will ease patent protections on eligible drugs in the specialty biotech market, Tumpach said. Insurers would realize some $250 billion in savings if the 11 most likely biotech drugs went generic, he said.\n\nThe rising number of younger plan participants, more comfortable with mail-order purchases, is expected to expand Express Scripts' profitable home delivery of drugs, Tumpach said. The company can narrow its network size to gain bargaining power with retailers and others, and more profitable generic sales are expected to grow.\n\nExpress Scripts generates about $4 billion in free cash flow, which translates into an attractive free cash flow yield of about 7.5%, Tumpach said. That means the company can buy back a hefty amount of its shares each year and make more acquisitions, he said.\n\nExpress Scripts' stock has underperformed this year after lower-than-expected earnings due to inclement weather, delays in the implementation of Obamacare and postponements to several contract starts.\n\nThe company had some account churn after its 2012 acquisition of Medco Health Solutions Inc., and there have been suggestions that the large WellPoint Inc. contract might be targeted for renegotiation, Tumpach said. Express Scripts' 2015 customer retention rate could dip to 92% from its traditional 95%, he said.\n\nStill, those risks may already be reflected in the company's stock price. Its stock is trading at about 13 times next year's earnings, well below its historical average of about 16 times, he said.\n\n\"We think that as the market becomes more comfortable with some of these headwinds \u2014 when the company begins to show it can bring its account retention ratio back above 95% and begin to win new accounts \u2014 the markets will become more comfortable with its growth profile,\" Tumpach said.\n\nExpress Scripts shares are trading in a 52-week range of $59.20 to $79.37. They could trade as high as $83 in the next 12 months, Tumpach said.\n\nABOUT THIS\n\nThe Journal Sentinel focuses on one Wisconsin money manager or analyst in this weekly feature, looking at a trend that helps investment pros make their decisions.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Stock benefits from aging population", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/stock-benefits-from-aging-population-b99361124z1-278911571.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "The pharmacy benefits management industry is clearly a beneficiary of demographic trends, says Mark Tumpach, a Green Bay portfolio manager and research analyst.", "title": "Stock benefits from aging population"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "The pharmacy benefits management industry is clearly a beneficiary of demographic trends, says Mark Tumpach, a Green Bay portfolio manager and research analyst.", "card": "summary", "title": "Stock benefits from aging population"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Express Scripts' stock has underperformed this year after lower-than-expected earnings due to inclement weather, delays in the implementation of Obamacare and postponements to several contract starts.\n\"Because of its scale, Express Scripts has bargaining power and therefore can negotiate discounts and pass them on to customers,\" he said.\nExpress Scripts' 2015 customer retention rate could dip to 92% from its traditional 95%, he said.\nExpress Scripts shares are trading in a 52-week range of $59.20 to $79.37.\nBy of theIn investing circles, the aging U.S. population is a long-lived theme."}
