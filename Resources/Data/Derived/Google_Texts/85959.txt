Reading your local newspaper can save lives. No, really…..

A Sri Lankan national daily, Mawbima, is believed to have saved thousands of lives when it published a special edition recently that featured citronella in its ink. As you may know, citronella wards off insects, but in this case it kept mosquitoes away from residents of the region that spread the potentially fatal dengue fever.

Britain’s The Independent recounts how Mawbima infused the citronella into the ink, thus making every word of the edition — published on World Health Day in April — a mosquito repellent. The newspaper determined that most of its readers peruse the publication in the early morning and evening, right around the time most bites occur.

Mawbima previously experimented with posters that were printed with the special ink and posted them at bus stops, where they proved effective, and handed out citronella-laced patches to schoolchildren to wear. Then it published the mosquito-repelling newspaper.

The results: Mawbima sold all its copies by 10 a.m., which represent a sales increase of 30%. Readership increased by an estimated 300,000.

It could be the first time it was noble to be a so-called “ink-stained rat.”
