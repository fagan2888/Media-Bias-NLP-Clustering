When the hunt began, she scooped up a purple plastic egg, but eschewed the bag, preferring instead to return each egg to her mother waiting outside the roped-off area.\n\n\"They were giving me the eggs instead of putting them in their bags,\" said a laughing Tara Gortner, Kaylee's mother, who was there with her cousin's two daughters, Reyna, 4, and Marley, 7.\n\nThe village, which is nestled inside of Allaire State Park, brought the Easter event back just a few years ago after a hiatus that spanned much of the 1990s and 2000s, according to events manager Abigail Murphy. They draw about 2,000 people every year and the sunny skies \u2014 although a strong wind made it brisk \u2014 likely brought that many out on Saturday, she said.\n\nThis is the first year in which they've adopted a divisional approach where kids were split into five different age groups with hunts going off every 15 minutes from noon to 3:45 p.m.\n\n\"There's three or four hunts going on at any time,\" Murphy said before excusing herself to countdown the start of another hunt through her megaphone.\n\nSprinkled in among the families, the Easter bunny, an alpaca and Clifford the Big Red Dog were a handful of historical re-enactors in bonnets and ankle-length skirts or turn-of-the-century Army shell jackets. Allaire Village is a non-profit educational and historic preservation organization that recreates the sights and sounds of the Howell Works Company, an early 19th Century iron producing community.\n\nKat Muller, volunteer coordinator at the Village, said the village's original residents would not have spent the day holding Easter egg hunts. A more buttoned-down celebration of an important religious holiday would have been the order of the day, she said.\n\nSaturday's Easter event also doubled as opening day: the Village is opening one month earlier this year.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1D50qd1", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Instead of giving away 10,000 Easter eggs in one free for all, for the first time ever the Allaire Village Easter Egg Hunt split the pastel-colored prizes into 49 separate searches.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Instead of giving away 10,000 Easter eggs in one free for all, for the first time ever the Allaire Village Easter Egg Hunt split the pastel-colored prizes into 49 separate searches.", "title": "10,000 Easter eggs given away at Allaire Village", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/2015/04/04/allaire-village-easter/25304057/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Instead of giving away 10,000 Easter eggs in one free for all, for the first time ever the Allaire Village Easter Egg Hunt split the pastel-colored prizes into 49 separate searches.", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b416116a4a6159f1b0ef1685a7f8b78349dc60f5/c=0-117-2200-2317&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2015/04/04/B9316824404Z.1_20150404180108_000_GBIADNUQP.1-0.jpg", "title": "Easter egg hunt at Allaire Village", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "easter egg hunt, easter eggs, allaire village, allaire state park"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde4aa\"", "article_summary": "Allaire Village hosts an Easter event centered around an Easter egg hunt of 10,000 eggs for kids of all ages.\n(Photo: Doug Hood/Staff Photographer)Buy PhotoInstead of giving away 10,000 Easter eggs in one free for all, for the first time ever the Allaire Village Easter Egg Hunt split the pastel-colored prizes into 49 separate searches.\nKat Muller, volunteer coordinator at the Village, said the village's original residents would not have spent the day holding Easter egg hunts.\nSaturday's Easter event also doubled as opening day: the Village is opening one month earlier this year.\nAllaire Village is a non-profit educational and historic preservation organization that recreates the sights and sounds of the Howell Works Company, an early 19th Century iron producing community."}
