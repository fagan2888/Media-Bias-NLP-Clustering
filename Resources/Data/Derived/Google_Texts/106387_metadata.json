It would also provide a sliding-scale for new federally-funded airports, trains and railway cars to be eligible for federal funding only if 60 percent of their iron, steel and other components are American-made in 2015, increasing by ten-percent increments to 100 percent by 2019.\n\nThe head of a federal agency could request a waiver if they find that using a domestic product \u201cwould be inconsistent with the public interest\u201d or would increase total project schedule or cost by more than 25 percent (50 percent for department of defense projects).\n\nAlso, S.2681, introduced by Pryor, provides grants of no more than $100 million and government loans for businesses eliminating business resources and overseas in favor of domestic resources and jobs. This bill would also end tax deductions to defray costs of moving operations overseas.\n\nAnother bill introduced by Pryor, S.2680 would create a voluntary \u201cAmerica Star\u201d label for domestic goods \u2014 a label along the lines of \u201cEnergy Star\u201d labeling for efficient appliances.\n\nPryor\u2019s visit to Virco\u2019s factory on Sturgis Road comes at a time when the company is a few weeks away from getting a product back in Walmart stores. Virco used to have a lucrative contract to make the metal folding chairs that Walmart sold, but in the late 1990s Walmart contracted with an overseas manufacturer instead.\n\nNow, with what Pryor described as a narrowing gap between the cost of importing some goods from China and making them domestically, Walmart has begun an initiative to bring more American-made goods to market in its stores, including an initial trial run of a child-sized table and chair that will be made in Conway\u2019s Virco plant.\n\nGetting a product back in Walmart would be \u201chuge,\u201d Virco marketing director Steve Presley said during Pryor\u2019s visit. Presley also said there was optimism that Walmart might again be interested in Virco folding chairs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Senator Mark Pryor visited Conway\u2019s Virco factory on Friday as part of a tour to promote his \u201cAmerican-Made Strong\u201d package of bills hoped to incentivize domestic manufacturing.", "geo.position": "35.093106;-92.441872", "og": {"url": "http://thecabin.net/news/local/conway/2014-08-08/sen-pryor-visits-virco-factory-promote-american-made-strong-legislative", "type": "article", "image": "http://thecabin.net/sites/default/files/%21EW9U4570.jpg", "site_name": "TheCabin.net - Conway, Arkansas", "title": "Sen.
