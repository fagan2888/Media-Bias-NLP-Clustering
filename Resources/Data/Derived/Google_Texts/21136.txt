Our Tax Day special edition weighs in on the estate tax, the carbon tax, Caterpillar's offshore tax dodge, and the taxes on the rich that are paying part of the tab for the Affordable Care Act.

This week, we’re running our annual OtherWords Tax Day special edition. Chuck Collins and Bob Lord explain how billionaires are bypassing the estate tax and what’s wrong with that. Jim Hightower and cartoonist Khalil Bendib skewer Caterpillar Inc. for an offshore tax dodge. Don Kraus and Mona Funiciello call for a carbon tax. And William A. Collins and I say taxes on the rich are driving those futile GOP attacks on the Affordable Care Act.
