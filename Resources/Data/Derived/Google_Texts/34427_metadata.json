But the return of siblings Ogun and Oshoosi Size and the younger brother\u2019s seductive and dangerous friend Elegba to the stage will be worth the brilliant discomfort it may cause.\n\nStarting in spring 2015, the Curious Theatre Company will take on \u201cThe Brother/Sister Plays,\u201d Tarell Alvin McCraney\u2019s heralded trilogy about denizens of a Louisiana bayou, which includes \u201cThe Red and Brown Water,\u201d \u201cThe Brothers Size\u201d and \u201cMarcus, Or the Secret of Sweet.\u201d Curious will be only the fifth company in the nation to present McCraney\u2019s full cycle.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I want, as Curious evolves, is to expand the size of the palette of our work,\u201d says artistic director Chip Walton. McCraney was named a MacArthur Fellow in 2013.\n\n\u201cWhat are the ways we can make these experiences for our audience bigger than what a typical theater experience is? This is the beginning of what will become an ongoing commitment on our part to do these bigger-scope projects.\u201d\n\nThe trilogy is set to open in 2015 with \u201cThe Red and Brown Water.\u201d (March 7-April 18)\n\nLocal actors Cajardo Lindsey, Laurence Curry and Damion Hoover will return to the roles that helped make \u201cThe Brothers Size\u201d the theater event of last season.\n\nThe return of the combative/loving brothers of \u201cSize\u201d is not the only homecoming on Curious\u2019 slate. Denver native and Broadway vet and playwright/performer Martin Moran brings two solo shows to town.\n\nAbout the actor\u2019s 2013 off-Broadway show, New York Times\u2019 critic Ben Brantley wrote, \u201c(T)his chatty but soulful show leads you into thought- and emotion-stirring territory that you don\u2019t often visit at the theater.\u201d\n\nMoran will also reprise the 2004 Curious show \u201cThe Tricky Part,\u201d about his experiences becoming involved with the pedophile who molested him when he was 12. (Sept. 6-28)\n\nWalton and his creative team remain dedicated to bringing bold new voices to the Denver stage.\n\nCurious\u2019 17th season also features Lisa D\u2019Amour\u2019s \u201cDetroit.\u201d Last May, the dark comedy shared the Obie Award for Best New American Play with Julia Jarcho\u2019s \u201cGrimly Handsome.\u201d (May 9-June 20)\n\nAs part of the National New Play Network, the company will present a \u201crolling world premiere\u201d of Robert Caisley comedy \u201cLucky Me\u201d (Oct. 25-Dec. 6) Also on tap: Jessica Dickey\u2019s \u201cCharles Ives Take me Home\u201d (Jan. 10-Feb. 14)\n\nIt is indeed the time of year when a number of high-profile companies reveal what\u2019s next on their stages. Denver Center Attractions announced its upcoming national touring shows at the start of the week. Quick on the heels of its successful 9th Colorado New Play Summit, the Denver Center Theatre Company will soon pull back the curtain on its offerings. The Aurora Fox is set to throw a season announcement party Feb. 20.\n\nYes, the stars and playwrights and directors are aligning, not by accident but often by canny design. And ambitious theatergoers will likely have their cultural curiosity rewarded.\n\nFor information on the season and subscription packages go to curioustheatre.org or call 303-623-0524.\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567, lkennedy@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Curious Theater\u2019s new season lineup lives up to \u201cNo Guts, No Story\u201d mantra", "title": "Curious Theater\u2019s new season lineup lives up to \u201cNo Guts, No Story\u201d mantra", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/13/curious-theaters-new-season-lineup-lives-up-to-no-guts-no-story-mantra/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140213__20140216_E6_AE16THCURIOUSp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140213__20140216_E6_AE16THCURIOUSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-13T16:48:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T16:04:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda74c\"", "article_summary": "The return of the combative/loving brothers of \u201cSize\u201d is not the only homecoming on Curious\u2019 slate.\n\u201cOne of the things I want, as Curious evolves, is to expand the size of the palette of our work,\u201d says artistic director Chip Walton.\nQuick on the heels of its successful 9th Colorado New Play Summit, the Denver Center Theatre Company will soon pull back the curtain on its offerings.\n\u201cWhat are the ways we can make these experiences for our audience bigger than what a typical theater experience is?\n(Sept. 6-28)Walton and his creative team remain dedicated to bringing bold new voices to the Denver stage."}
