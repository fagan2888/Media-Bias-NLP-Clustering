Which? takes the pain out of choosing an epilator We've tried 11 of the best-selling epilators

More women are considering epilation over waxing and shaving

Which? researchers have tried out the most popular epilators on the market, to help take the sting out of finding the right one for you.

We asked several of our brave researchers to try out 11 of the best-selling epilators and report back. While some left skin smooth with minimal pain, others left prickly patches and made their eyes water.

To find out which epilators get our vote, see our full first look epilator reviews.

Choosing the best epilator

Choosing the right epilator to suit you very much depends on your own needs and preferences.

Some epilators come with different features and attachments to help make the experience more comfortable. And some epilators, like the cordless Braun Silk-épil 7 Skin Spa 7951, can be used on wet skin for extra comfort.

Others, like the Philips Satinelle HP6422, have fewer extra features, but are a little cheaper to buy.

Although epilating is never completely painless, our researchers felt that some models were far more comfortable to use than others. Find out which in our full first look epilator reviews.
