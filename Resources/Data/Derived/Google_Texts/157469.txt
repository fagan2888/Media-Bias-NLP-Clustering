DEVILS LAKE, N.D. (AP) - Fire has destroyed a Hardee’s restaurant in Devils Lake.

Devils Lake Fire Chief Jim Moe says crews got a call about smoke in the area around 3 a.m. Sunday after the restaurant on U.S. Highway 2 was closed for the night.

Moe tells KZZY-FM (http://bit.ly/1LvbrqQ ) that firefighters arrived to find the Hardee’s on fire, with the blaze mainly in the ceiling. He says crews tried to attack the flames from inside, but the ceiling already was coming down so they decided to fight the fire from outside the building.

The last person had left the building around 12:30 a.m. The North Dakota state fire marshal’s office has been called in to help investigate.

A damage estimate was not available.
