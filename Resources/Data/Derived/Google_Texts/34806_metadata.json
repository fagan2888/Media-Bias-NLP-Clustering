The 6-ton animal eyed them, swung his long trunk dismissively, turned and ambled away. Scary?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Marshak said. \u201cExhilarating.\u201d\n\nThat unflappability serves him well whether he\u2019s in the bush stalking wild animals or in a classroom facing only slightly less rambunctious high school students. Marshak balances a full-time job teaching social studies, economics and psychology at the Academy of Holy Angels in Richfield, where he also coaches the girls\u2019 varsity soccer team, with yearly expeditions to Africa, where he has earned recognition as a top wildlife photographer. He has been named one of \u201c22 Wildlife Photographers That Work Wonders\u201d by Nature TTL, a photography website.\n\nHis decision to become a teacher was no surprise. He was inspired by his father, a U.S. Air Force Academy instructor, who told him that \u201cwhatever the problem, education is the silver bullet.\u201d\n\nHis passion for wildlife photography, however, came about in a less conventional way \u2014 an electric moment with a lioness that sounds a lot like falling in love at first sight.\n\nIn 2012, as part of Holy Angels\u2019 soccer program, Marshak took eight players on a service trip to Tanzania. They capped the week with a safari in Mikumi National Park, during which their guide maneuvered their Land Rover within 15 feet of a pride of lions.\n\nDM1 - Last July in Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe\n\n\u201cI know this might sound corny,\u201d said Marshak, 36, \u201cbut I had this very intimate moment in which I locked eyes with this lioness and something in me just clicked. I felt I have to do something to make sure that these animals that are disappearing are going to be here after I\u2019m not. It was like a calling.\u201d\n\nWhile studying a photograph he\u2019d taken of the lioness, it occurred to him that telling stories through pictures might be the best way he could educate people about poaching and wildlife loss. But to do so, he knew that his photography skills would have to get a lot better. So he began booking safaris with experienced Africa wildlife photographers \u2014 commitments made easier, he acknowledges, by the fact that he is single and has no children.\n\nOn six safaris, across four countries and over four years, Marshak learned the essentials.\n\nRule No. 1: Don\u2019t agitate or disturb the animals. Wildlife photography \u201clooks romantic in the photographs, but you spend a lot of time doing nothing at all. I\u2019ve sat with my camera [a Nikon D810 with telephoto lenses] pressed against my face for five hours waiting for a lion to wake up and roll over,\u201d Marshak said.\n\nRule No. 2: Don\u2019t run. Prey run, and you don\u2019t want the animals mistaking you for prey.\n\nThere are safety precautions in place. Many African countries require wildlife photographers to get a government permit in order to leave their vehicles to get closer to wildlife than tourists can. In addition, most of the photographers travel with what is, in effect, an armed guard ready to shoot at a charging animal should such a drastic step be necessary.\n\nBut their definition of \u201cnecessary\u201d might not always mesh with the photograher\u2019s. When a lion ran full speed toward a group Marshak was with in Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe, the guard, reading the animal\u2019s body language, decided that it was a mock charge and simply raised his rifle overhead and yelled, \u201cStop, you naughty, cheeky beast!\u201d It worked, much to the photographers\u2019 relief.\n\nMarshak\u2019s close elephant encounter occurred with Marlon du Toit, a former wildlife tour guide who works with Wild Eye, a photography safari company. The two crawled for 20 minutes to a log near a watering hole where the bull was drinking, hoping it might walk past.\n\nAfter it came close enough to almost touch, Marshak can be heard exclaiming on a video of the event posted on his Facebook page, \u201cThank God I get to do this. That was awesome!\u201d\n\nHis adventures have produced photographs that conservation groups \u2014 including the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, an orphan-elephant rescue program, and the RUAHE Carnivore Project, which focuses on lions and other big cats \u2014 are using to help promote their causes.\n\nMarshak uses proceeds from the sale of his photographs, featured on a Facebook page that tops 75,000 followers, to recoup trip costs and then donates the rest to the two conservation groups.\n\nClass assignments\n\nPosters the groups have made from his images line the walls of Marshak\u2019s classroom.\n\n\u201cMr. Marshak is one of the best teachers I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Cynthia Mathenge, a junior in the fall who took Marshak\u2019s world history class as a freshman. Although her family emigrated here from Kenya, Mathenge said she had no idea how bad the elephant poaching problem was until Marshak wove it into a chapter on African imperialism.\n\n\u201cHe makes it interesting, and you can really tell how passionate he is about the subjects he teaches,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Shuxin Yang Xi\u2019an, a student from China, learned in Marshak\u2019s economics class that most ivory sold in her homeland comes from poaching, not from already dead animals as is widely believed, she joined Marshak in a social media project. Marshak posts anti-poaching messages on his Facebook page. Shuxin translated them into Chinese and then reposted them on social media platforms in China.\n\nA giraffe in Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, 2013.\n\n\u201cI tell my classes that it\u2019s simple supply and demand,\u201d Marshak said. \u201cChina is the No. 1 market for ivory. The U.S. is No. 2. If people stop buying ivory, the poaching will stop.\u201d\n\nWith school out for summer, Marshak has more time to spend honing his photography skills. To broaden his repertoire, this summer he plans to track black bears and wolves in northern Minnesota, experiment with underwater images of game fish and try to photograph wild black-footed ferrets, one of North America\u2019s most endangered mammals, in Badlands National Park in southwestern South Dakota.\n\nBut thoughts of Africa and plans to return are never far away. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s important work,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m privileged to be able to share something I truly love.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The massive bull elephant stopped less than 3 feet away from the log behind which Dave Marshak and another wildlife photographer crouched.", "title": "Richfield teacher's African safari pictures earn worldwide honors", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/richfield-teacher-s-african-safari-pictures-earn-worldwide-honors/313383461/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143656542494100.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143656542494100.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The massive bull elephant stopped less than 3 feet away from the log behind which Dave Marshak and another wildlife photographer crouched.", "title": "Richfield teacher's African safari pictures earn worldwide honors", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/richfield-teacher-s-african-safari-pictures-earn-worldwide-honors/313383461/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143656542494100.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143656542494100.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The massive bull elephant stopped less than 3 feet away from the log behind which Dave Marshak and another wildlife photographer crouched."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7ea\"", "article_summary": "Many African countries require wildlife photographers to get a government permit in order to leave their vehicles to get closer to wildlife than tourists can.\nWildlife photography \u201clooks romantic in the photographs, but you spend a lot of time doing nothing at all.\nThey capped the week with a safari in Mikumi National Park, during which their guide maneuvered their Land Rover within 15 feet of a pride of lions.\n\u201cExhilarating.\u201dThat unflappability serves him well whether he\u2019s in the bush stalking wild animals or in a classroom facing only slightly less rambunctious high school students.\nHe has been named one of \u201c22 Wildlife Photographers That Work Wonders\u201d by Nature TTL, a photography website."}
