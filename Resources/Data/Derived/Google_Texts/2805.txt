Hillary Clinton has twice broken with President Obama in recent days, distancing herself from his doomed trade package and criticizing his signature legislation, Obamacare.

Hillary said the Affordable Care Act falls short on several fronts, citing what she called the “family glitch,” which does not provide subsidies for some low-income families. She also criticized the high deductibles of the family plans, which can run as high as $15,000 a year.

In an interview with the Des Moines Register, Clinton also said the cost of medicines under the ACA are still prohibitively high, especially for “speciality drugs,” such as those that treat Hepatitis C and HIV.

“I will be prepared to set forth what I would do,” she told the newspaper.
