Here's Michael Kinsley who, unaccountably, is still considered smart in many places, losing the Internets for the next month.

He should speak to the nation and say, "I cannot in good conscience put you and this country through the traumatic consequences of a default. The Republicans apparently don't feel that way. They don't care whether veterans and seniors get the benefits they have earned. They don't care whether they destroy the full faith and credit of the United States, which has never before defaulted on its debts and made the dollar the world's safest currency. They don't care if their irresponsibility drives us into a new recession or worse. They don't even seem to care if the families of soldiers dying in defense of our freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq get a proper opportunity to grieve and honor them...The sad truth is that if you don't care about any of that, it gives you tremendous power over those who do. Perhaps unfortunately, I do care. And I believe the stakes are too high to let this become a testosterone contest. So I have sent a letter to Speaker Bohner, saying that I will agree to a year's postponement of the Affordable Care Act, if he will agree to a rise in the debt limit that is at least big enough to spare us another episode like this for a year.
