Two weeks ago, congressional Republicans met across the harbor to establish their priorities for the year, including crafting broad policy proposals ranging from an Obamacare replacement to tax and welfare reform. While Democrats laid out their 2016 agenda \u2014 including familiar items such as immigration reform, the minimum wage and promoting the Affordable Care Act \u2014 they also promised to contrast the GOP vision.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Xavier Becerra, chairman of the Democratic Caucus, acknowledged that being in the minority makes it difficult to push an agenda since Republicans control the floor schedule and what bills make it to a vote.\n\nHe said Democrats were going to \u201clook for those windows\u201d where they can take advantage of circumstances to push their priorities. In the past, those windows often have come when Republicans, facing a deadline and unable to rally enough GOP votes for must-pass legislation, turn to Democrats for help.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we want to make sure we do here is really come together, understand what our mission is, what our direction is, so when the window opens, we press,\u201d Becerra said.\n\nDespite having nearly 60 fewer seats in the lower chamber than Republicans, Democrats saw a string of victories last year. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi successfully kept the vast majority of the caucus together to support Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran over the summer, negotiated an increase in spending levels above sequestration in the fall and prevented measures to defund Planned Parenthood and other GOP priorities from being added to the omnibus spending bill in the winter.\n\nShe praised her caucus, saying that Democratic unity is \u201cnot about us keeping together \u2014 it\u2019s about our values. Our values draw us together and that we share and that we act upon.\"\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a member of Democratic leadership, pointed to the appropriations process as a possible opening for Democrats.\n\nBecause government funding levels and the debt ceiling are both off the docket thanks to last year\u2019s spending deal, Democrats won\u2019t have any cliffs to turn to as leverage.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have been emphatic that Congress should pass all 12 individual appropriations bills this year \u2014 something that hasn\u2019t happened in two decades. But with seemingly endless amendments in committee and on the floor, those bills would give Democrats plenty of opportunities for votes on their agenda. DeLauro cautioned that Democrats, who have also pushed for fixing the appropriations process, would have to walk the line between fighting for their priorities and not upending the process.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be up front with you: I believe the appropriations process gives us leverage,\u201d she told reporters here Wednesday. \u201cThey cannot pass appropriations bills without us \u2014 they haven\u2019t been able to do that. I believe that is leverage. We\u2019ll get our message out, but I also think we ought to be very strong and understanding that we have to break this logjam.\u201d\n\nRyan has said he sees this year as an opportunity to lay out conservative principles and give voters a clear choice headed into November. On the clear choice, at least, Republicans and Democrats are on the same page. Democrats eagerly await the policy proposals from the GOP, convinced they will provide specifics Democrats can attack headed into the election.\n\n\u201cSixty-two times repealing the Affordable Care Act is not sufficient,\u201d Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer said. \u201cThey need to show what they want to replace it with and let the American public know the consequences of their proposals.\u201d\n\nBecerra added: \u201cWe hope they do because we\u2019ve got something that\u2019s worked \u2014 18 million people, health insurance, no pre-existing conditions \u2014 so we\u2019ve got something that we can stand on. We\u2019d like to see what they have and that may give us an opportunity to press a bit more.\u201d\n\nNew York Rep. Steve Israel, who leads Democrats\u2019 messaging, said the year comes down to financial, paycheck and national security issues. He said House Democrats\u2019 goal will be to remind Americans where each party stands and bank on the public rallying behind Democratic messages.\n\nWhile presidential election years are notoriously slow in Congress \u2014 with members spending time in their districts, often focusing on their own elections and hesitant to push controversial votes that might hurt them politically \u2014 Democrats were adamant about not letting the entirety of 2016 slip away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead,\" said DeLauro. \"We\u2019re going to try to accomplish whatever we can for 2016.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "BALTIMORE \u2014 Democrats\u2019 election year agenda involves pushing their own priorities but also countering Republicans every step of the way.\nDemocrats\u2019 chances of passing any...", "title": "House Dems' 2016 Plan: Buck GOP | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/01/29/house_dems_2016_plan_buck_gop_129485.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/343194_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "BALTIMORE \u2014 Democrats\u2019 election year agenda involves pushing their own priorities but also countering Republicans every step of the way.\nDemocrats\u2019 chances of passing any...", "title": "House Dems' 2016 Plan: Buck GOP | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "House Dems' 2016 Plan: Buck GOP | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "Xavier Becerra,Rosa DeLauro,budget,Steve Israel,national security,tax reform,affordable care act,Election 2016,House Democrats,Nancy Pelosi,"}, "article_summary": "Despite having nearly 60 fewer seats in the lower chamber than Republicans, Democrats saw a string of victories last year.\n\u201cThey cannot pass appropriations bills without us \u2014 they haven\u2019t been able to do that.\nIn the past, those windows often have come when Republicans, facing a deadline and unable to rally enough GOP votes for must-pass legislation, turn to Democrats for help.\nSpeaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have been emphatic that Congress should pass all 12 individual appropriations bills this year \u2014 something that hasn\u2019t happened in two decades.\nDemocrats eagerly await the policy proposals from the GOP, convinced they will provide specifics Democrats can attack headed into the election."}
