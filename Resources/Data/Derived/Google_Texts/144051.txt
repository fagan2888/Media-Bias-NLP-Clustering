You’ve no doubt heard about the Three Wise Men who visited baby Jesus from the far East. But have you heard about the Three Wise Guys who traveled to visit the infant king from the East Coast?

On Saturday Night Live this week, host John Goodman was joined by surprise guests Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone. The three played ‘wise guys’ from Long Island and New Jersey on their way to give gifts to baby Jesus. Wearing sweatsuits and gold chains, the trio wisecracked about their trip and the baby’s family foibles.

“Do we even know his last name, this Jesus?” Goodman’s character asks.

“Christ, I don’t know!” De Niro’s character responds.

The three also discuss the gifts they are bringing for the babe. And while De Niro is bringing frankincense, Stallone opted for things that were a little more East Coast.

“Me, I got him a meatball parm and a Yankee onesie,” he told his fellow travelers.

Plus, De Niro’s character reveals the real reason Mary and Joseph couldn’t find any room in the inn.
