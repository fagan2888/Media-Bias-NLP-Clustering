As Middle-Market M&A Thrives, 15 Trends to Track in 2015

Specialized PE firms, corporate spinoffs and innovations in sourcing will shape dealmaking in the months to come

"Sector-focused funds will have a chance to differentiate themselves, not only by moving quickly and being decisive, but also by avoiding valuation traps in what will continue to be a frothy market in 2015," predicts Devin Mathews, 43, a co-founder of ParkerGale Capital, a nascent Chicago firm backing tech-enabled service providers.

Responding to our monthly survey in November, 59 percent of participants predicted that deal flow will be greater in 2015 than it was in 2014, and another 37 percent said that it will be at least as good.
