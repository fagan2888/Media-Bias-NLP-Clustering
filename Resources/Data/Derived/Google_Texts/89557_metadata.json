For all the Republican assumptions about his so-called \u201carrogance,\u201d Obama generally does a poor job when it comes to touting his own successes \u2013 prompting many of his supporters to often wish he \u201cspiked the football\u201d far more than he actually does.\n\nAnd with this in mind, it was notable when the president told reporters Friday moments after reaching the podium, \u201cAs I look back on this year, one thing I see is that so much of our steady, persistent work over the years is paying off for the American people in big, tangible ways.\u201d Obama started rattling off successes, and the list wasn\u2019t short: a sharp drop in unemployment, growing wages, expanded access to affordable medical care, progress on the climate crisis, breakthroughs on civil rights, diplomatic accomplishments, and on and on.\n\nWe talked last week about how very wrong the conventional wisdom was a year ago about what to expect from the White House in 2015. After the midterm elections, Obama was largely written off, and it was widely assumed, incorrectly, that he\u2019d have few if any accomplishments in his seventh year. The truth turned out to be the exact opposite.\n\nBut writing in RealClearPolitics yesterday, Bill Scher took an even broader view , providing useful context for the president\u2019s entire second term.\n\nPresidential scholars have a term to describe the typical experience of a chief executive who wins re-election to the White House. It\u2019s called the \u201csecond-term curse.\u201d There\u2019s evidence for it. Midway through their second terms, George W. Bush suffered Hurricane Katrina and the Iraqi quagmire, Bill Clinton was impeached, Ronald Reagan was staggered by the Iran-contra scandal, and Richard Nixon was run out of town. At the risk of jinxing our current president with one year left to go, he appears to have broken the curse.\n\nSure, there\u2019s still a year to go in this second term, but Scher\u2019s observation is sound.\n\nAt least in modern terms, it\u2019s tough to top Obama\u2019s first term when it comes to major successes: ending the Great Recession, passing health-care reform, overhauling Wall Street safeguards, rescuing the American auto industry, etc.\n\nBut the president\u2019s second term ranks among the more important of any modern two-termer, most notably because of historic accomplishments on foreign policy: an international nuclear agreement with Iran; overhauling a failed U.S. policy towards Cuba; a breakthrough global climate-change agreement, and so on. If his executive actions on immigration clear the courts, it will be another important piece of his second-term legacy.\n\nThose struggling with a \u201csecond-term curse\u201d tend to struggle; Obama\u2019s done the opposite.\n\nS cher makes the persuasive point that this president has avoided what many of his predecessors did not: a second-term scandal. Iran-contra, Watergate, and the Lewinsky affair were all second-term controversies. It\u2019s easy to lose track of all of George W. Bush\u2019s scandals , but many of the biggest \u2013 including the U.S. Attorney fiasco, my personal favorite \u2013 came after his re-election.\n\nObama, at least so far, hasn\u2019t had any meaningful scandals at all. Some manufactured controversies briefly caused stirs, but each were discredited, and ultimately exposed as little more than mirages for far-right conspiracy theorists. Center-right pundit David Brooks recently marveled at this \u201camazingly scandal-free administration.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, let\u2019s not overlook the fact that many of the president\u2019s second-term successes, including some key Supreme Court victories, are the culmination of fights that began in his first term, only to be wrapped up more recently. The Washington Post\u2019s Chris Cillizza added on Friday, \u201c[R]egardless of your politics, it\u2019s hard not to look at the last year and see a whole lot of checked boxes on Obama\u2019s long-term priority list. And the ability to check those boxes in the seventh year of his presidency proved, beyond any question, that Obama remained not only relevant but a force to be reckoned with, politically speaking.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Scholars have talked for years about presidents and the \"second-term curse.\" Obama appears to have avoided it quite nicely.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/so-much-the-second-term-curse", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Scholars have talked for years about presidents and the \"second-term curse.\" Obama appears to have avoided it quite nicely.", "title": "So much for the 'second-term curse'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/so-much-the-second-term-curse", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/obama.jpeg-03432.jpg?itok=7LZJFavr", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/so-much-the-second-term-curse", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/obama.jpeg-03432.jpg?itok=t1YcUa93", "height": 553}, "title": "So much for the 'second-term curse'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Scholars have talked for years about presidents and the \"second-term curse.\" Obama appears to have avoided it quite nicely."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-22T08:00:04-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "So much for the 'second-term curse'", "tags": "barack-obama,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "12/22/2015 08:00:04 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/so-much-the-second-term-curse"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Scholars have talked for years about presidents and the \"second-term curse.\" Obama appears to have avoided it quite nicely.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "Those struggling with a \u201csecond-term curse\u201d tend to struggle; Obama\u2019s done the opposite.\nIt\u2019s called the \u201csecond-term curse.\u201d There\u2019s evidence for it.\nWe talked last week about how very wrong the conventional wisdom was a year ago about what to expect from the White House in 2015.\nBut writing in RealClearPolitics yesterday, Bill Scher took an even broader view , providing useful context for the president\u2019s entire second term.\nS cher makes the persuasive point that this president has avoided what many of his predecessors did not: a second-term scandal."}
