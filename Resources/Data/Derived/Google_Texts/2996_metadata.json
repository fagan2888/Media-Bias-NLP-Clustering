Ryan answered, \u201cWe will have an answer. We will have a solution. We don\u2019t want people to fall victim because of this bad law, and we want to give people freedom from Obamacare.\u201d\n\nRyan listed a series of Obamacare lies, and Chris Wallace come back at him by asking if he was guaranteeing that people will be able to keep their subsidies. Ryan tried to dodge the question, \u201cWell, we will have a solution that address this law that gives people a bridge from Obamacare.\u201d\n\nWallace asked, will you demand an end to the mandates, the employer mandates, the individual mandates, and Ryan refused to answer again, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to get into all that, because we want to see what the ruling is. We want to give people freedom from Obamacare. We want to actually let them buy what they want to buy.\u201d\n\nPaul Ryan refused to answer the simple question of whether House Republicans are going to screw millions of people out of their health insurance. Ryan\u2019s answers were an admission that the Republican Party has no backup plan because Republicans can\u2019t agree on what to do if the Supreme Court strikes down the subsidies.\n\nIf the Supreme Court gives conservatives the ruling that they want Republicans are in deep trouble. Most of the states where people will lose their subsidies are Republican controlled red states.\n\nFox News doesn\u2019t want to see Republicans held accountable by voters if the subsidies are taken away, which is why Chris Wallace was pushing Ryan so hard to guarantee the subsidies.\n\nInstead of honestly answering the question, Paul Ryan ducked and dodged while doing his usual deer in headlights schtick. Reality is knocking on Paul Ryan\u2019s door, and the Wisconsin Republican is about to discover that life isn\u2019t an Ayn Rand fantasy novel.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Ryan fell apart on Fox News Sunday and when pressed refused to say that he would guarantee Obamacare subsidies for the people who might lose them.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Paul Ryan fell apart on Fox News Sunday and when pressed refused to say that he would guarantee Obamacare subsidies for the people who might lose them.", "title": "Paul Ryan Falls Apart On Fox News And Admits Republicans Have No Obamacare Alternative", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/06/14/paul-ryan-falls-fox-news-admits-republicans-obamacare-alternative.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ryan-fns.png", "updated_time": "2015-06-14T12:03:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Paul Ryan Falls Apart On Fox News And Admits Republicans Have No Obamacare Alternative,Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-06-14T12:03:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-14T12:03:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Instead of honestly answering the question, Paul Ryan ducked and dodged while doing his usual deer in headlights schtick.\nPaul Ryan fell apart on Fox News Sunday and when pressed refused to say that he would guarantee Obamacare subsidies for the people who might lose them.\nVideo:Chris Wallace asked if Republicans would come up with a way to keep the ACA subsidies going?\nReality is knocking on Paul Ryan\u2019s door, and the Wisconsin Republican is about to discover that life isn\u2019t an Ayn Rand fantasy novel.\nFox News doesn\u2019t want to see Republicans held accountable by voters if the subsidies are taken away, which is why Chris Wallace was pushing Ryan so hard to guarantee the subsidies."}
