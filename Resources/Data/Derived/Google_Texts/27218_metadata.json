If so, with one partner, multiple partners or same-sex partners?\u201d\n\nBe ready to answer those questions and more the next time you go to the doctor, whether it\u2019s the dermatologist or the cardiologist and no matter if the questions are unrelated to why you\u2019re seeking medical help. And you can thank the Obama health law.\n\n\u201cThis is nasty business,\u201d says New York cardiologist Dr. Adam Budzikowski. He called the sex questions \u201cinsensitive, stupid and very intrusive.\u201d He couldn\u2019t think of an occasion when a cardiologist would need such information \u2014 but he knows he\u2019ll be pushed to ask for it.\n\nThe president\u2019s \u201creforms\u201d aim to turn doctors into government agents, pressuring them financially to ask questions they consider inappropriate and unnecessary, and to violate their Hippocratic Oath to keep patients\u2019 records confidential.\n\nEmbarrassing though it may be, you confide things to a doctor you wouldn\u2019t tell anyone else. But this is entirely different.\n\nDoctors and hospitals who don\u2019t comply with the federal government\u2019s electronic-health-records requirements forgo incentive payments now; starting in 2015, they\u2019ll face financial penalties from Medicare and Medicaid. The Department of Health and Human Services has already paid out over $12.7 billion for these incentives.\n\nDr. Richard Amerling, a nephrologist and associate professor at Albert Einstein Medical College, explains that your medical record should be \u201ca story created by you and your doctor solely for your treatment and benefit.\u201d But the new requirements are turning it \u201cinto an interrogation, and the data will not be confidential.\u201d\n\nLack of confidentiality is what concerned the New York Civil Liberties Union in a 2012 report. Electronic medical records have enormous benefits, but with one click of a mouse, every piece of information in a patient\u2019s record, including the social history, is transmitted, disclosing too much.\n\nThe social-history questions also include whether you\u2019ve ever used drugs, including IV drugs. As the NYCLU cautioned, revealing a patient\u2019s past drug problem, even if it was a decade ago, risks stigma.\n\nOn the other end of the political spectrum is the Goldwater Institute, a free-market think tank. It argues that by requiring everyone to have health insurance and then imposing penalties on insurers, doctors and hospitals who don\u2019t use the one-click electronic system, the law is violating Americans\u2019 medical privacy.\n\nThe administration is ignoring these protests from privacy advocates. On Jan. 17, HHS announced patients who want to keep something out of their electronic record should pay cash. That\u2019s impractical for most people.\n\nThere\u2019s one question they can\u2019t ask: Thanks to the NRA, Section 2716 of the ObamaCare law bars the federal government from compelling doctors and hospitals to ask you if you own a firearm.\n\nBut that\u2019s the only question they can\u2019t be told to ask you.\n\nWhere are the women\u2019s rights groups that went to the barricades in the 1980s and 1990s to prevent the federal government from accessing a woman\u2019s health records? Hypocritically, they are silent now.\n\nPatients need to defend their own privacy by refusing to answer the intrusive social-history questions. If you need to confide something pertaining to your treatment, ask your doctor about keeping two sets of books so that your secret stays in the office. Doctors take the Hippocratic Oath seriously and won\u2019t be offended.\n\nAre such precautions paranoid? Hardly. WikiLeaker Bradley Manning showed how incompetent the government is at keeping its own secrets; incidents where various agencies accidentally disclose personal data like Social Security numbers are legion. And that\u2019s not to mention the ways in which commercial databases are prone to hacking and/or exploitation.\n\nBe careful about sharing your medical secrets with Uncle Sam.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is the author of \u201cBeating ObamaCare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/defundobamacare.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "\u2018Are you sexually active?
