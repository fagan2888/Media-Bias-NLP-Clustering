Some critics of the decision demand that employers be stopped from \u201cinterfering\u201d with a worker\u2019s insurance for certain services, such as contraception, even if the employer has profound religious objections to sponsoring such coverage. That in turn led to efforts to pass legislation that would block privately owned firms from using religious beliefs as a reason not to provide certain features of health insurance.\n\nPutting aside the legal technicalities, critics of the Hobby Lobby decision are right to be concerned about employers essentially controlling the health coverage of their workers. But most critics have the wrong solution.\n\nThe answer is not to start interfering with religious liberty, or engage in an arcane legal dispute about whether a private corporation is a \u201cperson,\u201d or to strengthen mandates on employer coverage. The correct strategy is to push forward with tax reforms and other steps that would lead to the disappearance of most employer-sponsored insurance. That\u2019s actually something both advocates of single-payer systems and conservatives should agree on.\n\nHealth economists of all stripes, as well as employers and benefits managers, recognize the notion that employers \u201cpay for\u201d health benefits is a myth. In truth, health insurance is just a part of an employee\u2019s total compensation, like cash income or a payroll deduction for a 401(k) retirement plan.\n\nEmployers are not charities, and total compensation is determined by local labor market conditions. But under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax rules, if the employee lets his or her boss make the crucial decisions over the part of their pay involving health insurance, it becomes free of tax.\n\nWhile tax-free employer-sponsored health insurance is familiar and popular, it has many problems, besides those at the center of the Hobby Lobby case. For one thing, the tax benefit is very regressive, with highly paid employees in the top brackets gaining most from the tax breaks and lower-paid workers receiving the least. That\u2019s exactly the opposite of good public policy aimed at helping people afford insurance.\n\nIn addition, the illusion that the employer pays has long been criticized as encouraging overuse of care and fanning cost escalation. That\u2019s a major reason why many employers have been decreasing the share of compensation paid in the form of \u201cemployer-paid\u201d insurance, so that employees have more skin in the game in controlling costs. Add to those concerns the worry that employment-based insurance often results in \u201cjob-lock\u201d\u2014 where a worker is reluctant to move to a better job or become self-employed\u201d\u2014 because moving could result in a change or loss of coverage.\n\nThese problems have spurred many proposed reforms aimed at modifying the employer\u2019s role in health insurance. The most recent is of course the Affordable Care Act (ACA). By establishing health exchanges\u2014a mechanism widely advocated for many years\u2014the ACA provides for some Americans an alternative platform to employment-based coverage for organizing health insurance. And by combining a cap on the tax-free status of employer-sponsored insurance with tax credits and subsidies for exchange plans, the ACA takes some steps down the road of reducing the tax bias associated with employer-controlled coverage.\n\nBut the design of the ACA falls short of what is needed. In an unwise effort to prop up the employment-based system and to contain the program\u2019s budget cost, the ACA\u2019s sponsors flinched from equalizing the tax breaks and subsidies for exchange plans and employer-sponsored health insurance. Yet that tax and subsidy disparity actually threatens to undermine employer-sponsored coverage in firms with many lower-paid workers. That\u2019s because the government subsidies available for many such families enrolling in exchange plans are much larger than the tax benefits of employer-sponsored insurance , encouraging employers and workers to drop employer-sponsored insurance in favor of extra cash earnings. Meanwhile the delay of the ACA\u2019s mandate on employers, triggered by concerns of hiring cutbacks, underscores the fact that trying to force employers to provide government-designed coverage is likely to fail.\n\nSome have argued that employer-sponsored insurance will continue to erode, in part because of the ACA. Former Obama health advisor Ezekiel Emanuel, MD, PhD, an architect of the ACA, predicts that by 2025, fewer than 20% of private-sector workers will have traditional employer-sponsored insurance. He could be right. Like conservative health economists, he has long criticized tax-exempt health insurance.\n\nBut rather than allow a transition to occur in a haphazard way, it would be wiser to have an open and thorough debate about the importance of moving away from employer-based insurance. Such a discussion hopefully would avoid a clumsy and likely damaging \u201cfix\u201d for the Hobby Lobby decision.\n\nBack in 2007, I proposed a strategy for an orderly transition, called the Health Exchange Plan. That plan envisioned state-chartered exchanges. There would also be a cap on the tax-free status of employer-sponsored coverage, in conjunction with a refundable tax credit for lower-income families. The cap would be indexed to grow more slowly than the expected increase in employer-sponsored insurance, thereby gradually reducing the tax bias in favor of such coverage.\n\nImportantly, the Health Exchange Plan still envisioned a continuing role for employers but not the role of picking coverage. The place of employment would continue to be where the transactions took place, with employers arranging payroll deductions for plans and helping employees sign up for plans. No doubt many larger firms would continue to offer wellness plans and take other steps to promote a healthy workforce. Some might continue to offer coverage, and would be allowed to do so, but most would transfer the control of coverage to their employees.\n\nThe result of the plan would be that the vast majority of employers would become facilitators of exchange-based coverage and no longer the sponsors or controllers of coverage. It seems to me that\u2019s a result both Hobby Lobby and its critics would applaud.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stuart Butler argues that with the creation of health exchanges and a reassessment of health subsidies, liberals, conservatives, and moderates should be able to agree that now is a time for a complete rethink of employer-sponsored insurance.", "title": "Bye, Bye Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance?", "og": {"site_name": "The Brookings Institution", "description": "Stuart Butler argues that with the creation of health exchanges and a reassessment of health subsidies, liberals, conservatives, and moderates should be able to agree that now is a time for a complete rethink of employer-sponsored insurance.", "title": "Bye, Bye Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance?", "url": "http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2014/08/15-bye-employer-sponsored-healthcare-butler", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/images/h/hk%20ho/hobbylobby_001/hobbylobby_001_16x9.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en", "type": "article", "determiner": "auto"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stuart Butler argues that with the creation of health exchanges and a reassessment of health subsidies, liberals, conservatives, and moderates should be able to agree that now is a time for a complete rethink of employer-sponsored insurance.", "creator": "stuartmbutler", "image": {"width": 560, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu//~/media/research/images/h/hk%20ho/hobbylobby_001/hobbylobby_001_16x9.jpg?w=560", "height": 315}, "title": "Bye, Bye Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance?", "site": {"identifier": "BrookingsInst", "id": 151106990}, "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 151106990}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 137459917707}, "ces": {"broadcontenttype": "Commentary", "programs": "Economic Studies", "topics": "Health ; Politics and Elections ; The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ; U.S. Politics", "topicsbroad": "Health ; Politics and Elections", "experts": "Stuart M.
