The cost wasn\u2019t a concern. I was flush with Simoleons - the game\u2019s goofy currency - from selling their novels and masterpieces in the mail.\n\nIt\u2019s that the oh-so-convenient appliance was among dozens of features the developers had left out of the latest edition of Electronic Arts\u2019 virtual dollhouse franchise. Despite crafting Oasis Springs\u2019 next Jackie Collins and Damien Hirst, my couple was resigned to scrubbing their dishes in a sink. It\u2019s at that point I knew \u201cSims 4\u201d had let me - and Alma and Jimbo - down.\n\nThe problem with \u201cThe Sims 4\u201d (Electronic Arts, for PC, $59.99) is that after nearly 15 years, \u201cSims\u201d fans are keenly aware of EA\u2019s business model of later releasing a dozen expansion packs. It\u2019s been a successful formula for the quirky life simulator series, one that now feels cruelly antiquated in the era of downloadable instant gratification.\n\nDespite that monumental deficiency, this \u201cSims\u201d is remarkably more intuitive at the start. The developers at Maxis have made it easier than ever to get a household up and running by introducing streamlined tools to craft dysfunctional virtual cartoons, as well as build their homes. The controls are totally fluid, whether you want to stretch a Sim\u2019s waistline or living room.\n\nUnlike their predecessors, this breed of smarter, more emotional Sims are able to multitask and strive for various aspirations, ranging from finding a soul mate to becoming a best-selling author. When big aspirations are achieved or more simple whims are fulfilled, Sims are now granted points for much-needed rewards, like the ability to skip meals or get promoted more quickly at work.\n\nIt would be awesome - if it all flawlessly worked. In my review copy of \u201cSims 4,\u201d I ran into many unforgiveable glitches, such as Sim babies resembling Freddy Kruger and Sims awkwardly swapping chairs while gathered around a table. In one instance, a bizarre Rip Van Winkle goof caused all of my neighbors to age faster when I wasn\u2019t controlling them. They later died.\n\nThat last bug was enough to drive me to scream Simlish - the game\u2019s goofy language - at my laptop. With such snags and so many features introduced in the previous three entries left out this time, there\u2019s an unshakeable feeling while playing \u201cThe Sims 4\u201d that even though the Sims have evolved, something still isn\u2019t quite right about them, and it ain\u2019t just their dishpan hands. Two stars.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://www.thesims.com\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Entertainment Writer Derrik J.
