(AP) - Liam Maddox, 21 months, is a lively, engaged toddler, checking out his dad\u2019s cellphone, throwing a ball for his family\u2019s Labrador retriever Desmond and trying to get his basketball in the mini-hoop.\n\nBut for his parents, Paul, 25, and Jaqueline \u201cJaci\u201d Maddox, 22, he\u2019s a walking miracle.\n\nTheir journey started when Liam came down with a cold in March 2014. Babies get colds all the time, don\u2019t they?\n\nBut for Liam, 5 months old at the time, it turned out to be much more serious.\n\n\u201cWe were in Alaska, and we figured it was just from flying,\u201d his mother said. \u201cBut he was stuffed up and not getting better. We were turned away from the hospital three times, and two days later, when they finally admitted him, the doctors said he was one of the sickest babies they\u2019d ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe diagnosis was dilated cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that keeps it from pumping as much blood as the body needs.\n\nBefore they knew it, they were at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, where Liam was on life support for two weeks. He needed a new heart, but he couldn\u2019t go on the transplant list until he was breathing on his own. Once on the list, it was an agonizing 15-day wait until a suitable heart was available.\n\nAt any given time in the United States, there are more than 120,000 people waiting for transplants according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. UNOS estimates someone is added to the waiting list every 10 minutes, and about 22 people die every day waiting for a transplant, so it was by no means a certainty that a pediatric-sized heart matched to Liam\u2019s blood type and markers would be available in time.\n\n\u201cThey said it was one of the quickest and smoothest heart transplants they had done, and the heart started right away,\u201d Jaci Maddox said. \u201cTwo-and-a-half weeks later, he was discharged. He\u2019s our first kid, and we didn\u2019t know what to do anyway, and then this.\u201d\n\nLiam required anti-rejection medications every two hours, so the young couple took shifts round the clock.\n\nFamily and friends in Durango, Denver and Wrangell, Alaska, Jaci Maddox\u2019s hometown, raised $30,000 to help with co-pays and living expenses, because they needed to stay near the hospital, so Paul Maddox couldn\u2019t come back to his job in Durango.\n\nThe Maddoxes were able to move back to Durango in mid-August, when his employer, American Electric Co., transferred him from Seattle back to his hometown.\n\n\u201cThey said he was well enough to be further away from the hospital,\u201d Jaci Maddox said, \u201cWe\u2019ve settled into a rhythm. Two medications twice daily (into a port in Liam\u2019s stomach), blood tests every two weeks. He\u2019s gotten so used to those he doesn\u2019t even cry anymore, which is sad to me.\u201d\n\nBut he really doesn\u2019t like the electrocardiograms, Paul Maddox said, in large part because they have to hold him down for the test.\n\nThe Maddoxes check Liam\u2019s heart rate every day and monitor how long he sleeps - sleeping too much can be a sign of heart failure - but sometimes he\u2019s just been running around a lot and is tired, Paul Maddox said.\n\n\u201cLiam just keeps running,\u201d he said, looking worn out from trying to keep up with him.\n\nA big challenge is keeping an active little boy away from germs, because the anti-rejection drugs work by suppressing Liam\u2019s immune system.\n\n\u201cEvery time he gets a cold, there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll start fighting his heart,\u201d she said. \u201cHis immune system will get stronger as he gets older, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to put him in day care.\u201d\n\nBecause an illness is so risky for Liam, his family and doctors monitor him carefully.\n\n\u201cIf his temperature is over 101 degrees, he goes to the hospital,\u201d Paul Maddox said. \u201cI had an electrician comment on my gray hairs today, and I told him why.\u201d\n\nA CHALLENGING FUTURE\n\n\u201cThousands of transplant recipients are living everyday lives,\u201d said Jim Inman, marketing director for the Children\u2019s Organ Transplant Association. The organization provides a fee-free nonprofit donation account for pediatric transplant patients that will follow them for their entire lives. \u201cBut there are follow-up visits, insurance premiums, prescription drugs, and those families who don\u2019t live near a transplant center will have travel costs.\u201d\n\nInman said many families have to raise from $50,000 to $100,000 each year to cover those costs. The odds are also high that at some point in his life, Liam will need a kidney transplant and another heart transplant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hearing talk about meds that only suppress the immune system around the heart,\u201d Jaci Maddox said, \u201cor growing your own heart, so maybe it will be easier as he grows up. But for now, he\u2019s good, we\u2019re good, and we\u2019re just thankful he\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nHEARTFELT CELEBRATION\n\nSunday\u2019s Heartfest 2015, the second year of raising funds for Liam\u2019s ongoing care could become an annual event to help pay for the expenses.\n\nThe event drew about 75 of the Maddoxes\u2019 family and friends who are happy to have the couple and Liam back in Durango.\n\nSome had traveled to Seattle several times and watched the small family face all of Liam\u2019s medical challenges.\n\n\u201cThey did wonderful. \u2026 They really became stronger as a couple because of it,\u201d said Darrell Maddox, Liam\u2019s grandfather.\n\nLiam\u2019s aunt, Ginny Hofferber, visited Liam in the hospital when he wasn\u2019t fully conscious and noted the contrast with his current health.\n\nAs the band played Sunday, Liam stood directly in front of the stage holding a small shaker and bouncing to the music.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much he\u2019s changed,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Durango Herald, http://www.durangoherald.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liam Maddox, 21 months, is a lively, engaged toddler, checking out his dad's cellphone, throwing a ball for his family's Labrador retriever Desmond and trying to get his basketball in the mini-hoop.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Liam Maddox, 21 months, is a lively, engaged toddler, checking out his dad\u2019s cellphone, throwing a ball for his family\u2019s Labrador retriever Desmond and trying to get his basketball in the mini-hoop.", "title": "Family deals with aftermath of baby heart transplant", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/5/family-deals-with-aftermath-of-baby-heart-transpla/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/5670e3479b0dfb27800f6a706700f584.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/5670e3479b0dfb27800f6a706700f584.jpg", "description": "Liam Maddox, 21 months, is a lively, engaged toddler, checking out his dad's cellphone, throwing a ball for his family's Labrador retriever Desmond and trying to get his basketball in the mini-hoop.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Family deals with aftermath of baby heart transplant"}, "Author": "ANN BUTLER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd91f\"", "article_summary": "The odds are also high that at some point in his life, Liam will need a kidney transplant and another heart transplant.\n\u201cThey said he was well enough to be further away from the hospital,\u201d Jaci Maddox said, \u201cWe\u2019ve settled into a rhythm.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hearing talk about meds that only suppress the immune system around the heart,\u201d Jaci Maddox said, \u201cor growing your own heart, so maybe it will be easier as he grows up.\n\u201cThey said it was one of the quickest and smoothest heart transplants they had done, and the heart started right away,\u201d Jaci Maddox said.\n\u201cIf his temperature is over 101 degrees, he goes to the hospital,\u201d Paul Maddox said."}
