They are ready to finance the work. In April, the Commission will consider this issue,\u201d Lavrenova said.\n\nAlexey Bogaevsky, the founder of the group sponsoring the statue, told Newsweek that his organization would press for the statue to be located in the Vorobyovy Hills neighborhood, where students mourning Lennon\u2019s assassination in 1980 were dispersed by police.\n\nThe news that a statue of a man dedicated to peace might be erected in Moscow comes in the same week that Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s administration warned the government of Denmark that, should that country decide to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s collective missile shield, its ships would become \u201clegitimate targets\u201d for Russian missiles.\n\nRelated: Putin Again Begs Oligarchs to Bring Their Money Home\n\nMeanwhile, Russia continues its occupation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula, which it invaded last year, as well as its support for rebels in Eastern Ukraine who are currently locked in a tenuous ceasefire with the Ukrainian military. To the West, leaders of the European Union are considering the formation of a Pan-European army specifically to counter additional Russian aggression.\n\nSo will one of the pre-eminent songwriters of his generation take his place beside Peter the Great, Alexander Pushkin, and Yuri Gagarin?\n\nAnd if so, will it contain any quotations from his work? Perhaps \u201cGive Peace a Chance\u201d? Or maybe, \u201cHappiness Is a Warm Gun?\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s not hard to imagine that former Beatles front man and dedicated peace activist John Lennon wouldn\u2019t note the irony of having a statue in his memory erected in Moscow.", "title": "Is John Lennon Back in Putin\u2019s New USSR?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/24/John-Lennon-Back-Putin-s-New-USSR", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/John_Lennon_Memorial_Wall.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/24/John-Lennon-Back-Putin-s-New-USSR", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/John_Lennon_Memorial_Wall.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "It\u2019s not hard to imagine that former Beatles front man and dedicated peace activist John Lennon wouldn\u2019t note the irony of having a statue in his memory erected in Moscow.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde054\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s not the USSR anymore, but John Lennon may be back in Russia soon.\n\u201cThe\u2026group submitted a proposal to install a monument to John Lennon.\nWere John Lennon still with us, it\u2019s hard to imagine that the former Beatle would miss the irony in the news, reported by Newsweek today, that a group of fans is pressing to have him memorialized in a statue in Moscow.\nRelated: With the F-35 Grounded, Putin\u2019s New Jet beats U.S.\nTo the West, leaders of the European Union are considering the formation of a Pan-European army specifically to counter additional Russian aggression."}
