It happened late Wednesday night in a northwest Oklahoma City Park off N.W. 117th.

Three of the people arrested are 16-year-old girls, who reportedly go to school with that 8th grader, and who the police report states lured their classmate and his two cousins into an apparent ambush.

The police report states that 8th grader got a call from the teenage girls to meet them at a busy 7-11, located at the corner of N.W. 122nd.

The report states when they got there, the girls asked them to meet them at Macklanburg Park just a few miles away on N.W. 117th.

It was while they were parked in the parking lot talking that the report states three men came from behind the Macklanburg Community Center building and attacked them.

"It was basically a sneak attack," said Msgt. Gary Knight with the Oklahoma City Police Department. "They did not see them coming, did not see them running up. They dragged one of the victims out, beat him with the butt of the shotgun, and then firing off a round, thankfully not hitting anybody."

The victims called 911, and within minutes, police were able to track the three suspects and the three girls to the intersection of Hefner and Western Avenues.

Turns out, the car they were in was stolen.

Right now, only one of the girls is in the juvenile detention center, while the other two are in the Oklahoma county jail, along with the three young men who were arrested.

All six are accused of robbery with a dangerous weapon.

The adults are identified as Johnny Lamont MicGinnis, 18, Renaldo Miller, 19, and Ramone LaTodd Lewis II, 18.

The five people in jail are being held on $22,000 bond.
