Guests on the show were political reporter Jo Mannies, statehouse reporter Marshall Griffin and University of Missouri-St. Louis Curators' Teaching Professor of Political Science David Robertson.\n\nMissouri Gov. Jay Nixon is proposing a budget that would set state government spending at roughly what it was seven years ago, before the nation\u2019s economy \u2013 and the state\u2019s budgets -- took a nose dive.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a huge difference from the frugal budgets the state has seen for years.\n\nThe biggest beneficiary of the increased spending, should the General Assembly agree, will be public education.\n\nNixon\u2019s proposed budget for the 2015 fiscal year, which begins July 1, calls for an overall spending increase of $428 million over the current fiscal year. That means general revenue would increase to $8.739 billion for fiscal year 2015 from $8.311 billion for the current fiscal year.\n\nThe governor\u2019s proposal also foregoes any tax cuts -- possibly a non-starter among Republican legislative leaders committed to trimming the state's taxes.\n\nThe governor outlined his proposals to legislators packed Tuesday night into the Missouri House for his annual State of the State address. His 56-minute speech was followed by the Republican response delivered by state House Speaker Tim Jones, R-Eureka.\n\nSaid Nixon: \"Tonight, as I have every year, I am proposing a balanced budget that holds the line on taxes \u2013 and continues to downsize government, cutting 81 more positions from state payrolls. By the end of this fiscal year, we will have reduced the state workforce by 4,600 full-time employees.\n\n\"But we didn\u2019t just make government smaller \u2013 we made it smarter,\" Nixon said. \"We reduced energy use, sold off surplus property and put more state services online. My budget continues to invest in technology to provide Missourians with the efficient, effective, accountable government they deserve. \"\n\nRetorted Jones: \"Our governor mistakenly believes that more, bigger government is the answer, that his administration can decide how to better use your tax dollars, and that investments should be made in government programs rather than in the industrious people of this state.\n\n\n\n\"What our governor should understand is that we already have too many tax-and-overspend, out-of-touch, career politicians in our nation\u2019s capital. We don\u2019t need one here standing in the way of hard-working Missouri families and businesses who want nothing more than the opportunity to grow and succeed,\" Jones added.\n\nOutside groups also weighed in.\n\nPatrick Werner, state director of the conservative Americans for Prosperity, criticized the governor's approach: \"Once again, Governor Nixon is asking for taxpayers to cough up even more, while many other states are passing meaningful tax relief and making their states more economically competitive.\"\n\nBut Charles E. Smith, president of the Missouri National Education Association, was full of praise, saying Nixon \"reaffirmed Missouri's commitment to strong public schools and preparing our students for for the careers of the 21st Century.\"\n\nNixon highlights education, renews call for expanding Medicaid\n\n\n\nNixon\u2019s budget for the 2015 fiscal year, which begins July 1, is predicting that state coffers will be flush enough to increase spending for public education \u2013 at all levels \u2013 by $490 million. He's proposing some trims in other areas to make it happen.\n\nThe largest chunk of that added money would go for kindergarten through high school. Among other things, Nixon proposes to increase state spending on the foundation formula \u2013 the state\u2019s largest source of aid to local schools \u2013 by $278 million.\n\nState budget chief Linda Luebbering acknowledged to reporters that the hike is only half of the amount needed to fund the program fully; it has been underfunded for years. If the state\u2019s good economic times continue, the foundation formula should be funded fully by fiscal year 2016, she said.\n\nNixon is proposing roughly an additional $100 million for various higher education programs, but he coupled that with a call for state universities and colleges to keep tuition flat for the coming school year. His additional spending includes $22 million to help students who study science, technology, engineering and medicine -- dubbed the STEM subjects.\n\nNixon framed his focus on education as a choice between helping children or cutting taxes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve signed four tax cuts as your governor \u2013 specific, targeted tax cuts that have helped our businesses expand and grow,\u201d the governor said. \u201cFor example, Missouri employers will save $70 million this year alone because we cut the corporate franchise tax.\n\nHe then declared, \u201cBut here\u2019s what I won\u2019t do: I will not support anything that takes money out of our classrooms\u2026.The people of Missouri said they expect their elected leaders to support public schools, because they know that education is the best economic development tool there is.\u201d\n\nJones told reporters afterward that Nixon was misrepresenting the debate and cited the governor\u2019s previous cuts in education funding for transportation.\n\nJones and House Budget chairman Rick Stream, R-Kirkwood (and a former school board member), faulted the governor for failing to address the problems caused by unaccredited school districts, including the expensive transfer programs now underway.\n\nNixon's proposed budget includes $5 million sought by the Normandy school district to pay the costs of students who have opted to transfer to other districts in St. Louis and St. Charles counties.\n\nThe governor also is calling for more spending on mental health and job creation, public safety and \u201cexpanding and reforming Medicaid.\u201d\n\nNixon told Republican legislators that their opposition to expanding Medicaid was simply sending Missourians' federal tax dollars to other states that are expanding, while hurting the state's businesses and low-income residents.\n\nIn fact, Luebbering said that the state would save $77 million in current health care spending should the General Assembly expand Medicaid to cover roughly 300,000 more Missourians. That\u2019s because some people covered by state spending could be shifted to the federal Medicaid rolls.\n\nSaid the governor in his address: \"Since New Year\u2019s Day, Missouri taxpayers have spent $115 million and counting \u2013 $5.47 million a day \u2013 to improve and reform health care in other states, like Arkansas and Arizona, New Jersey and Iowa, Michigan and North Dakota. This adds up to $2 billion, or $500 for every Missouri taxpayer, every year. \"\n\nIn a nod to the opposition by Republicans and some Missourians, the governor added, \"We all know there are problems with Obamacare, and Washington\u2019s implementation of it has been abysmal. But rejecting Medicaid won\u2019t fix any of those things. It won\u2019t keep Missourians from having to pay federal taxes, or exempt our businesses from new requirements under the law.\n\n\"Instead, by standing still, we\u2019re making the things we don\u2019t like about Obamacare even worse, forcing Missourians to bear all the costs of this law \u2013 and reap none of the benefits. \"\n\nStream flatly told reporters afterward that Medicaid expansion wasn't going to happen.\n\nMedicaid isn't the only disagreement that Republican legislative leaders have with Nixon.\n\nNixon's budget picture rosier than legislative leaders'\n\nThe governor\u2019s budget is premised on stronger general-revenue growth than the GOP-controlled state House and Senate are predicting.\n\nAs a result, Nixon\u2019s proposal assumes the state would have an additional $140 million in income than what legislative leaders are expecting, Luebbering said. That means that the alternative budget plan assembled by the General Assembly may call for significantly less spending than Nixon.\n\nStream contended that the difference is actually about $300 million, and he warned that House and Senate budget leaders won't budge. \"We are not going to spend more than we think is going to come in,\" Stream said.\n\nNixon's focus on increased education spending could put some Republican legislators in a bind because public education is just as popular in rural and out-state Missouri \u2013 which are GOP strongholds \u2013 as it is in urban and suburban parts of the state.\n\nNixon and his budget chief tie the state\u2019s improved financial status to the state\u2019s employment growth \u2013 with an added 40,000 more jobs just in the past year.\n\nMissouri is in the nation\u2019s Top 10 in private-sector job growth, the governor said. Personal income for all Missouri workers also is up by about 4 percent over the past year, his budget chief said.\n\nJones painted a different economic picture, asserting that Missouri is lagging behind many of its neighboring states. \"We want to import jobs and opportunity for all into our state while our governor wants to import D.C.-style taxation, D.C-based budgeting, and D.C.-inspired overspending,\" Jones said. \"We will not allow this to happen on our watch.\"\n\nAlthough the governor's address kept with tradition by focusing primarily on the budget, Nixon also touched on other issues, He renewed his longstanding call for the General Assembly to restore some form of campaign donation limits, along with other ethics reforms.\n\nNixon also beseeched legislators to pass a measure -- which won Senate approval last year -- that would bar businesses from firing employees on the basis of their sexual orientation. \"No Missourian should be fired because of who they are or who they love,\" the governor said.\n\n\n\nInform our coverage: Click here to share through our Public Insight Network your reaction to Gov.
