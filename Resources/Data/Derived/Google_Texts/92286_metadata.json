A giant robotic giraffe is currently top dog on the White House lawn.\n\nThe giraffe, which moves, talks and lights up, is just one exhibit at the White House\u2019s first-ever Maker Fair, an event where innovators can show off the latest in technology and design. The fair saw the introduction of everything from a 3D-printed violin to a biodiesel car.\n\nBut the biggest hit was Russell, the robot giraffe.\n\nThe leader of the free world chatted with a robotic giraffe today http://t.co/G6oXogWuBk pic.twitter.com/xvZILuEiT9 \u2014 Marina Koren (@marinakoren) June 18, 2014\n\n\u201cI like those ears,\u201d President Obama said of the 17-foot-tall robot, which sports lava lamp ears and a head-mounted \u201cgiraffe cam.\u201d\n\nThe White House hopes inventions like Russell can inspire a new generation of creators. \u201cMaking can inspire and empower more young people to excel in design and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) and to pursue careers making things in manufacturing,\u201d the White House said in a statement announcing the fair in February.\n\nYep. There\u2019s a robotic giraffe named Russell on the South Lawn at the White House Maker Faire. #NationOfMakers https://t.co/ojhXUFW4tm \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 18, 2014\n\nDon\u2019t expect the giraffe to join the presidential motorcade any time soon, though. When offered a ride on the robot, Obama politely declined. \u201cThe Secret Service would not let us do that,\u201d the president told reporters.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Move over, Bo.
