That has Democrats cheering.\n\nWith Trump, a Republican, enmeshed in controversy over his inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants, Hillary Clinton and other Democrats are eager to make Trump the face of the GOP. As the Washington Post writes, the Republican field has no clear front-runner, and for Democrats, Trump is a kind of divine intervention.\n\n\u201cI am a person of faith \u2014 and the Donald\u2019s entry into this race can only be attributed to the fact that the good Lord is a Democrat with a sense of humor,\u201d said Paul Begala, a veteran Democratic strategist and adviser to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC boosting Clinton\u2019s candidacy.\n\nClinton herself has been calling out Trump\u2019s comments about Mexicans on the campaign trail.\n\nObamacare sales job: President Barack Obama is intent on finally winning over Americans on his signature health-care law, after the Supreme Court upheld it. As National Journal writes, Obamacare is still underwater with the general public, and Obama and his top officials seem acutely aware of that. It is a problem they are turning their attention to now that the law isn\u2019t threatened by a Supreme Court case. \u201cMy hope is that on a bipartisan basis, we can now focus on what we have learned, what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not working,\u201d Obama said Wednesday in Nashville. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of people who aren\u2019t insured,\u201d he said, in apparent reference to Medicaid expansion.\n\nTrading with Cuba: The Obama administration\u2019s move to normalize relations with Cuba has fueled excitement in the business world at the prospect of a new market. U.S. firms, writes Politico, already export hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods annually to Cuba, and are looking for opportunities to expand. For years, American farmers have been selling wheat, meat, corn and other agricultural commodities to Cuba under a special series of humanitarian exemptions. A delegation of farm leaders toured Cuba last week, Politico said.\n\nIran backlash: Fox News writes the Obama administration\u2019s decision to send the Iran nuclear talks into overtime is triggering a backlash on Capitol Hill. Congressional Republicans are warning Tehran is exploiting the situation and moving the goal posts. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, called on the administration to \u201cpress pause\u201d on the discussions after negotiators said they would miss the June 30 deadline and extend talks another week. As Fox writes, McConnell and other GOP lawmakers worry the administration\u2019s negotiating position is weakening and giving more ground to the Iranians.\n\nWhere Obama, Bush agree: Here\u2019s one issue President Obama and Jeb Bush agree on: don\u2019t mix peas into guacamole. As Time writes, both Obama and Republican White House hopeful Bush weighed in on a controversy that arose out of a New York Times article encouraging readers to add peas to their guacamole. Staunch guacamole fans bristled at the thought of adding peas to their dip.
