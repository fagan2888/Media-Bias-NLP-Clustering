According to a new report released by the Health and Human Services Department on Thursday, Americans across the country have received a total of $1.9 billion dollars in rebates since this provision first took effect in 2011.\n\nObamacare\u2019s medical loss ratio provision \u2014 which is also frequently referred to as the \u201c80/20 rule\u201d \u2014 requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of every American\u2019s premium costs on their medical care, rather than on the company\u2019s own profits or administrative overhead. If insurance companies don\u2019t hit the right balance, they have to issue a refund check to their customers to make up for it.\n\nAccording to HHS\u2019s calculations, 6.8 million Americans will save $330 million in refunds this year because of the 80/20 rule. Insurance companies are required to provide those reimbursements by no later than the beginning of August. Not everyone will actually receive a physical check in the mail; insurers are allowed to apply the reimbursements to future premiums, so the savings could show up that way.\n\nIn a press release announcing the new data, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said that the health reform law is giving Americans a \u201cbetter value for their premium dollars.\u201d The whole point of the 80/20 rule is to encourage insurance companies to operate more efficiently and cut down on their overhead \u2014 and it\u2019s slowly working. The portion of premium dollars allocated to insurers\u2019 profits and administrative costs dropped from 15.3 percent in 2011 to 11.7 percent in 2013.\n\nHHS estimates that if insurers weren\u2019t making those type of changes, Americans would have likely paid about $3.8 billion in additional premiums in 2013. Altogether, since the medical loss ratio took effect three years ago, the administration calculates that it\u2019s averted $9 billion dollars worth of unnecessarily high insurance premiums.\n\nThe 80/20 rule isn\u2019t the only Obamacare provision that seeks to keep premium costs affordable. The health law also extends federal subsidies to help Americans purchase plans on the individual market in the new state-level insurance exchanges, something that allows millions of people to buy health care for less than $100 each month. However, under a lawsuit against the health law that could make its way up to the Supreme Court, those subsidies could be put into jeopardy in the majority of states in the country. If that happens, insurance premiums could increase by about 75 percent.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Thanks to a little-known provision in the health reform law, millions of American families will be getting an $80 rebate this year.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Thanks to a little-known provision in the health reform law, millions of American families will be getting an $80 rebate this year.", "title": "Obamacare Has Helped Americans Save Nearly $2 Billion On Their Insurance Premiums", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/07/24/3463602/obamacare-premium-savings/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/money-hand.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thanks to a little-known provision in the health reform law, millions of American families will be getting an $80 rebate this year.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/money-hand-321x214.jpg", "title": "Obamacare Has Helped Americans Save Nearly $2 Billion On Their Insurance Premiums", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/money-hand.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/money-hand.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-24T09:00:21+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc365\"", "article_summary": "Health Obamacare Has Helped Americans Save Nearly $2 Billion On Their Insurance Premiums CREDIT: ShutterstockMillions of Americans can expect to get a refund from their insurance companies this year, at an average of about $80 dollars per family, thanks to a little-known Obamacare provision that\u2019s helping people save money on their premiums.\nIf insurance companies don\u2019t hit the right balance, they have to issue a refund check to their customers to make up for it.\nIf that happens, insurance premiums could increase by about 75 percent.\nInsurance companies are required to provide those reimbursements by no later than the beginning of August.\nAltogether, since the medical loss ratio took effect three years ago, the administration calculates that it\u2019s averted $9 billion dollars worth of unnecessarily high insurance premiums."}
