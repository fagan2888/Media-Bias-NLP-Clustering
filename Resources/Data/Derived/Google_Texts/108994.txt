A six-acre industrial property in Denver’s gritty Elyria-Swansea neighborhood will become a mixed-use development with affordable housing under a plan by the Urban Land Conservancy and Denver agencies.

ULC bought the site at East 48th Avenue and Race Street for $5.5 million. The property is on the FasTracks North Metro Line.

The acquisition follows a recent city-led task force that outlined the need for affordable housing and identified development sites in the Globeville and Elyria-Swansea neighborhoods.

The nonprofit ULC develops and invests in projects that provide housing, office space, community centers and schools.

Development of the site will be done in collaboration with several agencies including the Denver Office of Economic Development, the North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative, the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority and the Denver Urban Renewal Authority.

“This future transit oriented community will require significant support for successful development to take place, and ULC is thrilled to be leading this substantial venture,” ULC president and CEO Aaron Miripol said.

Earlier this year, the Denver City Council approved a $1.5 million Office of Economic Development loan to ULC to be used for the land acquisition.
