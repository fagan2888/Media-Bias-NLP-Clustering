I think you can be diplomatic about it, but you also have to be real.\n\n\"You have to tell it like it is.\"\n\nConnick said being a judge on the show won't be anything new. His whole life has been interacting with others, whether in a teaching situation, a clinic, a mentorship or a master class, he said.\n\n\"As I got older, I started to be on the giving end of those things,\" said the 46-year-old who was a child prodigy in New Orleans, played piano in French Quarter clubs and released his first album at 19.\n\n\"I would spend a lot of time talking to kids in high school, college, even professional people about how they can improve. So I feel very comfortable in that environment.\"\n\nAs an \"American Idol\" mentor, he helped guide the contestants competing for the title and a major record deal. As a judge, he won't have the same \"intense interaction\" but will be sharing his views with others and helping their development along.\n\n\"Plus, I love television. I love being in front of an audience. I love talking about music. So there are a lot of things about being on 'American Idol' that I really, really like. So it feels good so far.\"\n\nThe crooner, who has earned one gold, four platinum and three multi-platinum albums, three Grammy awards, two Primetime Emmys, two Tony nominations and has sold more than 28 million albums, said he likes working with singer-actress-producer Lopez and country music star Urban and appreciates their differences.\n\n\"They're extremely bright people, highly successful, have very strong work ethics and very strong convictions about what they do, and they're the best in the business at their respective jobs,\" he said. \"We're completely different. We're different brains, different personalities, different philosophies.\"\n\nThe 13th season of \"Idol\" opens with a two-night premiere of auditions in Austin, Texas, and Boston, Mass., where the talent was \"good, bad and outrageous.\" During the actual competition, the judges critique every performance but the viewing public determines who will advance to become a finalist and who will go home. Telephone, text message and online voting begin immediately after each live-performance show, and the results are announced during the following night's live broadcast.\n\nThe first day on the job showed Connick the show was a good fit.\n\n\"I know what the show is. So I was really familiar with what it would be like to be a judge and, from the very first contestant that we saw in Boston, it just felt very natural. You go sit in that chair, you're with two people that you respect very much and like very much, and people start coming in and singing and it all gets turned on. You zone in on them and you critique that performance, and it's exciting stuff.\"\n\nThe addition this season of guitar-playing contestants has had some mixed results. Not everyone \"kills it\" as a guitar player, he admits.\n\n\"If people pick up a guitar and they're not a good player, it shows immediately that they should put the guitar down,\" he said. \"There is this weird 'ignorance is bliss' kind of attitude. These people are coming up there playing guitar in front of Keith Urban. That takes some guts, and maybe they don't realize what they are doing. Maybe their family and friends have told them that they are really good and they should go on 'American Idol,' but eventually they are going to have a realization that 'Uh-oh, maybe I'm not as good as I thought.' Then there may be people that sound great with the guitar, and that's the kind of artist they are.\"\n\nSong genre doesn't matter to him, but singers connecting with the lyrics is \"huge,\" he said.\n\n\"Unless they're singing a tune that's really a groove-based tune like a lot of those disco tunes I grew up listening to, it's really not about the lyrics. ... So sometimes they sing tunes that the lyrics really aren't that important and I really don't care, but if they're going to sing a lyric, then you have to really start picking it apart.\"\n\nAlso, knowing how to take constructive criticism \u0097 not personal commentary \u0097 is an important asset. How he takes criticism depends on the source, he said.\n\n\"As a kid, when my teachers would critique me \u0097 and it happened every day for years and years and years \u0097 you develop a tolerance for it, especially when it's right and when it's sincere and when it helps you. Nowadays if I do something wrong and somebody that I know and love says 'Hey man, that was a mistake,' I'm at the point in my life where I can admit it almost immediately.\n\n\"The criticism from the noise out there because somebody doesn't like the way I look or the way I sing or the way I talk, it just doesn't even register with me. ... I just don't hear any of the noise.\"\n\n\u2018AMERICAN IDOL XIII\u2019\n\nWhen: 7-9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday\n\nWhere: Fox, channel 23, cable 5", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "Harry Connick Jr. is bringing mellow back to \"American Idol XIII\" after last season's alleged on- and off-set cat fights between judges Nicki Minaj and Mariah Carey.", "title": "Harry Connick Jr. talks 'American Idol,' being a new judge", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/tv/harry-connick-jr-talks-american-idol-being-a-new-judge/article_f0cc2846-25e2-5151-9a0e-9a1ba29d920a.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/6b/86b692a6-e8eb-57f6-a087-58a89af1eb67/52d24c6ba0932.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C325", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "idol,season,american,fox,connick,harry,judge,really,cable,channel,tv,scene", "news_keywords": "idol,season,american,fox,connick,harry,judge,really,cable,channel,tv,scene", "description": "Harry Connick Jr. is bringing mellow back to \"American Idol XIII\" after last season's alleged on- and off-set cat fights between judges Nicki Minaj and Mariah Carey."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddde4\"", "article_summary": "So there are a lot of things about being on 'American Idol' that I really, really like.\nHarry Connick Jr. is bringing mellow back to \"American Idol XIII\" after last season's alleged on- and off-set cat fights between judges Nicki Minaj and Mariah Carey.\nAs an \"American Idol\" mentor, he helped guide the contestants competing for the title and a major record deal.\n\u2018AMERICAN IDOL XIII\u2019When: 7-9 p.m. Wednesday and ThursdayWhere: Fox, channel 23, cable 5\nRemember me on this computer Login Screen Name or Email Now I remember!"}
