After the House narrowly passed the $1 trillion spending bill Thursday night, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh lambasted Speaker of the House John Boehner for going along with President Barack Obama and funding amnesty and Obamacare.

“The Republican speaker of the House has throw in with Obama!” Limbaugh opened his program Friday, adding that he doesn’t care too much about the apparent fracture within the Democratic party. “Yep, we’re supposed to look the other way while our Speaker of the House gets in bed with Obama and advances the Obama agenda. Takes care of it: amnesty, Obamacare, fully funded, done deal. The election must not have mattered.”
