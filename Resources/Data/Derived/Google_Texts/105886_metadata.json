Scientists suggest more companies adopt a flexible policy for the sake of their employees' sleep and health.\n\nHow about instead of hacking our way to a better night\u2019s sleep we just start the work day later? That\u2019s the idea researchers are proposing in their new study for the journal Sleep.\n\nResearchers analyzed the sleep and work habits of 124,517 American adults who participated in the American Time Use Surveys from 2003 to 2011. Compared to normal sleepers, short sleepers (six hours or less) worked 1.55 more hours on weekdays and 1.86 more hours on weekends or holidays, while also starting work earlier in the morning and stopping work later at night. Short sleepers also traveled more and earlier in the morning and later in the evening than normal sleepers. In other words, a lot of short sleepers are also commuters.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is Mathias Basner, lead author and assistant professor of sleep and chronobiology in psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine, and his team also found with every hour that work or educational training starts later in the morning, sleep time increases by approximately 20 minutes. So, starting work before or at 6 a.m. averaged out to six hours of sleep, while starting work between 9 and 10 a.m. averaged out to over seven hours of sleep. This all boils down to the fact Americans are still sacrificing sleep for their job.\n\n\u201cThe evidence that time spent working was the most prominent sleep thief was overwhelming,\u201d Basner said in a press release.\n\nStart time hasn\u2019t been the only aspect of the average work day that\u2019s been called into question. Earlier this year, experts listed the health impacts a four (as opposed to five) work week has, including fewer illnesses, less time in the car and carbon emissions (commuting is ruining us anyway), plus a boost in productivity. Carlos Slim, the world\u2019s richest man, went so far as to say a three day work week is what Americans need for a better life.\n\nIt\u2019s like we said, sleep is so hot right now. There\u2019s never been a greater emphasis on the importance of getting a quality night\u2019s sleep \u2014 about seven to nine hours per night, as recommend by the American Academy of Sleep. And maybe it\u2019s time we share the responsibility. Maybe it\u2019s not up to us to set and keep a sleep schedule, turn our phones off before 9 p.m., and sleep in certain positions. We absolutely should consider these tips for better sleep, of course, but it might be time for society as a whole to consider the ways they can break the mold and get some sleep, too.\n\nSource: Basner M, Spaeth A, Dinges D.
