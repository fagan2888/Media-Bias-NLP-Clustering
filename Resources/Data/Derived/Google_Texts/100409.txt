Brother Jeff’s Cultural Center in Denver’s Five Points neighborhood was alive with children running from table to table, decorating cookies and making crafts as traditional drums played Sunday evening.

On the third day of Kwanzaa, members of the Denver community gathered at various celebrations to honor African-American culture with family, friends and neighbors.

Katrina Sims organized the Five Points event and took a step back to watch the kids and their families learn about their African-American roots and traditions with the hope that the children would keep their history alive, she said.

“Growing our communities in a positive way is the answer to, ‘I can’t breathe,’ ” Sims said. “This is the answer to, ‘Black lives matter.’ “

At an intimate gathering at the Black American West Museum, the museum board chairwoman, Daphne Rice-Allen, told Kwanzaa participants the history of the holiday.

Beginning in the 1960s, Kwanzaa was created to pull the black community together amid race riots. The celebration lasts seven days and focuses on seven principles: unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith.

“It is non-heroic, nonreligious. It does not replace anything,” Rice-Allen said. “You can still celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah. It is simply to enhance the concept of stepping back and gathering your community and making sure you’re leaving everything better than you found it.”

Sunday’s celebration consisted of lighting the traditional kinara, a candelabra, with red, black and green Kwanzaa colored candles.

Back at Brother Jeff’s Cultural Center, 14-year-old Aliyah Fard iced cookies in Kwanzaa colors with her friends.

Fard said she grew up celebrating the holiday.

“I like the sense of community about Kwanzaa and getting to meet other people when we come together,” she said.
