But he wants me to take a full-time position so we can build more wealth. The only debt we have is our house, and we\u2019ve already saved and invested a lot of money. What\u2019s your suggestion for this situation?\n\nFirst and foremost, you two have a responsibility to take care of each other and your own household. It sounds as though you\u2019re doing that pretty well. So if he wants you to take a full-time job only to build more wealth, I think that\u2019s a bad idea.\n\nWealth is for quality of life, and quality of life includes giving. It also includes a safe and stable future. But if you have to surrender the joy in life to do that \u2014 to build extra wealth or build at a different pace \u2014 well, to me that\u2019s just wrong.\n\nContentment has nothing to do with how many hours you work or how many zeroes are in your bank account. Contentment has to do with your state of being. It\u2019s connected to your sense of gratitude, happiness and your priorities. The idea that contentment is on the same spectrum as ambition? No, it\u2019s not.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should take on a job or a schedule you hate just to pay off your house a couple of years earlier. I wouldn\u2019t do that, and I don\u2019t recommend you do it either. People should do something with their lives they find enjoyable and they\u2019re called to do.\n\nNow if your kids are going hungry and your bills aren\u2019t getting paid, then you do whatever it takes. But in this case, you\u2019re happy and you guys are in a great place. I\u2019m sure your husband is a great guy, but I think he\u2019s wrong on this one.\n\nMy credit union offers free accidental death and dismemberment insurance. Should I take it?\n\nThat\u2019s fine if it\u2019s free. However, I wouldn\u2019t rely on it as an integral part of my overall financial plan.\n\nIn most cases, accidental death and dismemberment policies are just a gimmick. You\u2019re not double dead if you die by accident, and your spouse or family doesn\u2019t need the money more if you die by accident rather than a heart attack. They need the same coverage and the same protection regardless.\n\nWhen it comes to life insurance, I recommend a good level term policy that\u2019s 10 to 12 times your annual income. That means if you make $50,000 a year, you need $500,000 to $600,000 in coverage.\n\nStill, if it\u2019s really free I have no problem with the policy. Just make sure you\u2019re not paying some other big fee to join a club so you can get \u201cfree\u201d stuff. When that happens, it\u2019s not really free after all.\n\nDave Ramsey is a personal money management expert, author and national radio personality.
