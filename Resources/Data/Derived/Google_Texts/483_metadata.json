Why yes, it can:\n\nDonald Trump responded Thursday to former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney ripping his campaign in a news conference by saying that Romney had been \u201cbegging\u201d for his endorsement in the 2012 election. Earlier in the day, Romney spoke in Utah of how disastrous Trump would be as commander-in-chief and criticized his approach to foreign policy. Trump responded to Romney at a campaign rally in Portland, Maine, calling the speech \u201cirrelevant\u201d and referencing his endorsement of the former Massachusetts governor in the last election. \u201cI could\u2019ve said, \u2018Mitt drop to your knees\u2019 and he would\u2019ve dropped to his knees,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe was begging. He was begging me.\u201d\n\nC\u2019mon, Mitt, say something about Donald\u2019s hands!\n\n* Now that Trump has put himself in position to win the Republican nomination, the big-money people are ready to step up:\n\nWall Street is getting ready to go nuclear on Donald Trump. Terrified that the reality TV star could run away with the Republican nomination and bring his brand of anti-immigrant, protectionist populism to the White House, some top financiers are writing big checks to fund an effort to deny Trump a majority of delegates to the GOP convention. The effort is centered on the recently formed Our Principles PAC, the latest big-money group airing anti-Trump ads, which is run by GOP strategist Katie Packer, deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney in 2012. The group, initially funded by $3 million from Marlene Ricketts, wife of billionaire T.D. Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, wants to saturate the expensive Florida airwaves ahead of the state\u2019s March 15 primary with hopes of denying Trump a victory that could crush the hopes of home state Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nImagine if they failed to damage him enough to stop him from winning the nomination, but damaged him enough to help Hillary Clinton get elected.\n\n* Shane Goldmacher reports that things are looking grim for Marco Rubio:\n\nMarco Rubio\u2019s path to the Republican nomination short of a contested convention has narrowed to nearly nothing as his campaign and allies reboot their strategy to prepare for months of guerrilla warfare to deny Donald Trump a clean, pre-convention victory. The math for Rubio is daunting. After getting thoroughly routed on Super Tuesday, Rubio is in so deep a delegate hole that he would now need to win roughly two-thirds of all the remaining delegates to guarantee his nomination ahead of Cleveland, according to a POLITICO analysis.\n\nBut his moment is really coming, right abouuuuuuut \u2026 now.\n\n* John Kasich is now arguing that if he wins Ohio, it will mean that Trump won\u2019t be able to win outright and we\u2019ll go to a brokered convention. Which means that he\u2019s staying in the race at least until March 15 and also means that at least two of the remaining four candidates are pinning their hopes on a brokered convention.\n\n* Glenn Kessler tries to untangle all the ways Fred Trump set Donald up for his real estate career and bailed him out when things got rough; it was a lot more than \u201ca small loan of a million dollars.\u201d\n\n* Jennifer Steinhauer reports that Iowa senator and chief Supreme Court obstructionist Sen. Charles E. Grassley is getting a serious challenger in Patty Judge, a former lieutenant governor and state agriculture secretary.\n\n* Dahlia Lithwick says that when the Supreme Court heard its latest abortion case yesterday, it felt for the first time like the gender playing field was finally levelled.\n\n* Francis Wilkinson argues that Trump has proven that racism doesn\u2019t need to be couched in dog whistles and subtle appeals \u2014 you can just say it!\n\n* Rich Lowry notes something else Trump has shown: it isn\u2019t actually necessary for Republican candidates to pray at the altar of Ronald Reagan.\n\n* Sarah Posner tells you everything you need to know about the Trumpvangelicals, and yes, she made that word up, and yes, you have to use it from now on.\n\n* Charles Gaba notes that the administration is now saying that 20 million more Americans now have health-care coverage because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n* At The Week, I explored what Donald Trump will look like as a general election candidate once he undergoes his inevitable transformation.\n\n* At CNN.com, I argued that the Mitt Romney who ran four years ago was a lot like today\u2019s Donald Trump in more ways than he\u2019d like to admit.\n\n* And finally, the Obamas will be staying in Washington for a couple of years after they leave the White House so their daughter, Sasha, can finish high school. I\u2019m guessing Barack Obama will open an artisanal pour-over coffee bar in Petworth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "title": "Happy Hour Roundup", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/03/03/happy-hour-roundup-807/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/01/27/National-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Trump-004c3-3698.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/03/03/happy-hour-roundup-807/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "article_summary": "* At The Week, I explored what Donald Trump will look like as a general election candidate once he undergoes his inevitable transformation.\n* At CNN.com, I argued that the Mitt Romney who ran four years ago was a lot like today\u2019s Donald Trump in more ways than he\u2019d like to admit.\n* And finally, the Obamas will be staying in Washington for a couple of years after they leave the White House so their daughter, Sasha, can finish high school.\n* Now that Trump has put himself in position to win the Republican nomination, the big-money people are ready to step up:Wall Street is getting ready to go nuclear on Donald Trump.\n\u201cI could\u2019ve said, \u2018Mitt drop to your knees\u2019 and he would\u2019ve dropped to his knees,\u201d Trump said."}
