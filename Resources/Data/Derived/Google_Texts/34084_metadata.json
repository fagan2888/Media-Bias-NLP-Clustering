He is a close friend of Rush Limbaugh who sounds the alarm that The Liberals Are Coming!\u2122\u201d By essentially injecting himself into the 1600s, Limbaugh hopes to teach children \u201cthe true story of Thanksgiving,\u201d an idea given to him by his wife, Kathryn, who observed that Limbaugh is \u201calways talking about how history is being mistaught.\u201d\n\nIt seems that the ever-enterprising Limbaugh, who published two other books in the 1990s, is expanding his reach. But why stop with children\u2019s books? Here are 10 other projects that Limbaugh could successfully undertake:\n\n1. Gettysburg reenactor\n\nGiven Limbaugh\u2019s proclivity for history, playing a reenactor of one of America\u2019s most pivotal battles would be the next logical application of his passion. Except that Limbaugh fiddles with history just a little bit, playing a resurrected George Washington, who arrives to battle in a stylish Tesla. Also, the reenactment takes place in a more American state, like Texas.\n\n2. An Etsy business tycoon\n\nTaking a page from the book of his kindred spirit Glenn Beck, who lovingly tried to auction off an Obama-in-a-Pee-Pee Doll, Limbaugh could easily set up shop on Etsy. Perhaps he could make jewelry for women, a demographic he seems to understand quite well.\n\n3. Professional cuddler\n\nPlease note: This is a real job. Cuddly-wuddly Limbaugh could probably make a decent chunk of change charging men and women upwards of $60 to enjoy his cuddly-wuddliness. (Just a thought!)\n\n4. Professional LARPer\n\nTo the uninitiated, \u201cLARP\u201d stands for \u201clive action role-playing,\u201d an interactive game in which players physically act out the stories of their characters in costume, with props. After all, Limbaugh is already a renowned LARPer in this tragicomedy we call real life.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The conservative radio shock jock is writing history books for kids.
