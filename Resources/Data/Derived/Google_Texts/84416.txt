Crews are battling a large fire at the Nantucket Condominium apartment complex in northwest Oklahoma City, Wednesday afternoon.

One entire apartment building was completely engulfed, with flames and large black plumes of smoke pouring from the structure. The complex is located in the 3200 block of W. Britton Rd., near the W. Britton and N. May intersection, just east of Lake Hefner and the Lake Hefner Parkway.

The fire from the original building then spread to a building to the east. Several units have responded to the scene, and the fire is being called out as a three-alarm fire. One lane of each eastbound and westbound Britton Rd. has been shut down.

The cause of the fire has not been determined. Fire officials tell News 9 that no injuries have been reported at this time.

At the same time as crews were working the condo fire in NW OKC, another team of firefighters were called out to a house fire on the southwest side of the metro. The fire call went out to a home in the 3700 block of S. Villa Ave. Authorities shut down both north and southbound lanes of Villa and the eastbound lane of SW Grand Blvd. while crews worked the scene. No injuries were reported.
