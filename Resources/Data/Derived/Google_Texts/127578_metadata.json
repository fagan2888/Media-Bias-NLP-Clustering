Brian Lyman / Advertiser\n\nGov. Robert Bentley brought many proposals to improve health care access at the State of the State Tuesday. But one program seemed conspicuous by its absence.\n\nBuy Photo Gov.

Bentley said for now, he wanted to complete the implementation of Regional Care Organizations (RCOs). The RCOs aim to shift Medicaid delivery from a fee-for-service model to one that allocates money based on health care outcomes. The hope is that the move will encourage more preventive care and less hospital use, slowing the growth of costs in the program.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been putting in place right now a redevelopment and revitalization of Medicaid, and we\u2019re halfway through with that with the regional care organizations,\u201d he said.\n\nBentley also said the Legislature's mood against new taxes and the difficulties paying for the current Medicaid program, which takes up about 38 percent of the General Fund, would scotch expansion. That\u2019s a feeling shared by Sen. Trip Pittman, R-Montrose, the chairman of the Senate Finance and Taxation General Fund Committee, who introduced a resolution last year expressing the chamber\u2019s opposition to expansion.\n\n\u201cI think that was a good decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe governor\u2019s made a wise decision based on the consequences and the cost of Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nExpansion advocates stressed last week that not expanding meant no economic gain for the state, and no health care for hundreds of thousands of people who fail to qualify for Medicaid or private Affordable Care Act plans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point that we need to bite the bullet and do this,\u201d said Jim Carnes, policy director for Alabama Arise and a member of the Bentley-created Alabama Health Care Improvement Task Force, which recommended expansion in November. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity at hand, and it\u2019s foolish to keep pushing it back while our economy suffers and our families suffer.\u201d\n\nLimited access\n\nMedicaid recipients in Alabama are, for the most part, children, nursing home residents and the disabled. Childless adults almost never qualify. Parents of children who qualify for Medicaid can only receive benefits if they make 18 percent of the federal poverty line -- $2,867 a year for a family of two, or less than $56 a week.\n\nMedicaid expansion offered under the Affordable Care Act would open the program to anyone making up to 138 percent of the poverty level \u2013 about $16,394 a year for an individual, and $33,534 for a family of four. The median annual household income in Alabama, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, was $43,511 in 2014.\n\nAs written, the Affordable Care Act required states to expand Medicaid and did not envision the Medicaid-eligible buying Affordable Care Act plans offered through federal and state exchanges. But a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court decision said the federal government could not force states to offer the expansion. Bentley announced later that year he would not do so.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, a Washington DC based nonprofit that studies health care issues, estimates there are 139,000 Alabamians in a \u201ccoverage gap\u201d \u2013 unable to get Medicaid or tax credits needed to buy an Affordable Care Act plan. Expansion would give those people insurance. A 2012 UAB study pegged the number of people benefitting from expansion at 292,000. The number would include some people with group insurance.\n\nThe federal government pays the full cost of Medicaid expansion through the end of the year. After this year, states will kick in a growing share of the costs, though the feds will never pay less than 90 percent of the cost of expansion. There has been talk about extending the three-year federal coverage to entice more states to opt in.\n\nIt could also help the state\u2019s bottom line, Carnes said, by shifting health costs currently borne by the state to the federal government. A study released last week found that expansion slashed uncompensated care bills for hospitals in Indiana.\n\n\u201cThere are substantial savings we would get automatically by switching the care to Medicaid,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are economic benefits projected for Alabama, but they\u2019re proven in states that have gone ahead with expansion.\u201d\n\nRural hospitals\n\nState hospitals have been pushing for expansion, in part because of changes coming to disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments. DSH payments help hospitals cover the cost of treating patients without insurance. Many Alabama hospitals, especially in rural areas, need the payments to keep their doors open.\n\nThe ACA cuts DSH payments in 2018, which would leave many rural hospitals \u2013 who have large populations of uninsured patients \u2013 on the brink.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge hit,\u201d said Jeff Brannon, CEO of Monroe County Hospital in Monroeville.\n\nThe Alabama Hospital Association is preparing a report that Danne Howard, executive vice president and chief policy officer for the AHA, said would show a way for the state to expand Medicaid without adding \u201csignificant revenue,\u201d in part by shifting populations covered by the state into the expansion population.\n\n\u201cIf we could expand by July, there would still be six months of 100 percent funding available,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also think that could go a long way toward helping the Medicaid budget for the year.\u201d\n\nBentley suggested Monday that without Medicaid expansion, some rural hospitals could become urgent care centers, which could have more limited hours than hospitals. Howard said she wasn\u2019t sure that move would be \u201cfinancially viable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not open 24/7,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still leaves a void if there\u2019s not a hospital with an emergency room that\u2019s open 24/7.\u201d\n\nHoward did praise Bentley\u2019s proposal to create incentives to bring doctors to rural areas. Both Howard and Brannon support the moves to RCOs, saying preventive care would lead to better outcomes and reduce utilizations of emergency rooms, a primary driver of costs.\n\n\u201cI think it leads to the ultimate expansion of Medicaid,\u201d Brannon said. \u201cIt\u2019s regionalized to the degree we talked about, somewhat of a patient care home type situation. I think care managers can guide patients to the appropriate place for care.\u201d\n\nPolitics\n\nWhile Democrats have long pushed for Medicaid expansion, Republicans in the Legislature, including Pittman, have opposed it. The Alabama Legislature would have to approve funding and enabling legislation for Medicaid expansion.\n\nPittman, who said he had not seen studies touting expansion\u2019s benefits, said he wants to see RCO implementation move forward. The health care sector, he said, needs to re-evaluate a system he said lay on a \u201cfoundation of sand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think everyone that operates hospitals and health care entities needs to look at the way they\u2019ve been capturing funding streams,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they need to manage their way through that.\u201d\n\nBentley did not rule out Medicaid expansion entirely on Monday. The governor said Monday two reasons to expand Medicaid were the hospital issue and allowing rural doctors to see more covered patients.\n\nAgainst that, the governor said, was his feeling \u201cvoters don\u2019t want to pay for an entitlement\u201d and the cost of getting the state\u2019s share.\n\nThe 2012 UAB study estimated the costs of Medicaid expansion to Alabama per year would reach $222 million by 2020. The study said the figure did \u201cnot consider potential savings from reduced spending on uncompensated care, mental health care and other services currently provided to the expansion population.\u201d It estimated a total economic impact of almost $20 billion from expansion.\n\nBut Bentley and other lawmakers, citing the perpetual troubles in the General Fund and legislators\u2019 unwillingness to add new revenues, have said the cost is not workable.\n\n\u201cThis is why I did not include it,\u201d Bentley said Monday. \u201cWe simply cannot afford to expand Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThe state is currently waiting on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver that would allow the RCOs to go into effect. Getting that in place, he said, is his priority. Bentley's General Fund budget proposal called for a $100 million increase to Medicaid next year, less than the $157 million officials said they need to maintain current services. The request includes $35 million for RCOs.\n\n\u201cWe are having trouble paying for the present Medicaid system,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need an extra $157 million in the system next year and I doubt very seriously they\u2019re going to get that. If they don\u2019t get that, I\u2019m not sure we will be able to put in our RCOs.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1T5VmNV", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Despite recommendation from task force, governor says focus on changing delivery system", "og": {"site_name": "The Montgomery Advertiser", "description": "Despite recommendation from task force, governor says focus on changing delivery system", "title": "Medicaid expansion missing from Bentley's proposals", "url": "http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/southunionstreet/2016/02/06/medicaid-expansion-missing-bentleys-proposals/79891430/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/montgomeryadvertiser.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite recommendation from task force, governor says focus on changing delivery system", "title": "Medicaid expansion missing from Bentley's proposals", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/74953187d8766573432320798d079802c75e5f3d/c=617-0-2384-1767&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/04/Montgomery/Montgomery/635901868135437368-state08.jpg", "creator": "@mgmadvertiser", "site": "@mgmadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=790279910", "fb": {"app_id": 163677993677689}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/southunionstreet"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, Alabama Legislature, Robert Bentley, Alabama Legislature, Alabama House of Representatives, Alabama Senate, Trip Pittman, Alabama Hospital Association, Danne Howard, General Fund"}, "article_summary": "The federal government pays the full cost of Medicaid expansion through the end of the year.\nThe 2012 UAB study estimated the costs of Medicaid expansion to Alabama per year would reach $222 million by 2020.\n\u201cI think they need to manage their way through that.\u201dBentley did not rule out Medicaid expansion entirely on Monday.\nThe RCOs aim to shift Medicaid delivery from a fee-for-service model to one that allocates money based on health care outcomes.\n(Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser)Despite a recent recommendation from one of his task forces to put it in place, Bentley did not mention Medicaid expansion in the hourlong speech."}
