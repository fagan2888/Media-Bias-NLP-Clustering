If approved, Prop 45 would give that authority to the state insurance commissioner. This would require health insurers to submit changes to the state for judicial review before they go into effect. Similar regulation was approved for auto and home insurance when Proposition 103 passed in 1988.\n\nWhat it\u2019s going to cost taxpayers: Nothing.\n\nWho supports it: Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones, U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, the California Democratic Party, Gray Davis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s secretary of health and human services\n\nWhy they do: Those who endorse Prop 45 believe giving the state insurance commissioner more authority would protect Californians from rate increases found to be excessive or unfairly discriminatory\u2014which is even more important for consumers now that coverage is mandatory.\n\nWho opposes it: Covered California, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Blue Shield of California, Los Angeles Times, the California Republican Party, California Chamber of Commerce, Association of California Healthcare Districts, California Taxpayer Protection Committee\n\nWhy they do: Opponents agree with the prop\u2019s proponents that it is important to regulate healthcare costs, but argue that this measure is deceiving and will in fact raise costs, not reduce them. They also believe it would give a politician power that is better served in the hands of doctors and patients and are critical of how poorly the proposition outlines how rates should be evaluated.\n\nThe takeaway: What\u2019s appealing about Prop 45 is its mission to keep insurance companies in check, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t adequately address how specifically a state insurance commissioner should do so or how a newly empowered commissioner would be required to work with Covered California, leaving many reformers to think a more comprehensive solution is needed.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.categories": "Politics,", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.lamag.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/10/madprops45-300x300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Jesy Odio", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, covered california, health insurance, mad props, prop 45", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "sailthru.link": "http://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/mad-props-need-know-voteon-prop-45/", "og": {"site_name": "Los Angeles Magazine", "description": "Will government regulation improve or hinder how the state implements the Affordable Care Act?", "title": "Mad Props: What You Need to Know Before You Vote\u2026On Prop 45  - Los Angeles Magazine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 850, "identifier": "http://www.lamag.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/10/madprops45.jpg", "height": 640}, "updated_time": "2014-10-27T15:57:21-07:00", "url": "http://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/mad-props-need-know-voteon-prop-45/", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.image.221": "http://www.lamag.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/10/madprops45-221x290.jpg", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.lamag.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/10/madprops45.jpg", "description": "Will government regulation improve or hinder how the state implements the Affordable Care Act?", "card": "summary", "title": "Mad Props: What You Need to Know Before You Vote\u2026On Prop 45  - Los Angeles Magazine"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-28 09:00:02", "sailthru.image.100": "http://www.lamag.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/10/madprops45-100x120.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Mad Props: What You Need to Know Before You Vote\u2026On Prop 45", "sailthru.image.400": "http://www.lamag.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/10/madprops45-400x400.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Affordable Care Act,Covered California,Health Insurance,Mad Props,Prop 45,Politics,CityThink,", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Prop 45", "published_time": "2014-10-28T09:00:02-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-27T15:57:21-07:00"}, "sailthru.description": "Will government regulation improve or hinder how the state implements the Affordable Care Act?", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.lamag.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/10/madprops45-600x400.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.image.150": "http://www.lamag.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/10/madprops45-150x150.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d00\"", "article_summary": "Mad Props: What You Need to Know Before You Vote\u2026On Prop 45Will government regulation improve or hinder how the state implements the Affordable Care Act?\nIf approved, Prop 45 would give that authority to the state insurance commissioner.\nWhat it\u2019s all about:The Affordable Care Act instituted Covered California as the state\u2019s individual health insurance exchange but failed to legislate how health insurance costs should be regulated.\nWho supports it: Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones, U.S.\nThis would require health insurers to submit changes to the state for judicial review before they go into effect."}
