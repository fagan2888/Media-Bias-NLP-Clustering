The extremist, Somalia-based terror group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for that attack.\n\nU.S. officials have said no credible threat has been detected in the United States, relating to Friday\u2019s attack in Paris.\n\nBut American law enforcement agencies are taking precautions in major U.S. cities.\n\nThe New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles police departments all reported deploying additional patrols to high-profile locations across their cities Friday night.\n\nOfficials at the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and across the U.S. intelligence community are monitoring the situation.\n\n\u201cAt this time, there is no specific or credible threat to the United States,\u201d a DHS official said on background on Friday night. \u201cWe will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people.\u201d\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, Texas Republican, said in a statement that, \u201cwhile we must always remain vigilant, there are no known, credible threats to the homeland at this time.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Andrea Noble contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The coordinated Paris attacks required a level of operational sophistication that Islamic extremist terrorists have not shown in Europe since the London suicide attacks in 2005 when four separate bombs, detonated in quick succession, targeted civilians on mass transit in the British capital.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The coordinated Paris attacks required a level of operational sophistication that Islamic extremist terrorists have not shown in Europe since the London suicide attacks in 2005 when four separate bombs, detonated in quick succession, targeted civilians on mass transit in the British capital.", "title": "Paris attacks show high level of sophistication, was kept secret", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/14/paris-attacks-show-high-level-sophistication-was-k/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/14/APTOPIX_France_Paris_Attacks.JPEG-0bca3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/14/APTOPIX_France_Paris_Attacks.JPEG-0bca3.jpg", "description": "The coordinated Paris attacks required a level of operational sophistication that Islamic extremist terrorists have not shown in Europe since the London suicide attacks in 2005 when four separate bomb", "card": "summary", "title": "Paris attacks show high level of sophistication, was kept secret"}, "Author": "Guy Taylor", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1eee\"", "article_summary": "The coordinated Paris attacks required a level of operational sophistication that Islamic extremist terrorists have not shown in Europe since the London suicide attacks in 2005 when four separate bombs, detonated in quick succession, targeted civilians on mass transit in the British capital.\nU.S. officials have said no credible threat has been detected in the United States, relating to Friday\u2019s attack in Paris.\nBut it was al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula \u2014 not the Islamic State \u2014 that claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo attack, which left 11 people dead at the magazine in January.\nThe Syria- and Iraq-based Islamic State claimed responsibility on Saturday for the attacks, saying it sent militants strapped with suicide bombing belts and carrying machine guns to various locations in the heart of the French capital.\n\u201cAt this time, there is no specific or credible threat to the United States,\u201d a DHS official said on background on Friday night."}
