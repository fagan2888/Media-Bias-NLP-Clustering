But if the media\u2014especially the dominant elite media\u2014really wants to know who\u2019s responsible for Trump\u2019s rise, one place they should start looking is right in their bathroom mirrors.\n\nI know, I know. Trump is a clownish figure far removed from the sort of seriousness they strive to cultivate. Surely they can\u2019t be blamed for him, right?\n\nWrong. Here\u2019s why: As Congress returns, there\u2019s a looming threat of yet another government shutdown. Once unthinkable, then disastrous when Gingrich introduced them, shutdown threats have become a part of normal politics in the Obama era, thanks in large part to \u201cbalanced\u201d journalism, which has helped to reframe them as normal, if perhaps a little bit risky\u2014and therefore, a bit titillating. With a large part of the GOP buying into this fantasy view of how politics works, they were at first content to vent their hatred primarily on President Obama and congressional Democrats, but now their anger has widened to the entire political class\u2014which is actually well deserved, in a way. But it\u2019s not just the GOP politicians who egged them on who are to blame\u2014the \u201cbalanced\u201d media played a starring role as well.\n\nShutdowns are not the only aspect of this story\u2014there\u2019s the dramatic increase in the use of the filibuster, for example\u2014but they are arguably the most extreme form that destructive obstructionism can take. They are also one of the most dramatic\u2014and virtually unprecedented prior to the 1990s. They also involve a kind of psychological regression, back to a more immature state. After all, the essential nature of the shutdown is a refusal to engage in normal give-and-take, the sort of thing most of us learn in kindergarten, if not before. As one indication of this, pollsters even took to asking the public who was acting more adult or more like a \u201cspoiled child.\u201d When the whole political system gets pulled for years in the direction of government-by-temper-tantrum\u2014and the media treats it as perfectly normal\u2014it really should not be so surprising when an intemperate blowhard like Trump suddenly shows up to steal the show.\n\nThe \u201cbalanced\u201d media has promoted this dysfunction around government shutdowns in at least three distinct ways: First, the media presents the shutdown shorn of historical context, with no indication of how radical, novel or one-sided it is, or of how it relates to a broader range of related radical and novel right-wing strategies, or to the dramatic underlying rightward shift of the GOP in Congress (House/Senate) since 1980. This has the effect of dramatically reducing the cost of introducing new, destabilizing and downright destructive political strategies.\n\nSecond, the media adopts a \u201cbalanced\u201d approach to reporting on the prospects of a shutdown, and the shutdown itself. It seeks to place blame on both sides (see, for example the Media Matters research report, \u201cWhat The Media\u2019s False Equivalence Misses About the Government Shutdown Threat\u201c), regardless of how inaccurate this is. This falsely balanced reporting works in favor of the absolute worst actors\u2014always giving them the \u201cbenefit of the doubt,\u201d and against those who are most public-minded, adopting a stance of jaded cynicism, regardless of whether they\u2019ve done anything to deserve it. Third, the media \u201cbalances\u201d any residual negativity that the shutdown perpetrators might be left with stories intended to cast the other party\u2014the Democrats\u2013in an equally bad light. The media\u2019s months-long obsession over problems with the Obamacare website filled this function perfectly.\n\nAlthough it began even earlier, shutdown talk began to flower immediately after the 2010 midterms, and ramped up through a series of threats, and near-shutdowns over the next two-plus years (see detailed timeline here), until Republicans finally did shut the government down for two weeks in October 2013, over a doomed attempt to defund Obamacare before it could go into effect. The public reaction was extremely negative, even though the media\u2019s \u201cbalanced\u201d coverage strove to give Obama and the Democrats an equal amount of blame (some relevant headlines here). At the time, I wrote a story identifying \u201cnine distinct bodies of evidence\u201d contradicting the \u201cboth sides did it\u201d narrative:\n\n(1) The longstanding GOP fixation on shutting down the government. (2) The GOP\u2019s creation of the shutdown crisis by blocking the budget reconciliation process. (3) The emergence and evolution of the incoherent Ted Cruz/Tea Party plan to force a shutdown over \u2018Obamacare\u2019. (4) The record of prominent Republican politicians and others who repeatedly warned against forcing a government shutdown. (5) The contrary historical record of some Republicans downplaying the severity of the shutdown. (6) The record of drastic Democratic budget concessions embodied in the \u201cclean continuing resolution\u201d which House Republicans rejected. (7) The polling evidence that only GOP base voters are opposed to political compromise\u2014and are indifferent to crisis. (8) Evidence that GOP base intransigence drives policy. (9) The framework of American legislative history.\n\nThere were stories here and there in the press touching on all of the above, but because of the ideologically driven commitment to \u201cbalance,\u201d they were kept isolated and atomized, never consolidated into a coherent picture of what was actually going on at the time. And for good reason: the GOP wanted a shutdown, and the public overwhelmingly did not.\n\nGoing into the shutdown, a Quinnipiac poll released on Oct. 1 found American voters rejecting it by more than a 3-1 landslide: 72-22 percent. While Gallup had recorded a very modest peak of congressional approval for the year at 19 percent in early September, before the shutdown drama began, it dropped to 11 percent in early October in the middle of the shutdown, and 9 percent in early November\u2014the lowest level ever recorded by Gallup in 39 years of polling the measure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The old \"both sides do it\" lie keeps the press from talking honestly about politics, and helps empower the right", "title": "The media made this f**king monster: How phony objectivity helped create Donald Trump", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The old \"both sides do it\" lie keeps the press from talking honestly about politics, and helps empower the right", "title": "The media made this f**king monster: How phony objectivity helped create Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/14/the_media_made_this_fking_monster_how_phony_objectivity_helped_create_donald_trump/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/trump_kelly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The old \"both sides do it\" lie keeps the press from talking honestly about politics, and helps empower the right", "title": "The media made this f**king monster: How phony objectivity helped create Donald Trump", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/trump_kelly.jpg", "creator": "@PaulHRosenberg", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Rosenberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Media Criticism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But it\u2019s not just the GOP politicians who egged them on who are to blame\u2014the \u201cbalanced\u201d media played a starring role as well.\nSecond, the media adopts a \u201cbalanced\u201d approach to reporting on the prospects of a shutdown, and the shutdown itself.\nTrump is a clownish figure far removed from the sort of seriousness they strive to cultivate.\nAnd for good reason: the GOP wanted a shutdown, and the public overwhelmingly did not.\n(7) The polling evidence that only GOP base voters are opposed to political compromise\u2014and are indifferent to crisis."}
