Now, with a near daily barrage of bad news tied to ObamaCare, from skyrocketing premiums to bald-face lies about its true nature, the president is reduced to working the talk show circuit like a B-lister promoting a cable pilot.\n\nObama\u2019s latest celebrity interview will take place tomorrow from the cozy confines of Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s daytime show. The talker will speak to Obama via a White House video feed in a last-ditch effort to coax young Americans to sign up for ObamaCare.\n\nWe last saw Obama yukking it up with Zach Galifianakis on the comedian\u2019s Between Two Ferns comedy sketch. Before that, Vice President Joe Biden and First Lady Michelle Obama worked Late Night with Seth Meyers and The Tonight Show, respectively, to pitch the flailing heath care agenda.\n\nObama\u2019s arrival on the national stage was met with a near-uniform belief that he could communicate and convince the masses in ways few other politicians could match. Today, after an endless barrage of speeches and the implementation of his signature legislative achievement, he must beam himself into a frothy daytime talk show to seal the deal.\n\nThis may not be the last we see of Obama on the pop culture radar. The deadline to sign up for ObamaCare is March 31, and he could always visit old pal Jimmy Fallon and \u201cslow jam\u201d the news before midnight strikes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama, desperate to spread good news about his struggling health care overhaul, will promote his agenda anew on", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "President Barack Obama, desperate to spread good news about his struggling health care overhaul, will promote his agenda anew on", "title": "President to Visit Ellen DeGeneres' Show to Sell ObamaCare (Again) - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/03/19/obama-ellen/obama-ellen.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2014/03/19/obama-visits-ellen-obamacare-push/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama, desperate to spread good news about his struggling health care overhaul, will promote his agenda anew on", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/03/19/obama-ellen/obama-ellen.png", "title": "President to Visit Ellen DeGeneres' Show to Sell ObamaCare (Again) - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Michelle Obama, Seth Meyers, White House,Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-03-19T09:42:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3dd3\"", "article_summary": "The deadline to sign up for ObamaCare is March 31, and he could always visit old pal Jimmy Fallon and \u201cslow jam\u201d the news before midnight strikes.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPresident Barack Obama has had years to promote his signature health care reform.\nObama\u2019s latest celebrity interview will take place tomorrow from the cozy confines of Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s daytime show.\nThe talker will speak to Obama via a White House video feed in a last-ditch effort to coax young Americans to sign up for ObamaCare.\nWe last saw Obama yukking it up with Zach Galifianakis on the comedian\u2019s Between Two Ferns comedy sketch."}
