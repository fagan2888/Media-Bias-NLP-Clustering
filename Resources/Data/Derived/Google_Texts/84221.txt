Carlos Calvo

“Further Down the Line”

Guitar instructor to the stars Carlos Calvo offers his considerable songwriting talents on “Further Down the Line,” a collection of road-tripping tunes and love songs that showcases the Angeleno’s sheer mastery of the pop music form.

The title track is a combination love song and meditation on a hopeful future. “Constellation” goes deep on lyrical content amid a strumming guitar line and an insistent backbeat. “Don’t Mean a Thing” infuses country and Americana sounds into a satisfying result, with the amazingly upended line, “You don’t please as you do.” “Bayonne” is a delightfully, oddly Lucero-spiced paean to Mr. Calvo’s New Jersey hometown, and “Walk With Me” provides a tale of almost gospel-level musicality. “Midnight” is achingly personal, and Mr. Calvo switches sonic gears yet again for “Natural Causes,” with his amazing command of vocal virtuosity and lyrical inspection of the human condition.

Mr. Calvo was “Californication” actor David Duchovny’s personal guitar coach during the Showtime series’ run, which preceded “The X-Files” actor releasing his own album. With a bevy of Hollywood players beckoning for his guidance — including another famous student Adam Levin of Maroon 5 — it’s little wonder then that Mr. Calvo indeed has talent to spare. Thankfully, he is sharing it with us.
