And teacher-seller Angela Watson shares how TpT can help teachers supplement their income as entrepreneurs while helping other teachers and their students too.\n\nThe Internet is a hub where virtually everything can be a commodity, and students with Web access have entry to a wealth of information. That same principle now applies to teachers.\n\nSome argue that education is a learning tool that should be free nationwide, yet some teachers are starting to cash in on the same classroom lessons they teach, with help from an online education resource called TeachersPayTeachers.com (TpT).\n\nTpT offers a combination of free and premium memberships. Premium sellers pay a $59.95 annual fee and a 15 percent commission on all sales. Basic sellers have a free account and pay 40 percent commission on sales.\n\nThe sharing economy gets a taste for luxury\n\n\n\nFor some teachers, TpT sales have proven to be a big salary boost. According to the site, approximately 12 teacher sellers have become millionaires, while nearly 300 teachers have earned more than $100,000. Total earnings paid to teachers since the site's launch have been more than $175 million.\n\nFounded in April 2006 by Paul Edelman, a former New York City public school teacher, TpT is the first and largest open marketplace where teachers share, sell, and buy original educational resources.\n\n\"We know that teachers don't have a lot to spend and we want to make sure every dollar is a dollar well spent,\" says Adam Freed, TpT's CEO, in an interview with CNBC.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "Some teachers are starting to cash in on the classroom lessons they teach, with help from an online education resource called TeachersPayTeachers.", "news_keywords": "sharing economy, education, Teacherspayteachers, TpT, Paul Edelman, Adam Freed", "author": "Izzy Best", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Some teachers are starting to cash in on the lessons they teach, with help from an online education resource called TeachersPayTeachers.", "title": "TpT: The site that can make teachers millionaires?", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/09/teacherspayteachers-a-hub-for-education-materials.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/10/09/103067210-GettyImages-144779020.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some teachers are starting to cash in on the lessons they teach, with help from an online education resource called TeachersPayTeachers.", "creator": "@IzzyBestNews", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/09/teacherspayteachers-a-hub-for-education-materials.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/10/09/103067210-GettyImages-144779020.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "Etsy for teachers?
