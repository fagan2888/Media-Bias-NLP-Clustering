What management had to say

"ADP's results in the third quarter were solid and reflect investments we've made to support our clients through the first year of [Affordable Care Act] compliance reporting," said CFO Jan Siegmund in a press release. "On a year-to-date basis, we have made substantial investments in operational resources and additional selling expenses, and have also continued our shareholder friendly actions, returning over $1.7 billion in cash through dividends and share repurchases."



Looking forward

ADP reiterated its guidance for full-year 2016 bookings growth of 12% over $1.6 billion sold in fiscal 2015. The company also continues to expect revenue to increase about 7%, and 9% on a constant-dollar basis.

In addition, ADP narrowed its earnings outlook, with management now anticipating adjusted EPS growth of about 12% (versus its prior forecast of 11% to 13%) and 13% on a constant-dollar basis, compared with its previous range of 12% to 14%.

"We are seeing continued traction for our technology solutions and our robust service offerings, as a growing number of clients adopt new applications or chose our higher-touch HR outsourcing models," added CEO Carlos Rodriguez. "While sales of additional human capital management modules that assist with the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, compliance continue to boost our performance, we are especially pleased to have seen balanced contributions to growth from across our HCM [human capital management] portfolio."
