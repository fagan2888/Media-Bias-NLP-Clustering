Though she believes she is healthy, Ary said she is anxious to get a check-up to make sure.  Ary said she is still looking for the right place to sign up for Medicaid so she doesn\u2019t get incorrect information or get denied coverage.  \u201cIt is already stressful not having had it for so long,\u201d she said. \u201cI would rather not go through that headache if I don\u2019t have to.\u201d Valenzuela said she dreaded her 21st birthday. \u201cWhen you turn 21, you\u2019re supposed to celebrate,\u201d she said. But for her, it just meant the end of her health insurance. \u201cYou don\u2019t realize how important it is until it\u2019s gone.\u201d Valenzuela was born to a drug-addicted mother and said she spent her childhood in and out of foster care and enduring abuse by relatives. By the time she was 18, Valenzuela had become addicted to drugs herself and spent time in detention.  Now sober, Valenzuela is a guardian for three of her younger siblings, ages 11, 14 and 17. She has a tattoo of a Joan of Arc quote across her chest: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. I was born to do this.\u201d Valenzuela said she wants health insurance so she can see specialists for her gastritis, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic pain. She also has panic attacks and anxiety, though she has\u00a0been able to keep seeing a therapist through a special program for former foster children.  At the county office, the eligibility worker asked for Valenzuela\u2019s pay stubs from her job as an outreach worker. Valenzuela politely said she didn\u2019t believe she had to show her income to qualify.  Then the worker asked for proof that Valenzuela was in foster care. Valenzuela said she thought the county would be able to verify that in their computer system.  The eligibility worker couldn\u2019t find any records but said she would keep trying. \u201cDo you want to make an appointment to bring back these documents?\u201d she asked. Valenzuela left the El Monte office, her arm around her younger brother.  A few days later, another county worker was able to confirm that she had been in foster care. She told Valenzuela that her insurance should be active in just a few weeks.  Though relieved, Valenzuela felt drained. It shouldn\u2019t be this hard, she said.", "card": "summary", "title": "It\u2019s tough for former foster youths to stay insured (VIDEO) - MedCity News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "article": {"section": "NewsCred", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2014-02-03T05:01:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-12T11:47:38-04:00"}, "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,California, health insurance exchange, medi-cal, Medicaid, obamacare, , MedCity News", "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde4ad\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA lot of former foster youth don\u2019t want to say they were in foster care,\u201d she said.\nYouths who have moved across state lines since their time in foster care may not qualify.\nAfter learning of the coverage available to former foster youths, she reapplied.\nThe law applies to youths who have aged out of foster care since 2007.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shotgun approach,\u201d said Mary Frame with Walden Family Services, which serves current and former foster youth throughout Southern California, including San Bernardino and Riverside counties."}
