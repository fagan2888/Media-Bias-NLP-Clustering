This year is the first time most people will be getting those forms, and officials are anticipating a fair amount of confusion. In part, that\u2019s because what you need to do with that form depends on the type of coverage you had.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhat the forms are\n\nThe 1095 contains information about the health care coverage you had in 2015.\n\nThere are three kinds of 1095s, based on the type of coverage people have:\n\n1095-A: These forms are sent to people who got coverage through their state\u2019s health insurance exchange (for example, Connecticut\u2019s Access Health CT).\n\n1095-B: These go to people who had coverage that didn\u2019t come from a public exchange \u2013 for example, those who got coverage through a job, have Medicare or Medicaid, or who bought coverage on their own outside their state\u2019s exchange.\n\n1095-C: These will be sent by certain large employers that provide coverage to their workers. (You might get this form even if you didn\u2019t sign up for your employer\u2019s coverage; this form is used in part for companies to show what coverage was offered to you.)\n\nSome people will receive more than one 1095, particularly if they had more than one type of coverage in 2015.\n\nWhat do I do with these forms?\n\nIt depends whether you got coverage through the exchange in 2015.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t, you don\u2019t need to do anything with the form. In fact, you can file your taxes before your 1095 comes in the mail. When completing your tax return, you will need to indicate whether you had insurance in 2015 (and possibly pay a penalty if you didn\u2019t), and you can use the information on the 1095 to help answer. But you can also complete your taxes without that form.\n\nBut if you or someone else included in your tax return got coverage through the exchange and received financial assistance to discount the premium, you will need the information on the 1095-A to complete another tax form, known as Form 8962. The premium discounts are actually tax credits, paid in advance, based on an estimate of your 2015 income. Now that the year is over, you\u2019ll need to report to the IRS your actual income and reconcile that with the discount you received \u2013 which is what the Form 8962 is for.\n\nSo if you got coverage through the exchange, be sure to have your 1095-A when you prepare your taxes.\n\nDo I have to prove that I had coverage?\n\nNo. While there is a place on the tax form to indicate if you had coverage, you don\u2019t need to send proof, according to the IRS. (Even so, the agency recommends that people keep records of their coverage, including premiums they paid.)\n\nAnd the IRS will be getting information on your coverage, just not from you. The entities that send 1095 forms to consumers will also be sending information to the IRS.\n\nMy income is low enough that I don\u2019t have to file taxes, but I got one of these forms. Does this mean I now need to file taxes?\n\nIf you didn\u2019t get coverage through the exchange and you otherwise wouldn't have to file taxes, you do not need to file taxes because you got this form in the mail.\n\nBut if you got coverage through Access Health and received financial assistance with your premiums, you must file a tax return, no matter what your income level was. That\u2019s because you\u2019ll need to reconcile the amount of tax credits paid in advance to discount your premium with the amount your income actually entitled you to receive. If you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t be eligible for discounted coverage in 2017.\n\nPut another way: If you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have to file taxes and you got a 1095-B or 1095-C, you don\u2019t have to do anything. But if you got a 1095-A, you\u2019ll need to file a tax return.\n\nWhen should I expect these forms?\n\nAccording to the IRS, exchanges must send 1095-A forms by Feb. 1. Access Health plans to send its 1095-As out during the last week of January, spokeswoman Kathleen Tallarita said.\n\nGroups that need to provide 1095-B and 1095-C forms \u2013 generally, insurance companies and employers \u2013 have until March 31.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/01/07/coming-soon-to-your-mailbox-an-obamacare-tax-form/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, 1095-A, Affordable Care Act, taxes", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/01/07/coming-soon-to-your-mailbox-an-obamacare-tax-form/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Even if you don\u2019t get your health insurance through the federal health law, you're likely to get the form, which is part of the way the federal government verifies whether people are complying with the mandate that nearly all Americans have health care coverage.
