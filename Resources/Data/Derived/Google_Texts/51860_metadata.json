What we find overall \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of details and caveats \u2014 but overall, the immigrants are rapidly assimilating into American society.\u201d\n\nWater noted that the study was intended to be \u201cfactual and independent of politics.\u201d Even so, her study\u2019s findings do repudiate some of the existing myths about the impact that immigrants have on American society, and could challenge some of the recent xenophobic rhetoric pushed by 2016 Republican presidential candidates with anti-immigrant positions.\n\nHere are the main takeaways from the study that help debunk some persistent misconceptions about immigrants:\n\nImmigrants are healthier than native-born Americans\n\nCREDIT: Shutterstock\n\nCompared with native-born Americans, foreign-born immigrants are less likely to die from cardiovascular disease and cancers, have fewer chronic health conditions, have lower infant mortality rates, have lower rates of obesity, and have longer life expectancy rates, among other issues. They\u2019re also less likely to suffer from depression and abuse alcohol, the report found.\n\nThat finding refutes the idea that immigrants shouldn\u2019t be allowed to enter our borders because they may pose some kind of health risk. Arguing that immigrants have diseases has long been a fearmongering tactic employed to scare people into believing that immigrants could spread infectious diseases and wreck havoc for Americans.\n\nWhen thousands of unaccompanied Latin American children and families crossed the border last year, numerous lawmakers refused to grant them temporary refuge, claiming that the immigrants may have \u201cknown diseases and gang affiliations\u201d and that \u201cyou don\u2019t ship people that are ill and contagious all over the country. At the time, other lawmakers claimed that Central American immigrants could have tuberculosis, measles, chickenpox, and even the Ebola virus (a predominantly West African disease). In spite of the claims, many of those immigrants have already been vaccinated in their countries, which actually have higher vaccination rates than the United States.\n\nAllowing immigrants to join the U.S. health care system could make them even healthier. But some of them are finding themselves shut out of the Affordable Care Act, even if they\u2019re in the country legally. It\u2019s possible that legal U.S. residents and citizens were among the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of the more than 400,000 legal immigrants who lost their insurance coverage earlier this year after getting flagged for citizenship and immigration issues.\n\nAs a previous Journal of General Internal Medicine study found, undocumented immigrants are not a drain on the health care system, instead providing a surplus of $35.1 billion to the Medicare Trust Fund between 2000 and 2011.\n\nImmigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Richard Drew\n\nFirst-generation immigrants are incarcerated at one-fourth the rate for the native-born. The new study found that it\u2019s likely that the crime rates among the second and third generations catch up to the crime rates for the native-born population, which the authors point out could be \u201can unwelcome aspect of integration.\u201d\n\nThat finding helps challenge GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s insinuation that immigrants are rapists, drug dealers, and criminals. A growing number of Republican lawmakers have pointed to individual crimes committed by immigrants to double down on calls to secure the border and to get rid of so-called \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d places where local law enforcement officials can refuse to turn over immigrants to federal immigration officials. But turning up the heat on criminal immigrants actually runs counter to the truth about the immigrant population as a whole.\n\nThe report backs up at least two other studies that came to similar conclusions. The Immigration Policy Council recently released a report finding that immigrants are less likely to be criminals than the native-born population, with the violent crime rate dropping 48 percent during the period of time when the foreign-born share of the U.S. population grew from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent. And a 2013 Criminology and Delinquency study found that second-generation immigrants catch up to native-born Whites when it comes to criminal offenses, but that first-generation commit crime at a lower rate.\n\nImmigrants are learning English faster than ever\n\nCREDIT: Shutterstock\n\nThe study found that 85 percent of the foreign-born population speaks a language other than English at home, with about 62 percent of all immigrants speaking Spanish. At least half of the immigrant population speaks English \u201cvery well\u201d or \u201cwell,\u201d and less than 10 percent said they speak English \u201cnot at all.\u201d\n\nCompared with their predecessors, immigrants are losing their ancestors\u2019 languages at around the same rates as their historical predecessors, \u201cwith English monolingualism usually occurring within three generations,\u201d the report found.\n\nEnglish monolingualism usually [occurs] within three generations.\n\nBut even with the advancement of English integration throughout the generations, the report found that there are various barriers to English proficiency, like lack of funding from federal and state agencies to support adult English-language classes or access by low-skilled, poorly educated, residentally segregated, and undocumented immigrant populations.\n\n\u201cThe troubling issue is that federal and state support for adult English-language classes has declined in the last decade,\u201d Waters said. \u201cSo people who want to learn English don\u2019t necessarily have access to that.\u201d\n\nAmerica does not have an official language, though many states have already passed or are trying to pass legislation to make their official state language English, sometimes as part of an anti-immigrant push to limit immigrants into their localities. Most recently, a Pennsylvania lawmaker turned off the microphone for a Latina colleague who objected to his English-only bill.\n\nEven GOP candidates have hedged right on advocating for English-only legislation. Trump criticized former Florida Jeb Bush (R) for not exclusively speaking English on the campaign trail. And Carly Fiorina indicated that \u201cEnglish is the official language of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for English-only legislation,\u201d Waters stated, noting that the switch to English in the second generation is \u201coverwhelming,\u201d while the switch in the third generation is generally complete. \u201cIt seems to be happening on its own. If people wanted to support English-language use, then perhaps increasing federal and state support would be the way to go.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The study's findings repudiate some of the existing myths about the impact that immigrants have on American society.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The study's findings repudiate some of the existing myths about the impact that immigrants have on American society.", "title": "New Study Demolishes 3 Pernicious Myths About First-Generation Immigrants In America", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2015/09/24/3704612/report-immigration-assimilation/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/23134141/October-8-Rally-Pictures-110.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The study's findings repudiate some of the existing myths about the impact that immigrants have on American society.", "creator": "@EstherYuHsiLee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/23134141/October-8-Rally-Pictures-110-321x214.jpg", "title": "New Study Demolishes 3 Pernicious Myths About First-Generation Immigrants In America", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-immigration", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/23134141/October-8-Rally-Pictures-110.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/23134141/October-8-Rally-Pictures-110.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-24T08:00:37+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/estheryuhsilee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "At the time, other lawmakers claimed that Central American immigrants could have tuberculosis, measles, chickenpox, and even the Ebola virus (a predominantly West African disease).\nImmigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born AmericansCREDIT: AP Photo/Richard DrewFirst-generation immigrants are incarcerated at one-fourth the rate for the native-born.\nAnd a 2013 Criminology and Delinquency study found that second-generation immigrants catch up to native-born Whites when it comes to criminal offenses, but that first-generation commit crime at a lower rate.\nBut turning up the heat on criminal immigrants actually runs counter to the truth about the immigrant population as a whole.\nIf people wanted to support English-language use, then perhaps increasing federal and state support would be the way to go.\u201d"}
