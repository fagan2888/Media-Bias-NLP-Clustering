The deal replaces a 2000 agreement that permitted some 4,400 U.S. firms to legally handle European citizens\u2019 data, struck down by the EU high court in October over privacy concerns.\n\nOne of the high court\u2019s explicit criticisms was a lack of redress options for European citizens who feel their data has been misused in the U.S.\n\nBut those tracking the negotiations over a new agreement said that while passage of Judicial Redress would help move the updated deal forward, it wasn\u2019t a make-or-break requirement.\n\nNow, with the Privacy Shield under review by Europe\u2019s privacy regulators, supporters hope the bill\u2019s passage will make the watchdogs more likely to give it their stamp of approval.\n\nMore broadly, the bill is considered by many to be an important good-faith effort that will help rebuild trust in U.S. privacy law after ex-National Security Agency contractor revealed the breadth of the agency\u2019s spying.\n\nIt received support from both the business and the tech communities and passed unanimously in the House, although it faced a brief flurry of opposition from Senate Republicans who saw it as concessionary.\n\nAn 11th-hour amendment requiring the countries covered by the bill to allow commercial data transfers with the U.S. passed the Judiciary Committee last month. In addition, the edit included a provision stating that the bill can not impede U.S. national security interests.\n\nThe move rankled some in Europe who saw it as strong-arming and some onlookers are concerned that it may impact how the privacy regulators receive the new Privacy Shield.\n\nThe bill\u2019s other co-sponsor, Sen. Chris Murphy Chris MurphyOvernight Healthcare: Momentum on mental health? | Zika bills head to conference | Only 10 ObamaCare co-ops left Senators hope for deal soon on mental health bill Overnight Healthcare: IRS doubted legality of ObamaCare payments, ex-official says MORE (D-Conn.), reacted to its passage with relief. Murphy has been outspoken with his frustration that the legislation hasn\u2019t proceeded more quickly.\n\n\u201cDespite months of delay, the Judicial Redress Act will cement the vital international relationships we rely on to fill gaps in law enforcement and support U.S. technology companies conducting business abroad,\u201d Murphy said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relieved that the Senate finally acted in America\u2019s best interest and passed this relatively small bill that has such an outsized impact on our national security and the U.S. economy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The bill gives EU citizens the right to challenge misuse of their data in U.S. courts.", "description": "The bill gives EU citizens the right to challenge misuse of their data in U.S. courts.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Katie Bo Williams", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The bill gives EU citizens the right to challenge misuse of their data in U.S. courts.", "title": "Senate passes privacy bill key to two international agreements", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/268841-senate-passes-privacy-bill-key-to-two-international-agreements", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/europeancommissionec_050615getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-09T18:52:38-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-09T18:52-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/268841-senate-passes-privacy-bill-key-to-two-international-agreements", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-09T18:28-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Katie Bo Williams", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-09T18:28:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-09T18:52:38-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Chris Murphy, Orrin Hatch,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/268841-senate-passes-privacy-bill-key-to-two-international-agreements", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The bill gives EU citizens the right to challenge misuse of their data in U.S. courts.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senate passes privacy bill key to two international agreements"}, "dcterms.title": "Senate passes privacy bill key to two international agreements"}, "article_summary": "The Senate late on Tuesday passed a privacy bill that is considered integral to a pending transatlantic data transfer pact with the European Union.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cI am pleased the full Senate has passed this legislation, which demonstrates that the United States respects cross-border data privacy,\u201d said Sen.(R-Utah), one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors.\nMore broadly, the bill is considered by many to be an important good-faith effort that will help rebuild trust in U.S. privacy law after ex-National Security Agency contractor revealed the breadth of the agency\u2019s spying.\nAn 11th-hour amendment requiring the countries covered by the bill to allow commercial data transfers with the U.S. passed the Judiciary Committee last month.\nIn addition, the edit included a provision stating that the bill can not impede U.S. national security interests."}
