Golden retrievers, especially. Then she and her husband added a Bernese mountain dog to the mix.\n\n\u201cBig dogs have such a presence,\u201d she said. \u201cThey like you to bury your head in their big chests or ram their big bodies into you. They\u2019re just so comforting.\u201d\n\nBut when their four-year-old Bernese died suddenly and they had to put down their aging golden shortly thereafter, Bohlmann, 69, took a serious look at downsizing her dogs. \u201cI wanted to make sure I was diligent in my choice, because I would be moving into my 70s with whatever breed we chose,\u201d she said.\n\nShe and her husband, Pete, now share their Minnetonka home with a couple of tiny tail-waggers: an energetic and agile 11-pound Havanese named Mateo and a 6-pound papillon-Maltese mix named Gretel, whose good looks make up for her lack of smarts, Bohlmann joked.\n\nMore than half of U.S. households own a dog that weighs less than 25 pounds, according to the marketing research firm Packaged Facts. The trend toward pint-size pooches has been documented since 2000, but has accelerated in recent years in part because of an aging population of baby boomers such as Bohlmann.\n\nAs these dog lovers head into their golden years, the notion of scaling down becomes more pressing. Bodies are aging, strength is waning and occasionally we are less sturdy on our feet.\n\nSue Bohlmann was a longtime owner of Golden Retrievers and decided to go small because of health concerns. Bohlmann was seen with her dog Mateo, a male 8 year-old Havanese, giving some affection at her Minnetonka home Wednesday, Dec. 2, 2015, in Minnetonka, MN. ](DAVID JOLES/STARTRIBUNE)djoles@startribune.com Aging Boomers are starting to wonder whether it's time to downsize their dogs.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about falling, having a big, boisterous puppy in your household could be challenging,\u201d said Cindy Johnson of the Minnesota Animal Humane Society.\n\nIn addition, many senior high-rises and assisted-living communities have size restrictions, which make it difficult to bring larger breeds with you if you need \u2014 or want \u2014 to move.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re planning to do some traveling, small dogs are more likely to be accepted at hotels, fit better in a cramped RV and can easily be tucked beneath an airplane seat.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re so portable,\u201d said Bohlmann, who took both small dogs with her to Costa Rica one winter.\n\nAnother plus? Small dogs eat less, making them more affordable for retirees and people on fixed incomes.\n\nGauging energy levels\n\nDepending on the breed, more petite dogs also may be less demanding.\n\n\u201cOne of the big concerns seniors have is being able to walk with their dogs,\u201d said Carol Martin, owner of Tails of 2 Cities, a pet-sitting and dog-walking company. \u201cIt\u2019s healthy for everyone to get outside, but the smaller ones are fine in the backyard, just chasing squirrels.\u201d\n\nBut a dog\u2019s energy levels and temperament can be just as important as size.\n\nIf you have young grandchildren who visit often, an easygoing Lab or retriever mix might be a better fit than a high-strung Jack Russell terrier that might not like having its tail tugged.\n\nGrooming needs also might be a consideration. A short-haired dog won\u2019t have to get to the groomer every six weeks like a poodle. Other small breeds, such as Lhasa apsos and spaniels, need frequent brushing to keep their coats from matting.\n\nAge \u2014 of the dog, not just the owners \u2014 also plays a role.\n\nRescue groups and animal shelters encourage older dog lovers to consider adopting an adult dog, or even a white-muzzled senior. Adult dogs have outgrown their rambunctious puppy stage, and there are fewer surprises when it comes to their health and personalities.\n\n\u201cMany of us remember what it was like to get our first dog in our 20s or 30s when we first set out on our own,\u201d said Johnson of the Humane Society.\n\n\u201cYou get 55 or older, you might say, \u2018No, thank you. I want a nice adult dog, easygoing, where I don\u2019t have to worry about training and destroying the house.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOlder dogs can be a better fit \u201cenergy-wise,\u201d said Jean Beuning, who runs Top Dog Country Club in New Germany, Minn., and is raising money to build a nonprofit sanctuary for senior dogs.\n\nstock photo.\n\n\u201cOlder dogs aren\u2019t going to be bouncing off the walls if someone\u2019s in a walker,\u201d she said, or underfoot as a tripping hazard.\n\nPlan for the future\n\nNo matter what breed an aging dog lover settles on, it\u2019s important to consider the dog\u2019s future, too.\n\n\u201cI know people who\u2019ve set aside money in their will to care for their dogs,\u201d Martin said. \u201cAt least you have a better chance of having someone help out if you go first.\u201d\n\nBeuning bought long-term care insurance.\n\n\u201cThis way nobody tells me I have to move to assisted living and my dogs can\u2019t follow,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe can all stay at home.\u201d\n\nAs for Bohlmann, she has no regrets about downsizing. She ended up needing neck surgery that would have made walking and caring for a big dog more difficult.\n\n\u201cA companion is a companion,\u201d she said, \u201cno matter what size.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sue Bohlmann always loved big dogs.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Sue Bohlmann always loved big dogs.", "title": "Aging baby boomers are opting for pint-sized pooches", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/aging-baby-boomers-are-opting-for-pint-sized-pooches/361599571/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144986440667.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144986440667.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sue Bohlmann always loved big dogs.", "title": "Aging baby boomers are opting for pint-sized pooches", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/aging-baby-boomers-are-opting-for-pint-sized-pooches/361599571/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144986440667.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144986440667.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "Humane Society"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "pet dogs,Aging,downsizing,assisted living,small dogs,Humane Society"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc56c\"", "article_summary": "She ended up needing neck surgery that would have made walking and caring for a big dog more difficult.\nPlan for the futureNo matter what breed an aging dog lover settles on, it\u2019s important to consider the dog\u2019s future, too.\n\u201cOlder dogs aren\u2019t going to be bouncing off the walls if someone\u2019s in a walker,\u201d she said, or underfoot as a tripping hazard.\nRescue groups and animal shelters encourage older dog lovers to consider adopting an adult dog, or even a white-muzzled senior.\nSmall dogs eat less, making them more affordable for retirees and people on fixed incomes."}
