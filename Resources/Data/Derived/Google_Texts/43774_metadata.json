Sanders, writes the Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold, \u201cis not just a big-spending liberal. And his agenda is not just about money. It\u2019s also about control.\u201d\n\nFahrenthold claims Sanders\u2019s plan for paying for college with a tax on Wall Street trades would mean \u201ccolleges would run by government rules.\u201d\n\nApparently Fahrenthold is unaware that three-quarters of college students today attend public universities financed largely by state governments. And even those who attend elite private universities benefit from federal tax subsidies flowing to wealthy donors. (Meg Whitman\u2019s recent $30 million donation to Princeton, for example, is really $20 million from her plus an estimated $10 million she deducted from her taxable income.) Notwithstanding all this government largesse, colleges aren\u2019t \u201crun by government rules.\u201d\n\nThe real problem is too many young people still can\u2019t afford a college education. The move toward free public higher education that began in the 1950s with the G.I. Bill and was extended in the 1960s by leading public universities was reversed starting in the 1980s because of shrinking state budgets. Tuition has skyrocketed in recent years as states slashed education spending. It\u2019s time to resurrect that earlier goal.\n\nBesides, the biggest threats to academic freedom these days aren\u2019t coming from government. They\u2019re coming as conditions attached to funding from billionaires and big corporations that\u2019s increasing as public funding drops.\n\nWhen the Charles Koch Foundation pledged $1.5 million to Florida State University\u2019s economics department, for example, itstipulated that a Koch-appointed advisory committee would select professors and undertake annual evaluations. The Koch brothers now fund 350 programs at over 250 colleges and universities across America. You can bet that funding doesn\u2019t underwrite research on inequality and environmental justice.\n\nFahrenthold similarly claims Sanders\u2019s plan for a single-payer system would put healthcare under the \u201ccontrol\u201d of government.\n\nBut health care is already largely financed through government subsidies \u2013 only they\u2019re flowing to private for-profit health insurers that are now busily consolidating into corporate laviathans. Anthem purchase of giant insurer Cigna will make it the largest health insurer in America; Aetna is buying Humana, creating the second-largest, with 33 million members.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Another deliberately misleading article claims Sanders' tax plan will cost the American people $15 trillion.
