(Republican Eagle photo by Michael Brun)\n\nCANNON FALLS \u2014 Self-described \u201climited-government conservative\u201d David Gerson came away with a straw poll win Monday night following a debate between six Republican candidates vying for the state\u2019s 2nd Congressional District.\n\nAlso on stage were John Howe, Jason Lewis, Darlene Miller, Pam Myhra and newcomer Gene Rechtzigel, who filed the day of the debate. David Benson-Staebler of Morris, Minnesota, did not attend.\n\n\u201cI am running for Congress because we know that Washington is a well-oiled machine for the political elite, big business, big banks, big media and big unions, and we will no longer accept the collusion between special interests and government,\u201d said Gerson of South St. Paul.\n\nHe received 40 out of 105 votes in the unofficial poll conducted by the Goodhue County Republican Party, which sponsored the debate at Cannon Falls High School.\n\nThe GOP looks to retain the seat held since 2003 by Rep. John Kline. The Republican lawmaker announced last year he would not seek re-election in the fall.\n\nGerson ran a close race against Kline for party endorsement in 2014.\n\nLewis came in second in Monday\u2019s straw poll with 33 votes. The former radio host faced criticism by third-place finisher Howe of Red Wing for residing outside of the district.\n\n\u201cIf (Lewis) really wanted to help the Republican Party, maybe he should run against (DFL 4th District candidate) Betty McCollum in his own district instead of carpet bagging in this district,\u201d Howe said in his closing statement.\n\nThough the law does not require a candidate live in the district, Howe said it would be a \u201cliability\u201d in the general election.\n\n\u201cI live a whopping two miles outside the district,\u201d Lewis said, calling the issue a \u201cred herring.\u201d\n\nThe debate covered a range of national issues, from repealing the Affordable Care Act to questions on climate change and renewable energy policy.\n\nMyhra, a two-term state representative from Burnsville, Minnesota, said she favors a free-market approach for energy initiatives over government subsidies.\n\n\u201cI believe in reducing the regulations,\u201d Myhra said. \u201cAdding more regulations increases our premiums \u2026 which will result in greater hardship for people on fixed incomes.\u201d\n\nVoters in the 2nd District are most concerned about jobs and the economy, said Miller, CEO of a Burnsville, Minnesota,-based parts manufacturer.\n\n\u201cWe need to encourage anyone who has a dream to start a new business, even if it\u2019s in their garage, to help them and then when they grow up make sure they stay here in America,\u201d Miller said.\n\nCandidates also voiced opposition for federal spending on high-speed passenger trains in southeastern Minnesota, a contentious topic in the region considered for separate public- and privately-funded rail lines.\n\n\u201cWe need to go ahead with the super highway system, not a Zip Rail,\u201d Rechtzigel said.\n\nThe 2nd District covers the south metro and parts of southeastern Minnesota, including Goodhue, Dakota and Wabasha counties.\n\nThe presumptive DFL nominee is Angie Craig of Eagan, Minnesota.\n\nKline said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d about fundraising by the field of Republican candidates, none of whom have raised much more than $100,000 for their campaigns, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported Monday.\n\nThe congressman has not endorsed a candidate in the race.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,government,cannon falls,GOP,social", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Michael Brun", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "CANNON FALLS \u2014 Self-described \u201climited-government conservative\u201d David Gerson came away with a straw poll win Monday night following a debate between six Republican candidates vying for the state\u2019s 2nd Congressional District.
