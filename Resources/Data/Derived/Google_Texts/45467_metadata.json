The number of students who enrolled this year rose 2.8 percent, exceeding 20,000 for the first time, the group said.\n\nHospitals and medical schools have been trying to find solutions to a doctor shortage that is projected to grow 10-fold to 130,000 by 2025 as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act adds at least 25 million new patients to the health system. During debates around the law, some doctors voiced concern that it may make the medical profession less attractive. Today\u2019s numbers show otherwise, said Darrell Kirch, the chief executive officer of the Washington-based medical colleges group.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a baby boomer and among my generation, a lot of colleagues are struggling with the feeling this isn\u2019t what we signed up for, a complex organization with a lot of physicians,\u201d Kirch said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut premedical student groups and medical students see the world totally differently: the vast majority say they want to be employed in systems.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because larger systems afford new doctors more resources, he said. What\u2019s more, fewer medical students have interests in running private practices.\n\nOsteopathic Enrollment\n\nAdditionally, enrollment in osteopathic medical colleges grew 11.1 percent in 2013, and has almost doubled in the last 10 years, according to data from the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, based in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Osteopaths have a more holistic approach than traditional allopathic physicians, and students receive a D.O. degree rather than an M.D.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges will be what happens when the students finish their initial studies. More than 75 percent of residency programs -- where graduate medical students train for three to seven years before working independently -- are funded by the U.S. Medicare program, which is being subjected to mandatory federal budget cuts. In addition Congress has kept the number of slots capped at the same level since 1997.\n\nMore Slots\n\n\u201cWe need to increase training positions now because we\u2019re concerned that if Congress doesn\u2019t act we\u2019re not going to have enough residency positions to fully train these physicians,\u201d said Atul Grover, the chief public policy officer for the medical colleges group, in a telephone interview.\n\nThe lack of training may lead to a physician shortfall if graduates can\u2019t find residency programs to join, Grover said.\n\nThis year, 14 medical schools expanded class sizes by more than 10 percent. Since 2002, medical schools have increased the number of entering students by more than 20 percent, in an attempt to alleviate a projected physician shortfall to meet the aging of the baby boomers, those born from 1945 to 1965. A national shortage of 92,000 physicians is projected for 2020, increasing to more than 130,000 by 2025, according to the medical colleges group.\n\nThe Census Bureau estimates that 81.2 million people in the U.S. will be 65 or older in 2040 from 40.2 million in 2010.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, known as Obamacare, is expected to provide 25 million uninsured Americans with health coverage by 2016, according to the Congressional Budget Office.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Elizabeth Lopatto", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-24/medical-school-applications-enrollment-rise-to-records", "title": "Medical School Applications, Enrollment Rise to Records", "description": "A record number of students applied and enrolled in U.S. medical school this year, bucking predictions that President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care system overhaul would dissuade people from becoming doctors.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Elizabeth Lopatto", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health", "news_keywords": "Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-24/medical-school-applications-enrollment-rise-to-records", "parsely-title": "Medical School Applications, Enrollment Rise to Records", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-10-24T22:33:03.021Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "A record number of students applied and enrolled in U.S. medical school this year, bucking predictions that President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care system overhaul would dissuade people from becoming doctors.", "parsely-tags": "Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2013-10-24T22:33:03.021Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-24/medical-school-applications-enrollment-rise-to-records", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "A record number of students applied and enrolled in U.S. medical school this year, bucking predictions that President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care system overhaul would dissuade people from becoming doctors.", "title": "Medical School Applications, Enrollment Rise to Records"}, "fb": {"status": "A record number of students applied and enrolled in U.S. medical school this year, bucking predictions that President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care system overhaul would dissuade people from becoming doctors."}, "parsely-post-id": "MV57EK1A1I4H01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1cd0\"", "article_summary": "Total medical school applications increased 6.1 percent to more than 48,000, breaking a record set in 1996, according to data released today by the Association of American Medical Colleges.\nToday\u2019s numbers show otherwise, said Darrell Kirch, the chief executive officer of the Washington-based medical colleges group.\nThis year, 14 medical schools expanded class sizes by more than 10 percent.\nWhat\u2019s more, fewer medical students have interests in running private practices.\nA national shortage of 92,000 physicians is projected for 2020, increasing to more than 130,000 by 2025, according to the medical colleges group."}
