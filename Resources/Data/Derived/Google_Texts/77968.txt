A letter, written by a police sergeant on the department and signed by several other people, made its way to the Chickasha City Manager.

In the letter, the sergeant says he believes immediate action needs to be taken against the chief for using the “N” word. The sergeant recalls as a child a police officer used the derogatory term to him and to see his police chief use the word, even on social media, is hurtful and offensive and crosses a professional line when he posted it.
