And this number is expected to climb in the coming days.\n\nAl Jazeera reported the majority of these deaths occurred in government-run hospitals located in the port city of Karachi, where 20 million people live. Post Graduate Medical College Hospital alone has treated more than 3,000 patients, with other hospitals \u201cswamped with people suffering from heatstroke and dehydration.\u201d Usually, summer heat in Pakistan rests around 37 degrees celsius \u2014 but in recent days, it\u2019s risen to 44. That's is 113 degrees Farenheit.\n\nThe heat wave couldn\u2019t strike at a worse time, as the mostly-Muslim country is currently observing Ramadan, an Islamic Holy month marked by its sunrise-to-sunset fasting. For this reason, Al Jazeera found the provincial government has advised those observing Ramadan to do so inside. Medical camps have also been set up throughout Karachi in order to provide water and anti-dehydration salts.\n\nThe problem with heat is two-fold: it\u2019s dehydrating and causes power outages, which then cuts off air conditioning and running water. Kamal Hyder, an Al Jazeera correspondent in Pakistan, said everyone is playing \u201cthe blame game,\u201d but the truth is the government didn\u2019t issue a heat advisory or otherwise warning to people. And now, with the power outages, the situation has worsened.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pakistans, extreme, heat, wave, leaves, nearly, 700, dead, reminds, people, everywhere, take", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Pakistan declares a state of emergency in hospitals following 692 heat-related deaths.", "title": "Pakistan's Heat Wave, In Photos", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pakistans-extreme-heat-wave-leaves-nearly-700-dead-reminds-people-everywhere-take-339598", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/23/pakistan.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pakistan declares a state of emergency in hospitals following 692 heat-related deaths.", "title": "Pakistan's Heat Wave, In Photos", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pakistans-extreme-heat-wave-leaves-nearly-700-dead-reminds-people-everywhere-take-339598", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/23/pakistan.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/23/pakistan.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-23T16:35:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-23T16:35:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Pakistan declares a state of emergency in hospitals following 692 heat-related deaths."}, "article_summary": "Pakistan health officials have declared a state of emergency in hospitals after 692 people died during an extreme, three-day heat wave.\nThe heat wave couldn\u2019t strike at a worse time, as the mostly-Muslim country is currently observing Ramadan, an Islamic Holy month marked by its sunrise-to-sunset fasting.\nAnd now, with the power outages, the situation has worsened.\nThe problem with heat is two-fold: it\u2019s dehydrating and causes power outages, which then cuts off air conditioning and running water.\nFor this reason, Al Jazeera found the provincial government has advised those observing Ramadan to do so inside."}
