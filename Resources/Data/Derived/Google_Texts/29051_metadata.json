As of January, graduates in every province and territory except for Quebec and Yukon have had to write the National Council Licensure Examination, or NCLEX, to be licensed in their home provinces.\n\nPreviously, nursing graduates took a paper-based exam, which was administered by the Canadian Nurses Association three times a year. NCLEX is a computer-adaptive test that can be taken throughout the year. The exam adapts to a test-taker\u2019s ability, using an algorithm to choose the type and number of questions based on how the student is doing on the exam.\n\nThe first round of exam results are now in \u2013 and they are a cause for worry, according to some.\n\nThe national pass rate, at 70.6 per cent, was more than 10 percentage points below the pass rate \u201cfor the last number of years\u201d under the previous regime, the Canadian Association of Schools of Nursing said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nThe pass rate for Canadians was also lower than the 78.3-per-cent pass rate for Americans.\n\nThose results confirmed the worries of Dianne Tapp, dean of the faculty of nursing at the University of Calgary. \u201cThere were questions on the exams ... that were not appropriate for Canadian nursing,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked for specifics, Dr. Tapp said students told her they encountered questions that referred to Obamacare \u2013 the nickname for the health-care reform law in the U.S. \u2013 and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nProvincial regulatory groups and the Canadian Council of Registered Nurse Regulators, an umbrella group formed in 2011, have tried to counter concerns that NCLEX is \u201can American test.\u201d\n\nIn a question-and-answer document on its website, the council said those taking the exam would not be asked questions about the American health-care system or see other American content on the exam.\n\nThat contradicts feedback Dr. Tapp says she has received, including from one student who said she was asked to describe the side effects of a drug approved by the U.S. FDA.\n\nA spokesperson for the Canadian Council of Registered Nurse Regulators did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe new exam was supposed to be adapted to Canadian requirements, but instead Canadian schools are having to prepare their students to pass an American exam, Canadian Association of Schools of Nursing president Kirsten Woodend said in a statement, adding that \u201cthe tail is wagging the dog.\u201d\n\nOthers took a more nuanced view, acknowledging concerns about the test while saying any change involves an adjustment period.\n\n\u201cThe questions may be worded a little bit differently, but the purpose of the exam is the same,\u201d said Maura MacPhee, associate director at the University of British Columbia\u2019s school of nursing.\n\n\u201cAs educators, our mandate to the public is to produce students who are competent and safe at entry level of practice. So regardless of what the exam is, we are all working toward the same goal,\u201d Dr. MacPhee said.\n\nAt UBC, the pass rate for the 44 students who have taken the exam to date is 97.7 per cent \u2013 about the same as under the previous regime, she said, adding that it will take time to determine trends resulting from the new exam.\n\nAt the University of Saskatchewan, preliminary results showed an average pass rate of 79 per cent.\n\nLorna Butler, dean of nursing at the University of Saskatchewan, said those results were promising, but that, like many stakeholders, she would like to see some changes in the process, including more Canadian registered nurses involved in writing questions for the exam.\n\nDr. Tapp of the University of Calgary said she hoped the test results would spur regulators to re-evaluate the exam \u2013 without shaking public confidence in nurses.\n\n\u201cWe have every confidence that Canadian nursing graduates are just as competent as they were last year,\u201d she said. \u201cWe evaluate our students constantly, with a lot of different methods; we don\u2019t want to undermine confidence in our nurses.\n\n\u201cWe know that the only thing that\u2019s really changed is the examination.\u201d\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.333", "description": "National pass rate was more than 10 percentage points below recent pass rate under previous regime", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=429228415", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "National pass rate was more than 10 percentage points below recent pass rate under previous regime", "title": "Fewer nursing students are passing the new national licensing exam", "url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/fewer-nursing-students-are-passing-the-new-national-licensing-exam/article26297735/", "image": {"width": 400, "secure_url": "https://sec.images.theglobeandmail.com/media/www/images/flag/gam-square.png", "type": "image/png", "identifier": "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/8c6/news/british-columbia/article26297734.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/test.JPG", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "National pass rate was more than 10 percentage points below recent pass rate under previous regime", "creator": "@globeandmail", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tgam://article/26297735", "iphone": "tgam://article/26297735"}, "country": "CA", "name": {"ipad": "The Globe And Mail", "iphone": "The Globe And Mail"}, "id": {"ipad": 429228415, "iphone": 429228415}}, "site": "@globeandmail", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512948019}, "robots": "noarchive", "last-modified": "2015-09-09 11:56:54 EDT", "fb": {"app_id": 126045934076200}, "location": "Canada", "application-contextName": "globeandmail", "keywords": "University of Calgary;University of British Columbia;exam;nursing;student;pass rate;health-care system;Canadian nursing;licensing exam;American exam;Health Care;", "article": {"onpage": 1, "engagement": "true", "comments": "false", "pages": 1, "type": "news", "id": 26297735}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "identifier-URL": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb67c\"", "article_summary": "The pass rate for Canadians was also lower than the 78.3-per-cent pass rate for Americans.\n\u201cWe have every confidence that Canadian nursing graduates are just as competent as they were last year,\u201d she said.\nThe first round of exam results are now in \u2013 and they are a cause for worry, according to some.\nNursing educators are raising concerns over a new national licensing exam, saying the percentage of students passing the test is lower than under a previous regime and that some students have encountered questions that reflect the American \u2013 not Canadian \u2013 health-care system.\nPreviously, nursing graduates took a paper-based exam, which was administered by the Canadian Nurses Association three times a year."}
