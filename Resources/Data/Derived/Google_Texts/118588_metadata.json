We are proud to make these investments in infrastructure upgrades because it improves the quality of life in Delaware County,\u201d said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker. \u201cThe Cherokee Nation maintains these kinds of strategic partnerships to ensure our communities remain safe for our families.\u201d\n\nDelaware County Road North 4580, also known as \u201cBull Hollow Road,\u201d suffered from persistent problems. The dirt road had major drainage issues, and the county was continually repairing potholes. Transportation officials completed final inspection Monday, and the roadway is now fully open.\n\n\u201cThis new nine-and-a-half-mile stretch of paved highway will not only provide safer travel for Delaware County citizens, but also reduce the wear and tear on citizens\u2019 vehicles,\u201d said Tribal Councilor Curtis Snell. \u201cThis reduces the financial burden of maintaining their vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe Cherokee Nation works cooperatively with counties inside the tribal boundaries to repair and replace roads and bridges. In many cases, the Cherokee Nation purchases the materials and the counties provide the work. The Bull Hollow Road project was funded under a federal program, so the Cherokee Nation managed this particular project from start to finish. This is the longest federally funded highway project the tribe has managed to date.\n\n\u201cI cannot say enough good things about our partnerships with the Cherokee Nation,\u201d said Danny Duncan, Delaware County commissioner for District 3. \u201cThis new road helps not only Cherokees living in this area, but everyone in the county. It opens up a new route for commerce by better connecting these communities to Highway 412, and better connecting Delaware and Mayes counties. Bull Hollow Road was problematic for so many years, so this new road will have a tremendous impact on all of southern Delaware County.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, the Cherokee Nation completed road and bridge projects in Cherokee, Delaware, Mayes and Rogers counties. The projects totaled more than $17 million. This year, the Cherokee Nation plans to invest $11.8 million into road and bridge repairs in the following counties:\n\n* Adair County \u2013 Honey Hill Road Phase I\n\n* Cherokee County \u2013 Sequoyah Schools stoplight project and Tenkiller School Road\n\n* Delaware County \u2013 Dry Creek Bridge #71 and Teesquatnee Bridge #53\n\n* Mayes County \u2013 Saline Creek Bridge #67, Saline Creek Bridge #68 and Wickliffe Bridge\n\n\u201cI can honestly say this project would have never happened without the Cherokee Nation,\u201d Commissioner Duncan said. \u201cOur county budgets are very limited, so partnerships with the Cherokee Nation help us stretch every dollar, and we are so grateful.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the Cherokee Nation Roads Program, visit http://www.cherokee.org/Services/Community/Roads.aspx.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \u00a0Cherokee Nation just completed a $9.5 million road project in southern Delaware County, Oklahoma.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/22/cherokee-nation-completes-95-million-road-project-153214", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/bullhollowroad.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Cherokee Nation Completes $9.5 Million Road Project"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-22T14:14-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/22/cherokee-nation-completes-95-million-road-project-153214", "dc": {"title": "Cherokee Nation Completes $9.5 Million Road Project"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Cherokee Nation Completes $9.5 Million Road Project"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3728\"", "article_summary": "The Cherokee Nation just completed a $9.5 million road project in southern Delaware County, Oklahoma.\nThe Bull Hollow Road project was funded under a federal program, so the Cherokee Nation managed this particular project from start to finish.\n\u201cOur county budgets are very limited, so partnerships with the Cherokee Nation help us stretch every dollar, and we are so grateful.\u201dFor more information on the Cherokee Nation Roads Program, visit http://www.cherokee.org/Services/Community/Roads.aspx.\n\u201cI cannot say enough good things about our partnerships with the Cherokee Nation,\u201d said Danny Duncan, Delaware County commissioner for District 3.\n\u201cThe Cherokee Nation maintains these kinds of strategic partnerships to ensure our communities remain safe for our families.\u201dDelaware County Road North 4580, also known as \u201cBull Hollow Road,\u201d suffered from persistent problems."}
