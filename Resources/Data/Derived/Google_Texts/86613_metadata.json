Officials added the feature after discovering that the requirement to establish an account created a traffic bottle neck at the site\u2019s entry point and caused massive delays and glitches.\n\nUnder the new tool, users log on to HealthCare.gov, and after being told that \u201cthis isn\u2019t the application for Marketplace coverage,\u201d enter the type of plan they\u2019re interested in, select their state and county, and one of two age ranges: \u201c49 or under\u201d and \u201c50 or older.\u201d\n\nFollowing several more prompts about benefits, tax credit eligibility, and the different bands of coverage, the tool throws out what it calls an \u201cestimated monthly premium\u201d for the available health care plans. A disclaimer reading, \u201cIMPORTANT NOTE: The prices here don\u2019t reflect the lower costs you may qualify for based on household size and income\u201d is displayed on every page.\n\nThe CBS report sought to portray the tool as purposely deceitful or an effort to mislead users by displaying the lowest possible premiums:\n\nPrices for everyone in the 49 or under group are based on what a 27-year-old would pay. In the 50 or older group, prices are based on what a 50-year-old would pay. We ran the numbers for a 48-year-old in Charlotte, North Carolina, ineligible for subsidies. According to HealthCare.gov, she would pay $230 a month but the actual plan on BlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina\u2019s website costs $360. More than a 50% increase. The difference, Blue Cross Blue Shield requests your birth date before providing more accurate estimates. The numbers for older Americans are even more striking. A 62-year-old in Charlotte looking for the same basic plan would get a price estimate on the government website of $394. The actual price is $634.\n\nWatch it:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that users have a proper, honest, trustworthy online experience when they interact with HealthCare.gov and I think providing accurate prices is an integral component of that,\u201d Crawford quotes Chini Krishnan, whose company designed California\u2019s state-based exchange, as saying, before adding, \u201cindustry executives we talked to literally could not believe the government is providing these estimates which they said were useless and could easily mislead consumers.\u201d Incidentally, Crawford\u2019s own report is misleading, showing an image of the site that reads \u201cYour Monthly Cost,\u201d even though the actual site says \u201cEstimated monthly premium.\u201d\n\nOf course, users can obtain exact costs \u2014 and discover if they\u2019re eligible for subsidies \u2014 if they apply online or by phone and provide their age and income level (those buttons are displayed above the anonymous browsing tool and are far more visible.) In an effort to reduce confusion, the original design of the website required users to enter personal information, though some conservatives argued that that too was a play to prevent users from discovering the unsubsidized cost of coverage.\n\nAnd while one can argue that the anonymous shopping tool should provide price ranges instead of relying on cost estimates derived from the younger ends of both age brackets, it\u2019s hard to believe that the administration would purposely mislead users about the cost of insurance by using a tool that does not take subsidies into account. Users will also discover their actual premiums once they fill out a real application, meaning that any con will be extremely short lived.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "So the Obama administration is purposely showing users cheaper premium estimates on HealthCare.gov so when people actually enroll, they'll be shocked by how expensive their plans are?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "So the Obama administration is purposely showing users cheaper premium estimates on HealthCare.gov so when people actually enroll, they'll be shocked by how expensive their plans are?", "title": "No, CBS News, Obama Isn\u2019t Hiding The True Cost Of Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/10/23/2823581/cbs-news-misleading-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jan-Crawford.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "So the Obama administration is purposely showing users cheaper premium estimates on HealthCare.gov so when people actually enroll, they'll be shocked by how expensive their plans are?", "title": "No, CBS News, Obama Isn\u2019t Hiding The True Cost Of Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jan-Crawford-321x214.png", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jan-Crawford.png", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jan-Crawford.png", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-23T13:15:02+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd03fc\"", "article_summary": "Health No, CBS News, Obama Isn\u2019t Hiding The True Cost Of Obamacare CREDIT:On Wednesday morning, CBS This Morning opened its show with a claim that\u2019s quickly gaining steam among Obamacare critics: the administration isn\u2019t just pedaling furiously to fix the technical problems associated with HealthCare.gov, it\u2019s also misleading people about the true cost of coverage.\nAccording to HealthCare.gov, she would pay $230 a month but the actual plan on BlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina\u2019s website costs $360.\nUsers will also discover their actual premiums once they fill out a real application, meaning that any con will be extremely short lived.\nA 62-year-old in Charlotte looking for the same basic plan would get a price estimate on the government website of $394.\nIn the 50 or older group, prices are based on what a 50-year-old would pay."}
