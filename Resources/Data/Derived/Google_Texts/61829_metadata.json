The chamber is expected to debate a series of amendments to the proposal, but lawmakers are unlikely to alter the proposal with days left before the traditional August recess.\n\nThe measure, which has already been approved by the House, is intended to prevent a bankruptcy in the Department of Transportation\u2019s Highway Trust Fund that agency officials said was likely to occur in August without congressional action.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Senate\u2019s expected passage of the temporary transportation funding extension pauses a fight in Washington that threatened thousands of construction projects across the country in the run up to a critical election.\n\nThe eight-month, $10.9 billion bill is also a source of frustration for transportation advocates, who had sought a longer piece of legislation with a more permanent infrastructure funding source.\n\nThe normal source for funding transportation projects has been the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax. The tax has not been increased since 1993, however, and it has struggled to keep pace with infrastructure expenses as cars have become more fuel efficient.\n\nThe current transportation bill, which is expiring in September, includes about $50 billion per year in infrastructure spending. But the gas tax only brings $34 billion per year at its current rate.\n\nTransportation advocates have pushed lawmakers to increase the gas tax for the first time in two decades to help close the $16 billion shortfall.\n\nHowever, lawmakers and the Obama administration have both been reluctant to ask drivers to pay more for road construction in the middle of an election year.\n\nConservative groups in Washington have pushed Congress to reduce transportation funding to at least the amount of money that is brought in by the gas tax or eliminate it completely.\n\nBut lawmakers have been equally as unwilling to cut back on construction projects in their districts as they have been to raise the gas tax to pay for them.\n\nThe solution has been the temporary extension, which is largely paid for with money from other areas of the federal budget like pension changes and custom fee increases.\n\nAdditionally this week, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee will hold a hearing on Tuesday \u201cto examine opportunities and challenges for improving truck safety on our highways.\u201d\n\nThe committee will also hold a hearing on Wednesday about \u201cdomestic challenges and global competition in aviation manufacturing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "The week ahead: Lawmakers eye highway fund exit ramp", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "The week ahead: Lawmakers eye highway fund exit ramp", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/213459-the-week-ahead-highway-fight-approaches-resolution", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/highway_070314thinkstock.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/213459-the-week-ahead-highway-fight-approaches-resolution", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-28T09:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Highway Trust Fund, Gas Tax, MAP-21 Reauthorization,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-28T09:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/213459-the-week-ahead-highway-fight-approaches-resolution", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "The week ahead: Lawmakers eye highway fund exit ramp"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6d8\"", "article_summary": "The months-long fight over the nation\u2019s transportation funding will likely to come to end this week \u2013 for now.\nThe normal source for funding transportation projects has been the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax.\nTransportation advocates have pushed lawmakers to increase the gas tax for the first time in two decades to help close the $16 billion shortfall.\nBut the gas tax only brings $34 billion per year at its current rate.\nThe Senate is expected to approve a nearly $11 billion bill to prolong federal road and transit spending for eight months this week."}
