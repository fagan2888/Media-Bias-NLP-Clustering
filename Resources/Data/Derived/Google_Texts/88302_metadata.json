(AP) - Almost every day, Carl Pusser can be found at his motorcycle shop, Walkin\u2019 Tall Cycles, working on at least six custom motorcycles. He and his crew of mechanics, friends and locals are looking to finish all the bikes and get ready for the 2014 Rat Hard Great American Blue Collar Build Off.\n\nThe contest features 12 motorcycle builders and 12 car builders from all across the country. The challenge is to build a motorcycle or car made of pieces and scraps found in trash heaps or junk yards in 30 days. In total, the parts must cost $3,000 or less. Pusser was one of the chosen contestants, and after the 30 days he and his crew have to build the bike, Pusser will ride it more than 300 miles from St. Louis to Lebanon, Tenn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one big parade from St. Louis to Tennessee. It\u2019ll be fun,\u201d the tanned and tattooed Pusser said of the event that will commence in August. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s not about competing with others, it\u2019s about having fun and competing with myself.\u201d\n\nTucked in the side of a hill, about two farm-filled miles northwest of Tremont, Pusser\u2019s shop is filled to the brim with motorcycles. Inside, his crew is like a makeshift family: building bikes and sharing pizza from the Casey\u2019s in Tremont.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more into the family thing, not the bad biker thing. I don\u2019t like the bad side of biking. I look rough, I look mean, but I\u2019m nice,\u201d he said before laughing.\n\nPusser, an East Peoria native, is the nephew of the famed Buford Pusser, a sheriff in McNairy County, Tenn., whose one-man war on all things illegal became the basis of two Hollywood movies called \u201cWalking Tall.\u201d The 1973 original, which his nephew greatly prefers, starred Joe Don Baker. The 2004 version, starring Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, dropped the Pusser name but kept a similar plot.\n\nPusser funnels his uncle\u2019s rugged individualism into his bikes instead of fighting crime. \u201cA lot of the times, I have to lock all the doors and keep to myself to get anything done,\u201d he said.\n\nSoon enough, though, Pusser will shed his locked garage solitude and start building his rat bike. When bikers from all around Illinois come to the Peoria Riverfront for the Budweiser Grand Nationals Weekend on Aug. 16, Pusser plans on setting up a miniature shop on the waterfront and building the bike in front of all those in attendance.\n\n\u201cI just want to share the experience with people. It\u2019s supposed to be fun and Grand Nationals is right in the middle of the time I\u2019m supposed to be building, so I\u2019m going to talk to everyone as I build it, make it communal,\u201d Pusser said. \u201cThe ride itself is very much like a community, so it makes sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really surreal to see a convoy of bikes and cars going down the road and hundreds of bikes and cars going to gas stations at once,\u201d Jerry Ripley, co-owner and co-editor of Ride Hard Magazine, said. His magazine and Rat Rod Magazine are putting on the build-off.\n\n\u201cCarl\u2019s going to do great. He says he\u2019s got some surprises, and I believe him,\u201d Ripley said.\n\nPusser doesn\u2019t fret much about the build off itself. He has to finish all the bikes in his shop before his focus shifts to the contest. Still, Pusser is planning the rat bike in his head. The ideas he\u2019s coming up with made him smile, but he\u2019s not ready to share them just yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some interviews of other bikers involved. They\u2019ve been telling people what they\u2019re building and what they\u2019re doing. I want to keep the element of surprise,\u201d Pusser said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to turn some heads, it\u2019s going to be loud and it\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSource: (Peoria) Journal Star, http://bit.ly/1gqo62l\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Journal Star, http://pjstar.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Almost every day, Carl Pusser can be found at his motorcycle shop, Walkin' Tall Cycles, working on at least six custom motorcycles.
