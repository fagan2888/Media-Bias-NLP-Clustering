Anchorage resident Lara Imler is one of them.\n\nDownload Audio\n\nIn 2004, Imler quit her job as an accountant to become a hair stylist. Now she rents space in a small salon in midtown Anchorage. She\u2019s a lot happier cutting hair than she was sitting in front of a computer. But she does miss one big thing about her old job.\n\n\u201cI had health insurance with a pretty big corporate office for about six years and it was wonderful.\u201d\n\nEven without health insurance, Imler spends a lot of time in doctors\u2019 offices. The 37 year old has Hashimoto\u2019s disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid. The treatments and blood work she needs are expensive, but not as expensive as monthly health premiums.\n\n\u201cBeing self employed, getting my premium at anything reasonable, wasn\u2019t happening. I think my last quote was $1200 a month for myself.\u201d\n\nImler was determined to find a better deal on the new Affordable Care Act marketplace. She logged onto healthcare.gov a few days after it went live last month. She tried on and off for the first week but kept running into messages that the site was \u201cunavailable.\u201d So she decided to wait a few weeks. On October 24th, she logged back in and slowly started making her way through the process.\n\n\u201cSo you get to a point where you finally get to pick what health insurance you want and all the buttons have to be double clicked. If you don\u2019t know that or try that it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. It just sits there.\u201d\n\nImler has a degree in computer programming. She\u2019s even built a few Websites. She thinks that experience, helped her persevere through the trouble spots on healthcare.gov. About two hours after she started, she landed on a screen that told her she had successfully enrolled. She was pleasantly surprised by the price. Imler qualified for subsidies, and chose a mid-level plan that will cost her $110 a month.\n\n\u201cThe website sucks, I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s awful, it\u2019s cumbersome, it\u2019s a lot of work\u2026 but the idea that I might be able to afford health insurance, is huge to me.\u201d\n\nImler is still waiting for enrollment confirmation from her new insurance company. She\u2019s optimistic that will come soon. If it doesn\u2019t, she\u2019s willing to log back in to healthcare.gov to keep trying.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "Despite the extensive problems with healthcare.gov, a few dozen Alaskans have managed to enroll in a health plan on the marketplace.
