Because UV radiation can trigger our cells\u2019 DNA to mutate, possibly out of control \u2014 as with cancer \u2014 the body has developed a series of preemptive defense mechanisms to protect itself.\n\nIt\u2019s these defensive maneuvers that are really causing our skin to tan or burn, not the sun or UV radiation itself. Much like how a fever is our body\u2019s attempt to drive away foreign invaders rather than being directly caused by the latest common cold virus.\n\nSo put on the sunscreen, watch the video, and learn some more interesting factoids about why and how sunburns and tans happen.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "just, why, do, we, get, sunburns, anyhow", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Just why does our skin tan or burn when we head out to the beach?", "title": "The Science Behind Getting And Avoiding A Nasty Sunburn [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/just-why-do-we-get-sunburns-anyhow-345766", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/08/02/just-why-do-we-get-sunburns-anyhow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just why does our skin tan or burn when we head out to the beach?", "title": "The Science Behind Getting And Avoiding A Nasty Sunburn [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/just-why-do-we-get-sunburns-anyhow-345766", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/08/02/just-why-do-we-get-sunburns-anyhow.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/02/just-why-do-we-get-sunburns-anyhow.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-02T23:07:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-02T23:10:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Just why does our skin tan or burn when we head out to the beach?"}, "article_summary": "So put on the sunscreen, watch the video, and learn some more interesting factoids about why and how sunburns and tans happen.\nBut thanks to this Youtube segment by the popular SciShow, we no longer have to be in the dark about sunburns and tans.\nIt\u2019s these defensive maneuvers that are really causing our skin to tan or burn, not the sun or UV radiation itself.\nWith beach season in full swing, the reminders to wear your sunscreen when you head outside are ever-constant, and for good reason.\nBecause UV radiation can trigger our cells\u2019 DNA to mutate, possibly out of control \u2014 as with cancer \u2014 the body has developed a series of preemptive defense mechanisms to protect itself."}
