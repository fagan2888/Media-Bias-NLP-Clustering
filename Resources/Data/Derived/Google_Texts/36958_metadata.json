This also means that whatever profits the company earns will go back into its health plans, with the goal of lowering cost, according to its website.\n\nCo-ops are a small but growing segment of insurance providers in the United States. Maine Community Health Options and Healthy CT in Connecticut are the two other co-ops in New England, and there are 23 co-ops nationwide. All are being funded with nearly $2 billion of federal money, part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis is a vastly different model than the one currently provided by Anthem, a much larger insurance company and the only one currently in New Hampshire.\n\nMinuteman\u2019s expansion signals that Anthem\u2019s monopoly in New Hampshire\u2019s insurance market will end next year. That\u2019s welcome news to many consumers and hospitals across the state.\n\n\u201cMost people consider it a good thing,\u201d said Tyler J. Brannen, health policy analyst for the N.H. Insurance Department. \u201cI think that\u2019s particularly true given the situation in the market.\u201d\n\nAsked to describe the current condition of New Hampshire\u2019s market, Brannen said, \u201cExpensive.\u201d\n\nThe narrow network of hospitals and doctors provided by Anthem Blue Cross has already caused frustration for consumers and providers.\n\nMinuteman CEO Tom D. Policelli said the current monopoly is the reason his company decided to expand into New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cThe New Hampshire market is dominated by one carrier,\u201d Policelli said. \u201cWe saw the market need as very large.\u201d\n\nTwo more companies in the market will mean more coverage for more areas, and more price competition, according to Brannen.\n\nHe also said he anticipated the move will lower prices for New Hampshire consumers.\n\nBrannen said he believes Minuteman could meet Anthem\u2019s prices. However, the company has not yet released information on prices for its plans in Massachusetts, because its rates are currently awaiting approval from the Massachusetts Division of Insurance.\n\nBut the provider has signed up 26 hospitals and about 7,500 physicians in Massachusetts so far.\n\nAnthem said earlier this year it will not participate with 12 New Hampshire hospitals in the state, and this has left coverage gaps. Many hospitals have been left grumbling about the changes; Frisbie Memorial Hospital in Rochester has even sued Anthem over its exclusion.\n\nCheshire Medical Center/Dartmouth-Hitchcock Keene does participate with Anthem, but Monadnock Community Hospital in Peterborough has been left out.\n\nIn an email statement, Monadnock Community Hospital CFO Richard Scheinblum said his hospital welcomes Minuteman and Harvard Pilgrim\u2019s announcements.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that increased competition in the insurance marketplace will mean increased access for people in our primary service area to receive care locally,\u201d Scheinblum said.\n\nScheinblum said the main issue with being excluded from Anthem\u2019s network is the disruption for patients who have established their doctors at Monadnock.\n\n\u201cSome of our patients will no longer be able to receive care from physicians they have seen for years and developed strong relationships with,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully this will change in 2015.\u201d\n\nPolicelli said Minuteman\u2019s goal is to offer coverage statewide.\n\n\u201cThe real problem in New Hampshire is having affordable access to care everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cAnthem is being very narrow. It\u2019s puzzling.\u201d\n\nPolicelli specifically mentioned the lack of Anthem coverage in the North Country, where hospitals in Littleton, Berlin and Colebrook have been excluded.\n\n\u201cThe north is empty right now,\u201d Policelli said.\n\nAnthem spokesman Christopher Dugan did not address the entry of the new providers into the N.H. marketplace, but said in an email that his company\u2019s focus was serving their customers and the market in 2014.\n\n\u201cAs the state\u2019s longest standing carrier and the only health insurer who has chosen to participate in the exchange, we have a unique responsibility to those we serve and new members who may choose us for coverage in 2014,\u201d Dugan wrote.\n\nPolicelli said his company has received plenty of communication from New Hampshire hospitals, encouraging Minuteman to enter the marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe got letters of support from over half the hospitals,\u201d he said. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve had some phone calls from others. People are calling us.\u201d\n\nBrannen said he thinks Minuteman has a leg up on the New Hampshire market.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve got some people involved \u2026 in New Hampshire,\u201d he said. \u201cAll things considered, they\u2019re in a much better place than another company.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SentinelSource.com", "description": "\u201cJoin the Revolution.\u201d", "title": "Minuteman, Harvard Pilgrim plan to enter NH insurance marketplace", "url": "http://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/minuteman-harvard-pilgrim-plan-to-enter-nh-insurance-marketplace/article_420e2a31-6598-5f50-9937-c8cbccab8f7f.html", "image": "http://sentinelsource.com/app/SSlogo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sentinelsource", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "\u201cJoin the Revolution.\u201d", "fb": {"app_id": 195134749461}, "keywords": "local,top_story", "google-site-verification": "oOCA50_TAAjdvXwxVnDnOs5yS_kZUqHI6u4prlFHnH4", "news_keywords": "local,top_story"}, "article_summary": "\u201cJoin the Revolution.\u201dThat\u2019s the slogan for Minuteman Health, a Massachusetts-based insurance provider that recently announced it will enter the New Hampshire marketplace in 2015.\nPolicelli said his company has received plenty of communication from New Hampshire hospitals, encouraging Minuteman to enter the marketplace.\nMinuteman\u2019s expansion signals that Anthem\u2019s monopoly in New Hampshire\u2019s insurance market will end next year.\nHarvard Pilgrim Healthcare of Massachusetts will also enter the same year, after its application to enter the exchange is approved, according to state insurance officials.\nPeople are calling us.\u201dBrannen said he thinks Minuteman has a leg up on the New Hampshire market."}
