I think the initial place that the administration announced didn\u2019t strike the right balance between religious liberty and the rights of women.\u201d\n\nThis admission is particularly fascinating, considering that DuBois was the head of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships at the time. While he advocated hard on the side of religious liberty, he described the ensuing internal debate as frustrating and a \u201ctough moment\u201d to be working for the administration.\n\n\u201cI very quickly started demonizing my opponents \u2014 questioning their motivations rather than seeing them as people who (God loves),\u201d he told TheBlaze. \u201cI really had to grow and learn to disagree without being disagreeable.\u201d\n\nEventually, he said, the administration came to a stance that he believes balances women\u2019s health and religious liberty concerns. But it wasn\u2019t an easy road getting there, DuBois said. Being an employee, a friend and a confidant of Obama\u2019s certainly complicated that dynamic.\n\nThe Book\u2019s Central Themes\n\nWhile some of the personal stories that precede each month\u2019s devotions contain content that some might see as partisan or at least favorable to the president, the 365 Christian entries widely ignore political themes and are relatable to any Bible-believing Christian.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy getting to that point.\n\nDuBois had to sift through the 1,500 daily entries he has emailed to the president over the past few years to find elements that would be relatable and beneficial to all readers.\n\n\u201cThere were three basic things that I tried to underscore in the devotional \u2014 grounding (Obama) in the knowledge of God\u2019s love for us. There\u2019s something about us knowing this God has a tangible and meaningful love for every individual,\u201d DuBois told TheBlaze, going on to say that this helps make life\u2019s many challenges more manageable.\n\nIn addition to including the president devotionals that highlight God\u2019s compassion, DuBois said he also wanted to instill advice about how to love others \u2014 especially one\u2019s enemies. That\u2019s especially relevant considering his own battle over the contraceptive mandate and the general struggles people have with confronting ideological opponents.\n\n\u201cThird was courage and boldness,\u201d he added. \u201cThinking through what messages that would encourage the president to step out there and do big things (and) realize God will reward his courage. That\u2019s something that aligns for other people as well.\u201d\n\nAnd Obama agrees. DuBois said \u201cThe President\u2019s Devotional\u201d has Obama\u2019s seal of approval.\n\n\u201cHe thought it was a great idea. He thought if (the devotions) were useful to him, they might be useful to other people as well,\u201d he said.\n\nObama\u2019s Faith\n\nDuBois is well aware of the fact that some question the president\u2019s faith, but he doesn\u2019t believe the critiques are warranted and he responded to those who regularly wage them. Mainly, he argued that people who do not know the president personally cannot truly know what is in his heart.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a practical response and a spiritual one. I actually do think that President Obama has talked about his faith a fair amount,\u201d DuBois said. \u201cI believe in Romans 10:9 \u2026 I happen to know the president personally and know his heart and know he\u2019s a believer. Outside of that I\u2019d have no ability to speak about what\u2019s in his heart.\u201d\n\nThat scripture reads: \u201cIf you declare with your mouth, \u2018Jesus is Lord,\u2019 and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nFeatured image source/credit: @JosuhaDuBois on Twitter/Getty", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Joshua DuBois, author of \"The President\u2019s Devotional,\" is a close confidant of President Barack Obama and a former White House staffer, but that doesn't mean he agrees with all of the administration's plans and proposals.
