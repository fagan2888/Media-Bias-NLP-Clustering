Most of that has been funneled through the AFL-CIO Workers\u2019 Voices PAC. Members are working to drive turnout through traditional ground-game efforts like phone banks, door knocks and leafleting. As a result, Trumka said, voters were beginning to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d between Republican policies and the flat wages and slashed pensions that have buffeted middle-class union members.\n\n\u201cThe momentum is starting to build,\u201d Trumka said.\n\nReturning from a tour of battleground states, Trumka said he saw candidate after candidate on the Republican side running against the policies of President Barack Obama, rather than enumerating specific policies of their own. If Republicans seize the Senate, Trumka said, it would result in stalled executive appointments, judicial vacancies and a fresh round of doomed efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of urgency,\u201d he added.\n\nAt least there should be. Unions\u2019 power has been curbed in recent years by a broad campaign to restrict collective bargaining and impose right-to-work legislation. The effort to enact comprehensive immigration reform, one of the labor movement\u2019s top priorities, has been stalled since the summer of 2013; Obama\u2019s decision to punt on the issue until after the midterms incensed labor leaders and has the potential to trim turnout. Looking ahead, many labor leaders aren\u2019t particularly enthused about the potential presidential candidacy of Hillary Clinton, with concerns that the former New York senator is too close to Wall Street spurring a push for a populist candidate like Elizabeth Warren.\n\nTrumka said he saw positive momentum for pro-labor candidates like Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic Senate candidate in Kentucky. But he was circumspect about his predictions for November. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an interesting election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have our work cut out for us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Richard Trumka says 2014 momentum is finally starting to build for the labor movement", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Richard Trumka says 2014 momentum is finally starting to build for the labor movement", "title": "Union Chief Frets Foreign Policy and Ebola Are Distracting Voters from the Economy", "url": "http://time.com/3478674/unions-isis-ebola-2014/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ap120620990232.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ap120620990232.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Richard Trumka says 2014 momentum is finally starting to build for the labor movement", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Union Chief Frets Foreign Policy and Ebola Are Distracting Voters from the Economy"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "isis, ebola, unions, 2014, midterm elections", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ISIS, Ebola, unions, 2014, midterm elections"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e6f\"", "article_summary": "Most of that has been funneled through the AFL-CIO Workers\u2019 Voices PAC.\nTrumka said he saw positive momentum for pro-labor candidates like Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic Senate candidate in Kentucky.\nIf Republicans seize the Senate, Trumka said, it would result in stalled executive appointments, judicial vacancies and a fresh round of doomed efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cIt took more effort this time to break through,\u201d Trumka told reporters at the labor giant\u2019s headquarters in Washington.\nRichard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, said global events such as tumult in the Middle East and the Ebola virus scare had diverted workers\u2019 attention from the economic issues that form the cornerstone of the movement\u2019s message."}
