The service, which allows physicians to offer specific services at a stated price in a bid process, claims to reduce healthcare costs using free-market principles of competition and transparency in healthcare.\n\nThe service is attractive especially to the uninsured, holders of high-deductible health plans or enrollees in faith-based healthcare risk programs, who don\u2019t have a third party payer dictating early-dollar provider choice and are true free-market healthcare consumers.\n\nThis Kaiser Health News article chronicles the state of online competitive consumer healthcare pricing, \u201ca phenomenon that is in part being spawned by the absurd, nonsensical and inexplicably unfathomable pricing of American health care,\u201d and includes the critical point of view that there is no provision that guarantees the quality or safety of the providers offering their services through Medibid.\n\n\u2014Dr. Jim Palermo, Editor-in-Chief\n\nKAISER HEALTH NEWS \u2014 Francisco Velazco couldn\u2019t wait any longer. For several years, the 35-year-old Seattle handyman had searched for an orthopedic surgeon who would reconstruct the torn ligament in his knee for a price he could afford.\n\nOut of work because of the pain and unable to scrape together $15,000 \u2013 the cheapest option he could find in Seattle \u2013 Velazco turned to an unconventional and controversial option: an online medical auction site called Medibid, which largely operates outside the confines of traditional health insurance.\n\nThe four-year-old online service links patients seeking non-emergency care with doctors and facilities that offer it, much the way Priceline unites travelers and hotels. Vetting doctors is left to prospective patients: Medibid does not verify credentials but requires doctors to submit their medical license number for patients to check.\n\nVelazco paid $25 to post his request for knee surgery. A few days later, he had bids for the outpatient procedure from surgeons in New York, California and Virginia, including details about their expertise.\n\nAfter accepting the lowest bid \u2014 $7,500, a fee that covered anesthesia and related costs \u2014 he learned that his surgeon would be William T. Grant, a Charlottesville orthopedist.\n\nA few weeks later, after several online discussions with Grant, Velazco arrived in Charlottesville, where he had rented a $50-a-night room and would spend two weeks recuperating. On Dec. 4, 2013, he underwent knee surgery, performed in an outpatient surgery center that Grant co-owns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m back working four days per week and climbing ladders,\u201d Velazco said recently. \u201cI\u2019m doing great.\u201d\n\nTo Medibid founder Ralph Weber, a benefits consultant who said he left his native Canada for the United States in 2005 to escape \u201csocialized health care,\u201d using the Internet to arrange non-emergency medical care is long overdue.\n\nAmericans, he says, are increasingly going online to book travel and even find a mate. Medibid enables them to strip away the opacity that surrounds health-care pricing, Weber maintains, where charges vary wildly even in the same market and can be nearly impossible for consumers to obtain.\n\n\u201cWe introduce transparency and also competition,\u201d said Weber, whose company is based in Murfreesboro, Tenn.\n\n\u201cWe are a disruptive innovation, a free-market alternative to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nWeber said that about 120,000 consumers \u2014 Medibid calls them \u201cseekers\u201d \u2014 have used the service. Many are uninsured, holders of high-deductible plans or enrollees infaith-based plans, which have grown as a conservative alternative to the Affordable Care Act. Seekers are charged $25 for each request or about $60 for an unlimited number of requests per year.\n\nRoughly 6,000 doctors or surgery centers and a handful of hospitals, most seeking patients from abroad, have registered as \u201cbidders\u201d; physicians pay a fee ranging from $50 to bid on one request to $250 to bid on many.\n\nOnce a bid is accepted, Medibid bows out, and patients work out arrangements with the doctor. Many bids are a package deal, covering the facility fee, the surgeon\u2019s charge and anesthesia services. Patients pay the bidder in full, upfront and in cash or by credit card.\n\nBut critics, who agree hospitals\u2019 prices are too often inflated, arbitrary and opaque, express concerns about Medibid.\n\nThey say the service provides little in the way of quality indicators for prospective patients, something hospitals convey by granting a doctor privileges and insurers do by accepting doctors on a plan\u2019s roster. Surgery or procedures such as colonoscopies are typically performed in physician-owned outpatient centers, which are more lightly regulated than hospitals and have fewer safeguards for patients.\n\nUnlike hospitals, which are required to track infections, outpatient surgery centers are usually exempt from such reporting requirements. And complications are rarely covered under the terms of Medibid.\n\nMedibid \u201cis a phenomenon that is in part being spawned by the absurd, nonsensical and inexplicably unfathomable pricing of American health care,\u201d said Arthur L. Caplan, head of the division of bioethics at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York. \u201cCheap sounds good, but in these auctions you\u2019re not getting any information: Was the guy at the bottom of his class in medical school?\u201d \u201cIn the current world you buy the name \u2014 the institutional reputation of a doctor or hospital. Insurance companies or hospitals drop people who have high complication rates or costs due to errors, \u201d he added. \u201cMedical care is not like buying a watch on the street or a hotel room online. The stakes are much, much higher.\u201d Marty Makary, an associate professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital and the author of \u201cUnaccountable,\u201d a 2012 book about hospital quality, agrees. \u201cI have concerns about the lack of good metrics of quality,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you know what you\u2019re getting?\u201d Weber says that consumers are competent to make such decisions without relying on a provider directory or the imprimatur of a hospital. \u201cIs there anything that says the Internet is any worse than a Blue Cross directory?\u201d he asked. \u201cOnce they choose a physician, we will send them the license number, and there are a bunch of third-party sites\u201d that patients can use to check out a doctor. If a patient is dissatisfied with a doctor after accepting a bid but before surgery, Medibid will repost the query free of charge. \u2018Free-Market\u2019 Care Oklahoma City anesthesiologist G. Keith Smith, co-owner of the Surgery Center of Oklahoma, was one of the first to sign up with Medibid, which dovetails with his \u201cfree-market\u201d philosophy. \u201cWe\u2019ve been quoting prices for 17 years\u201d to prospective patients, Smith said, \u201cand posting them online for five.\u201d About 125 of the center\u2019s patients have come through Medibid, for procedures including hernia repair, gallbladder removal and knee replacement. Although cost may be the initial lure, once prospective patients \u201clook at our Web site and see it\u2019s a beautiful, new, 40,000-square-foot facility, they\u2019re sold,\u201d he said. So far, no patient has had a complication serious enough to require a transfer to a hospital. But, Smith adds, \u201cIf someone pays $3,000 for a hernia [repair] and goes home and develops a wound infection that costs them another $3,000, they\u2019re still ahead.\u201d Prices vary considerably, but the cost of a hernia repair averages about $7,900 or $9,700, depending on whether it is performed conventionally or laparoscopically, according to New Choice Health, a Florida-based company with a Web site that compares hospital charges. Some hospitals charge as much as $23,000. Jeffrey M. Gallups, founder of one of the largest ear, nose and throat practices in the Southeast, said he recently signed up with Medibid because he believes the health-care law will make consumers more cost-conscious as a result of rising deductibles. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that non-emergency medical care will be like any other commodity,\u201d said Gallups, whose practice has 16 offices in the Atlanta area and two \u2014 soon to be three \u2014 surgery centers. \u201cWe\u2019re perfect for Medibid because we control the whole thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have pathologists, anesthesiologists and surgeons.\u201d His profit margin on Medibid cases \u2014 he has done only two surgeries so far but hopes to do more \u2014 is adequate, possibly \u201cas little as 10 percent.\u201d \u201cWe can do a $20,000 surgery for $6,000,\u201d Gallups said. Why the price difference? \u201cGreed,\u201d he replied. \u201cHospitals are making a killing.\u201d Hospital profit margins average about 5.5 percent, according to 2012 statistics released by the American Hospital Association. Richard Gundling, vice president of the Healthcare Financial Management Association, whose members include financial executives from hospitals, disputed Gallups\u2019 contention. \u201cHospitals provide a community benefit and are responsible for cases that can\u2019t go to surgery centers,\u201d he said. \u201cHospitals are providing things like shock-trauma units and emergency care services that have to be covered 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\u201d Peter LePort, a surgeon in Orange County, Calif., recently performed hernia surgery on a Medibid patient for $2,500. \u201cNot billing insurance cuts out a huge amount of the cost,\u201d LePort said. \u201cI can literally make the same amount of money.\u201d Of the $2,500 fee, which the patient charged to his credit card, LePort estimates that $1,200 to $1,400 went to the surgery center of which he is an owner, $400 to the anesthesiologist, while the remaining $600 to $800 was his surgical fee. NYU\u2019s Caplan says he worries about the lack of oversight in free-standing surgery centers. \u201cWho is the peer review?\u201d Caplan asked. \u201cThere is none. And it doesn\u2019t take a lot of qualifications to open one.\u201d For Bill Lang, an engineer in Gainesville, Fla., who has a $2,500 annual deductible through a Blue Cross plan, using Medibid proved to be a boon. Lang, 66, needed minor sinus surgery after an earlier procedure failed. His ENT told him the procedure would cost $3,000 and would be performed in a surgery center under anesthesia. Lang thought both the charge and the anesthetic were excessive and decided to try Medibid. A few days after his request was posted, he received several bids and chose the lowest \u2014 an ENT in Tampa, a two-hour drive away. The doctor agreed to perform the operation in his office for $362 using a local anesthetic. \u201cThe man was well-qualified, and I\u2019d seen videos of this procedure on YouTube,\u201d Lang said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s a low-risk procedure.\u201d Had he opted for the first choice, he said, he would have owed $2,600 out of pocket \u2014 his $2,500 deductible plus 20 percent of the remainder. Far From Home Francisco Velazco said his family thought he was crazy when he told them he planned to have major knee surgery 3,000 miles from home in Virginia, a place he\u2019d never visited and where he knew no one. His mother, he said, begged him not to go and insisted they could borrow money for surgery in Seattle. But Velazco said he felt confident in the online approach; he sold his car to raise money and received help from relatives and an employer to pay Grant\u2019s $7,500 fee and the additional $1,000 he spent on airfare, a bus ticket, lodging and other expenses. Velazco flew from Seattle to Durham, N.C., where a cousin lives, and then took a six-hour bus ride to Charlottesville. A day or two before surgery he met Grant and underwent a pre-op physical. The Charlottesville retiree from whom he rented a room via Airbnb, turned out to be a godsend: He drove Velazco to medical appointments and cooked him breakfast during the two weeks he recuperated. Grant visited Velazco twice while he was recovering and helped arrange physical therapy. \u201cThis was my first Medibid case,\u201d the surgeon said, \u201cand I was certainly invested in wanting this to be a positive experience for everybody.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
