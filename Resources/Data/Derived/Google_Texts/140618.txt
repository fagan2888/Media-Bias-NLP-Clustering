After two years planning and preparing, Logan County health officials learned last week the community has qualified for a federally-supported community health center.

And along with the designation, Community Health and Wellness Partners of Logan County will receive $1.4 million in funds made available by the Affordable Care Act over the next 28 months with $873,000 coming in the first year, the organization’s CEO Tara Wagner said.

“We could not be more pleased to see the hard work of all parties involved paying off,” Ms. Wagner said. “This is a huge boost for our community and an opportunity to build on the strong foundation that Mary Rutan Hospital has established by their investment in Mad River Family Practice.”

Local health officials began exploring the option of a community health center in September 2011 after Mad River Family Practice lost funding through The Ohio State University’s Rural Family Medicine Residency Program. The $80,000 grant they were awarded then funded a recent community-wide survey to demonstrate the need for health services.

Community Health and Wellness Partners was established in April 2012 to oversee the original grant and the needs assessment survey, and eventually apply for the grant to operate the health center.

Ms. Wagner said the organization is still in the planning stages of determining how the money will be used. She noted that details such as the location and scope of services offered by the health center have not yet been ironed out.

U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who announced the funding award, said community health centers will help local residents have better access to medical services.
