Her 20-minute short film, \u201cObvious Child,\u201d starred \u201cSNL\u201d alumna Jenny Slate as a 20-something woman who chooses to get an abortion.\n\nThey put it together quickly \u2014 shooting for just four days in Williamsburg, Brooklyn \u2014 but the short was an immediate viral sensation. Five years, one successful Kickstarter campaign, and several rounds of funding later, Robespierre and Slate have expanded the short to a full-length feature film with an all-star cast that includes \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d writer Gabe Liedman, comedian David Cross and actors Richard Kind and Gaby Hoffmann.\n\n\u201cIt was my frustration about the portrayal of real women going through real problems and unplanned pregnancy is one of them,\u201d Robespierre told Salon at Sundance, where the movie first premiered. \u201cThere was a slew of movies in 2007 which I enjoyed, but they all dealt with unplanned pregnancy with having the baby at the end. And it wasn\u2019t the story that rang true to me or people that I knew.\u201d\n\nIn the film, Donna (Slate) is a stand-up comic whose life is falling apart during a break-up. She\u2019s facing unemployment and dutifully shuffling between the houses of her divorced parents while hiding the fact that she\u2019s going to have an abortion. She deals with the chaos through stand-up, which is both her emotional release and the way she connects with those around her. Though abortion is a sensitive and often-times political subject, \u201cObvious Child\u201d hits the perfect tone, delivering an honest, real, and raw comedy about the realities of what happens when a woman gets pregnant but decides she\u2019s not ready to be a parent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gillian Robespierre's directorial debut stars the \"SNL\" alumna, Gabe Liedman, David Cross and Richard Kind", "author": "Prachi Gupta", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Gillian Robespierre's directorial debut stars the \"SNL\" alumna, Gabe Liedman, David Cross and Richard Kind", "title": "Jenny Slate brings humor to \u201cObvious Child,\u201d an honest rom-com about abortion", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/19/jenny_slate_brings_humor_to_obvious_child_an_honest_rom_com_about_abortion/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/000037.2771.ObviousChild_still3_JennySlate__byChrisTeague_2013-11-26_03-01-51PM-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gillian Robespierre's directorial debut stars the \"SNL\" alumna, Gabe Liedman, David Cross and Richard Kind", "creator": "@prachigu", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/000037.2771.ObviousChild_still3_JennySlate__byChrisTeague_2013-11-26_03-01-51PM-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Jenny Slate brings humor to \u201cObvious Child,\u201d an honest rom-com about abortion", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Jenny Slate brings humor to \u201cObvious Child,\u201d an honest rom-com about abortion", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, Film, gabe liedman, gillian robespierre, jenny slate, Juno, knocked up, sundance 2014, unplanned pregnancy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b03\"", "article_summary": "Her 20-minute short film, \u201cObvious Child,\u201d starred \u201cSNL\u201d alumna Jenny Slate as a 20-something woman who chooses to get an abortion.\n\u201cThere was a slew of movies in 2007 which I enjoyed, but they all dealt with unplanned pregnancy with having the baby at the end.\n\u201cIt was my frustration about the portrayal of real women going through real problems and unplanned pregnancy is one of them,\u201d Robespierre told Salon at Sundance, where the movie first premiered.\nShe\u2019s facing unemployment and dutifully shuffling between the houses of her divorced parents while hiding the fact that she\u2019s going to have an abortion.\nThey put it together quickly \u2014 shooting for just four days in Williamsburg, Brooklyn \u2014 but the short was an immediate viral sensation."}
