So the White House touted Dec.15 enrollment deadline to have coverage kick in on Jan. 1, may be misleading, says Yevgeniy Feyman, scholar at the Manhattan Institute.\n\nAmericans across the country have been struggling to enroll in health-care plans on the glitch-plagued Healthcare.gov federal insurance marketplace and state exchanges, making it more difficult to get to the step of paying for coverage.\n\n\u201cWe do know that individuals who want to have coverage enacted by Jan. 1, 2014 have to have paid their premiums by Dec. 15,\u201d Feyman says. \u201cIf you have not paid that premium [by that deadline], that means that starting Jan. 1, you don\u2019t actually have coverage. You are not enrolled in an insurance plan until you have made your first premium payment or signed a contract with the insurance company.\u201d\n\nUpon completing a plan selection on the site, Feyman says the exchange will communicate to the user the subsidy eligibility to insurers, via an 834 form. The insurer is then responsible for sending out the bill. Another scenario, depending on the insurance company, would be the exchange site directing a policyholder to the insurance provider\u2019s site to make a payment there.\n\nIn certain states like California, for example, where exchanges are being run by the state itself, payments can be directly made on the exchange.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services announced last week that from Oct. 1-Nov. 2, 106,185 Americans had selected insurance plans across the country\u2014but the department didn\u2019t clarify if the monthly premiums had been made. It is standard operating procedure in the insurance industry to only count clients who have paid the premium as new enrollees.\n\nHHS has hinged on the Dec. 15 date to have a better grasp of how many people have enrolled as payments would have to be made on this date to have coverage kick in for the New Year.\n\nLarry Kocot, visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution, says that enrolling on the federal exchange with an actual payment was never the plan.\n\n\u201cIf someone registers by the 15 of December, the process was supposed to happen within a few days that the enrollment form was sent to insurers and they would then bill the policy holder,\u201d he says.\n\nFeyman cautions that much of enrollment hinges on both the government and insurance companies working efficiently, so consumers who need coverage immediately on Jan. 1 should take matters into their own hands and sign up as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI would contact the insurance company [after selecting a plan] and get it in writing,\u201d he says.\n\nIf not, it\u2019s very rare that a consumer\u2019s insurance would be backdated if he or she had to use a plan to visit a doctor before actually making a monthly premium payment. \u201cInsurance companies do not cover things that happen to you before you are covered.\u201d\n\nThe only way enrollment would be retroactive, Kocot says, is if the fault fell on either the government or insurance company for the lack of coverage.\n\n\u201cIf you had done what you needed to do, and enrolled by the 15 and the insurance company didn\u2019t resolve payment and billing with the exchange, and you don\u2019t get your premium bill until Jan. 15, a possibility does exist that you could be backdated,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX
