Brent rose 6 percent in the first quarter of this year, its first such increase since a 15 percent rally in the second quarter of 2015. U.S. crude fell $1.43 to $36.91 a barrel. Prices rose almost 4 percent over January-March, also the first quarterly gain since surging nearly 25 percent in the second quarter of last year. U.S. employment increased solidly in March and wages rebounded, signs of economic resilience that could allow a cautious Federal Reserve to raise interest rates gradually this year. \"I think (the payrolls report) is probably what\u2019s sent us over the edge in oil,\" CMC markets analyst Jasper Lawler said. A Reuters monthly survey showed this week that OPEC output rose in March on higher supply from Iran after the lifting of sanctions and near-record exports from southern Iraq. Oil prices fell despite China's official Purchasing Managers' Index showing an unexpected expansion in March, the first in nine months. Putting a floor under prices in earlier trade was a drop in U.S. crude output, falling for a fourth straight month in January to the lowest since October 2014.
