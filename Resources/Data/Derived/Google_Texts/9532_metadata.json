But health care leaders have spoken out in favor of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nModern Healthcare surveyed a \"CEO Power Panel\" of executives from \"hospitals, insurance companies, physician groups, trade associations and other not-for-profit advocacy groups\" and found more than two-thirds of CEOs oppose repealing the ACA.\n\nSEE ALSO: President Obama announces historic deal with Vietnam\n\nOnly 2 percent of that group wanted to remove the ACA, and the rest who weighed in said they'd need more details before deciding one way or the other.\n\nBut the switch to the ACA was enough change for that group. Only 9 percent were in favor of creating a single-payer plan funded by the government.\n\nSome seem to think the U.S. just isn't ready. The CEO of the Cedars-Sinai health system said a single-payer system \"will only be politically feasible once it is sufficiently socially acceptable. Americans still place a very high value on choice.\"\n\nSee some of the protests of Obamacare:\n\n\n\nStudy shows health care CEOs overwhelmingly support Obamacare WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 04: Ryan Burrows, right, protests with others that are not in support of the portions of the Affordable Care Act on which the Supreme Court of the United States was hearing arguments on Wednesday March 04, 2015 in Washington, DC.

The US Supreme Court heard a second challenge to US President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. The US Supreme Court faces a momentous case Wednesday on the sweeping health insurance reform law that President Barack Obama wants to leave as part of his legacy. The question before the court is whether the seven million people or more who subscribed via the government's website can obtain tax subsidies that make the coverage affordable. A ruling is expected in June.
