She nods reassuringly, consulting charts on the tablet in her lap. She reaches for a bottle of prescription medicine.\n\n\u201cI want you to take these with plenty of fluids,\u201d she says with a smile.\n\n\u201cCut!\u201d\n\nThe director stopped the scene. The doctor was an actor, her stethoscope was fake, the tablet was plastic, the pill bottle empty.\n\nBut on camera, it was a 15-second snippet of ordinary life \u2014 the makings of a perfect clip of stock footage, a key building block for the \u201creal people\u201d-filled campaign ads that are so popular these days.\n\nThere is a burgeoning industry devoted to filming these clips, staged and framed to capture scenes so cheerily generic that they could work for a variety of advertisers \u2014 Republican, Democratic, issue advocacy or otherwise \u2014 who download the footage from the Internet and slip them into the commercials they are able to assemble more cheaply than ever.\n\nA few weeks from now, this \u201cdoctor\u201d with the fake stethoscope might be on your TV, a mute scene enhanced by a voice-over booming on about the Affordable Care Act, retirement or Medicaid. Two seconds later, the ad might jump to a scene in an urban classroom.\n\nThen maybe a bakery. A field of wheat. A biracial couple in front of their first house. A parade of waving American flags.\n\nWhatever the image a campaign wants to evoke, someone in the thriving 15-second-clip field has probably already filmed it, with more on the way as the 2016 election cycle heats up.\n\nFilming in his Washington, D.C., condo earlier this month, director Mark Kokkoros asked the \u201cdoctor,\u201d part-time actor Cheryl Scungio, to trade her stethoscope for a dark-gray blazer. The pill bottle and blood pressure cup on the table were replaced by a tea set and a black binder \u2014 and voil\u00e0, Scungio was suddenly a financial adviser.\n\n\u201cAction!\u201d\n\nShortcuts\n\nKokkoros has been shooting stock footage for a living since 2009, the year industry observers say the demand for generic imagery really took off. Photo agencies such as Getty Images and start-ups such as Shutterstock and Pond 5 compile millions of photos and videos and make them available for purchase.\n\nThese web-based archives have become an indispensable shortcut for creative directors, who previously had to spend countless hours and money developing their own libraries of footage.\n\nRepublican advertising consultant Fred Davis, best known for his work with Arizona Sen. John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign, pretty much has given up shooting any kinds of scenes he can just as easily buy online.\n\n\u201cSay you wanted a farmer in Montana,\u201d Davis said. With stock footage, \u201cthat might cost you $500. Actually going to Montana, which would only be an incremental improvement, might cost $5,000. It became a completely 100 percent economic issue.\u201d\n\nBut while stock footage is cheap and easy \u2014 some clips start as low as $19 \u2014 its ubiquity and staginess can also set up campaigns for mockery.\n\nIn September, the Jeb Bush-supporting super PAC Right to Rise USA released an advertisement portraying Bush as the antithesis to Donald Trump. It began with clips of a snarling, combative Trump, before switching to Bush promising that \u201cmy message will be an optimistic one,\u201d over images of American flags fluttering, the Statue of Liberty standing proudly, and the sun rising over a beautiful field ... that turned out to be in England.\n\nAs for those noble construction workers hefting a metal beam? They were working on a building in Asia.\n\nAfter Politico wrote about the origins of the images, stock-footage creator Daniel Hurst \u2014 who did not create those particular scenes \u2014 said he started getting inquiries from potential clients asking if his clips were \u201cmade in the U.S.A.\u201d\n\nHurst is all too familiar with stock-footage fails. In 2010, he uploaded a clip of his son waving an American flag in slow motion. It had the perfect ingredients for a winning political message \u2014 a cute kid with an expression so neutral it could be taken for concern or contentment, plus an obvious symbol of patriotism.\n\nAd consultant Davis is pretty sure he used that clip first, in an advertisement for the Ronald Reagan-founded PAC Citizens for the Republic. (In a phone interview, Davis seemed disappointed to learn the flag-waver was the son of the director instead of a young patriot in his natural setting.)\n\nIn the five years since it first appeared, \u201cyoung boy waving flag, slow motion\u201d has appeared in ads for Scott Walker, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, BuzzFeed reported earlier this year.\n\nHurst\u2019s son doesn\u2019t mind at all.\n\n\u201cMy kids generally love doing it,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cThey enjoy the process of shooting and seeing themselves in commercials and things. We might not shop at that store or support that political candidate, but that\u2019s just the nature of the business. And all of our family and people we know, they see us on TV and they know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nProfessionals such as Hurst and Kokkoros are constantly seeking to fill the need of all types of advertisements, consulting with the stock agencies to find out what kinds of downloads are in demand. Lately, it has been time-lapse images of busy streets, bird\u2019s-eye footage of big cities, and people wielding high-tech equipment, looking authoritative.\n\nFor campaign season, Shutterstock curator Robyn Lange recommends filmmakers shoot anything with traditional American themes.\n\n\u201cCornfields, windmills, horses in pasture ... anything you could find within the lines of \u2018The Star-Spangled Banner\u2019 is what they like to present,\u201d Lange said.\n\nShutterstock contributor Bill Burlingham specializes in what he calls \u201cthe Hero Shot.\u201d He transforms his photo studio into any number of small businesses and transforms an actor into an archetypal American worker. The coffeehouse barista, the greasy auto mechanic, the young teacher \u2014 they stand proudly in front of their pseudo-workplaces, staring wordlessly through the camera and straight into your living room with a gaze that assures that they\u2019re just like you.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not ashamed to deal in cliches,\u201d Burlingham said. \u201cThey sell.\u201d\n\nFull-time stock-footage producers can earn about $50,000 to $75,000 a year. They typically pay the actors \u2014 part-timers or amateurs, some with experience as extras or in public-service announcements \u2014 about $30 to $50 an hour. Actors sign waivers allowing their images to be used for any type of advertisement, except perhaps those of sensitive topics, such as medical conditions.\n\nSometimes Burlingham dispenses with actors and just films himself. He\u2019s a white man in his 60s, a key demographic for many political advertisers. You can buy clips of him as a corn farmer, a grandfather, a \u201csenior man worrying about his bills,\u201d a runner, a man with a knee injury, a professor and an engineer.\n\nDoes the public realize that he\u2019s not any of those things? Do they care that the people starring in ads for political candidates may not even know those candidates exist?\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, a stock shot is a visual representation of an idea or people or policy,\u201d said Julian Mulvey, who makes advertisements for Democrats. \u201cStock shots get a bad name, but the reality is they save campaigns thousands of dollars.\u201d\n\nBut a truly good ad cannot exist on stock alone, Mulvey said. The best, in fact, may not rely on any stock at all. If a candidate can muster supporters of various ages and races who will appear in an ad for free, that candidate probably will do pretty well at the polls anyway.\n\n\u201cReal people, real voters, unscripted, is often more powerful than what lots of people can devise around a conference-room table,\u201d Mulvey said.\n\nUnless, of course, you need high-definition stock footage of a lot of people around a conference-room table.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | WASHINGTON - The doctor takes in her patient's concerned frown.
