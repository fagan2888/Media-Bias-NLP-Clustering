Good. Do more.\n\nSo Thursday night at 9 pm, while everyone was watching the debate (okay, everyone who\u2019s a weirdo politics junkie), I was watching\u2026well, the debate. But then I happened to be up at 4 am, just in time for the rebroadcast of The Rachel Maddow Show, and I caught her interview with Hillary Clinton, which I\u2019m guessing wasn\u2019t seen by many save my fellow insomniacs and those devoted enough to the Clinton cause to have DVR\u2019d it.\n\nYou should watch. She was good, better than I\u2019d expected her to be under questioning that you wouldn\u2019t call Mike Wallace-60 Minutes tough, but that was sober and on point and that challenged Clinton on her recent troubles and charges against Bernie Sanders. And it made me think: Why in the world doesn\u2019t she do this more often, like virtually every day, just like all the other candidates?\n\nActually, she's starting to. We\u2019ll get to that and the broader Clinton media strategy, but first about Thursday night. Maddow said to Clinton, correctly, that her campaign \u201cset its hair on fire a little bit\u201d the previous afternoon by hosting a media conference call to wag a big finger in Bernie\u2019s direction for going negative. Now madam secretary, Maddow rejoined; that wasn\u2019t much of an attack ad. It didn\u2019t even mention your name. It was just your basic compare and contrast.\n\nHere, Clinton could have gotten herself all riled up and continued the finger wag, but she backed away to some degree, saying the issue was merely one of making Sanders say how he was going to pay for things. \u201cI\u2019ve been laying out my plans, I\u2019ve been telling you where I\u2019m gonna get the money, I\u2019ve been telling you how much it\u2019s gonna cost,\u201d she said, whereas Sanders has not so much, especially with respect to his Medicare for All or single-payer health plan.\n\nThis one shot up the charts this week after Chelsea Clinton clumsily and unwisely accused Sanders of wanting to do away with Medicare and Medicaid and \u201cstrip millions and millions of their health insurance.\u201d It was foolish and kind of shocking and signaled panic. And maybe the Clinton campaign is panicked, but a campaign never wants to show panic. It was kind of disastrous.\n\nQuestioned by Maddow, Hillary Clinton was artful and specific (it starts at about 11:30 in the link in my first paragraph). Sanders, she said, had promised voters that he\u2019d release the details of his plan before the Iowa caucuses, and he hasn\u2019t done so yet, and he should, so voters have a way of comparing and contrasting their plans. \u201cIf he has changed his mind about having the fed government pay 86 percent of the costs, and having states have to come up with the remaining 14 percent, when in fact we know Republican governors won\u2019t even pay for Medicaid [expansion under Obamacare], which they\u2019re going to get initially for nothing, well, that\u2019s what we mean\u201d by raising these questions.\n\nI\u2019m not going to get down into the policy weeds here; as is usually the case, there\u2019s some truth to what both sides are saying. My point is that Clinton came across as calm and authoritative, which is like the magic TV combo.\n\nSo I wondered: Why doesn\u2019t she do this more often?\n\nShe is. She also did a CNN sit-down this week, and she even called in, Donald-style, to Morning Joe. Oddly, Joe Scarborough didn\u2019t even ask a question (she only took two). She\u2019s apparently hitting some of the Sunday shows this weekend. So this is changing, but it\u2019s still a curiosity when she does it. Mika Brzezinski introduced Clinton by saying what a big deal this was, what a \u201clong time in coming\u201d it was.\n\nI know why Clinton hasn\u2019t done this more. It\u2019s because unlike most other candidates she doesn\u2019t need the exposure, the free air time, but mostly it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t like it, doesn\u2019t want to field more email questions, knows that that\u2019s what will dominate the coverage. But it plays to her strengths. She\u2019s at her best when she\u2019s sitting somewhere talking calmly about Important Things.\n\nMore importantly, not doing TV in this day and age just doesn\u2019t hold up well. All these other candidates do it. The front-runner on the other side does it to excess, calling Scarborough to report a hangnail. Clinton needn\u2019t do that, but why not get on there and mix it up a little? The refusal has felt remote and imperial. It feeds into that whole coronation perception. Whereas a candidate who\u2019s out there submitting to questions and defending her policies and statements on the medium that for better or worse shapes our political discourse and goes a long way toward defining what we think of these people is more likely to be seen as fighting for something.\n\nIt is true that her answers about emails and Bill\u2019s wanderings would dominate everything\u2014at first. But after about two weeks, it would get old. Oh, Hillary\u2019s on TV again. Which would be a good thing from her perspective. She\u2019d benefit from getting her hands a little dirty in the mud where everybody else plays. She\u2019s done Maddow and Hardball now, but she should hit Chris Hayes (she phoned into that one once) and Lawrence O\u2019Donnell and Andrea Mitchell, too; and she should do them more than once. And she should do CNN regularly too, although she needn\u2019t bother with Fox; or maybe once or twice. Some of them will lay a trap for her, but by the third or fourth time she\u2019s on Morning Joe or the Sunday shows, it just won\u2019t be a big deal. And she should keep doing the Ellen DeGeneres and Amanda de Cadenet things of course, even though those don\u2019t help much with the political class. Jimmy Fallon, which she did the other night, helps more with that set.\n\n\n\nOn Friday morning, Nate Silver still had her 82 percent likely to win Iowa and 57 percent likely to take New Hampshire, but some polls show she\u2019s clearly lost some ground in the last month. So something\u2019s not working. She gets a lot of negative press coverage; less so since the email story has quieted, but it still ain\u2019t great, while Sanders gets almost nothing but positive coverage.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "Politics-Election, 2016 Election, 2016, Joe Scarborough, Rachel Maddow, Hillary Clinton, Google, Hillary Clinton, u.s. poli, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Ellen DeGeneres", "publicationDate": 201601160501, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Lo and behold, Hillary\u2019s starting to do something she\u2019s previously done with the enthusiasm of going to the dentist: TV.
