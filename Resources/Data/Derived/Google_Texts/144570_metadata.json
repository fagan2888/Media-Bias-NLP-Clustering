He goes on to say that, because of this, the GOP doesn\u2019t stand a chance unless someone like his son is elected.\n\nHuntsman Sr., former assistant to President Richard Nixon, is looking ahead with concern regarding the Grand Old Party\u2019s 2016 prospects, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nHe says, \u201cUnless Jeb Bush comes in or John Huntsman Jr., the Republicans don\u2019t have a prayer.\u201d\n\nThe junior Mr. Huntsman sought the GOP nomination in 2012 and lost. He now serves as the U.S. ambassador to China.\n\nWhen asked if his son will run again in 2016, Mr. Huntsman Sr. says, \u201cI don\u2019t think so [but] I wish he\u2019s listen to his father and would run.\u201d\n\nHuntsman Sr., who is founder of Huntsman Chemical Corporation, says that he didn\u2019t think that a \u201cmoderate\u201d Republican like his son could win with the party\u2019s nomination. With regards to Jeb Bush, Huntsman says that he \u201cwould represent the Republican Party very well, but I doubt he\u2019ll be embraced too heavily by the Tea Party gang.\u201d\n\nHuntsman goes on to say that he thinks that Hillary Clinton \u201cwould be a fine president.\u201d\n\nEmboldened by recent midterm elections, the Tea Party movement promises a clash with President Obama, reports Global Post. However, an equally consequential battle awaits between the far-right lawmakers and their Republican leaders.\n\nThere are several conservatives backed by the small-government, anti-tax movement who, in January 2015, will embark on efforts to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act, eliminate government departments like the Environmental Protection Agency, and fight Obama over excessive government funding.\n\nWhether Tea Party conservatives can find common ground with Democrats or with their own leadership is a key question for Congress when it opens January 3, 2015.\n\nThe Inquisitr reports that the recent elections reveal Americans are fed-up with the infighting, as well as the Republican and Democrat extremes.\n\nRaw Story reports that Michelle Bachmann says voters want Congress \u201cunited\u201d, and the Tea Party is simply misunderstood. She says that \u201cfiscal sanity\u201d is what the party is standing for, and that was the Tea Party message from the people who voted last Tuesday.\n\nShe goes on to say, \u201cThat\u2019s what the Tea Party is\u2014it\u2019s maligned. And, people don\u2019t\u2014misunderstand what it is, but it\u2019s really about brining fiscal sanity.\u201d\n\nDuring a panel discussion on CNN, Bachmann argued that now that the Republicans have control of both the House and the Senate, Congress should relinquish its \u201cdo nothing\u201d label.\n\nTime will what unification, if any, is being created following the recent midterm election. And, as to whether or not if Huntsman is right about the Tea Party ruining the GOP, we\u2019ll know more in 2016.\n\n[Image via The Conversation]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jon Huntsman Sr., father of former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. and self-proclaimed \"lifelong Republican,\" says that the Tea Party has \"completely captivated", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Jon Huntsman Sr., father of former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. and self-proclaimed \u201clifelong Republican,\u201d says that the Tea Party has \u201ccompletely captivated", "title": "Tea Party Ruined GOP", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1598281/tea-party-ruined-gop/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Tea-party-republican-Good.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-09T18:55:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-10T18:00:57+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Tea-party-republican-Good.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-11-09T18:55:42+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "2016 elections,gop,tea party,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Tea-party-republican-Good.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jon Huntsman Sr., father of former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. and self-proclaimed \u201clifelong Republican,\u201d says that the Tea Party has \u201ccompletely captivated"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "She says that \u201cfiscal sanity\u201d is what the party is standing for, and that was the Tea Party message from the people who voted last Tuesday.\nAnd, as to whether or not if Huntsman is right about the Tea Party ruining the GOP, we\u2019ll know more in 2016.\nJon Huntsman Sr., father of former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. and self-proclaimed \u201clifelong Republican,\u201d says that the Tea Party has \u201ccompletely captivated and ruined the Republican Party,\u201d and they will show this in 2016, according to the Washington Times.\nRaw Story reports that Michelle Bachmann says voters want Congress \u201cunited\u201d, and the Tea Party is simply misunderstood.\nWhether Tea Party conservatives can find common ground with Democrats or with their own leadership is a key question for Congress when it opens January 3, 2015."}
