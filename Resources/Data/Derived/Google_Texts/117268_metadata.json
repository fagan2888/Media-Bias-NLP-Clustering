The TV stations \u2014 all of those in the city with a nightly newscast plus the cable channel Court TV \u2014 say the camera will not be a disturbance to the trial.\n\n\u201cA television camera which allows a live feed to be sent outside the courtroom actually reduces the number of media representatives in the courtroom,\u201d the stations argue in the motion.\n\nArapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour said during a hearing Monday that he will likely set another hearing in September to debate the request.\n\nMonday\u2019s hearing was mostly devoted to the vetting of fingerprint-identification experts. Three analysts \u2014 two from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and one from the Aurora Police Department \u2014 testified about how they match fingerprints found at crime scenes to suspects. Samour will rule later whether they can be admitted as expert witnesses at trial.\n\nMeanwhile, an order made public Monday means defense attorneys will not be able to obtain the records of a mystery witness.\n\nJohn Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@ denverpost.com, or twitter.com/ John_Ingold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver TV stations ask for camera in Aurora theater shooting trial", "title": "Denver TV stations ask for camera in Aurora theater shooting trial", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/25/denver-tv-stations-ask-for-camera-in-aurora-theater-shooting-trial/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140822__aurora-theater-shootingp1p1.jpg", "height": 428}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140822__aurora-theater-shootingp1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-25T08:54:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:43:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e9d\"", "article_summary": "Several Denver television stations filed a motion Monday seeking to put a camera in the courtroom during the Aurora movie theater murder trial of James Holmes.\nThe TV stations \u2014 all of those in the city with a nightly newscast plus the cable channel Court TV \u2014 say the camera will not be a disturbance to the trial.\nThe motion asks for one video camera in a fixed position inside the courtroom during the trial, currently scheduled to begin with jury selection in December.\n\u201cA television camera which allows a live feed to be sent outside the courtroom actually reduces the number of media representatives in the courtroom,\u201d the stations argue in the motion.\nArapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour said during a hearing Monday that he will likely set another hearing in September to debate the request."}
