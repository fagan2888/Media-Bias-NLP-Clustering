It was first published on the humor website Funny or Die on March 11. Galifianakis\u2019 show sees the actor interview a string of famous guests whom he asks inappropriate and awkward questions.\n\nThough Galifianakis is biting, he\u2019s no match for the President who, when asked if he wishes he could run a third time, replies: \u201cUh, if I ran a third time, it\u2019d be sorta like doing a third Hangover movie. It didn\u2019t really work out very well, did it?\u201d\n\nObama then proceeds to try and educate Galifianakis about the Affordable Care Act and registering with Healthcare.gov online or by phone. Galifianakis responds: \u201cI\u2019m off the grid. I don\u2019t want you people, like, looking at my texts.\u201d\n\nWhile Obama himself is not up for an Emmy for the episode, he has previously received the Grammy for best spoken word album for Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope in 2006 and 2008, respectively.\n\nThe 66th Primetime Emmy Awards will be broadcast on August 28 at 8 p.m. ET on NBC. Actor Seth Meyers is hosting this year\u2019s awards.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "An episode of online comedy series \"Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis\" featuring President Barack Obama was among the Emmy nominees.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Obama himself won't get an Emmy, though", "title": "Obama's 'Between Two Ferns' Episode Nominated for an Emmy", "url": "http://time.com/2973470/barack-obama-emmy-between-ferns/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/barack-obama-fern.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/barack-obama-fern.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Obama's 'Between Two Ferns' Episode Nominated for an Emmy", "description": "Obama himself won't get an Emmy, though", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "barack obama, zach galifianakis, funny or die, between two ferns, grammy, emmy, affordable care act, health insurance, humor", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Zach Galifianakis, Funny or Die, Between Two Ferns, Grammy, Emmy, Affordable Care Act, health insurance, humor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb732\"", "article_summary": "An episode of online comedy series \u201cBetween Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis\u201d featuring President Barack Obama was among the Emmy nominees announced Thursday morning.\nThe six-minute, 30-second episode featuring the President has been nominated for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program.\nThe 66th Primetime Emmy Awards will be broadcast on August 28 at 8 p.m.\nGalifianakis\u2019 show sees the actor interview a string of famous guests whom he asks inappropriate and awkward questions.\nIt was first published on the humor website Funny or Die on March 11."}
