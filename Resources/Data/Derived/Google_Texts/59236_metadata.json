Just fire up an app on your phone, talk to a nurse or doctor and have your drugs sent to the nearest pharmacy within the hour. Sounds too good to be true, right? But that\u2019s exactly what I did on a recent evening, when I couldn\u2019t get myself to my doctor\u2019s office during a terrible cold.\n\nThey\u2019re known as \u201ctelemedicine\u201d services, and if you haven\u2019t heard of them by now, they\u2019re one of Silicon Valley\u2019s ever-expanding ventures into the health space. As part of a larger push for a data-based healthcare system\u2014and on the heels of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rules and regulations\u2014the tech industry isn\u2019t waiting around when it comes to innovating the patient experience. Because Obamacare\u2019s law includes incentives for innovation and cost-cuts, tech startups can become a booming byproduct of the looming new generation of healthcare.\n\nBut while many startups are scrambling to provide similar medical services, not everyone is impressed with tech\u2019s plans to disrupt healthcare\u2014at least not without valid apprehensiveness\u2014with misdiagnosis being the main concern among the medical field.\n\n\u201cIs it opportunistic? Sure. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe prominence of apps such as Pager and Doctor On Demand proves that tech entrepreneurs are hoping to make virtual healthcare a reality for every patient. Even UnitedHealthcare has announced its own virtual care program; the latest giant insurance company joining the ranks in providing telemedicine services. While they all have their own variations on the telemedicine idea, one thing all of these apps have in common is a triage system that filters a patient\u2019s needs and eventual treatment.\n\nIn my experience, getting an instant diagnosis for your health problems becomes addicting. This is especially true for millennials like myself already used to exhaustingly WebMD\u2019ing symptoms until we find an answer we like.\n\nFor my first \u201cvisit\u201d, I decided to use my health insurance\u2019s app, Oscar, which comes loaded with a free, unlimited \u201cDoctor on Call\u201d feature as part of my monthly member plan. After requesting a call through the mobile app, I received a phone call that spurred a 10-minute consultation with a board-certified physician about my symptoms. By the time I hung up, the doctor had already sent my pharmacy the prescription treatment that I agreed to try. Overall, a painless, easy experience.\n\nImage: Gabriela Barkho\n\nOscar CEO and Co-Founder Mario Schlosser told me that its Doctor on Call \u201ccan be a very powerful feature, and work very well, but you cannot rely on just tele-visits. Patients have to have it as part of a bigger healthcare system.\u201d\n\nGiven that these telemedicine features are being built to quickly treat common ailments and point the patient in the right direction, thus far, the benefits have outweighed the concerns. Since its inception about two years ago, Oscar's \u201cDoctor on Call\u201d system has already made an impact, the startup claims.\n\n\u201cTo use bronchitis as an example, with the use of Oscar's telemedicine, bronchitis treatment increased 60 percent and general consultation increased 55 percent,\" Schlosser said. \"In terms of cost, Oscar's telemedicine program has also caused a 91 percent increase in free and successful solutions to bronchitis.\u201d\n\nWith such positive reinforcement, I got more comfortable with the idea of trying out virtual doctors in the comfort of my own home. And so, I kept going as I saw fit for my ongoing health issues.\n\nOf course, the idea of telemedicine is nothing new, and has been around long before tech brought it to our mobile phones. \u201cThere is literature on older ways of doing this, like telemedicine and \u2018ask a nurse\u2019 services that would let patients call in and ask for help with their illness. It\u2019s not too terribly different,\u201d Dr. Peter Muennig, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, told me.\n\nAnd so, next up was the Pager app. A beautifully designed, clean interface drew me in, but asking for help on a medical app can be intimidating, especially when I started to calculate the potential financial costs. Luckily, many of these services tend to offer a free first time \u201cvisit\u201d, which I immediately took advantage of (after which \"visits\" cost between $25 to $200). This time around, I wanted a second opinion about my chronic digestive issues, which often trigger vomiting spurts. Glamourous, I know. After explaining my symptoms away to the certified Pager nurse on the other side of the smartphone screen, she suggested I call my regular specialist for further consultation.\n\nImage: Pager\n\nWhat these apps all have in common is they work exactly how I imagine a well-oiled \u201ctriage\u201d system to operate\u2014and so off I went with my quick advice. It feels, really, no different than asking your local pharmacist a question about over-the-counter meds. In my experience, these telemedicine apps do exactly what they\u2019re intended for. They\u2019re by no means intended for emergency diagnosis, but they get the patient that first nudge of professional opinion to start their treatment.\n\nPager hopes to bring telemedicine to the masses, and is going one step further by providing doctor visits to your home or office. Pager Chief Exec and Co-Founder Gaspard De Dreuzy told me that when it comes to innovating an-already struggling and wasteful healthcare system, you must implement multiple care facets.\n\n\u201cIs it opportunistic? Sure. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d Boston-based pediatrician Lisa Coray said. \u201cThe solutions from Silicon Valley can absolutely improve the system, but at the same time, with the reliance on tech, if there isn\u2019t some sober realistic thinking about inherent limitations in tech-based diagnosis\u2014not that there aren\u2019t already\u2014systematizing these failures is a problem.\u201d\n\nPager acknowledges that diagnosing a patient incorrectly is a big risk that the startup is mindful of.\n\n\u201cMisdiagnosis can happen on a lot of levels,\" Pager\u2019s CMO and Operations Director Andrew Chomer said. \"What we solve for is largely urgent care. If it\u2019s not urgent care upfront, we get them to the right course. That\u2019s how triage and chat-based tech can be a guide, and how our satisfaction rate is so high. It\u2019s about filtering cases right up front.\"\n\nDespite all the precautions that startups are taking, along with the realities of high-tech vs. traditional triage systems provide, some traditional physicians feel that \u201cdoctor-hailing apps\u201d just can\u2019t deliver the same type of quality as a visit to your trusted doctor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like seeing a patient,\" Colorado-based family physician Dr. Mark Hailey said. \"There\u2019s an art to medicine that needs human element, and a computer is merely a tool that helps us diagnose the patient correctly.\u201d\n\nA few weeks after my Pager call, I found myself back at my primary physician\u2019s office for a follow up visit to a routine checkup. After reassessing my physical and mental health due to recent stressful life events, my long-term doctor (whom I\u2019ve become close with over the years) suggested it\u2019d be the perfect time to give the anti-anxiety medication I previously resisted. I knew it was going to be a big change, but I trusted my doctor to steer me on the right path, given the context and medical history she has on record.\n\nWhat I wasn\u2019t ready for were the severe side effects. Fortunately, there weren\u2019t any signs of mania or suicide (as the label warns), but my previously-mentioned nausea problems kicked into full effect right away.\n\nAnd so I found the perfect opportunity to try out the Doctor On Demand app to get some advice on calming my dizziness and upset stomach. By now, I was becoming a pro at talking to virtual healthcare professionals while in agonizing pain, and quickly entered my question following the signup prompt. While Doctor On Demand doesn\u2019t have the clean lines and design that I prefer, it still got the job done. Within minutes, I was once again offered a complimentary first video visit with a doctor, which I decided to forgo given my anxiety (ironically) about my unsightly physical state.\n\nThe near-retirement doctors I talked to may want to stick to their face-to-face doctor-patient relationships, but many members of the medical community are willing to embrace telemedicine in the name of improving America\u2019s healthcare system. For example, Pager\u2019s mission is to overhaul traditional medicine by \u201ccombining elements of house visits and virtual care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have advantages for being a new company, so we can leverage new technology when it comes to concerns such as patient data,\u201d explains Pager\u2019s De Dreuzy. \u201cWe can do this at a faster pace and a lower cost than traditional health providers.\u201d\n\nTelemedicine tech providers still have a way to go before perfecting their formulas to truly implement a perfect healthcare system, but even so, there\u2019s a sense of optimism that \u201cvirtual doctor\u201d services can make a difference when it comes to certain medical field issues. These include the current shortage of general practitioners and wasteful ER visits that we\u2019re all familiar with.\n\nImage: Pager.\n\n\u201cDoctor shortages are more common in rural communities, and this would give those areas a chance to connect to more doctors,\u201d Humza Ansari, a third-year student at Mayo Medical School, told me. \u201cAdditionally, the role of mid-level providers (nurse practitioners, physician assistants) in primary-care is growing in many states, and I would envision mid-levels playing a big role in \u2018staffing\u2019 primary care done through tech. At the end of the day, with or without this technology, America will need more primary care physicians, especially in under-served communities.\u201d\n\nAt this point, there is still a push and pull in what can be deemed as the Wild West when it comes to healthcare apps under the new tech era of medicine, with only time as the telling factor of whether technology can truly step up to solve the issues that the lagging medical industry hasn\u2019t been able to do for decades.\n\nThus far for me, using telemedicine apps definitely enhanced my healthcare experience to an extent. And when used as part of a larger aforementioned triage system, they have the ability to not only be effective, but potentially save both patients and providers time and money, like they did during my anecdotal experiment.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that technology is seeping through our healthcare system to improve it. The decision to use these tech-based health services depends on the personal preference and lifestyle of the patient.\n\nI do plan on using at least one of these apps in the future for its intended purposes: quick diagnosis for simple issues. However, when it comes to major medical decision\u2014like starting a new long term prescription treatment\u2014I\u2019d feel more comfortable, psychologically anyway, doing it \u201cin real life\u201d at my trusted doctor\u2019s office.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-im-hooked-on-doctor-hailing-apps", "twitter": {"twitter": "Why I'm Hooked on 'Doctor-Hailing' Apps", "image": "http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/article/32615/1460747960477102.jpg", "description": "\u201cIs it opportunistic?
