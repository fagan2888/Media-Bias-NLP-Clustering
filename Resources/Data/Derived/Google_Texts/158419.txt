Health Senate Candidate Compares Pregnancy To Cancer CREDIT:

Ken Buck, a Republican district attorney and erstwhile Tea Party darling who has announced he will challenge Sen. Mark Udall (D-CO) in the midterms this fall, appeared on talk radio on Wednesday morning and attacked a woman’s right to choose by comparing a woman’s pregnancy to his own cancer.

Buck and host Randy Corporon criticized Obamacare’s provisions designed to give women affordable access to birth control before transitioning to a conversation on abortion. That’s when Buck acknowledged that while he “understands” the desire to make decisions about your own body, women are not entitled to that right:

BUCK: Yes, I am pro-life. While I understand a woman wants to be in control of her body — it’s certainly the feeling that I had when I was a cancer patient, I wanted to be in control of the decisions that were made concerning my body — there is another fundamental issue at stake. And that’s the life of the unborn child.

Listen to the audio, as first reported by the site BigMedia.com:

In going after women’s reproductive rights, Buck is picking up where he left off during his failed 2010 senate bid. During a heated Republican primary, the Tea Party-backed attorney told a debate audience that they should vote for him instead of his female opponent “because I do not wear high heels.” Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) went on to win reelection largely on his strength among women; Buck only managed to win 39 percent of the female vote.

Buck has been on the record for years as opposing any and all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest.
