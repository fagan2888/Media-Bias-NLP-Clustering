But it was expensive. But it was Mom\u2019s. But it still works. But it was a gift. But I might lose weight. But it might be worth something. But it\u2019s irreplaceable. But I don\u2019t have time to deal with it.\n\nBut, but, but.\n\nAnd so the clutter begins. The piles stack. The closets overflow. Belongings take over. And life deteriorates.\n\nNow, I have my issues, but saving every plastic bag, coat hanger, piece of junk mail and rubber band that comes my way to the point of turning a perfectly good living space into an avalanche hazard isn\u2019t one of them. And while I don\u2019t understand how people can get into this mess, the fact remains: Having too much stuff is an American plague.\n\nShows like \u201cHoarders\u201d and \u201cHoarding: Buried Alive,\u201d which have turned people\u2019s personal pack-rat problems into spectator sport, aren\u2019t helping.\n\nThat\u2019s because when the average human pack rat watches a show that focuses on the extreme, they feel downright pulled together. Shows that feature entire houses overtaken with material chaos make those who see themselves as \u201cthrifty supersavers\u201d feel better because their own clutter is limited to only two or three rooms they can\u2019t use or go in, or just half a blocked hallway, not a completely blocked hallway.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to break the news: Clutter may be relative, but it is still clutter.\n\nI know I sound like the clean police sometimes, and I am sorry to be a buzz kill, especially when we\u2019re all gearing up for holiday shopping, but someone has to speak up about this.\n\nAs we enter the season of massive consumption, weeks when more shopping is done than during the rest of the year combined, I am asking you to pause a moment and think about your stuff.\n\n\u201cOur relationship with stuff can be put on a spectrum,\u201d says hoarding expert Gail Steketee, professor and dean of the School of Social Work at Boston University.\n\nOn one end you have the ascetics, the nonmaterialists who practice austerity like a religion and don\u2019t leave so much as a fingerprint behind, let alone a carbon footprint. On the other end you have the serious hoarder. Like a human vacuum, the superhoarder sucks everything \u2014 including but not limited to papers, books, clothes, jars, broken appliances and stray cats \u2014 to it and does not release.\n\nIn between the two extremes lie the manic purger, the nefarious neat freak, the nonobsessively organized, the domestically disordered, the sloppy supersaver and the pre-hoarding pack rat.\n\nReality check: To find out where you fall on the spectrum, ask a loved one. Most of us are clutter blind. And hoarders in particular see themselves as frugal, not nuts.\n\n\u201cHolding onto stuff becomes unhealthy when it negatively affects a person\u2019s life,\u201d said Steketee, also the co-author of two books on hoarding: \u201cStuff: Compulsive Hoarding and the Meaning of Things,\u201d and \u201cBuried in Treasures: Help for Compulsive Acquiring, Saving, and Hoarding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen clutter interferes with daily living \u2014 when you can\u2019t sit on the sofa, or park in your garage, or have people over because you\u2019re too embarrassed, it\u2019s an emotional disorder,\u201d said Steketee.\n\nBesides that, a home filled with junk is unsightly, unsafe, unhealthy and unfriendly. Excessive clutter can cause fires, pest infestation, accidents, family arguments, embarrassment, social isolation (you can\u2019t entertain), evictions, property depreciation and furious neighbors.\n\nThose with serious hoarding problems need professional intervention to unpack the problem. However, the mere supersavers and packrats can straighten themselves out with a little awareness, a lot of motivation and a few new habits, she said.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press).

Here, according to the Hoarding Center, a part of the International Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Foundation, are the telltale signs of being somewhere on the problem- clutterer spectrum.\n\nYou can\u2019t use parts of your house because they are too cluttered.\n\nYou can\u2019t eat at your kitchen table or sit on your sofa, because it\u2019s covered with stuff.\n\nYou can\u2019t use certain appliances or repair them because they\u2019re buried.\n\nYou can\u2019t park your car in the garage.\n\nYour car is filled with stuff.\n\nYou feel overwhelmed by the volume of stuff that has taken over your house or workspace.\n\nYou sleep in a bed that has stuff piled on it, or you can\u2019t sleep in your bed because it has stuff piled on it.\n\nYou can\u2019t walk around the outside of your house because debris is piled up.\n\nYou have difficulty passing up bargains or not taking free things even if you don\u2019t need them.\n\nYou experience intense emotions \u2014 guilt, anxiety, fear \u2014 at the thought of getting rid of things.\n\nYou think items that nobody thinks are valuable have value.\n\nYou have trouble organizing your stuff, which is in random heaps, not stored in categories.\n\nYou can\u2019t use your bathtub, shower or sink because it\u2019s full of stuff.\n\nYou can\u2019t find items you need to find \u2014 like bills \u2014 because they\u2019re buried.\n\nYou can\u2019t invite people over because it\u2019s too embarrassing.\n\nYour clutter causes friction with family members.\n\nYour neighbors wish you would move.\n\nIf more than one of these signs describe you or someone you love, tune in next week when experts share ways to break the hoarder habit.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "What kind of clutterer are you?
