That\u2019s up from 78.2 percent reported in summer 2013. The data came from the online Health Reform Monitoring Survey.\n\nThe key coverage provisions of the ACA, also known as Obamacare, are the expansion of Medicaid in 31 states and the creation of health insurance marketplaces, a source of insurance for those who had difficulty obtaining it elsewhere. These provisions went into effect at the beginning of 2014 and have helped many non-LGB adults gain coverage as well. The spread of marriage equality also improved LGB coverage rates, the study\u2019s authors note, as people in same-sex marriages have gained access to spousal benefits, although the data came in before this summer\u2019s Supreme Court decision struck down all remaining marriage bans.\n\nSince the ACA\u2019s implementation, the percentage of LGB people reporting that they have a usual source of health care has increased, to where it\u2019s actually slightly higher than the percentage of non-LGB adults (78.4 percent versus 73.2 percent). But LGB Americans report more difficulties with access to and affordability of care, even though their access to insurance has improved. A quarter reported problems with accessing care, compared to 16.1 percent of non-LGB adults, and 42.6 percent of LGB adults reported an unmet need for care because of cost, compared to 32.4 percent of non-LGB people.\n\nAlso, gender disparities continue to exist. \u201cAlthough sample sizes were small and our estimates were imprecise, lesbian or bisexual women were more likely than gay or bisexual men to report difficulty accessing and affording care in winter 2014\u201315, despite similar rates of having insurance and having a usual source of care,\u201d note study authors Laura Skopec and Sharon K. Long.\n\nThe marriage equality decision, Obergefell v. Hodges, could further improve access to and affordability of care, the authors report. So could another high court ruling from this year, King v. Burwell, which upheld subsidies for insurance purchased through the marketplaces.\n\n\u201cIn addition, a growing body of research suggests that marriage equality may result in improved physical and mental health for LGB adults,\u201d the study relates. \u201cNational marriage equality may also reduce social stigma against LGB adults, which could reduce actual and perceived discrimination by providers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAided by the recent Supreme Court decisions, the Affordable Care Act dramatically increased access to health insurance for lesbian, gay, and bisexual Americans,\u201d concluded Kathy Hempstead, who directs coverage issues for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, in a press release announcing the study. \u201cFor this and other populations the question now turns to whether affordable health insurance and easy access to care providers can be sustained.\u201d\n\nThe full study is available only to magazine subscribers, but an abstract is available here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The proportion of LGB Americans with health insurance has risen by 10 percentage points since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, a new study finds.", "og": {"image": "http://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/2015/10/05/healthcare-doctor-x750.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-05T16:01:06-04:00", "type": "article", "title": "STUDY: Obamacare Improves LGB Access to Health Insurance"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Advocate", "fb": {"page_id": 19799718480, "app_id": 625763650825412, "pages": 6030918854}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-05T16:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-05T16:00:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7b2\"", "article_summary": "STUDY: Obamacare Improves LGB Access to Health InsuranceThe proportion of LGB Americans with health insurance has risen by 10 percentage points since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, a new study finds.\nBut LGB Americans report more difficulties with access to and affordability of care, even though their access to insurance has improved.\n\u201cIn addition, a growing body of research suggests that marriage equality may result in improved physical and mental health for LGB adults,\u201d the study relates.\nThese provisions went into effect at the beginning of 2014 and have helped many non-LGB adults gain coverage as well.\nThe Affordable Care Act has greatly reduced the number of uninsured lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults in the U.S., although disparities in access to health care remain, according to a new study."}
