Springfield, Mo. -- For the past two years, CoxHealth’s South Medical Center expansion project has been a familiar sight on the south side of town If you look closely at the project right now you'll see that it's almost finished.That’s good news for mother’s like Brittany Clevenger.“Being able to bond with your child is probably one of the most important things when they're this little,” she said.While it’s important, it’s not always easy for mother's like Clevenger who's twenty-eight week old twins are patient's at the medical center’s NICU. For the past thirty years, the NICU has operated inside the same single room.“You can hear other alarms going off and it distracts you or it can upset your baby,” Clevenger said. “You just get like a negative mindset …and all the fear you can have in here.”Right now, all that separates one family from the next are curtians, but in the new building patients and families will have actual rooms and a lot more space.In total, an additional 300,000 square feet of more space will be added to the new ten story $130,000,000 patient tower. The tower will not only house the new NICU, but also a women's and children's hospital, more than 120 private patient rooms and a new neuroscience department.Hospital staff said it's an expansion that's necessary due to the nationwide expansion of healthcare.“Now that we have the Affordable Care Act nationwide, more people are going to be accessing healthcare and so we need to be able to be ready for them and to be able to serve them,” said Michelle Leroux with CoxHealth.That will also require at least 75 additional staff members working in the hospital’s dietary services, environmental services and patient safety departments.“This hospital is progressive. We're able to foresee things down the road of what our medical needs are for our community,” Leroux said.The hospital plans to have an open house for the public at the end of June. Then officially open the new patient tower in July.For more information about upcoming hiring fairs for CoxHealth’s new patient tower, please click here
