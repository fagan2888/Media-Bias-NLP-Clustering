The Story of Popular Music from Bill Haley to Beyonc\u00e9\u201d is a rare thing: a work of popular music criticism written by a successful popular musician. Although many well-regarded novelists have a sideline in literary criticism and artists since Vasari have written about their peers and forebears, very few pop musicians are also critics of popular music. ( Yes, Chrissie Hynde wrote for England\u2019s New Musical Express, but that was before she joined The Pretenders.)\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why. Rock critics get no respect; they are regarded as not quite legitimate by their colleagues in the more established fields of literature, classical music and theater. For the popular musician, the rock critic is a pain in the neck, pointing out unacknowledged borrowings and outright thefts, insisting that the musician\u2019s songs, which are rarely more than a lick, a groove, and a few lucky rhymes, possess a deeper meaning. And as the movie \u201cAlmost Famous\u201d beautifully showed, the critic by his very existence violates the musician\u2019s sense of cool, his need to be the least-verbal and most- nonspecific person in the room.\n\nThis is a shame , because what popular music criticism has lacked from the beginning is the sort of thing that someone like Bob Stanley, who plays keyboards in the bestselling British group Saint Etienne, provides: not just technical knowledge, but also a sense of what creating pop is like from the inside.\n\nHere is Stanley on Phil Collins:\n\n\u201cCollins believed that everything sounded better with gated reverb, which gave the off beat the jackboots-on-Rice-Krispies sound. Most producers agreed. Studios were rebuilt, stripped bare, all Seventies cushioning removed to accommodate this stark, bass-free sound. Collins was a jazz drummer, and his inventiveness could circumvent the brutality of this sound on a 4/4 beat, but most drummers were less talented. Everything got bigger, tinnier, thinner.\u201d\n\nLike most working artists, Stanley finds in the past the tendencies that validate the art he creates. Saint Etienne is a slick synth-pop band fronted by a series of female singers,\n\nall of them young and telegenic, and \u201cYeah!YeahYeah!!\u201d has a heavy emphasis on glamorous synthetic genres like disco and electronica. Stanley is surprisingly enamored of the testosterone-free rap of the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 \u201cWest End Girls,\u201d of Kylie Minogue and KLF. Donna Summers\u2019 \u201cI Feel Love\u201d might be his choice for the best pop record ever made.\n\nThough he\u2019s sharp and original about Elvis, Motown and the California singer-songwriter scene (\u201cthe most successful economic model in the history of entertainment. They wrote, sang, frequently performed alone, and sold albums rather than singles\u201d), Stanley is stronger on British pop, which for him always comes out of a particular time and place. About Skiffle, that bizarre, artless British take on American jug-band music, much of it made with washboard, broomstick and a kazoo, Stanley shows its roots in postwar austerity. \u201cSkiffle was an exciting noise,\u201d he writes, \u201cand it was exciting because it was noise.\u201d\n\nIn the chapter : It Came from the Suburbs: Glam,\u201d Stanley examines the long apprenticeships and spectacular breakouts of Marc Bolan and David Bowie, both working-class lads from drab suburbs outside of London. About Bowie\u2019s early singles he writes, \u201cBowie\u2019s early songs smelled of woodsmoke over the suburban fence, of railway stations, platforms, and waiting rooms \u2014 the golden road to London Town.\u201d\n\nStanley perceptively notes that the rise of glam, a fashion- rather than music-based genre that John Lennon dismissed as \u201cjust rock \u2018n\u2019 roll with lipstick on,\u201d coincided with the introduction of color TV in Britain.\n\n\u201cYeah!Yeah!Yeah!\u201d was first published in England, and to this American reader, part of its interest is in documentating the divergence of British and American pop tastes.After all, Lonnie Donegan and Glam barely charted in America, nor did ska, the \u201960s precusor to reggae, nor did the ska revival of the early \u201980s.\n\nStanley ends his survey in 1999. By his account, the modern pop era ended with the introduction of Napster and the emergence of a new homogeneity in pop, what he calls \u201cthe pick \u2018n\u2019 mix digital era.\u201d But there is always hope.\n\nAs he writes, \u201cAll that a musician needs to do is to rearrange the constituent parts of the modern pop era in a way that no one has done before, and I hope that some 15-year-old in Newark, N.J., or Newark, Notts, is working on it right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee6a\"", "article_summary": "The Story of Popular Music from Bill Haley to Beyonc\u00e9\u201d is a rare thing: a work of popular music criticism written by a successful popular musician.\nAlthough many well-regarded novelists have a sideline in literary criticism and artists since Vasari have written about their peers and forebears, very few pop musicians are also critics of popular music.\nThey wrote, sang, frequently performed alone, and sold albums rather than singles\u201d), Stanley is stronger on British pop, which for him always comes out of a particular time and place.\nHere is Stanley on Phil Collins:\u201cCollins believed that everything sounded better with gated reverb, which gave the off beat the jackboots-on-Rice-Krispies sound.\nStanley is surprisingly enamored of the testosterone-free rap of the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 \u201cWest End Girls,\u201d of Kylie Minogue and KLF."}
