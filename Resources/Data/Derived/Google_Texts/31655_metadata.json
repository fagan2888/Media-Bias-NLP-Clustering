Democrats have operated on the theory that Sam's six-shooter fires only blanks. If offered a genuine opportunity to repeal health insurance coverage for millions of Americans, would Republicans go through with it?\n\nThe election of Matt Bevin as governor of Kentucky ought to settle the question. Bevin, whose company Bevin Brothers Manufacturing Co. in East Hampton makes bells, is a tea party guy who challenged Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell in 2014 with familiar complaints about big government and big Obama. McConnell beat back the upstart, but Bevin ran for governor and won this week.\n\nKentucky happens to be the perfect test case for Obamacare. Other states with Republican governors have expanded Medicaid to cover the uninsured. But under Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear, Kentucky's state insurance exchange has been a national model, and through the combination of the exchange and Medicaid expansion funded by the law, Kentucky has cut its uninsured rate in half. The progress, however, was enabled by executive order, not legislation, and it can be unraveled similarly.\n\nThough he previously vowed to do away with all remnants of Obamacare, Bevin appeared to soften near Election Day. Like McConnell, who during his 2014 campaign said he would do away with Obamacare \"root and branch\" but somehow keep Kynect, the state health insurance exchange that is Obamacare's local outpost, Bevin got squirrelly. He said he'd end the state exchange and scale back Medicaid without beneficiaries being \"kicked to the curb.\"\n\nThe generic Republican position on health insurance in recent years has been a spectacular muddle, and the confusion worked its way into the electorate. In a 2014 poll, a majority of Kentuckians opposed Obamacare while a small plurality in the same poll held a favorable view of Kynect. Voters either didn't understand Obamacare's paternity of Kynect or simply leaped at an opportunity to oppose anything beginning with \"Obama.\" Meanwhile, GOP rhetoric has clearly implied that the nation can end a heavily subsidized program enabling 16 million to obtain health insurance without adverse consequences to the beneficiaries.\n\nObviously, that's not true. It will now fall to Bevin, as the first Republican with the power to reverse course on a functioning state insurance exchange and a successful Medicaid expansion, to conjure some magic to make it so.\n\nAs it is, Kentucky has one of the least healthy populations in the nation. Rates of heart disease and diabetes are high, as is tobacco use. Kentucky's 5th Congressional District, represented by Republican Harold Rogers, has a lower life expectancy \u2014 72.9 years \u2014 than any district in the nation.\n\nFrom the summer of 2013, before open enrollment in Obamacare began, to August 2015, the signups for Medicaid and CHIP, federally subsidized health insurance for children, increased 87 percent in Kentucky. Altogether, an additional 530,000 of the state's 4.4 million people were covered under Obamacare.\n\nPreventive care for Medicaid recipients in the state rose sharply from 2013 to 2014, with screenings for breast cancer up 111 percent, for colorectal cancer up 108 percent and for cervical cancer up 88 percent.\n\nThe federal dollars that flow into Kentucky to pay for all that additional health care add up. According to a study by Deloitte Consulting LLC and the University of Louisville's Urban Studies Institute, Medicaid expansion will add 40,000 jobs and $30 billion to Kentucky's economy through 2021, including a \"net positive impact\" of more than $800 million to state and local government budgets.\n\nThat may explain this email from Kentucky Chamber of Commerce CEO Dave Adkisson to a reporter for the ThinkProgress website: \"We have serious questions as to the financial impact of dismantling a system that seems to be working for Kentucky,\" Adkisson wrote.\n\nWeighing against all this, against the cancer screenings and the jobs and the infusion of federal money into a poor state, is the pervasive sense that government is failing and the nation is in a rut. Democrats are right to view Obamacare as a landmark success: In Kentucky, in particular, it is clearly achieving its goals.\n\nYet Democrats have also been getting clobbered in state and local races all over the country since the law passed. They are no doubt dispirited at losing yet another governor's race.\n\nIn Kentucky, Democrats are out of power and Republicans are out of excuses. Health insurance for thousands of families is now in the hands of the Republican governor-elect. Either subsidized health insurance is here to stay, with or without the histrionics of tea party freedom fighters, or the curb is about to get crowded.\n\nFrancis Wilkinson writes on politics and domestic policy for Bloomberg View, where this first appeared.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Will New Gov.
