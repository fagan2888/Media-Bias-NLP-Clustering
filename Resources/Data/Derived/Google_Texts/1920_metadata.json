There is \u2014 there\u2019s distrust that exists on both sides. There\u2019s misunderstanding that exists on both sides. And we have to come up with ways in which we bridge those gaps so that people don\u2019t demonize other people so that people understand on both sides they\u2019re people trying to do the best that they can. We\u2019re not at a stage where I can honestly say, you know, truthfully say that if you\u2019re a person of color, you should not be concerned about any interaction that you have with the police in the same way I can\u2019t say to a police officer, shouldn\u2019t worry about what community you are being asked to operate in.\u201d\n\nWhen Reid asked about a 2001 case in New York in which officers were acquitted in the killing of a young west African immigrant and at that time, Holder issued a memorandum saying there is \u201cmistrust between black communities and police that needed to be bridged.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means that we as a nation have failed,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that. We have failed. We have understood that these issues have existed long before even that 2001 memorandum by that then young deputy attorney general. These are issues we\u2019ve been and it\u2019s why we have to seize this opportunity that we now have. We have a moment in time. That we can, perhaps, come up with some meaningful change. It\u2019s what I\u2019m committed to doing, even in the limited time I have left as Attorney General and I\u2019ll certainly continue to do it after I leave office. It\u2019s what this administration is committed to.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thursday on MSNBC's \"The Reid Report,\" Attorney General Eric Holder said \"We as a nation have failed,\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Thursday on MSNBC's \"The Reid Report,\" Attorney General Eric Holder said \"We as a nation have failed,\"", "title": "Eric Holder: 'We As A Nation Have Failed' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Eric-Holder.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/12/18/eric-holder-we-as-a-nation-have-failed/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thursday on MSNBC's \"The Reid Report,\" Attorney General Eric Holder said \"We as a nation have failed,\"", "title": "Eric Holder: 'We As A Nation Have Failed' - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Eric-Holder.jpg", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Crime, Eric Holder, White House,Breitbart TV,Eric Holder", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-12-18T12:08:50-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThursday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Reid Report,\u201d outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder said \u201cWe as a nation have failed,\u201d to address the mistrust between black communities and the police.\nWe have understood that these issues have existed long before even that 2001 memorandum by that then young deputy attorney general.\nIt\u2019s what I\u2019m committed to doing, even in the limited time I have left as Attorney General and I\u2019ll certainly continue to do it after I leave office.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cI don\u2019t think they should fear the police,\u201d Holder said.\n\u201cBut I certainly think we have to build up a better relationship between young people, people of color, and people in law enforcement."}
