Ultimate Fighting Championship superstar Matt “The Immortal” Brown took time out from training for an upcoming battle with former interim champ Carlos Condit to offer BizPac Review a few thoughts about how U.S. troops overseas are suffering under the government shutdown.

U.S. troops have had to do without post-season Major League Baseball and NFL football coverage as the situation worsens and the president fails to negotiate on Obamacare.

When Brown was asked about the troops losing the coverage, he said:

“I have the highest respect for our soldiers and wish all the best for them. Apparently, Obama thinks differently. Our soldiers should be treated with respect and should not be subject to the downfalls of the American political system. It’s very disheartening to hear that our soldiers are suffering even more than usual because our politicians can not agree on anything. The last people that should suffer is them. Again, Obama thinks differently. I wish the troops the best and hope I can make a difference in getting some entertainment back to them.”

Brown had a message for Obama and his administration:

“I would tell the president that he needs a reality check. He should go serve for a year in the Middle East and see firsthand what it is like to be there. Obviously, he has no clue and no empathy for these men and women.”
