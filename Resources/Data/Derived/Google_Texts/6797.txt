(Newser) – People have claimed to have heard God instruct them to do all sorts of things over the years, but this is probably a first: "I felt the Lord say to me, ‘Go feed the strippers,'" Erin Stevens tells Fox News. The calling came to Stevens, a pastor's wife in Nashville, following a 21-day fast. So Stevens formed her own ministry under an organization called Strip Church, a network of ministries around the world with a shared mission of reaching out to those in the sex industry. In her own branch of Strip Church, Stevens says she takes home-cooked meals to local clubs, and offers moral support and guidance to the women dancing there.

So far, Stevens has met with 100 dancers across 10 to 15 clubs, and at least one woman says she's left her stripping career thanks to her efforts. "I had been missing so much from my life and had been hiding,” says the woman, a 23-year-old mother. "(Stevens) said, ‘I’m here if you need me, give me a call if you need any help. She said God still loves me, basically." She has now found work as a security guard and is studying for an associate's degree in criminal justice, reports the Christian Post.
