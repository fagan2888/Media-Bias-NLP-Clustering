[WATCH] Jimmy Fallon and Miranda Kerr play an intense game of flip cup to get Kerr ‘into the American culture’

There’s nothing more American than drinking games and supermodels, especially if you combine the two.

On his show Thursday night, Jimmy Fallon did just that and introduced Miranda Kerr to the wonder that is “Flip Cup.”

“I’ve never played this game before, but I’ve gotta get into the American culture,” Kerr joked.

Fallon has also taught Kerr’s fellow models Gisele Bundchen and Kate Upton how to play the college drinking game. They were all surprisingly good at it, considering they skipped out on college and probably don’t regularly chug cheap beer.
