But we can reveal this: Donald Trump competes for last place on our list with Rand Paul. We don\u2019t think either man should be the next president of the United States.\n\nSo we\u2019re not Trump enthusiasts. We\u2019re not even Trump fellow travelers. We\u2019re closer to Trump deriders. But we do remember 1992. Ross Perot was, as a presidential candidate, something of an oddball and egomaniac. The George H. W. Bush campaign mocked and dismissed him. Bush might have been reelected if the campaign had instead taken the attitude that there are things to be learned from smart oddballs and eccentric egomaniacs who have a feel for public opinion.\n\nWhat might we learn from listening to Trump?\n\nTrump understands that Americans aspire to greatness. His campaign slogan is \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d Sound familiar? A prominent Ronald Reagan slogan in 1980 was \u201cLet\u2019s Make America Great Again.\u201d In his announcement speech Trump repeated several times\u2014and repetition may not be as foolish in politics as all the pundits who disapproved of Trump\u2019s verbosity think\u2014that \u201cwe are going to make our country great again.\u201d And he concluded his remarks, \u201cSadly, the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.\u201d Politics is about dreams as much as it is about deliverables, about pride as much as it\u2019s about pocketbooks. Trump understands that. It\u2019s not clear most of the rest of the field does.\n\nTrump understands that Americans like winning: \u201cOur country is in serious trouble. We don\u2019t have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don\u2019t have them.\u201d Trump is aware the public believes international politics is more zero-sum than globalist elites like to think. \u201cOur enemies are getting stronger and stronger, by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.\u201d So Trump is pro-tough-trade-negotiations, he\u2019s pro-China-bashing, and he\u2019s pro-military. \u201cI will find within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that\u2019s going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.\u201d A bit simple-minded? Sure. Closer to the truth than the cocktail partiers at Davos? Probably. Closer in sentiment to the American people? Certainly. Trump understands that many Americans believe winning isn\u2019t everything, but it\u2019s a good thing. A very good thing. It\u2019s not clear most of the rest of the field does.\n\nTrump understands the centrality of Obamacare on the domestic front. \u201cWe have a disaster called the big lie: Obama-care.\u201d \u201cObamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting.\u201d And so Trump understands that it\u2019s important to emphasize that Obamacare must be repealed and replaced. It\u2019s not clear most of the rest of the field does.\n\nTrump understands that, in running for president, it is a major disadvantage to never have been elected to anything. But he\u2019s a turn-lemons-into-lemonade type guy. So he goes after politicians. \u201cI\u2019ve watched the politicians. I\u2019ve dealt with them all my life. If you can\u2019t make a good deal with a politician, then there\u2019s something wrong with you. You\u2019re certainly not very good. And that\u2019s what we have representing us. They will never make America great again.\u201d Trump understands that Americans have deep doubts about the competence and probity of our political class. It\u2019s not clear most of the rest of the field does.\n\nTrump understands that Republican primary voters don\u2019t want a nominee who will shy away from criticism of President Obama. \u201cOur president doesn\u2019t have a clue. He\u2019s a bad negotiator. He\u2019s the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists. . . . We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor, a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.\u201d Trump understands that it\u2019s okay to say something the media elite will shake their collective head at. It\u2019s not clear most of the rest of the field does.\n\nWe trust Trump will not be the Republican nominee. But Trump could win significant support from Perot-type voters in primaries who will then be up for grabs in the general election. Bill Clinton has already begun sweet-talking him: Trump \u201chas been . . . uncommonly nice to Hillary and me.\u201d Republicans need not compete with the master in flattering Trump. But imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. A little touch of Trump in the rhetoric, the attitude, the bearing of the other Republican candidates could go a long way toward making this election more like 1980 than 1992.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Donald Trump,Editorial,William Kristol", "og": {"site_name": "Weekly Standard", "description": "We are not allowed, needless to say, to disclose our top secret list ranking the GOP presidential candidates from top to bottom.
