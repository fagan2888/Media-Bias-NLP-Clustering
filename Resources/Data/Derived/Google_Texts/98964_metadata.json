Instead, the economy took another dip, with real GDP contracting by an annualized 1.6 percent in the third quarter.\n\nSo is it time to buy Japanese stocks? No, seriously.\n\nTokyo\u2019s Nikkei index lost 3 percent after the surprising GDP news, but analysts at Capital Economics on Monday made the case that the disappointing growth figure provides some reasons to be relatively optimistic about Japanese shares. \u201cThe news has actually prompted us to predict even more yen weakness and a stronger outperformance by Japanese equities in the year ahead,\u201d Julian Jessop, the firm\u2019s chief global economist, wrote in a research note.\n\nRelated: The Eurozone Economy Is Not in Recession, but Is Still a Mess\n\nThat prediction is grounded in expectations that the Bank of Japan, which recently announced surprisingly aggressive stimulus measures, will have to keep its policies much more aggressive, especially as compared to the U.S. Federal Reserve. And an adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has already called for a fiscal stimulus package of more than $25 billion, too.\n\n\u201cIn short, Japan\u2019s drop back into recession will strengthen disinflationary pressures and reinforces the divergence in the prospects for monetary policy relative to those in the U.S.,\u201d Jessop wrote. \u201cWe expect the Fed to raise interest rates sooner and further than the markets currently anticipate, with the first hike coming in the first half of next year and perhaps as early as March. In contrast, the Bank of Japan has just stepped up its asset purchases and will probably have to do substantially more.\u201d\n\nRelated: Landmark China/Hong-Kong Stock Trading Scheme Starts Nov. 17\n\nJessop said, based on his forecast for a weakening yen and the recent relationship between the currency and Japanese equities, the Nikkei could soar from its current level just below 17,000 to 23,000. \u201cIn reality there may be other factors pulling the other way \u2014 notably the performances of overseas markets, the state of global risk appetite (the main risk to our yen forecast), and the progress on other elements of \u2018Abenomics,\u2019\u201d Jessop wrote. \u201cOn balance, then, we are raising our end-2015 forecast for the Nikkei from 18,000 to 20,000 \u2013 still a gain of around 18 percent from Monday\u2019s close of 16,974.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For the third time in four years, the Japanese economy has skidded back into recession", "title": "Japan Is Back in Recession.
