CHICAGO (AP) — An appearance by Kim Kardashian on the National Public Radio show “Wait Wait … Don’t Tell Me!” has angered among some listeners.

NPR received hundreds of complaints about last week’s episode of the humorous quiz show. Kardashian was in a segment called “Not My Job,” in which she answered questions about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. She answered two of three questions correctly.

But many listeners were outraged that she was on the Chicago-based show. Some have threatened to stop donating to the nonprofit NPR.

In a response posted on NPR’s website, ombudsman Elizabeth Jenson said she wasn’t sure what to make of the outrage over Kardashian’s 11-minute appearance. She said while Kardashian wasn’t a great guest, “she was gracious” and had a couple of funny lines.
