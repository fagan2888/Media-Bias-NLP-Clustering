On Thursday, Day 6.]\n\n[Click here for a gallery of photos from the series.]\n\nDr. Chris Flynn was about two hours from completing a recent eight-hour shift at the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital emergency room, but the majority of the cases he'd seen hadn't been broken arms, wounds needing stitches or head injuries.\n\nOf the 22 patients Flynn had seen that day, 16 involved what he calls \u201csocial failure\u201d \u2014 people with untreated mental illness, drug addiction or both.\n\nFlynn has been working at the Cottage ER since 1997, and said that \u201cthe level of desperation of social issues\u201d is higher than it\u2019s ever been.\n\n| Santa Barbara County's Safety Net | About This Series |\n\nAs an example, he pulled up the records of a young woman, a schizophrenic, who has visited the ER 99 times since the beginning of the year.\n\nHe said she doesn\u2019t have the support at home to help manage her illness, and constantly ends up in the emergency room when her manic episodes begin.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that she\u2019ll go back to a family system that isn\u2019t helping things,\u201d he said. \"Half of our ER is dedicated to mental-health or social issues.\"\n\nThe model of acute emergency room care doesn\u2019t work well for psychiatric patients, who are only seen by someone in the medical community if they\u2019re deemed suicidal.\n\nOnce the threat has passed, they\u2019re released back into the world, with no treatment and no follow up, Flynn said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending hundreds of thousands of dollars for a system that doesn\u2019t help them get better,\u201d he said, adding that the sheer volume of psychiatric patients is becoming a burden to the emergency room.\n\nA third of the patients seen in the ER has no means of paying for treatment, so the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which goes into effect Jan. 1, may help alleviate some of that financial burden.\n\nAs Medi-Cal enrollment expands under the new law, many people may qualify for preventive mental-health services for the first time, and many people who already have insurance may see coverage for some services and treatments that were not covered in the past.\n\nFor now, people with severe untreated mental illness remain a staple in the emergency room.\n\nIn the ER, bed turnover is key, and Flynn looked at the patient log and the column that shows how long patients have been there.\n\nWith patients who come in for more traditional ER causes, they\u2019ll typically spend a couple of hours being treated before they\u2019re released.\n\nWith psychiatric patients, that timeframe grows exponentially.\n\nFlynn\u2019s computer log shows patients being held in the ER for 46, 50, even 72 hours.\n\nAll the while, ER staff may be trying to get these patients moved to one of the 16 involuntary-treatment beds at Santa Barbara County's Psychiatric Health Facility or to a similar facility in Ventura.\n\nBut many times those beds are taken, and if someone in the ER with a mental-health crisis has drugs or alcohol in his or her system, the patient will not be admitted to the county\u2019s facilities at all.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very hard to place,\u201d he said of the patients.\n\nThe floor Cottage uses to house psychiatric patients during their \u201cholds\u201d \u2014 which can be up to 72 hours, or until they are deemed not to be a threat to themselves or others \u2014 is not a therapeutic space, Flynn said, and patients spend their hours in the 8-by-12-foot rooms monitored by a nurse.\n\nSeveral security guards also sit nearby in case patients become aggressive.\n\nUntreated mental health overlaps with homelessness in many people, and that group may be one of the biggest to benefit from the expansion of the new health-care law in Santa Barbara County.\n\nRalph Barbosa, director of the county's Health Care for the Homeless Program, said that more than 85 percent of the homeless people it treats as a part of the program will be newly covered under the expansion.\n\n\"This is the one area that it's most profound,\" he said of the new law.\n\nHomelessness can range from someone who is chronically sleeping on the streets to someone who just lost his or her house and is staying on a friend's couch, and Barbosa said the program sees anywhere from 4,500-5,500 unique clients a year.\n\nAnnie Lucier, a public-health nurse who works with Health Care for the Homeless, does street outreach in local parks and at places like the Salvation Army.\n\nShe says her \"focus is medical, but oftentimes there's a psych component\" with the patients she sees. Lucier adds that she tries to triage or link them to services if possible.\n\nMental health continues to be a huge issue for the homeless, she said, as well as other medical problems such as diabetes and \"general poor health.\u201d\n\nBecause county mental health officials are focused on state mandates that say they must treat the most seriously mentally ill, \"it's a really high plateau to actually receive care,\" Barbosa said.\n\nDr. Takashi Wada, director of the county Public Health Department, said the county has a responsibility to provide care for the severely mentally ill, including those covered by Medi-Cal.\n\nPrimary-care providers in the community are supposed to be able to help treat those who have mental-illness diagnoses that aren\u2019t as serious.\n\nBut \u201cthere\u2019s a huge gap between what primary care is comfortable treating and what the county can take on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRight now, when we see indigent patients, there\u2019s no reimbursement. That becomes a financial challenge.\"\n\nWith many indigent patients converting to regular Medi-Cal, the county should see a new reimbursement stream.\n\nUnder the new law, some benefits are expanded, such as for residential detox programs for people with addiction issues and for treatment at day centers.\n\nThat expansion may also help the same population, since many people with mental illness also struggle with substance abuse.\n\nAs with other medical problems, early treatment for mental health problems is key.\n\n\u201cHopefully, a lot of those problems will be treated early,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk staff writer Lara Cooper can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .
