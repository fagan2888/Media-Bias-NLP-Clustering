I was about to take a shower, yelling from the bathroom,She had forgotten to pay the bill. In the small Florida town where we live, I would have to get dressed and drive two miles to the water company. Then, wait for the leisurely paced workers to get around to turning my water back on. How annoying. What a pain. That was the biggest issue of my day that morning.As the nightmare of 9/11 unfolded, several of my fellow Americans who simply showed up for work were faced with a horrific decision; whether to be consumed in the inferno or jump to their deaths from the towers. Many became \"the jumpers.\" Who was responsible for putting my fellow Americans in such an unimaginable horrific position? Al Qaeda.That same day, American Todd Beamer on board flight UA93 thought to call his wife Lisa, but did not want to worry her. He called GTE supervisor Lisa Jefferson to say that their plane had been hijacked. Beamer lead passengers in voting to storm the cockpit and take over the plane. Beamer instructed Jefferson,Jefferson heard Beamer's voice,Flight UA93 crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. Who were the hijackers? Al Qaeda.September 11, 2012, U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and embassy security personnel, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were killed during an attack on our consulate in Benghazi while expecting help that never arrived. Who were the attackers. Al Qaeda.Ironically, as we approach another anniversary of the 9/11 attack, Obama and Secretary Kerry are arguing that the U.S is morally obligated to bomb the Assad regime for allegedly gassing Al Qaeda which is responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent Americans.To put this crazy scenario into perspective, imagine the KKK and the Aryan Nation fighting each other. The KKK gases the Aryan Nation. The NAACP joins the Aryan Nation in attacking the KKK for using an immoral weapon.Obama and Kerry claim their desire to bomb Syria is about Assad gassing a few hundred children and national security. America must not be perceived as a paper tiger.Well, why were both these guys vehemently opposed to President Bush attacking Saddam Hussein who on a single day gassed 5,000 of his own people? Over a few decades, Saddam used various gasses to kill 50,000 of his own people. Saddam used poison gas against his own people 50 times more than Assad. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTnpRrHDkOA As for Kerry and Obama claiming that we can not risk America being perceived as a paper tiger, I say, \"too late.\" The 2001 September 11th attack was the result of past wimpy responses to terrorism by a Democrat president. http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1490017/posts Obama has merely continued the Democrat's weak blame-America-first tradition. Before unpacking his bags upon his arrival in the White House, Obama went on his world apologize-for-America-tour.What has been our paper tiger president's forceful response to terrorism? Pretend it does not exist.President Obama's relentless efforts to protect his false narrative that Al Qaeda is on the run continues to have devastating consequences for Americans. The Fort Hood shooting was a Jihadist mass murder; unquestionably proven to be a terrorist attack. Coldly, the Obama Administration stands firm in classifying it as \"work place violence\" which denies the victims combat benefits. Also, while in prison, Nidal Hasan, the shooter received $270,000 from the U.S. Government while his victims had to pay their own medical bills. http://bit.ly/1a19kG0 Despite knowing almost immediately that it was Al Qaeda who attacked our consulate in Benghazi, killed Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans, for weeks, the Obama Administration promoted the lie that the attackers were a spontaneous mob angry over a youtube view.Finally, after 11 months the Obama Administration has charged the first suspects in connection with the Benghazi terror attack. http://fxn.ws/17580kP Learning how to build a bomb in an Al Qaeda magazine, Dzhohar Tsarnaev expressed his extremist Islamist beliefs by killing 8 year old Martin Richard, Krystle Campbell and Lu Lingzi; injuring over 260, at least 16 suffered severed limbs. http://bit.ly/13bNRfq And yet, the Obama Administration rushed to Mirandize Dzhokhar, the surviving Boston bomber. http://bit.ly/15VsFLe Secretary Kerry's holier-than-thou concern for Syrians and hostile comment to Rep. Duncan was a bit much to stomach given the Obama Administration's pattern of putting justice and compassion for suffering Americans last.Remarkably, Kerry has even opened the door to possible deployment of U.S. troops to Syria. http://bit.ly/176awcm Can you imagine our air force and troops providing military might for Al Qaeda?How do you explain that to the families of the 9/11 jumpers, other victims of 9/11, the Ft Hood shooting victims, the Boston Marathon bomb victims and the four Americans killed in Benghazi, all devastated by extremist Islamist terrorists, Al Qaeda?\u00a9 Lloyd Marcus", "article_metadata": {"description": "September 11, 2001, I was annoyed at my wife, Mary.
