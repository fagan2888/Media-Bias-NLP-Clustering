(AP) - As a blanket of gray clouds rolls over the prairie, the grunts of scrimmage, the shrill chirp of the referee\u2019s whistle and cheers from the crowd fill the Saturday afternoon air. This is how a small town turns a page in history.\n\nAfter 27 years, football is back in Alexander. The Comets have returned.\n\nThe first high school football game here in a generation comes thanks to the oil boom that\u2019s reversed the fortunes of this tiny school. Enrollment is up after years of decline. And 13 young men in cardinal red, gray and white - some recent North Dakota arrivals - are new celebrities in this rejuvenated town.\n\n\u201cHigh school sports - that\u2019s what people live and breathe for in small-town North Dakota,\u201d says Jerry Hatter, Alexander\u2019s mayor. \u201cIt brings back a sense of pride to the community. \u2026 To see football again in our own little town \u2026 I think it\u2019s just neater than hell.\u201d\n\nAlexander\u2019s return to the gridiron is a story of revival and resilience - for the school and the latest Comets team.\n\nLike many rural schools, Alexander has struggled to keep its doors open. Enrollment from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade dropped to just 41 in 2006-2007. The Bakken oil bonanza changed all that, luring new workers and their children to the area. The school, where all grades attend in a single building, now has 210 students, a number projected to grow. But the Class of 2016 - with just four members - is still small enough to fit at a card table.\n\nNow that football is back, there\u2019s buzz all around town. Old-timers are reminiscing about their glory days. The new Comets, whose coach is also an oil worker, are bracing for a tough season. And most everyone else knows where they\u2019ll spend Saturday afternoons this fall.\n\n\u201cHaving a football team to rally around strengthens the community,\u201d says Leslie Bieber, Alexander\u2019s superintendent, who spearheaded efforts to rebuild the team. \u201cIt allows us to have our identity again.\u201d\n\nA lot of townsfolk helped make it happen. Last May, a few hundred people gathered at a semi-formal ball at the firehouse and, on a single night, raised more than $50,000 for jerseys, helmets and other equipment. Some of that money also will go to the girls and boys basketball and girls volleyball teams that are resuming after 11 years.\n\nThe official football launch came on the first Saturday in September as Alexander celebrated Old Settlers\u2019 Day for the 70th year with a parade along Elk Street, past the post office, the Hard Ride Saloon, the Lions Burger Fry grill and the Ragged Butte Spring that was a watering hole for cattle in pioneer days.\n\nHorse-drawn open wagons led the way, followed by a clown in a miniature yellow car, vintage autos and fire department vehicles. Then came the floats with the Class of \u201865, marking its 50th anniversary, and after their long absences, the girls\u2019 volleyball team and the Comets, who tossed candy to kids in the crowd.\n\nTaking it all in, Jim Jacobson recalled how Comets football is in his family\u2019s DNA. His father, Garvin, was plucked from the wheat fields when he was 15 to play in the first game, around 1925. Jim followed, starting in the late 1950s, and his son, Todd, played the last season in 1987. Now his grandson, Dayden Rafferty, is wearing the uniform.\n\n\u201cFamily has been here since \u201805 and we\u2019re still a part of the community,\u201d Jacobson says proudly. \u201cHaving a team that\u2019s your own is something special. We\u2019ve been missing that for a long time.\u201d\n\nFolks who\u2019d been gone for decades began arriving hours before the game. Some were former Comets with weathered faces, silver hair and flawless memories of their gridiron exploits. Other people traveled from South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming for the momentous occasion.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Why all the hype?\u2019\u201d says Margaret Bottke, class of \u201856, who made the nearly 600-mlle drive from Missoula, Montana. \u201cNow I understand. \u2026 What else would hold a small community like this together? It\u2019s church on Sunday and games the rest of the week.\u201d\n\nHundreds of fans, some wearing cowboy hats and boots, others in Comets t-shirts and sweatshirts, huddled in the bleachers or clustered along the sidelines as the game got underway. Others sat on the back of pickups or remained behind the wheel, honking persistently when Alexander scored.\n\nJulie Riggs, who painted a red \u201c25\u201d on her left cheek for the jersey number of her son, Tyler Hayden, says being a Comet provides life lessons. \u201cOne of the things these kids learn is there\u2019s something bigger than themselves,\u201d she said between cheers.\n\nCoach Kevin Clausen has a similar message for his squad: \u201cWe\u2019re all in it together. There\u2019s not one person more important than the other. \u2026We represent the school, the community, everybody that\u2019s ever played here.\u201d\n\nThe Comets play six-man football, and since North Dakota doesn\u2019t have that division, its competitors are Montana schools.\n\nThis year\u2019s squad is a collection of homegrown kids and transplants from states including Florida, California, Louisiana, and Arkansas. Many have never played football. Several have endured hard times.\n\nNick Armour, the 16-year-old quarterback who also is a saddle bronco rider, suffered a double tragedy in January. He lost his 18-old-year-old brother, Brady, and best buddy, Nathan Sims, 16, when they were killed in a car accident.\n\nHe and Sims were looking forward to being teammates. \u201cI sure would like to have a really good season for him,\u201d he says.\n\nRyan Bergstrom, 16, a Florida native, normally would work after school to ease the financial load for his mother, who manages a man camp for oil workers. This fall, he says, she told him to pursue his football dream. He\u2019s committed to the Comets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a brotherhood like no other,\u201d he says.\n\nJack Heen, 14, the youngest varsity player, is playing with a heart condition, but has the approval of his doctor and the school nurse, who happens to be his mother. \u201cLife\u2019s a lot better when I\u2019m playing sports,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd there\u2019s Jayy Morgan, 18, the only senior, who arrived this spring from California eager to join the team, though basketball is his true passion. \u201cI love the town and I\u2019m pretty sure I can get the town to love me,\u201d he says.\n\nMorgan\u2019s plans were almost derailed when his mother needed him to work to help make ends meet. When he told school officials he might have to quit, the teachers, coach and others rallied - with his mother\u2019s OK - to help with the bills for the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cWhen I say we are a family, we ARE a family,\u201d Bieber says, growing tearful at times as she talks about the team\u2019s return. \u201cOur students are not just our students. They\u2019re our kids. They would do it for anyone if he\u2019s an athlete or not.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, Morgan was a fan favorite. He scored all three Comets\u2019 touchdowns.\n\nUnfortunately, the team\u2019s first game back was a rout - 65 to 18 - by the much larger Grass Range/Winnett High School team from Montana. But the crowd didn\u2019t seem discouraged.\n\nBruised but unbowed, the Comets walked off the field to shouts of \u201cGood job, you guys! We love you!\u201d\n\nAnd there was a rousing cheer:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our team and we couldn\u2019t be prouder.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe us, we\u2019ll yell a little louder!\u201d\n\nTownsfolk hope this fall ritual is here to stay. One encouraging sign: A school addition is being built and enrollment is expected to surpass 360 in three years.\n\nJacobson, who wore his Comets jersey long ago, says it\u2019ll take time to develop a strong team.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to take their lumps \u2026 but they\u2019re going to learn and get better,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve got to realize the community is always behind them.\u201d\n\nBergstrom, who plays both running back and linebacker, took the shellacking in stride.\n\n\u201cThis is the first game in 30 or so years, and we all really tried our best, tried our hardest,\u201d he said, \u201c\u2026 so even though we lost today it was still a win in the end.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSharon Cohen, a Chicago-based national writer, can be reached at scohen@ap.org.
