2014 Ca単on Proud Clean-Up

Local officials and businesses are once again gearing up for the annual Ca単on Proud Clean-Up Campaign. A limited number of trash vouchers for free disposal of household trash, furniture, construction debris, brush, logs, leaves and yard waste will be available on a first-come, first-served basis to Ca単on City and Fremont County residents beginning on March 24 and ending on April 30.

Trash vouchers are good for free disposal of 2.5 cubic yards (one regular pick-up truck bed filled no higher than the sideboards) at Twin Enviro's "Phantom Landfill" at 2500 CR 67 (north of the airport), Penrose, 372-6671. (Amounts of trash in excess of 2.5 cubic yards will be charged extra on site.) Hours of operation are from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Saturday.

Ca単on City residents may pick up a voucher from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday at City Hall, 128 Main St. Those living outside the city limits may pick up a voucher from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday (they are closed on Friday) at Room 106 of the Fremont County Administration Building, 615 Macon Ave. Proof of residency is required when obtaining a voucher. Only one voucher will be issued per household. Free disposal will end at 4 p.m. April 30. All loads must be covered, and no commercial haulers or contractors qualify for these vouchers.

Partners in this event include Twin Enviro Services, R.D. Recycling, Junk Masters, and Call it Gone Metal Recyclers.
