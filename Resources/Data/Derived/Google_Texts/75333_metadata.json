(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nThe president is upset. Very upset. Frustrated and angry. Seething about the government\u2019s handling of Ebola, said the front-page headline in the New York Times last Saturday.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem with this pose, so obligingly transcribed for him by the Times. It\u2019s his government. He\u2019s president. Has been for six years. Yet Barack Obama reflexively insists on playing the shocked outsider when something goes wrong within his own administration.\n\nThe IRS? \u201cIt\u2019s inexcusable, and Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it,\u201d he thundered in May 2013 when the story broke of the agency targeting conservative groups. \u201cI will not tolerate this kind of behavior in any agency, but especially in the IRS.\u201d\n\nExcept that within nine months, Obama had grown far more tolerant, retroactively declaring this to be a phony scandal without \u201ca smidgen of corruption.\u201d\n\nObamacare rollout? \u201cNobody is more frustrated by that than I am,\u201d said an aggrieved Obama about the botching of the central element of his signature legislative achievement. \u201cNobody is madder than me.\u201d\n\nVeterans Affairs scandal? Presidential chief of staff Denis McDonough explained: \u201cSecretary [Eric] Shinseki said yesterday . . . that he\u2019s mad as hell and the president is madder than hell.\u201d A nice touch \u2014 taking anger to the next level.\n\nThe president himself declared: \u201cI will not stand for it.\u201d But since the administration itself said the problem was long-standing, indeed predating Obama, this means he had stood for it for 5\u00bd years.\n\nThe one scandal where you could credit the president with genuine anger and obliviousness involves the recent breaches of White House Secret Service protection. The Washington Post described the first lady and president as \u201cangry and upset,\u201d and no doubt they were. But the first Secret Service scandal \u2014 the hookers of Cartagena \u2014 evinced this from the president: \u201cIf it turns out that some of the allegations that have been made in the press are confirmed, then of course I\u2019ll be angry.\u201d An innovation in ostentatious distancing: future conditional indignation.\n\nThese shows of calculated outrage \u2014 and thus distance \u2014 are becoming not just unconvincing but unamusing. In our system, the president is both head of state and head of government. Obama seems to enjoy the monarchial parts, but when it comes to the actual business of running government, he shows little interest and even less aptitude.\n\nHis principal job, after all, is to administer the government and to get the right people to do it. (That\u2019s why we typically send governors rather than senators to the White House.) That\u2019s called management. Obama had never managed anything before running for the biggest management job on earth. It shows.\n\nWhat makes the problem even more acute is that Obama represents not just the party of government but a grandiose conception of government as the prime mover of social and economic life. The very theme of his presidency is that government can and should be trusted to do great things. And therefore society should be prepared to hand over large chunks of its operations \u2014 from health care (one-sixth of the economy) to carbon regulation down to free contraception \u2014 to the central administrative state.\n\nBut this presupposes a Leviathan not just benign but competent. When it then turns out that vast, faceless bureaucracies tend to be incapable, inadequate, hopelessly inefficient and often corrupt, Obama resorts to expressions of angry surprise.\n\nHe must. He\u2019s not simply protecting his own political fortunes. He\u2019s trying to protect faith in the entitlement state by portraying its repeated failures as shocking anomalies.\n\nUnfortunately, the pretense has the opposite effect. It produces not reassurance but anxiety. Obama\u2019s determined detachment conveys the feeling that nobody\u2019s home. No one leading. Not even from behind.\n\nA poll conducted two weeks ago showed that 64 percent of likely voters (in competitive races) think that \u201cthings in the U.S. feel like they are out of control.\u201d This is one degree of anxiety beyond thinking the country is on the wrong track. That\u2019s been negative for years, and it\u2019s a reflection of failed policies that in principle can be changed. Regaining control, on the other hand, is a far dicier proposition.\n\nWith events in the saddle and a sense of disorder growing \u2014 the summer border crisis, Ferguson, the rise of the Islamic State, Ebola \u2014 the nation expects from the White House not miracles but competence. At a minimum, mere presence. An observer presidency with its bewildered-bystander pose only adds to the unease.\n\nRead more from Charles Krauthammer\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president\u2019s determined detachment conveys the feeling that nobody\u2019s home.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Krauthammer/95978776589", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The president\u2019s determined detachment conveys the feeling that nobody\u2019s home.", "title": "Barack Obama, bewildered bystander", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/barack-obama-bewildered-bystander/2014/10/23/335bd0e2-5aeb-11e4-b812-38518ae74c67_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/23/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Obama_Ebola-06735-5035.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@krauthammer"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/barack-obama-bewildered-bystander/2014/10/23/335bd0e2-5aeb-11e4-b812-38518ae74c67_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "charles krauthammer, obama leadership, obama ebola, obama irs scandal, obama new york times, obama corruption, obamacare rollout, obama veterans affairs, obama approval rating, obama summer border crisis, obama ferguson, obama islamic state, obama bewildered", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Krauthammer/95978776589"}, "news_keywords": "charles krauthammer, obama leadership, obama ebola, obama irs scandal, obama new york times, obama corruption, obamacare rollout, obama veterans affairs, obama approval rating, obama summer border crisis, obama ferguson, obama islamic state, obama bewildered", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "335bd0e2-5aeb-11e4-b812-38518ae74c67"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf4a6\"", "article_summary": "He\u2019s president.\nPresident Barack Obama pauses as he speaks to the media about the government\u2019s Ebola response in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2014, in Washington.\nYet Barack Obama reflexively insists on playing the shocked outsider when something goes wrong within his own administration.\n(That\u2019s why we typically send governors rather than senators to the White House.)\nThe one scandal where you could credit the president with genuine anger and obliviousness involves the recent breaches of White House Secret Service protection."}
