(AP) - His restaurant closing is one thing, but finding a place for the treasures within is another.\n\nDarrell \u201cBo\u201d Smith has come to grips with the reality that his 29-year-old business, Tascali\u2019s Decades Pasta and Grill, will open for the last time on Tuesday. What he has not yet determined, however, is the fate of the massive amount of unique memorabilia which adorns the walls of the restaurant, and what will become of the coveted 29th Street Wiggin\u2019s Barbecue recipes.\n\nWiggin\u2019s was known for its carhop service of spaghetti, barbecue sandwiches and homemade dishes.\n\n\u201cI have a buyer for all the equipment and furnishings, but I\u2019m keeping ownership of the memorabilia and recipes,\u201d Smith said, citing his age and other life factors as reasons for closing. \u201cBut I have this wonderful memorabilia that needs a home. These amazing works should remain in public domain. I could sell them, but I\u2019d rather it be displayed in the right place.\u201d\n\nSmith, 70, said one aspect of the memorabilia in particular, the murals which have been a 10-year effort of artist Tim Decker, need a home along with the recipes. Since its beginning, Tascali\u2019s Italian-American menu has featured the Wiggin\u2019s recipes, which are more than 75 years old.\n\n\u201cI will continue to look for an opportunity to find an outlet for the 29th Street Wiggin\u2019s Barbecue recipes, which have been a staple of Tascali\u2019s these past 29 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new owner is not interested in the recipes, and 40 percent of our customers eat something made from the Wiggin\u2019s recipes.\u201d\n\nFounded in November of 1985 by Smith and his business partner, the late Edward Humphries, Tascali\u2019s was originally located at 5505 U.S. Route 60 East in Huntington. The restaurant operated in that location for 19 years before moving to its current location at 6007 U.S. 60 in Barboursville\u2019s River Place Shopping Center in 2005. Smith retired from Inco Alloys in 2000 at age 55.\n\nWhen the restaurant relocated, Smith launched its current \u201cDecades Pasta and Grill\u201d theme which features three dining rooms, each containing 20 years of history illustrated by the aforementioned murals, calendars, posters and individualized music beginning with the attack on Pearl Harbor and ending with the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n\u201cI am proud of what we accomplished these past 29 years,\u201d Smith said. \u201cMy most significant rewards have come with the human interaction with the staff and customers.\u201d Tascali\u2019s currently has between 14 and 16 employees. Smith said he doesn\u2019t know if the new owner intends to retain any of the current staff, but through the years, his employees have been the catalyst for some of his more fond memories.\n\n\u201cI have watched many of my past employees use Tascali\u2019s as a spring-board to start their careers and their families,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen former employees come in with their children it only reinforces the fact that a business\u2019 success is not always measured by a profit-and-loss statement.\u201d Smith praised his staff - Natasha Workman in particular - for continuing to work, thus not forcing Tascali\u2019s to abruptly close.\n\nHe also thanked his customers.\n\n\u201cI want to thank our customers not only for their continued support, patronage and understanding,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for the memories they have shared about the role Tascali\u2019s has played in their lives over the years.\u201d The new owner and tenant of the location at 6007 U.S. Route 60 will open Fratelli\u2019s Italian Restaurant, slated to open in early June.\n\nSmith will for the first time be fully retired as of April 1. He said he will likely spend most of his time remodeling his house with his wife, Pat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the road,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe are doing what we have to do. As Bob Hope would say, \u2018Thanks for the memories.\u2019\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Herald-Dispatch, http://www.herald-dispatch.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "His restaurant closing is one thing, but finding a place for the treasures within is another.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "His restaurant closing is one thing, but finding a place for the treasures within is another.", "title": "Owner of closing W.Va. restaurant ponders fate of murals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/28/owner-of-closing-wva-restaurant-ponders-fate-of-mu/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/28/92350272d7b9ea0d710f6a7067006292.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/28/92350272d7b9ea0d710f6a7067006292.jpg", "description": "His restaurant closing is one thing, but finding a place for the treasures within is another.", "card": "summary", "title": "Owner of closing W.Va. restaurant ponders fate of murals"}, "Author": "BRANDON ROBERTS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "HUNTINGTON, W.Va.
