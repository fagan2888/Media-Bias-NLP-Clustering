This weekend she joined guest host Matthew Boyle to guide listeners through her plan.\n\nBoyle first highlighted a few extremely prominent Democrats who have placed McCain among their favorite Republicans, including 2016 Democratic Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, as well as likely incoming Senate Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a mutual admiration society over there between Hillary Clinton and John McCain,\u201d Ward said to Boyle.\n\n\u201cThey all seem to like him because of his moderate or Democrat-light willingness to sell this country down the road.\u201d\n\nWard pointed to what she sees as McCain\u2019s greatest shortcomings.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s voted for tax hikes, he\u2019s voted for massive new spending, he\u2019s voted for bailouts, he voted for amnesty, he voted for liberal judges, it just goes on and on and on. Ya know that vote on the budget.\u201d\n\nWard explained the she believes the votes show McCain\u2019s \u201ctrue heart\u201d as a \u201cbig government Republican.\u201d\n\nNoting that McCain and Congresswoman Martha McSally (R-Tucson) were the only Arizona Republicans that voted for the budget, Ward said,\n\nIn the name of a strong defense they are willing to give up control of spending in this country and I believe in a strong defense, I believe in peace through strength, but we also have to have restraint and we have to reign in this uncontrollable spending that our country is doing because we are selling our kids, our grandkids, our great-grandkids down the road.\n\nBoyle asked Ward, a practicing doctor, to walk the listening audience through her plan to repeal Obamacare and institute the solution Ward has produced entitled the \u201cPatient Power Plan.\u201d\n\nWard began describing:\n\nThis plan and the other new, fresh bold ideas that I will be proposing during this campaign are something that sets me apart from Senator McCain because you haven\u2019t seen too many new ideas coming out of his office and out of his mind. He\u2019s been in Washington D.C. for over 30 years and if he needs six more years to accomplish something, I\u2019m wondering what it is. As a physician, I have seen the good the bad and the ugly of Obamacare and I used to say there was some good, but it\u2019s very, very difficult to find any good here on the ground in Arizona, here in the trenches in the emergency department where I work because premiums and deductibles are way up and the emergency rooms are overwhelmed. And so, we see a lot of bad and a lot of ugly every single time that we work. So this Patient Power Plan, what it does is it fully repeals Obamacare. It must. And it repeals all of the taxes and all of the regulations that go along with it, which is going to save our country billions of dollars. And then the other good part about this plan is that it puts the power back where it belongs, it takes it out of the hands of the politicians, of the bureaucrats of the insurance companies and it puts it straight back into the hands of the patient. We don\u2019t see any of that under Obamacare. This Patient Power Plan allows people and encourages people to have a health savings account no matter what their income level is and it completely levels the field so that the poorest of the poor are able to have the best healthcare because they have, they\u2019re injected into the free market of medicine as well as the middle class and the rich. And their health savings account, that is something that takes care of the things that are day-to-day needs. Whether its, you need to go to the store to buy cough medicine or ya know you have a cold or a rash or your back hurts and you go into doctor\u2019s office, not the emergency room, into the doctor\u2019s office and you use that health savings account to pay for those visits. And then you have a catastrophic care policy, we call it a major medical policy that covers the true emergencies, the things like car accidents, cancer, pregnancy, long-term debilitating very costly illnesses, all of those are taken care of by true insurance. What we have right now in the insurance company world, in the health insurance company world, is not true insurance. Whenever you buy car insurance, you hope not to use it. When you buy life insurance you hope to heck not to use it, at least not for a really, really long time. But people have health insurance and they say, hey I\u2019ve got health insurance, it\u2019s already paid up, I\u2019ll go get that MRI or I\u2019ll go get this procedure that I may not need because someone else is paying for the bulk of it. So we\u2019ve got to get some free market back into the health care arena if we want to truly get the healthcare that we want and need rather than having to settle for what the government is willing to give us.\n\nBoyle reminded the listening audience that Ward raised over half a million dollars in the most recent fundraising report, her first quarter report. Only Senator Cruz appears to have beaten Ward in first quarter fundraising among Republican Senate candidates, at least in recent history.\n\nWard recounted highlights of a recent three day trip to Washington D.C. to introduce herself as an alternative to McCain. \u201cI think this trip has opened the eyes to a lot of people. I gained a lot of conservative support during the trip and I hope to get more.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re going to need the momentum, the momentum of the groups, the momentum of the grassroots, the momentum of the country if we truly want to retire one of the big D.C. dinosaurs that are there. That are stopping things from going down the right path.\n\nSenator McCain has \u201cbeen an obstacle not to the Democrats, not President Obama\u2019s agenda, but to conservative policies that are designed to shrink the size of government and get the federal government out of our way. He\u2019s putting obstacles in the way of people and it\u2019s gotta stop.\u201d\n\nWard replied to Boyle\u2019s question about the TPP, calling the process executed to push the bill deal through \u201cun-American,\u201d in part for the lack of transparency. She referenced the Senate\u2019s abdication of authority on the matter as of last April and that the deal should be treated like the treaty that it is. Ward reiterated, \u201cGovernment in secret is not the American way.\u201d\n\nState Senator Kelli Ward\u2019s Patient Power Plan to repeal Obamacare and provide a patient-centric plan can be found on her website KelliWard.com.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arizona State Senator and practicing doctor Kelli Ward walked Breitbart News radio listeners through her plan to repeal Obamacare on Sunday.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Arizona State Senator and practicing doctor Kelli Ward walked Breitbart News radio listeners through her plan to repeal Obamacare on Sunday.", "title": "Dr. Kelli Ward Talks Patient Power Plan to Repeal Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Kelli-Ward-1.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/10/mccain-challenger-dr-kelli-ward-walks-patient-power-plan-repeal-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Arizona State Senator and practicing doctor Kelli Ward walked Breitbart News radio listeners through her plan to repeal Obamacare on Sunday.", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Kelli-Ward-1.jpg", "title": "Dr. Kelli Ward Talks Patient Power Plan to Repeal Obamacare", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Breitbart News Sunday, Dr. Kelli Ward, obamacare, Patient Power Plan, repeal, Sen John McCain, State Senator Kelli Ward,Big Government, Medicine, Obamacare,Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-11-10T13:13:59-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "State Senator Kelli Ward", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Ward reiterated, \u201cGovernment in secret is not the American way.\u201dState Senator Kelli Ward\u2019s Patient Power Plan to repeal Obamacare and provide a patient-centric plan can be found on her website KelliWard.com.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLast week Arizona State Senator Kelli Ward, a practicing emergency room doctor, released the Patient Power Plan to repeal Obamacare and provide an alternative approach centered around patients.\nSo this Patient Power Plan, what it does is it fully repeals Obamacare.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cIt\u2019s like a mutual admiration society over there between Hillary Clinton and John McCain,\u201d Ward said to Boyle.\nWhat we have right now in the insurance company world, in the health insurance company world, is not true insurance."}
