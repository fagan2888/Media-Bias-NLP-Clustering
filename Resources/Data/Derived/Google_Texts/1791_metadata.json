After all, he\u2019s here to stay (for the moment), but his actions after the first GOP debate have earned him the ire of many. The billionaire businessman was disinvited from the conservative RedState Gathering in Atlanta. Since the debate, Trump has dropped almost ten points, according to a new Rasmussen poll. Additionally, there are reports that his campaign has entered a state of \u201ccivil war,\u201d a claim that was exacerbated when top adviser Roger Stone quit shortly after the debate. The Trump campaign alleges that the Donald fired Stone, which the latter disputes (via Politico):\n\nRegardless of who resigned or was fired first, the campaign shakeup was the first sign that Trump\u2019s election effort was seriously damaged from within after his Thursday night debate performance and his subsequent comments in which he attacked one of the Fox debate moderators, Megyn Kelly. [\u2026] The next morning, Stone had to fight Trump\u2019s handlers to meet with him for 15 minutes, prompting the following exchange that both of Stone\u2019s friends, independently and separately, tell POLITICO what happened: Stone: \u201cDonald, stop with the Megyn Kelly s**t. It\u2019s f**king crazy. It\u2019s killing us.\u201d Trump: \u201cWhat do you mean? I won the debate. People loved it.\u201d Stone: \u201cYou didn\u2019t win the debate.\u201d Trump: \u201cYes I did. Look at the polling. Look at Drudge.\u201d Stone: \u201cThe Drudge Report poll isn\u2019t a scientific poll. You won\u2019t give me the money to pay for a scientific poll. And you\u2019re off-message.\u201d Trump: \u201cThere are other polls.\u201d Stone: \u201cThose are bulls**t polls, Donald. They\u2019re not scientific polls. We need to run a professional campaign and talk about what people really care about.\u201d Trump: \u201cWe\u2019re winning.\u201d [\u2026] \u201cHe is losing his grip on reality,\u201d Stone told them. \u201cHe has these yes-men around him. And now he\u2019s living in a parallel world.\u201d\n\nThe article also noted that the Trump camp vociferously denied an exchange like the one above ever took place.\n\nSo, the campaign appears to have serious internal problems, which could happen on national campaigns; people bucking for more influence, lost of political machinery and money flowing\u2013it happens. Yet, if this exchange did occur, the latter part is telling. Trump doesn\u2019t appear to want to do serious polls, even though he has the money to do so, because he\u2019s afraid that he might find out what the ending of his 2016 candidacy will be: abject defeat. It\u2019s the spoiler alert that no one wants hear\u2013and if they hear it; it sends them into a frenzy.\n\nSo, while Trump is leading big in Iowa, let\u2019s not forget that a lot of other polls show him losing support (via FiveThirtyEight):\n\nThe polling is a bit split on Trump, but there is enough evidence to say \u2014 at the very least \u2014 that he didn\u2019t gain any ground. On average, Trump lost about 2 percentage points off his standing, and that includes a Morning Consult poll that found him gaining 7 percentage points \u2014 a result no other poll came close to. Averaging polls that were conducted primarily by phone (i.e., Franklin Pierce, Public Policy Polling, Rasmussen Reports and Suffolk) shows Trump down 5 percentage points after the debate. Perhaps more dangerous for Trump, his net favorability rating in YouGov\u2019s national poll dropped 14 percentage points, and 56 percent of Iowa Republicans said they feel less comfortable with him being president, according to Suffolk.\n\nIf this is true, it signals the beginning of a collapse. Moreover, even if Trump is leading now, we seem to be forgetting that the Iowa Caucuses are a long ways away; anything could happen. With how Trump has acted thus far, we should expect more un-presidential behavior. Second, there are various primary factors at play that really don't mesh well with Donald\u2019s electoral game:\n\n\u2026[T]he problem isn\u2019t just that the national polls at this stage in the race lack empirical power to predict the nomination; it\u2019s also that they describe a fiction. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that Donald Trump\u2019s support in the polls is \u201cfake.\u201d I have no doubt that some people really love him or that he\u2019d be the favorite if you held a national, winner-take-all Republican primary tomorrow. However, the \u201celection\u201d these polls describe is hypothetical in at least five ways: They contemplate a vote today, but we\u2019re currently 174 days from the Iowa caucuses.\n\nThey contemplate a national primary, but states vote one at a time or in small groups.\n\nThey contemplate a race with 17 candidates, but several candidates will drop out before Iowa and several more will drop out before the other states vote.\n\nThey contemplate1 a winner-take-all vote, but most states are not winner-take-all.\n\nThey contemplate a vote among all Republican-leaning registered voters or adults, but in fact only a small fraction of them will turn out for primaries and caucuses. This is why it\u2019s exasperating that the mainstream media has become obsessed with how Trump is performing in these polls.\n\nOver at Real Clear Politics, Sean Trende, an elections analyst, noted that the GOP has nominated Bob Dole, two Bushes, and Mitt Romney as evidence that the party won\u2019t be all gung-ho over someone as brash as the Donald. Yet, the high distrust and disapproval of the GOP establishment could add to Trump\u2019s shelf life. He also noted that there is little evidence that Trump is hurting the GOP brand, as his rivals aren\u2019t living up to poach his supporters\u2013and they\u2019re generally disgusted by his remarks. Yet, Trende also said that we should not treat him as the frontrunner, though some disagree:\n\nIn August of 2003, the leader in the Democratic primary was Joe Lieberman, with 18 percent. He was followed by Dick Gephardt and Howard Dean, at 15 percent each, and finally John Kerry at 12 percent. By late fall, Dean led in the polls. But his polling lead collapsed in the homestretch; he failed to win any races outside of his home state and the non-binding D.C. primary. Gephardt and Lieberman likewise went nowhere; Sen. John Edwards, who was at 5 percent over the summer, emerged as the leading alternative to Kerry. In the summer of 2007, Sen. Hillary Clinton had opened up a double-digit lead over her competition, which grew to almost 25 points in September. On the Republican side, McCain was approaching single digits in the polls, while former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani had opened up a nine-point lead over former Sen. Fred Thompson. Romney had a healthy lead in Iowa, while eventual leader Mike Huckabee was mired at 3.5 percent. Finally, in the summer of 2011, Texas Gov. Rick Perry was beginning a Trump-like ascent in the polls, rising from a mere 5 percent in June to a peak of 32 percent in mid-September. Many analysts considered him the likely nominee. Oops. At the same time Rep. Michele Bachmann was receiving a little more than 25 percent in Iowa polling. Of course, Romney became the eventual nominee, but not before enduring boomlets from Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich (twice), and Rick Santorum. As late as December 2011, Gingrich even held a 13-point lead over Romney.\n\nEven in Iowa, the vast majority of voters have yet to make up their minds, as Dan noted earlier today. Yet, what about Trump\u2019s legion of supporters? I\u2019ve generally thought that he was tapping into an angry subset of the electorate, furious over the lack of the rule of law regarding health care and immigration (i.e. Obama\u2019s executive actions and delay of parts of the Affordable Care Act). To some extent, that may still be a factor, especially when you mention illegal immigration, though Yahoo!\u2019s Matt Bai wrote that the electorate generally isn\u2019t angry\u2013and those who are seem to be a subset of a subset:\n\nYes, there\u2019s a sizable segment of enraged voters in the GOP \u2014 and on the left, for that matter. The angry vote is a fixture of the modern political landscape and has been, more or less, since at least the 1970s. But Trumpmania may be telling us a lot less about the dominant mood in the electorate at large than we think. As one of the more astute liberal bloggers, Mother Jones\u2019 Kevin Drum, points out, Trump has been drawing the support of less than a quarter of Republican primary voters, who in turn make up less than a quarter of the voting public. And not only are Trump\u2019s mad-as-hell voters a fraction of a fraction of the electorate, but they represent even a subset of that small group who are engaged in the campaign at this point and angry enough to actually take a pollster\u2019s call. In other words, Trump\u2019s summer surge tells you about as much about prevailing political attitudes in America as the line outside the Yogiberry tells you about the state of the American dairy industry. Here\u2019s something interesting to consider: According to the Pew Research Center, which to my mind does the best polling on public attitudes across a range of topics, anger in the American electorate actually peaked in 2013 (at about 30 percent), after Republicans in Washington decided to turn the budget process into a series of hostage crises. Since then, the number of voters who identify themselves as angry has actually dipped precipitously, to about 19 percent last year.\n\nSo, there you have it: Trump\u2019s base of support is small, it\u2019s dubious that he\u2019ll be able to expand it, there\u2019s internal strife with his campaign staff, and the polls showing him in the lead are conducted through a prism that there\u2019s a national primary, not one based on the results from separate states.\n\nIf Trump decided to dump his own cash, which he\u2019s so far been hesitant to do, to build a serious ground game in the early voting states, then we shall revisit this question about his candidacy soon. Yet, even with his belligerent and boisterous character, the Donald knows how to make money\u2013forking over hundreds of millions of dollars of his own wealth to make this 2016 dream happen seems like a very bad business deal.\n\nHe recently said he supported funding the \u201cgood parts\u201d of Planned Parenthood, which is pretty much the position that the organization has staked out as well. He supports a wealth tax, calling it a conservative idea. And he still seems sympathetic to single-payer health care. It\u2019s kind of hard to fundraise with positions like these, unless you\u2019re a Democrat. The Donald is going to stick around, but there\u2019s an expiration date.\n\nFriendly Reminders:\n\nMexico won't pay for Trump's coveted wall. It probably isn't smart strategy to pick a fight with a news network that's overwhelmingly trusted by the party whose nomination you're seeking. Trump's third party run threats are probably empty.\n\n\"Having a two-party race gives us a much better chance of beating Hillary and bringing our country back than having a third-party candidate...\" -Donald Trump to the Washington Examiner's Byron York last month.\n\nI'm sure you all have thoughts on this subject.
