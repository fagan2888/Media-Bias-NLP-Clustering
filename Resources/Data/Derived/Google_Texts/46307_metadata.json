Rick Scott (R-FL) hinted that he no longer supported expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act to cover low-income Floridians. The long-time reform critic shocked the political world in February when he endorsed the effort, only to see the measure stall and eventually fail in the state House.\n\nDuring a press availability today, Scott pointedly dodged a question about whether he would pursue federal funding for Medicaid expansion next month and instead highlighted the law\u2019s rocky rollout:\n\nYou know the concern Floridians have today about what the federal government has done with the president\u2019s health care law is 300,000 families or individuals been told they\u2019re gonna lose their insurance at the end of the month. That\u2019s the biggest issue we\u2019re dealing with right now. On top of the fact you see the plans that have been proposed, they have high deductibles, so I\u2019m concerned about cost, quality and access to health care, that\u2019s our biggest problem right now.\n\nExpanding Medicaid to 133 percent of the federal poverty line would in fact improve access for the state\u2019s neediest residents. Florida is home to the country\u2019s second-highest uninsured rate and the expected $51 billion in federal funding could have covered approximately 850,000 low-income Floridians in the next 10 years. But since the House rejected the plan, hundreds of thousands of state residents find themselves in the so-called Medicaid coverage gap \u2014 earning too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for premium tax credits available through the law\u2019s insurance marketplaces \u2014 and will likely remain uninsured.\n\nIn February, Scott argued that his decision to expand Florida\u2019s program for three years was inspired by \u201cmy Mom\u2019s struggles raising five kids with very little money.\u201d \u201cNo mother, or father, should despair over whether or not they can afford \u2013 or access \u2013 the healthcare their child needs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the federal government is committed to paying 100 percent of the cost of new people in Medicaid, I cannot, in good conscience, deny the uninsured access to care.\u201d\n\nThe federal government will pick up nearly all of the costs of Medicaid expansion (100 percent for the first three years, phasing down to 90 percent in 2020 and all subsequent years), paying nearly 93 percent the cost over the next nine years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Since Medicaid is financed through general tax revenue, Floridians will sill pay billions into the system without reaping the financial benefits of decreasing the ranks of the uninsured.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Scott dodged a question about whether he would pursue federal funding for Medicaid expansion next month and instead highlighted Obamacare's rocky rollout.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Scott dodged a question about whether he would pursue federal funding for Medicaid expansion next month and instead highlighted Obamacare's rocky rollout.", "title": "Now That Rick Scott\u2019s Running For Re-Election, He\u2019s Backing Away From Medicaid Expansion", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/12/10/3046851/rick-scott-files-election-signals-change-heart-medicaid-expansion/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rick-scott-banner-e1370435284591.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scott dodged a question about whether he would pursue federal funding for Medicaid expansion next month and instead highlighted Obamacare's rocky rollout.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rick-scott-banner-e1370435284591.jpg", "title": "Now That Rick Scott\u2019s Running For Re-Election, He\u2019s Backing Away From Medicaid Expansion", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rick-scott-banner-e1370435284591.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rick-scott-banner-e1370435284591.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-10T17:39:57+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb91b\"", "article_summary": "Health Now That Rick Scott\u2019s Running For Re-Election, He\u2019s Backing Away From Medicaid Expansion CREDIT:On Tuesday, as he made \u201chis re-election bid official\u201d by opening his campaign account and turning-in paperwork to seek a second term in office, Gov.\nRick Scott (R-FL) hinted that he no longer supported expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act to cover low-income Floridians.\nExpanding Medicaid to 133 percent of the federal poverty line would in fact improve access for the state\u2019s neediest residents.\nSince Medicaid is financed through general tax revenue, Floridians will sill pay billions into the system without reaping the financial benefits of decreasing the ranks of the uninsured.\nOn top of the fact you see the plans that have been proposed, they have high deductibles, so I\u2019m concerned about cost, quality and access to health care, that\u2019s our biggest problem right now."}
