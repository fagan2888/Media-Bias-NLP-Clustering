Missy Elliott has been gone from the music scene for going on ten years, and while she’s still planning a comeback the rapper won’t say when it might happen.

The groundbreaking producer and emcee said she hasn’t been able to follow up the critically acclaimed 2005 album The Cookbook because she hasn’t been able to get a project right.

Missy teased a seventh album, titled Block Party, by releasing a handful of singles in the past few years. In 2012 she put out two more singles — “9th Inning” and “Triple Threat” — but still hasn’t given a release date for the album.

“When I create something, it’s gotta be special, and it can’t just be to throw something out there because I feel like I’m Missy,” said told Yahoo’s The Yo Show. “I gotta feel like what I’m giving the fans is 100% and that it’s game-changing. I don’t just throw out microwave records.”

Missy Elliott has made sporadic appearances since her last album, producing or lending her voice to singles from Monica, Keyshia Cole, Jazmine Sullivan, Jennifer Hudson and Fantasia.

The hiatus could be in part to some health issues Missy Elliott has been dealing with. In 2011 she announced to fans that she suffers from Graves disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid. Missy said she was diagnosed in 2008 and noted that the ailment is something “you live with it for the rest of your life.”

After announcing that she had been diagnosed, Missy took to Twitter to thank fans for their support:

“Thank yall for the love yall have shown me! *TearsofJoy* I love yall so much!” Fans are using the hashtag #prayFOR missy to send well-wishes.”

Missy Elliott assured fans that she is still planning on coming back, but added, “I just ain’t telling nobody when.”
