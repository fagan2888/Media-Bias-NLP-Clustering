An argument between two passengers aboard a Valley Metro bus ended in a stabbing Sunday afternoon, Tempe Police spokesman Rashidi Johnson said.

During the argument, one of the passengers, Dwarn Taylor, stabbed the other in the neck.

The victim, Kenneth Rogers, suffered a 5-inch laceration, Johnson said.

Another person aboard the bus witnessed the incident. According to investigators, Taylor threatened Cornelius Wynberg, but did not hurt him.

Taylor was arrested and charged with attempted murder and aggravated assault. Police said more charges could be added.

Tempe fire authorities said the patient was alert and talking en route to the hospital.

It's not clear what sparked the initial argument.
