They have the votes to do whatever they want \u2013 and their party\u2019s governor, Mary Fallin, to sign it into law.\n\nHouse Democrats wisely exercised their limited power to influence the budget by voting as a bloc \u2013 refusing to support the cigarette tax unless Republicans agreed to a Medicaid expansion that would pump $900 million in federal money into the state.\n\nThese are tax dollars that Oklahoma taxpayers sent to Washington. The Legislature\u2019s refusal to accept the federal expansion means Sooner tax dollars are underwriting health care for the working poor in other states while 175,000 of Oklahoma\u2019s most vulnerable remain without health coverage and the state\u2019s hospitals buckle under the mounting costs of uncompensated care.\n\nHow could this happen? It\u2019s all because of who resides in the White House. Rather than work with Obamacare \u2013 oh, the humanity! \u2013 the state\u2019s Republican leadership would rather risk the physical health of thousands of Oklahomans and the fiscal health of Oklahoma\u2019s medical facilities. Talk about playing politics with people\u2019s lives.\n\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase: The Legislature\u2019s primary responsibility each session is to produce a state budget. A balanced state budget.\n\nInstead, for much of this session, lawmakers majored on the minors, focusing, for example, on goofy matters like whether to allow open carry of guns without a permit or training.\n\nNow, with the session\u2019s end only a week away and the budget unresolved, legislators still can\u2019t resist dabbling in the peripheral.\n\nJust this week, a slim House majority decided it is time Oklahomans be required to buy new vehicle license plates. The GOP sponsor, speaker-designate Charles McCall, portrayed it as a \u201cpublic safety measure,\u201d asserting that as reflective material on current metal tags fades it becomes increasingly difficult for law enforcement to read the numbers.\n\nOf course, it just so happens the replacement tags would cost Oklahomans $5 each \u2026 generating about $18.5 million for the cash-strapped state government. Yep, that should put a real dent in a $1.3 billion budget gap.\n\nMore preposterous, Republican lawmakers are wasting precious time and energy crafting a legislative response to the Obama administration\u2019s directive that schoolchildren be permitted to use the restroom of the gender with which they identify.\n\nNot only would a legislative thumb in Washington\u2019s eye risk millions in federal aid for cash-strapped schools, it also would invite another lawsuit that could unnecessarily cost taxpayers even more. Yet another legislative solution in search of a problem.\n\nThe 2016 session may be the best argument yet for budget-only sessions every other year.\n\nArnold Hamilton is editor of The Oklahoma Observer; okobserver.net.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legislative leaders have no one but themselves to blame for the blood pressure-spiking brinkmanship at the Capitol this week.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Arnold Hamilton", "og": {"site_name": "The Journal Record", "description": "Legislative leaders have no one but themselves to blame for the blood pressure-spiking brinkmanship at the Capitol this week.", "title": "Hamilton: Detours on the road to a balanced budget", "url": "http://journalrecord.com/2016/05/19/hamilton-detours-on-the-road-to-a-balanced-budget-opinion/", "image": "http://journalrecord.com/files/2014/09/arnold-hamilton-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Hamilton: Detours on the road to a balanced budgetThe Journal Record", "keywords": "arnold hamilton,mary fallin,oklahoma legislature", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "google-site-verification": "vAy42WJoFK0to-yBz3axT36JMlFa0BIJdchVGi9IPXw", "y_key": "b211670718d8bd21", "thumbnail": "http://journalrecord.com/files/2014/09/arnold-hamilton-180x120.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A balanced state budget.\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase: The Legislature\u2019s primary responsibility each session is to produce a state budget.\nNow, with the session\u2019s end only a week away and the budget unresolved, legislators still can\u2019t resist dabbling in the peripheral.\nIrony Alert II: Republicans have absolute control over the Legislature, owning 71 of 101 House and 39 of 48 Senate seats.\nLegislative leaders have no one but themselves to blame for the blood pressure-spiking brinkmanship at the Capitol this week."}
