The Tucson Police Department has identified the victim in an early morning shooting near the Tucson airport.

Floyd Davis, 29, was found dead in the parking lot of a hotel at 7001 S. Tucson Blvd., according to police. That is the address for La Quinta Inn & Suites - Tucson Airport.

Police say they got a call about a shooting at the location at 12:35 a.m. Saturday, and when they arrived, they found Davis in the parking lot with "obvious signs of gunshot trauma." He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Detectives from the TPD Gang Unit and Night Detectives Unit have determined that Davis and a friend had just arrived at the hotel, and as they got out of their vehicle and began walking toward the building, shots rang out and Davis was struck, according to a press release.

An officer in the area heard the gunshots and responded immediately, but the people involved in the shooting had already fled.

Police suspect the shooting was gang-related.

No suspects are in custody. Investigators are asking anyone with information to please call 911 or the 88-CRIME anonymous tip line.
