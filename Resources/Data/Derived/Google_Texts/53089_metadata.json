Romney gave a dominating, near-perfect performance, while Obama struggled. The president didn\u2019t even hit Romney on \u201c47 percent.\u201d It was a smashing victory, a big, big win for Romney. Such a clear-cut triumph would seem a huge confidence-builder, but afterward, Romney seemed mostly concerned that Obama would come back and beat him badly the next time. \u201cSitting presidents have a very hard time in these debates,\u201d Romney told the family. \u201cThey feel like, who is this whippersnapper coming up here who knows nothing? And so they don\u2019t prepare, and they just think they can waltz through it. Then they get crushed in the first debate, and then they come back.\u201d\n\nGeorge Romney, a self-made man, would have gotten the best of Obama, Mitt seemed to think, but a guy like him who\u2019d started life on third base might not have what it takes to make it to home plate. Then, on election night, when the writing\u2019s on the wall, we get this:\n\n\u201cTo get up and soothe [in my concession speech] is not my inclination,\u201d an obviously anguished Romney continued. \u201cI cannot believe that [Obama] is an aberration in the country. I believe we\u2019re following the same path of every other great nation, which is we\u2019re following greater government, tax rich people, promise more stuff to everybody, borrow until you go over a cliff. And I think we have a very high risk of reaching the tipping point sometime in the next five years. And the idea of saying \u2018it\u2019s just fine, don\u2019t worry about it\u2019 \u2014 no, it\u2019s really not.\u201d Given what has come before it in the film \u2014 Romney\u2019s defeatism in the debates \u2014 the scene leaves the impression that perhaps in his heart of hearts Romney never really believed he could win. That also seems the message of one of the last scenes of \u201cMitt,\u201d the day after the election, when Romney addressed staff at his Boston campaign headquarters. The old lack of confidence came out again as Romney suggested he never felt comfortable in the race. He passed on something someone at headquarters had told him: \u201cIn some ways, we kind of had to steal the Republican nomination. Our party is Southern, evangelical and populist. And you\u2019re Northern, and you\u2019re Mormon, and you\u2019re rich. And these do not match well with our party.\u201d\n\nWould a better attitude have mattered? There\u2019s a whiff here of the idea that more optimism and a little well-timed righteous anger towards O onstage might have changed the race down the stretch. I doubt it. I remember seeing a graph from a statistical model somewhere after the election, probably on Nate Silver\u2019s blog, showing that Romney never once reached 50 percent odds to win after becoming nominee. Not once. That\u2019s a remarkable quasi-fact about a president whose first term was defined by a grinding jobless economic \u201crecovery\u201d and a huge new health-care boondoggle that\u2019s never been popular with the public: In spite of all of it, if the model I saw was right, Obama was always the favorite, start to finish. Romney thought he had a chance (otherwise, why obsess about the debates?) but he was a longshot \u2014 and evidently he knew it. In fact, his finest hour, the first debate, was memorable not because he projected some sort of Reagan-esque sunniness or because he got in Obama\u2019s face over his failures but because he was composed and engaged while O was lethargic and missed easy opportunities. It was, per the model, Obama\u2019s race to lose. And after the first debate, he made sure not to lose it.\n\nI think Romney lost for three reasons. One: He\u2019s right that Obama isn\u2019t an aberration. There\u2019s a huge constituency for the European/blue-state model in the U.S., whether it\u2019s fiscally sustainable or not, and demographic change is more likely to expand it than shrink it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be many years before we see another Republican president but I do think it\u2019ll be many years before we see another Republican landslide. Two: He got out-organized. The irony of the passages from the movie flagged by York is that Mitt was, understandably, worried about his obvious weaknesses (his ability to communicate with voters, his unjust image as a rich guy who\u2019d inherited all his successes) but not worried about his supposed strengths, i.e. his managerial acumen and organizational efforts. He should have been. Obama\u2019s data-crunchers and behavioral analysts evidently ran rings around Team \u201cProject ORCA.\u201d Oh well. Three: Romney suffered from the same problem McCain did, albeit to a lesser extent \u2014 there was no real point to his campaign. Bush had \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d and then the war on terror. Obama had Hopenchange and then protecting the liberal gains he\u2019d made in his first term like ObamaCare. Romney\u2019s message was \u2026 \u201cyou did build that,\u201d I guess? Makers versus takers? That\u2019s a hard message to sell to middle-class wage earners after a giant recession. The boldface part above, about averting a coming crisis, looked like it was going to be a major theme when he chose Paul Ryan, but then Ryan all but disappeared on the trail \u2014 for good reason, as Team Mitt apparently concluded that fighting the battle over entitlements wasn\u2019t likely to be a net winner for them. Maybe all of that would have been blunted by a change in attitude from the candidate himself. But overcome?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Pessimism.", "title": "Did Romney ever really believe he could win the election?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/20/did-romney-ever-really-believe-he-could-win-the-election/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-20T18:01:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-20T20:06:50+00:00"}, "keywords": "47 percent, concession, debates, documentary, film, mitt, Obama, pessimism, republican, romney,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc371\"", "article_summary": "The president didn\u2019t even hit Romney on \u201c47 percent.\u201d It was a smashing victory, a big, big win for Romney.\nAnd you\u2019re Northern, and you\u2019re Mormon, and you\u2019re rich.\nDid Romney ever really believe he could win the election?\nI think Romney lost for three reasons.\nThat also seems the message of one of the last scenes of \u201cMitt,\u201d the day after the election, when Romney addressed staff at his Boston campaign headquarters."}
