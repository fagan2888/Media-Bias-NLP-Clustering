You can also buy and build your own robot, learn to program it and race it. A video game organization will have a living room set up to play games that have not yet been released.\n\n\u201cGrab a soldering iron and learn to solder. Program a Lego robot. That\u2019s the whole idea. It\u2019s all hands on. All science and arts,\u201d Lanaghen said. \u201cYou are given an opportunity to play, it\u2019s not just a walk-on-by event.\u201d\n\nThe event also has an educators track. Classes are included in the admission fee. One of the featured speakers is Temple Grandin, an animal science professor at Colorado State University in Fort Collins.\n\nSTEAM Fest:\n\nWhere: Boulder Fair Grounds,\n\n9595 Nelson Road in Longmont, CO 80501\n\nWhen: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.,\n\nSaturday and Sunday, Sept. 5-6\n\nPrice: $5 to $13 for a day pass\n\nDetails: makerboulder.com/steam", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Boulder,makers,Mini Maker,STEAM,STEAMfest,STEM", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Tech+", "description": "Related", "title": "STEAM Fest: Because kids should play with technology | Tech+ \u2014 The Denver Post", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/09/04/steam-fest-because-kids-should-play-with-technology/18775/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/09/Mini-Makers69-L.jpg?fit=495%2C348", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Related", "title": "STEAM Fest: Because kids should play with technology", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/09/04/steam-fest-because-kids-should-play-with-technology/18775/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/09/Mini-Makers69-L.jpg?fit=495%2C348", "creator": "@gadgetress", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "STEAM Fest in Boulder encourages kids of all ages to play with science, technology, engineering, art and math at the new Labor Day festival."}, "article_summary": "The homegrown STEAM Fest, started by four Boulderites, requires every exhibitor to include an activity, said Martha Lanaghen, an event co-founder.\nYou can also buy and build your own robot, learn to program it and race it.\n\u201cYou are given an opportunity to play, it\u2019s not just a walk-on-by event.\u201dThe event also has an educators track.\nA video game organization will have a living room set up to play games that have not yet been released.\nOne of the featured speakers is Temple Grandin, an animal science professor at Colorado State University in Fort Collins."}
