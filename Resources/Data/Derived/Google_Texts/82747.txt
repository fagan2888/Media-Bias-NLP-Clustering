A new study by Colorado’s department of revenue’s Marijuana Enforcement Division and the state’s Marijuana Policy Group concludes that only about nine percent of Colorado’s population uses the drug, but will go through 121.4 metric tons of it every year.

The new study results are 31 percent higher than a recent department of revenue assessment, 89 percent higher than a stuffy by the Colorado Futures Center, and 111 percent higher than an older study by the Colorado Center for Law and Policy, Time reported Saturday.

According to the study, about 21.8 percent of users report consuming marijuana almost daily, accounting for 66.9 percent of the total demand in the state.

To put the numbers in perspective, across America only 17 percent of adults consume marijuana that frequently, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

However, using sales-tax analysis and data from tourist offices, researchers found that about 44 percent of all retail sales of pot come from tourists. Visitors to the state are expected to consume about 8.9 metric tons of pot per year.
