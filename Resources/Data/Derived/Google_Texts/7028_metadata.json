The psychology of colors goes well beyond personal preference, upbringing, cultural influence, and associations with experiences.\n\nColors are deeply ingrained in modern society, which can signify love, friendship, boy, girl, purity, passion, happiness, and peace. Marketers are well aware of the power color reigns over our lives, which is why McDonald\u2019s chooses its red and yellows to make us hungry, and Victoria\u2019s Secret uses pinks and purples to make women feel sexy and feminine.\n\nIt should surprise no one that retailers have gotten their hands on science that can manipulate the mind and senses into buying a particular item, shopping at their store or eating at their restaurant. Up to 90 percent of first impressions made about products can be based on color alone, according to a Canadian study on the impacts of color on marketing.\n\nColors influence us \u201cto the extent that even our highest-level cognition and intelligence are biased by these low level impressions,\u201d Jerald Kralik, assistant professor of psychology and brain sciences at Dartmouth University, told The Atlantic.\n\n10 Ways Colors Unknowingly Influence Your Life\n\n1. Red\n\nStimulates appetite and enhances the brain\u2019s attention to detail, which is why it\u2019s the perfect choice for McDonalds, Pizza Hut, KFC, Wendy\u2019s, and 711. A recent study also reveals waitresses who wear red receive more tips if their patrons are men because of the brain\u2019s attraction to red. The color can also impair exam performances or tasks because it\u2019s associated with danger and decreases motivation.\n\n2. Blue\n\nEncourages the mind to think outside the box and to be productive and boost performance. Blue Cross Blue Shield, Forbes, and AT&T all know the trick and stick to it through their corporate business logos. It also curbs appetite because it reminds the mind of sterility.\n\n3. Green\n\nPromotes inner tranquility and connects the mind to trust and good health. A Harvard University study conducted in 2012 found food items that were labeled in green evoked a sense of healthiness and sales shot up, in contrast with the same food items with red labels, which declined in sales.\n\n4. Yellow\n\nThe happiest color in the color spectrum also increases metabolism and gives the body a surge of energy. Babies are also prone to cry more if they\u2019re exposed to the color yellow, so it\u2019s best to avoid coloring the nursery with a bright sun or sunflower curtains.\n\n5. Orange\n\nIs a lively color that excites the brain and causes a person to become enthusiastic. A deeper shade will indicate warmth; a brighter shade will indicate caution and cause a person to become vigilant.\n\n6. Pink\n\nThis calm and warming color is used to signify love, femininity and womanhood. It has such a strong hold on the mind that prisons paint the walls of certain jail cells pink to calm down some of their most aggressive prisoners, after psychologists discovered in the late 1970s that the color calmed children down in Canadian schools.\n\n7. Purple\n\nThe color of royalty, wealth, and success dresses the mind in luxury and provokes elitist thoughts. Many kings wore purple robes. Lighter purples, known as lavender, will calm a person who is in an anxious or nervous state, and allows them to relax.\n\n8. Black\n\nThe most ominous of colors is actually considered a shade to represent death and mourning. Ancient Egyptians believed black symbolized life and rebirth. Brands such as Chanel and Prada use the color to create a sense of sophistication in their items.\n\n9. White\n\nThe color of purity, innocence, and emptiness is also often used as a symbol of peace and spaciousness. It is also used to create a bland and sterile feeling, which is why most hospitals and hospital workers are adorned in white.\n\n10. Gold/Silver\n\nGold is a metallic color that is closely associated with love, wisdom, glamour, and wealth. While silver is also a metallic color, it evokes security and style and can make the mind associate it with upscale items because of jewelry and appliances.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "color, psychology, 10, ways, colors, trick, you, every, day", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Color has the power to change our minds and feelings before we realize what we're looking at.", "title": "10 Ways Colors Trick You Without You Knowing", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/color-psychology-10-ways-colors-trick-you-every-day-295460", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/29/psychology-color-controls-our-minds.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Color has the power to change our minds and feelings before we realize what we're looking at.", "title": "10 Ways Colors Trick You Without You Knowing", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/color-psychology-10-ways-colors-trick-you-every-day-295460", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/29/psychology-color-controls-our-minds.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/29/psychology-color-controls-our-minds.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-07-29T12:59:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-29T12:59:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Color has the power to change our minds and feelings before we realize what we're looking at."}, "article_summary": "10 Ways Colors Unknowingly Influence Your Life1.\nColors have the power to influence our choices and change our feelings at first glance.\nColors influence us \u201cto the extent that even our highest-level cognition and intelligence are biased by these low level impressions,\u201d Jerald Kralik, assistant professor of psychology and brain sciences at Dartmouth University, told The Atlantic.\nColors are deeply ingrained in modern society, which can signify love, friendship, boy, girl, purity, passion, happiness, and peace.\nThe psychology of colors goes well beyond personal preference, upbringing, cultural influence, and associations with experiences."}
