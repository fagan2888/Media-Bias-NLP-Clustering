Mike Amon/The Wall Street Journal\n\nPATH train service from Midtown to Jersey City and Hoboken is suspended through Tuesday evening\u2019s rush hour, extending a closure that began on Sunday afternoon after a fire at the 23rd Street station in Manhattan, according to Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials.\n\nService was also shut down to Midtown on Sunday evening and Monday and Tuesday mornings, forcing riders to take trains from the World Trade Center PATH station to Jersey City. Officials didn\u2019t release a time frame for when full service would return for the system\u2019s more than 250,000 daily riders.\n\nThe fire, which a Port Authority spokesman said occurred near the 9th Street PATH stop, shut down service between New Jersey and the PATH\u2019s 33rd Street station but service was restored by Monday\u2019s rush hour. On Tuesday morning, officials said, a smoky condition had returned in the same area as the fire. A preliminary review found that a repair splice between an old cable and a replacement cable was the cause, officials said.\n\nPort Authority officials said much of the cabling in the Manhattan tunnel is decades old. The authority was exploring ways to accelerate upgrades to miles of old wiring, \u201cwhile minimizing the reductions in service that will be needed to make the upgrades,\u201d according to a news release.\n\nNJ Transit was cross-honoring all PATH tickets, and free ferry service was being offered to stranded riders. Passengers reported large crowds on the World Trade Center line on Tuesday morning.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "PATH train service from Midtown to Jersey City and Hoboken is suspended through Tuesday evening\u2019s rush hour, according to Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials.", "title": "PATH Service from Midtown Will be Suspended Through Evening Rush", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/09/23/path-service-from-midtown-will-be-suspended-through-evening-rush/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ER250_nypath_P_20140923140052.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "PATH Service from Midtown Will be Suspended Through Evening Rush", "description": "PATH train service from Midtown to Jersey City and Hoboken is suspended through Tuesday evening\u2019s rush hour, according to Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "WSJ Staff", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "PATH train service from Midtown to Jersey City and Hoboken is suspended through Tuesday evening\u2019s rush hour, according to Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-09-23T18:12:22-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/09/23/path-service-from-midtown-will-be-suspended-through-evening-rush/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-21675", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "PATH train service from Midtown to Jersey City and Hoboken is suspended through Tuesday evening\u2019s rush hour, according to Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials.", "title": "PATH Service from Midtown Will be Suspended Through Evening Rush", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/09/23/path-service-from-midtown-will-be-suspended-through-evening-rush/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ER250_nypath_P_20140923140052.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-21675", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-09-23T18:46:29-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Service was also shut down to Midtown on Sunday evening and Monday and Tuesday mornings, forcing riders to take trains from the World Trade Center PATH station to Jersey City.\nThe fire, which a Port Authority spokesman said occurred near the 9th Street PATH stop, shut down service between New Jersey and the PATH\u2019s 33rd Street station but service was restored by Monday\u2019s rush hour.\nPATH train riders at the World Trade Center station on Tuesday morning.\nPassengers reported large crowds on the World Trade Center line on Tuesday morning.\nPort Authority officials said much of the cabling in the Manhattan tunnel is decades old."}
