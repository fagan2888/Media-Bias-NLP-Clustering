She\u2019s scared of horses, but loves unicorns. And she sometimes snaps when she talks.\n\nDavinnie holds up a selfie taken in one of her multiple prom dresses.\n\n\u201cI had a couple outfit changes,\u201d Davinnie said. \u201cMy performance outift, my walk-around, my entrance outfit, I have to be on point for prom. That\u2019s just one of those things for a showgirl.\u201d\n\nDavinnie is a trangender teen, just 18-years-old. Davinnie is not the name she was given at birth, it\u2019s the name she\u2019s chosen as a woman.\n\nThis day, Davinnie wore a navy blue dress, gold wedge sandals and gold tone eyeshadow. On her wrist, a black wristband says \u201cSPEAK OUT.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s part of a campaign to get people talking about HIV.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been positive since September, 2014,\u201d she said.\n\nHealth News Florida reporter Abe Aboraya speaks with HIV-infected youth.\n\nLike many transgender youth, Davinnie faced an ultimatum from her parents at age 15: Stay home and identify as a man, or move out. She left, and moved in with a boyfriend. She then turned to what experts call survival sex.\n\n\u201cIf I was doing sex work, that\u2019s the only way I could stay with this dude,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to perform sex work for a good year and a half.\u201d\n\nLife wasn\u2019t easy. Depending on which Jacksonville neighborhood she was in, she could either be solicited \u2013 or face violence. She\u2019s been robbed at gunpoint.\n\nBut it wasn't sex work that exposed Davinnie to HIV. She says she was infected after she got out, back on her feet and had reunited with her parents. Another unfaithful boyfriend is to blame.\n\nWhen Davinnie got a positive HIV test result, she already was active in Jacksonville Area Sexual Minority Youth Network, or JASMYN, the group that put on the prom.\n\nStill, the diagnosis sent her off the grid, for months. But JASMYN staff kept reaching out.\n\n\u201cThat welcoming energy gave me the courage to come back up here,\u201d Davinnie said. \u201cIf I wouldn\u2019t have come back here, I wouldn\u2019t have been linked to medicine.\u201d\n\nThe JASMYN center sits just outside downtown Jacksonville, underneath Interstate 95, just before the road turns at a strangely beautiful, but abandoned public school. The only clue the turn-of-the-century home with a wraparound porch is a nonprofit is a small, rainbow flag sticker in the window that says \u201csafe space.\u201d\n\nThere are 400 youth enrolled in JASMYN programs, said Emily Rokosch, the director of operations. And about 40 of them are HIV positive.\n\nThe nonprofit took over the adjacent house, and built an $85,000 clinic. The eventual goal is to expand into offering primary care, including transgender services.\n\n\u201cEvery Thursday, young people can come here and have access to free HIV testing and STI testing,\u201d Rokosch said.\n\nDavinnie was underage when she got into treatment. She hadn\u2019t told her parents, and JASMYN shuttled from appointment to appointment.\n\nThat kind of support and access to care is critical. About 1,000 youth a year are diagnosed with HIV in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . In Florida, roughly 15 percent of all new HIV infections happen to people who haven\u2019t hit their 25th birthday.\n\nTwo hours south of Jacksonville, 19-year-old Lamont has gotten similar help from a nonprofit called Hope and Help. The Orlando teen was diagnosed as HIV positive March 13, 2015.\n\nLamont isn\u2019t his real name. Members of his family don\u2019t know that he\u2019s a gay man or that he has HIV.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hell,\u201d Lamont said.\n\nLamont, like Davinnie, contracted HIV from an unfaithful partner. He was 17, and his boyfriend 24. They met though an online site called BCG Live.\n\nThey got serious, and they both took their profiles down from the site. And they stopped using condoms.\n\nHindsight being 20-20, Lamont acknowledges there were signs of infidelity. The boyfriend wanted threesomes. He changed the password on his phone, and didn\u2019t answer Lamont\u2019s calls when Lamont knew he was off work. Mysterious cousins and friends started popping up.\n\nThen a friend confided that he\u2019d seen Lamont\u2019s boyfriend on an app called Jack\u2019d. It shows gay men looking to hookup near a location.\n\nLamont ended the relationship. Then he spent the next four months too scared to get an HIV test.\n\nHe finally went to The Center in Orlando, an LGBT testing center. He was calm when he got the diagnosis. But afterwards, he said he had suicidal thoughts.\n\n\u201cI really thought about going up at a high rate of speed and trying to flip my car over,\u201d Lamont said. \u201cI had to really come to my senses.\u201d\n\nMany experts will tell you part of the reason more youth are contracting HIV is because attitudes are changing. New drugs mean that HIV isn\u2019t a death sentence.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t Lamont\u2019s world. He knew how you contract HIV, knew that if you don\u2019t take your medications, it becomes AIDS.\n\nAnd he\u2019s known five friends who died from the disease in the last four years. Some refused to ever get tested, others got tested and never got treatment, scared of what their peers would think.\n\nThat\u2019s why it hurt him so bad when his boyfriend cheated on him.\n\n\u201cHe knew these friends who had passed away,\u201d Lamont said. \u201cHe went to a couple of these funerals with me. He knew these friends.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why testing is so important, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wish it on anyone,\u201d Lamont said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I really wish people would wrap it up, talk about it. Knowledge is power.\u201d\n\nLamont is working on getting an apartment, and wants to get into law enforcement for a career. He wants to find a happy, faithful relationship.\n\nHe\u2019s talking to someone now. Just talk so far, but Lamont is really into this guy.\n\nHe just doesn\u2019t know how to bring up that he\u2019s HIV positive.\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
