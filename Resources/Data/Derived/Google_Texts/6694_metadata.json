More than 3,300 nominations from organizations of all sizes in virtually every industry were submitted this year for consideration in a wide range of categories. More than 200 executives worldwide participated in the judging process to select this year's Stevie\u00ae Award winners. The ACA COMPASS\u2120 technology platform is also a finalist in the category for Technical Innovation of the Year \u2013 At Organizations with 1,000 or More Employees that will be announced on September 11 in San Francisco.\n\n\"The ACA COMPASS\u2120 platform earns praise from clients and associations across the US by providing the most extensive technical ACA compliance capabilities, in addition to the firm's professional analysis, strategic recommendations and depth of knowledge,\" said Master. \"We are honored that the judges recognized our holistic approach to resolving an immediate business challenge and the exceptional work of a tremendous team responsible for the creation and development of ACA COMPASS\u2120.\"\n\nAs organizations face a tight reporting deadline that requires volumes of data to comply with the ACA, they discover that other technologies only offer cursory abilities to break down and analyze data, precluding them from leveraging and balancing the full scope of workforce and tax options. The increased urgency to put the appropriate systems in place has resulted in growing recognition and accolades that ACA COMPASS\u2120 can address all these issues in a customizable platform. ACA COMPASS\u2120 assists employers with a true technical analysis and application of the ACA regulations as well as future Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reporting. The complexity of the law allows employers multiple options for their implementation methodology. As employers move through the decision making process of how to implement, critical decisions along the way can have far reaching and expensive consequences if the law is not accurately applied.\n\nAbout the Stevie Awards\n\nStevie Awards are conferred in six programs: the Asia-Pacific Stevie Awards, the German Stevie Awards, The American Business Awards, The International Business Awards, the Stevie Awards for Women in Business, and the Stevie Awards for Sales & Customer Service.
