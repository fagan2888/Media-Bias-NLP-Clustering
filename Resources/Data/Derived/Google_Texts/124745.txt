Hollywood’s attempt to sell ObamaCare to the American people didn’t fair much better than the actual legislation did.

One mega-star, Lady Gaga, bungled the web site’s address in a tweet. Another A-lister, Will Ferrell, instructed his comedy site to extol how easy the legislation’s Web site is to use at a time when the site was barely functional.
