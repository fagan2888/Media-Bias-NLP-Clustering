In his latest piece, A Dream Undone, Rutenberg takes readers back to 1956 when Henry Frye (who later became North Carolina\u2019s first black Supreme Court chief justice) was subjected to a literacy test and barred from registering to vote.\n\nRutenberg then fast-forwards us to 1965 when the Voting Rights Act was signed into law, eliminating such tests and seeking to end the disenfranchisement of black voters. His story goes on to explain:\n\nIn the decades that followed, Frye and hundreds of other new black legislators built on the promise of the Voting Rights Act, not just easing access to the ballot but finding ways to actively encourage voting, with new state laws allowing people to register at the Department of Motor Vehicles and public-assistance offices; to register and vote on the same day; to have ballots count even when filed in the wrong precinct; to vote by mail; and, perhaps most significant, to vote weeks before Election Day. All of those advances were protected by the Voting Rights Act, and they helped black registration increase steadily. In 2008, for the first time, black turnout was nearly equal to white turnout, and Barack Obama was elected the nation\u2019s first black president. Since then, however, the legal trend has abruptly reversed. In 2010, Republicans flipped control of 11 state legislatures and, raising the specter of voter fraud, began undoing much of the work of Frye and subsequent generations of state legislators. They rolled back early voting, eliminated same-day registration, disqualified ballots filed outside home precincts and created new demands for photo ID at polling places. In 2013, the Supreme Court, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, directly countermanded the Section 5 authority of the Justice Department to dispute any of these changes in the states Section 5 covered. Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, declared that the Voting Rights Act had done its job, and it was time to move on. Republican state legislators proceeded with a new round of even more restrictive voting laws. All of these seemingly sudden changes were a result of a little-known part of the American civil rights story. It involves a largely Republican countermovement of ideologues and partisan operatives who, from the moment the Voting Rights Act became law, methodically set out to undercut or dismantle its most important requirements.\n\nRutenburg\u2019s article covers five decades of the struggle to expand voting rights, right up to the the federal trial (North Carolina N.A.A.C.P. v. McCrory) in Winston-Salem that could wrap-up later this week.\n\nRead A Dream Undone here in The New York Times.\n\nFor more on the voting rights trial continuing in Winston-Salem, listen to Policy Watch\u2019s recent radio interview with Bob Phillips of Common Cause North Carolina.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7b3\"", "article_summary": "All of those advances were protected by the Voting Rights Act, and they helped black registration increase steadily.\nRutenberg then fast-forwards us to 1965 when the Voting Rights Act was signed into law, eliminating such tests and seeking to end the disenfranchisement of black voters.\nChief Justice John Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, declared that the Voting Rights Act had done its job, and it was time to move on.\nIt involves a largely Republican countermovement of ideologues and partisan operatives who, from the moment the Voting Rights Act became law, methodically set out to undercut or dismantle its most important requirements.\nRutenburg\u2019s article covers five decades of the struggle to expand voting rights, right up to the the federal trial (North Carolina N.A.A.C.P."}
