Kroger Co., the nationwide retailer with more than $80 billion in sales, trimmed more spouses from its health coverage with the ratification of a major union contract in late July.

Kroger has been targeting spousal coverage as a way to reduce costs. The latest agreement, with the United Food and Commercial Workers union in the Cincinnati/Dayton, Ohio, area, actually represents a less severe spousal coverage reduction than earlier agreements.
