Parkview Health System, Inc. has agreed to settle potential HIPAA violations costing them around $800,000 dollars after one of their retiring physicians dumped medical records.\n\n\u201cAll too often we receive complaints of records being discarded or transferred in a manner that puts patient information at risk,\u201d said Christina Heide, acting deputy director of health information privacy at Dept. of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR), in a press statement. \u201cIt is imperative that HIPAA covered entities and their business associates protect patient information during its transfer and disposal.\u201d\n\nThe investigation began after receiving a complaint that Parkview had violated the HIPPA privacy rule. Parkview took custody of 5,000 to 8,000 medical records or patients and had allegedly compromised all of them. The incident reportedly occurred back in 2008 when Parkview was assisting a retiring doctor during the transition of her records to the facility. According to the U.S. Department of Health And Human Services, \u201cParkview employees, with notice that the physician was not at home, left 71 cardboard boxes of these medical records unattended and accessible to unauthorized persons on the driveway of the physician\u2019s home, within 20 feet of the public road and a short distance away from a heavily trafficked public shopping venue.\u201d\n\nThe facility in question is a not-for-profit located in Indiana, serving northwest Ohio as well. They have approximately 8,700 employee and have a number of health services including behavioral, cancer, emergency, heart, orthopedics, and women\u2019s health.\n\nParkview didn\u2019t contest a subsequent investigation with OCR. Along with the $800,000 settlement, the company will also have to implement a corrective action plan. This includes Parkview revising its policies and procedures, and training staff. They will also have to provide an implementation report to OCR.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hippa, parkview health system, inc.", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After leaving 71 records unattended, Parkview Health System, Inc. had to settle a lawsuit for HIPPA violations in the amount of $800,000 .", "title": "HIPPA Lawsuit Settled For $800,000 After Facility Violated Patient Privacy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/parkview-health-system-settles-800000-lawsuit-after-physician-violates-hippa-privacy-rule-289512", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/23/shutterstock116345242.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After leaving 71 records unattended, Parkview Health System, Inc. had to settle a lawsuit for HIPPA violations in the amount of $800,000 .", "title": "HIPPA Lawsuit Settled For $800,000 After Facility Violated Patient Privacy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/parkview-health-system-settles-800000-lawsuit-after-physician-violates-hippa-privacy-rule-289512", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/23/shutterstock116345242.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/23/shutterstock116345242.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-06-23T16:49:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-23T16:49:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After leaving 71 records unattended, Parkview Health System, Inc. had to settle a lawsuit for HIPPA violations in the amount of $800,000 ."}, "article_summary": "They have approximately 8,700 employee and have a number of health services including behavioral, cancer, emergency, heart, orthopedics, and women\u2019s health.\nParkview took custody of 5,000 to 8,000 medical records or patients and had allegedly compromised all of them.\nParkview Health System, Inc. has agreed to settle potential HIPAA violations costing them around $800,000 dollars after one of their retiring physicians dumped medical records.\n\u201cAll too often we receive complaints of records being discarded or transferred in a manner that puts patient information at risk,\u201d said Christina Heide, acting deputy director of health information privacy at Dept.\n\u201cIt is imperative that HIPAA covered entities and their business associates protect patient information during its transfer and disposal.\u201dThe investigation began after receiving a complaint that Parkview had violated the HIPPA privacy rule."}
