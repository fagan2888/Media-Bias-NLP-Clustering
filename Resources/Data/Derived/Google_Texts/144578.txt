VIERA, Fla. — Washington Nationals second baseman Yunel Escobar has a strained side and will be sidelined seven to 10 days.

The injury is a Grade 1 left oblique strain, and manager Matt Williams said Saturday the team is being cautious. He anticipates Escobar returning to spring training games and being ready for opening day.

Williams said. “He’ll just be a little delayed on that. He tweaked his oblique a little bit.”

Escobar was pulled from the lineup shortly before Thursday’s Grapefruit League opener. Williams says Escobar isn’t having trouble taking grounders or making the pivot. The problem is swinging the bat.

Escobar was acquired from the Oakland A’s and played shortstop his first eight seasons. He is switching to second base this spring.
