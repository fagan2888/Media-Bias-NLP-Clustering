The rise of the health-conscious consumer has begun to shape the country\u2019s eating behaviors and has even forced some food makers to remove unhealthy ingredients from their products. As the power continues to shift from companies to the hands of its consumers, a \u201cFuture of Eating Report,\u201d by NPD, a market research group, has found Generation Z is more likely to eat fresh, home-cooked meals than their predecessors, as fresh food consumption is expected to rise by 11 percent in five years.\n\n\u201cGeneration Z, Millennials, and Hispanics will be the growth drivers of this country\u2019s eating patterns over the next five years,\u201d said Darren Seifer, NPD food and beverage industry analyst, in the NPD news release. The youngest generation and millennials are driving changes with the way they approach food choice and preparation, as they are seen to want more involvement, not more complexity, in the way they prepare their foods and meals, especially the most important meal of all, breakfast. They opt for home-made breakfasts like omelets and French toast, over processed ready-to-eat meals, such as cold cereal.\n\nAlthough spending more time in the kitchen may seem counter-intuitive, especially for this time-pressed generation, this may be driven by the need to have a say in the final output of their prepared foods. \u201cThere seems to be a need to have their say or approval on the final product,\u201d said Seifer on his blog. \u201cIt's almost as if they want to have a hand in the production of the food so that when it hits the plate they can say that they were part of the project.\u201d\n\nThis generation also shows a tendency to use stove tops rather than microwaves for preparing meals because they prefer consuming fresh ingredients and using additives \u2014 like putting fruits and syrups on their foods \u2014 to feel more involved. Although Generation Z could eventually make microwaves obsolete, Generation X (ages 38 to 48), are more contingent on preparing microwavable foods because they are more convenience-driven.\n\nThis finding can be explained through the concept of aging dynamics \u2014 aging and generation \u2014 where eating behaviors will influence consumption rates based on the current and previous generation\u2019s preferences. The report highlights that as we age we are more likely to consume fresh foods, with the largest momentum occurring from young adults to the age of 40, and from there the number begins to increase, but slowly. Generation X will no longer drive the forecasted growth of fresh food consumption, as Generations Z and Y (millenials), are expected to increase the use of these foods at breakfast by nine percent, seven percent at lunch, and five percent at dinner.\n\nNot only will fresh food consumption increase, but also Latino foods by seven percent, as Hispanics will make a large portion of millenials, along with Generaton Z, in five years, according to the NPD. Whole grains, protein, and calcium, or foods low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium will continue to take precedence for the younger generation and older baby boomer groups as time progresses. It is important for Generation Z to continue to adopt healthy eating habits as baby boomers will be more concerned with what they need to sustain their health and lifestyle, compared to be driven by the latest health fad.\n\nDespite this report, doctors and parents continue to remain worrisome as a report from Trust for America\u2019s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation says, most U.S. residents will be obese within the next two decades. Currently, more than one-third of U.S. adults are obese, while childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the last 30 years. Perhaps, Generation Z will learn from their predecessors\u2019 eating behaviors and want to strive for a healthier future.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "healthy eating, healthy cooking, fresh foods, generation x, generation y, generation z, millenials, microwaves", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Generation Z, the rising generation, is expected to be healthier than the rest, as they prefer more home-cooked meals and fresh food, but what does this mean for the future of millennials and Generation X?", "title": "Why Generation Z May Be Healthier Than The Rest", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/future-healthy-eating-generation-z-more-likely-eat-fresh-home-cooked-meals-282524", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/14/couple-playing-food-kitchen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Generation Z, the rising generation, is expected to be healthier than the rest, as they prefer more home-cooked meals and fresh food, but what does this mean for the future of millennials and Generation X?", "title": "Why Generation Z May Be Healthier Than The Rest", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/future-healthy-eating-generation-z-more-likely-eat-fresh-home-cooked-meals-282524", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/14/couple-playing-food-kitchen.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/14/couple-playing-food-kitchen.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-05-14T16:32:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-14T16:32:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Generation Z, the rising generation, is expected to be healthier than the rest, as they prefer more home-cooked meals and fresh food, but what does this mean for the future of millennials and Generation X?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda5c1\"", "article_summary": "Perhaps, Generation Z will learn from their predecessors\u2019 eating behaviors and want to strive for a healthier future.\nAlthough Generation Z could eventually make microwaves obsolete, Generation X (ages 38 to 48), are more contingent on preparing microwavable foods because they are more convenience-driven.\nWith campaigns, food labels, and TV commercials pushing toward a healthier future to curb childhood obesity, Generation Z (ages 0 to 23) has been the hub of all these healthy eating initiatives.\nAs the power continues to shift from companies to the hands of its consumers, a \u201cFuture of Eating Report,\u201d by NPD, a market research group, has found Generation Z is more likely to eat fresh, home-cooked meals than their predecessors, as fresh food consumption is expected to rise by 11 percent in five years.\n\u201cGeneration Z, Millennials, and Hispanics will be the growth drivers of this country\u2019s eating patterns over the next five years,\u201d said Darren Seifer, NPD food and beverage industry analyst, in the NPD news release."}
