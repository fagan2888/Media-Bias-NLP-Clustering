The SMI network now serves 125,000 people and is exempt from the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThink about the Gospels and how the Apostles lived,\u201d said CMF CURO director Louis A. Brown Jr. at the program\u2019s Washington, D.C., debut. \u201cThey very much shared and cared for each other. And we\u2019re saying: \u2018Catholics, you can do that too.\u2019\u201d\n\nCMF CURO was founded independent of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops; officials there did not offer comment on it.\n\nProponents of \u201chealth care sharing\u201d say they are not insurance plans, but ministries that cut Christians\u2019 health care costs and tend to their souls. The groups, according to the Illinois-based Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries, together include more than 300,000 Americans.\n\nCritics point out that health care sharing programs are unregulated, and that there is no guarantee that any particular medical need will be covered. As John Gruber, an health care economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told CNBC: \u201cThe whole goal of health-care reform is to ensure that people are protected against risk and illness, and this violates that fundamental goal.\u201d\n\nAs with similar programs, those who join CMF CURO expect other members to pay for most of their medical costs \u2014 except preventive health care and pre-existing conditions \u2014 for expenses of up to $250,000 for each medical need in the basic program.\n\nFor a two-parent household, CMF CURO costs $489 a month; an individual plan costs $264 a month. Members vote on whether to raise the costs of membership, and the program will pay health care providers 125 percent of what they get from Medicare.\n\nAnd as members of Samaritan and other health-sharing networks have testified, CMF CURO members can also expect notes, cards and drawings from the children of fellow members with prayers for a speedy recovery, said Anthony Hopp, SMI\u2019s director of membership.\n\nGiven its standards for members\u2019 conduct, the group won\u2019t accept all Christians. And many who do qualify may not choose CMF CURO as their exclusive means of paying for health care. (\u201dCuro\u201d is Latin for \u201cto care for.\u201d)\n\nThe co-founder and executive director of the Christ Medicus Foundation, for one, said he is not a member of CMF CURO and is not sure he will become one. As a veteran, \u201cI have all my health care through the VA,\u201d said Michael J. O\u2019Dea, who also advised Catholics who join CMF CURO not to drop their Medicare coverage.\n\n\u201cThey pay for it throughout their life and I wouldn\u2019t want to pass that cost on to Samaritan,\u201d O\u2019Dea said.\n\nAnd CMF CURO co-founder David E. Wilson, the first person to enroll in the new program, said he\u2019s keeping the more conventional insurance he provides himself and his employees at his consulting firm, though he doesn\u2019t anticipate using it. \u201cI have full confidence that CMF CURO is going to cover all my needs,\u201d he said.\n\nBrown said that as the director of CMF CURO, he plans to rely on it exclusively when the plan begins paying for medical expenses on Jan. 1.\n\nThe introduction of CMF CURO comes as President Obama\u2019s 2010 health care overhaul continues to reduce the ranks of the nation\u2019s uninsured. Obamacare, as its critics call it, requires almost all Americans to carry insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nIts most vocal critics have been conservative Christians and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who object especially to the ACA\u2019s requirement that insurance plans offer contraception, including methods that opponents (but few doctors) consider abortifacients.\n\nHobby Lobby President Steve Green won the right not to cover such birth control methods at the Supreme Court this summer. But a provision was written into the ACA that health-sharing groups are exempt as long as they were founded before Dec. 31, 1999. CMF CURO\u2019s partnership with SMI allows it to invoke this exception.\n\nBut Brown said he doesn\u2019t want people to sign on to CMF CURO just because they don\u2019t like the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHe called it \u201ca real solution that gives Catholics and people of faith affordable access to Christ-centered health care, consistent with Catholic teaching, that\u2019s protective of the individual right of conscience and religious liberty writ large.\u201d\n\nCopyright: For copyright information, please check with the distributor of this item, Religion News Service LLC.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "RNS-CATHOLIC-HEALTH, Barack Obama, Health care costs, Access to health care, Christianity, Health care reform, Philanthropic foundations, Religion, Health issues, Health, Social affairs, Political issues, Government and politics, Health care policy, Government policy, Philanthropy, Government-funded health insurance, Government programs", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "If you are a Christian who doesn\u2019t smoke, abstains from sex outside your heterosexual marriage and can get your priest to vouch that you go to church at least three times a month, you may qualify for a new Catholic alternative to health insurance.", "title": "Following evangelicals, traditional Catholics create a health insurance alternative", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/following-evangelicals-traditional-catholics-create-a-health-insurance-alternative/2014/10/03/71520644-4b20-11e4-a4bf-794ab74e90f0_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/following-evangelicals-traditional-catholics-create-a-health-insurance-alternative/2014/10/03/71520644-4b20-11e4-a4bf-794ab74e90f0_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "RNS-CATHOLIC-HEALTH, Barack Obama, Health care costs, Access to health care, Christianity, Health care reform, Philanthropic foundations, Religion, Health issues, Health, Social affairs, Political issues, Government and politics, Health care policy, Government policy, Philanthropy, Government-funded health insurance, Government programs", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "71520644-4b20-11e4-a4bf-794ab74e90f0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "If you are a Christian who doesn\u2019t smoke, abstains from sex outside your heterosexual marriage and can get your priest to vouch that you go to church at least three times a month, you may qualify for a new Catholic alternative to health insurance."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd22e1\"", "article_summary": "Proponents of \u201chealth care sharing\u201d say they are not insurance plans, but ministries that cut Christians\u2019 health care costs and tend to their souls.\n\u201cThink about the Gospels and how the Apostles lived,\u201d said CMF CURO director Louis A.\nFor a two-parent household, CMF CURO costs $489 a month; an individual plan costs $264 a month.\nThe groups, according to the Illinois-based Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries, together include more than 300,000 Americans.\nAnd many who do qualify may not choose CMF CURO as their exclusive means of paying for health care."}
