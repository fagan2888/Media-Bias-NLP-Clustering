Thursday\u2019s hearing probably cemented Republicans\u2019 criticism that she wasn\u2019t completely straight with the public in the days right after the September 2012 attack, but there are more than just political reasons why that might\u2019ve been so. Might not a balance between intelligence, diplomacy and military action sometimes require not publicly tipping your whole hand right away, especially if some misdirection might provide time and space to identify and strike back against those responsible? And if the administration\u2019s comments in the first few days after the attack were motivated only by presidential election politics, wouldn\u2019t they have tried to maintain the charade longer, rather than acknowledging before that month\u2019s end that the evidence supported a premeditated attack? Still, the information she and others put out in the first few days was wrong, and that\u2019s been aired again.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic primary voters saw an all day-marathon of Clinton looking calm, cool, collected and thoughtful, which is what most want in a presidential candidate. She\u2019s not out of the woods yet \u2013 trustworthiness and transparency issues raised by her overall email situation will continue to plague her \u2013 but she\u2019s on the path.\n\nClinton already was trending upward in the polls at this week\u2019s start, based on her performance in last week\u2019s Democratic debate. I expect to see a more dramatic increase next week, as she gains support from many who had been holding out for Biden and as the dust settles from Thursday\u2019s hearing.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Political Blotter", "description": "After a summer of uneven, if not rather calamitous, performance on the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton had a hell of a good week.
