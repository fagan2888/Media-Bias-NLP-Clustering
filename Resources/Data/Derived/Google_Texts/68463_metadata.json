Before Reid went nuclear, tea party challengers and their supporters (this columnist included) could correctly argue that winning the majority really did not matter. Since the GOP needed 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster \u2014 something that was clearly out of reach \u2014 why not gamble and challenge the establishment? The GOP had gone astray when it came to fiscal responsibility, and a Republican reformation was more important than a Republican restoration. To paraphrase former senator Jim DeMint, better to elect 30 true conservatives than compromise for a powerless moderate majority.\n\nThat rationale disappeared when Reid invoked the nuclear option. Now winning the majority really does matter.\n\nWhile Reid\u2019s nuclear strike was limited to executive-branch nominees and judges below the Supreme Court level, it set the precedent that the majority could change Senate rules when it suited them. If Republicans win control of the Senate this fall, there is nothing to stop them from invoking Reid\u2019s example. And if Republicans win the presidency in 2016, the nuclear option could have far-reaching consequences.\n\nTake Obamacare. Does anyone think for a moment that a Republican Senate majority is going to let a handful of Senate Democrats stop them from repealing Obamacare in order to protect the institutional rights of the minority? Of course not. If Republicans take back the Senate and the White House, they can follow the Democrats\u2019 lead, change the rules and repeal Obamacare with just 51 votes. And for conservatives upset over the Supreme Court\u2019s Obamacare ruling, Reid\u2019s action will make it easier for a Republican president and Senate majority to transform the high court. If Republicans are not allowed to filibuster lifetime appointments to circuit courts, why should they let Democrats filibuster lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court?\n\nUltimately, Reid\u2019s action strengthens the hand of establishment Republicans facing conservative primary challengers \u2014 because the fate of Obamacare now hangs in the balance. The government shutdown proved that without control of the Senate, the GOP will never be able to repeal Obamacare. Tea party voters now have a tougher choice to make. Before the nuclear option, they could cast their ballots for the most conservative candidate, regardless of electability. Now they need to ask themselves which is more important: ideological purity or winning the majority and repealing Obamacare?\n\nThe stakes are high because a GOP Senate majority is within reach. As the National Journal recently reported, \u201c[T]he 7 seats most likely to switch parties [in 2014] ... are only Democratic-held. If Republicans flip 6 of the 7 \u2014 without losing any of their own vulnerable seats -- they would control the Senate in 2015.\u201d Democrats are vulnerable because of the disastrous Obamacare rollout and the public\u2019s anger over the president\u2019s false promise that if you like your health plan and your doctor, you can keep them. There are 12 Senate Democrats on the ballot in 2014 who made that exact same promise. Some of them will pay the price.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that conservative primary challenges are a bad thing. To the contrary, they have produced outstanding conservative leaders, such as Sens. Pat Toomey (Penn.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.). And even when challengers don\u2019t win, they keep establishment Republicans accountable to the grassroots. The effect of establishment Republicans getting knocked off in the last two election cycles has made the Senate more conservative \u2014 because Senate Republicans vote differently when they are worried about a primary than they would have if they thought they could cruise to reelection. We get two good years out of them, thanks to the tea party. Moreover, it is a myth that nominating establishment candidates is the key to victory. If that were so, Tommy Thompson would be in the Senate today.\n\nBut before Reid pulled the nuclear trigger, the primary goal for grassroots conservatives was to reform the GOP. That meant it was worth losing Delaware\u2019s Senate seat to prevent the election of a Republican squish like Rep. Mike Castle. Now tea party conservatives have to balance the objective of Republican reformation against another one that is just as important: repealing Obamacare.\n\nThanks to Reid, establishment candidates have an argument in 2014 they did not have in the last two election cycles:\n\nThe majority matters.\n\nRead more from Marc Thiessen\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans stand to gain from Reid\u2019s \u2018nuclear\u2019 blunder.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Republicans stand to gain from Reid\u2019s \u2018nuclear\u2019 blunder.", "title": "How Harry Reid may help the GOP win back the Senate", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-harry-reid-may-help-the-gop-win-back-the-senate/2014/01/06/7e9bfd1c-76de-11e3-af7f-13bf0e9965f6_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/06/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Congress-00f54-1715.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marcthiessen"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-harry-reid-may-help-the-gop-win-back-the-senate/2014/01/06/7e9bfd1c-76de-11e3-af7f-13bf0e9965f6_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Marc Thiessen, nuclear option, harry reid, filibuster, midterms 2014, election 2016, election 2014, tea party, primary challenges, conservative gop,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen"}, "news_keywords": "Marc Thiessen, nuclear option, harry reid, filibuster, midterms 2014, election 2016, election 2014, tea party, primary challenges, conservative gop,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "7e9bfd1c-76de-11e3-af7f-13bf0e9965f6"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd78b\"", "article_summary": "The stakes are high because a GOP Senate majority is within reach.\nThere are 12 Senate Democrats on the ballot in 2014 who made that exact same promise.\nAnd even when challengers don\u2019t win, they keep establishment Republicans accountable to the grassroots.\nThe government shutdown proved that without control of the Senate, the GOP will never be able to repeal Obamacare.\nIf Republicans win control of the Senate this fall, there is nothing to stop them from invoking Reid\u2019s example."}
