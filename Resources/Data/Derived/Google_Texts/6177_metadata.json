Begin with a few simple rules:\n\n\u2022 Substitute the word \u201cmobility\u201d for \u201ctraffic and transportation.\u201d Moving people and goods from place to place depends on location and adjacencies. In a dense urban environment, optimal mobility accommodates a balance of pedestrians, bicyclists, vehicles and transit.\n\nIn suburban or rural areas, mobility adapts to different scales and modes. Applying the same priorities, rules and measures to Denver\u2019s urban grid makes as much sense as building light rail from Rocky Ford to Olathe.\n\n\u2022 Sin boldly, then beg forgiveness. Local, state and federal regulatory agencies are risk-averse. And an exhaustive process and institutional caution muzzle progress. Rather than carefully examining every possible metric of what may be transformative, experiment with a pilot project and examine the results. If it works, implement. If it doesn\u2019t, adjust.\n\n\u2022 Walk and chew gum. The Platte River, the National Western, Interstate 70 and Brighton Boulevard are one piece of a larger city and region, not four pieces of a single initiative. Downtown Denver\u2019s edges should not begin at Colfax and Broadway and end behind Union Station at the Central Main Line. Extend downtown\u2019s perimeter southeast to Speer and Colorado and northwest to I-25 and Brighton Boulevard/East 40th Avenue.\n\n\u2022\n\nRestore every downtown street to two ways, from Cleveland Place to Wewatta, including 14th, 15th, 17th, 18th and 19th Streets. If improving circulation on these streets doesn\u2019t make the Central Business District safer and more appealing to residents, retailers and visitors, put cars back on the 16th Street Mall, along with dedicated bike lanes and a trolley.\n\n\u2022 Connect downtown and Cherry Creek with transit. Begin with pop-up transit, accessible through a phone app for Uber-style buses. For example, San Francisco\u2019s Leap Transit or Boston\u2019s Bridj, six- to 10-person coaches with comfortable seats and WiFi. If the pilot is successful, build Bogot\u00e1-style bus rapid transit, connecting Colfax, Speer and University Boulevard and link Denver\u2019s key commercial centers with a safe, clean and efficient alternative to the single-person vehicle. To ensure seamless transitions, locate bike shares, Cars2Go and pedestrian connections next to every station.\n\nOther priorities:\n\n\u2022 Build a large festival park adjacent to the Platte River, at the southwest quadrant of the National Western Stock Show site. The amenity would restore the integrity of neighborhood-serving parks, including City Park and Civic Center.\n\n\u2022 Transform the infrequently occupied historic Carnegie Library to a boutique hotel with a grand public restaurant on the main floor, including an outdoor terrace on the south. Twenty-four-hour activity solves a lot of problems.\n\n\u2022 Add a first-rate dining spot and open the beautiful lobby bars in the Ellie Caulkins Opera House when the hall is dark. At the same time, transform the under-used sculpture park behind the Denver Performing Arts Complex to an inviting public square by adding shade trees, seating areas, and engaging outdoor rooms.\n\nFinally, change Denver\u2019s motto from the Mile High City to No Penalty for Delight!\n\n\u201cMake no little plans; they have no magic to stir men\u2019s blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work.\u201d \u2014 Daniel Hudson Burnham (1846-1912)\n\nCivic activist Susan Barnes-Gelt can be reached at barnesgelt@gmail.com or @SBGtweets.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Barnes-Gelt: Denver needs ideas, optimism", "title": "Barnes-Gelt: Denver needs ideas, optimism", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/26/barnes-gelt-denver-needs-ideas-optimism/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140926__denver-16th-streetp1.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140926__denver-16th-streetp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-26T11:18:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:39:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The amenity would restore the integrity of neighborhood-serving parks, including City Park and Civic Center.\nDowntown Denver\u2019s edges should not begin at Colfax and Broadway and end behind Union Station at the Central Main Line.\nIt\u2019s time for Denver to go back to its 100-year legacy of big ideas and optimism.\n\u2022Restore every downtown street to two ways, from Cleveland Place to Wewatta, including 14th, 15th, 17th, 18th and 19th Streets.\nMake big plans; aim high in hope and work.\u201d \u2014 Daniel Hudson Burnham (1846-1912)Civic activist Susan Barnes-Gelt can be reached at barnesgelt@gmail.com or @SBGtweets."}
