CNBC's Bertha Coombs takes a look at some Colorado nonprofit organizations' unique campaign to get residents to sign up for Obamacare health insurance.

Even the healthiest bros need health insurance.

That's the message of a new social media campaign that uses keg stands and Club Med to persuade young men to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.

Or, as one ad calls it: "Brosurance."

"Keg stands are crazy. Not having health insurance is crazier," it says next to a photo of three hard-partying guys, described as "bros for life."

"The feedback, especially on Twitter, has been kind of off the charts, and I think we are surprised to see the Brosurance ad take off quite as much as it did," said Adam Fox, director of strategic engagement at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative (CCHI), which helped create the ads.

The "got insurance?" campaign is an irreverent spoof of the iconic "got milk?" ads. It's a collaboration between CCHI and ProgressNow Colorado Education, two nonprofit advocacy groups involved in promoting enrollment under the Affordable Care Act.
