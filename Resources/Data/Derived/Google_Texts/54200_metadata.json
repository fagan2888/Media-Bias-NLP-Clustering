Candidates took on issues like firearm restrictions, Obamacare, and bucking leadership in Congress. But generally speaking the nominees took positions in agreement with one another. On the topic of minimum wage small business owner and former cop Jeff Moran offered a brief demonstration.\n\n\u201cLets do a poll in here,\u201d he said, \u201cHow many of us have ever worked for minimum wage?\u201d\n\nNearly every hand in the room went up. But when he asked, \u201cHow many of us are still doing it?\u201d all those hands went down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be a living wage, ok?\u201d Moran said in triumph.\n\nSo-called bathroom bills have become a recent flashpoint in the GOP. North Carolina legislation forcing people to use the restroom of the sex they were assigned at birth has raised the ire of the Department of Justice but support among many Republicans. Former Federal prosecutor Ken Sukhia teed off on the issue.\n\n\u201cIf you have a sex stereotype that you want to be like that day you just simply are that you identify that and that gives you the right to walk into a women\u2019s restroom\u2014and we\u2019re the odd ones here?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the goofballs and the people who are being mistreated\u2014or are mistreating them?\u201d he continued to broad applause. \u201cNo, we are the normal ones.\u201d\n\nBut a more perennial issue is abortion. And Rick Scott administration attorney Mary Thomas is unequivocal on the issue.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re dealing with cases such as rape or incest, a horrific crime has been committed against a woman,\u201d Thomas said, \u201cand the person who committed that crime must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and punished.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we cannot allow an innocent baby\u2019s life to be taken to pay for the crimes of another,\u201d she concluded.\n\nPanama City Surgeon Neal Dunn doesn\u2019t take quite so hard a stance.\n\n\u201cI do think that there\u2019s room in our laws to recognize some special cases where the mother\u2019s life is at stake\u2014truly at stake, and in cases of rape and incest, otherwise I see no exceptions,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nAt the close of evening, organizers held a straw poll. Sukhia won the competition rather handily with 42 percent. Despite carrying the most endorsements, Dunn came in third\u2014narrowly beaten by Thomas. Moran was a distant fourth.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Elections 2016", "description": "Republicans running for the nomination in Florida\u2019s second congressional district took the stage for a debate in Tallahassee Thursday night.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.wfsu.org/post/former-us-atty-sukhia-wins-straw-poll-after-tame-republican-debate", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wfsu/files/styles/medium/public/201605/IMG_7118.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Republicans running for the nomination in Florida\u2019s second congressional district took the stage for a debate in Tallahassee Thursday night.", "title": "Former US Atty Sukhia Wins Straw Poll After Tame Republican Debate"}, "story_id": 477886589, "twitter": {"site": "@wfsunews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wfsunews"}, "author": "Nick Evans", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Former US Atty Sukhia Wins Straw Poll After Tame Republican Debate"}, "nid": 84169, "datePublished": "2016-05-12", "keywords": "Florida Congressional District Two, Neal Dunn, Mary Thomas, Jeff Moran, Ken Sukhia", "wordCount": 495, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cLets do a poll in here,\u201d he said, \u201cHow many of us have ever worked for minimum wage?\u201dNearly every hand in the room went up.\nRepublicans running for the nomination in Florida\u2019s second congressional district took the stage for a debate in Tallahassee Thursday night.\nThe Florida Family Policy Council\u2014a lobbying organization with a social conservative bent\u2014hosted the debate at Florida State University\u2019s Turnbull center.\nOn the topic of minimum wage small business owner and former cop Jeff Moran offered a brief demonstration.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be a living wage, ok?\u201d Moran said in triumph."}
