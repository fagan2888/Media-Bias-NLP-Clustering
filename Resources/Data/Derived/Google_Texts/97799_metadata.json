Miraculously, the mountain was said to have opened up and given protection to the princess, the youngest daughter of the last king of the Persian Sassanian empire.\n\nA spring slowly drips from the ceiling of the shrine, built into a cliff-side cave, giving the site its name, which means \u201cdrip drip\u201d in Persian.\n\nTradition says the spring is the mountain shedding tears in remembrance of Nikbanou. An immense tree stands nearby, which is said to have grown from Nikbanou\u2019s cane.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all gathered here to remember Nikbanou and celebrate our deep Persian roots,\u201d said priest Ardeshir Khorshidian who was dressed in white to symbolize purity.\n\nMany pilgrims stay overnight at pavilions set up at the base of the mountain. Families sitting on rugs had picnics while children played.\n\nDariush Tirandazi, an Iranian-American Zoroastrian, brought his 22-year-old daughter Nadia so she could experience the faith in the land where it was born.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to learn and this was our chance to come here and show her the temple, to give her the chance to be with Zoroastrians and understand Zoroastrian culture and values.\u201d\n\nZoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion predating Christianity and Islam founded some 3,800 years ago by Zoroaster. It was the dominant religion in Persia before the Arab conquest.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iran\u2019s Zoroastrians celebrate Persian roots", "author": "Ali Akbar Dareini", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Iran\u2019s Zoroastrians celebrate Persian roots", "title": "Iran\u2019s Zoroastrians celebrate Persian roots", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/15/irans_zoroastrians_celebrate_persian_roots/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/aptopix-mideast-iran-zoroastrians.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iran\u2019s Zoroastrians celebrate Persian roots", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/aptopix-mideast-iran-zoroastrians.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Iran\u2019s Zoroastrians celebrate Persian roots", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Iran\u2019s Zoroastrians celebrate Persian roots", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1370\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ve all gathered here to remember Nikbanou and celebrate our deep Persian roots,\u201d said priest Ardeshir Khorshidian who was dressed in white to symbolize purity.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsCHAK CHAK, Iran (AP) \u2014 Adherents of the Zoroastrian religion from around the world gathered at a mountain shrine in central Iran this week to celebrate their Persian roots, praying in remembrance of a princess who fled the seventh century Arab invasion.\nA spring slowly drips from the ceiling of the shrine, built into a cliff-side cave, giving the site its name, which means \u201cdrip drip\u201d in Persian.\nMiraculously, the mountain was said to have opened up and given protection to the princess, the youngest daughter of the last king of the Persian Sassanian empire.\nTradition says the spring is the mountain shedding tears in remembrance of Nikbanou."}
