He extended his contract with the hospital twice, each for one-year terms.\n\nHochheiser plans to stay on with the hospital at least through June 30, but said he is staying flexible in case the medical center needs more time to find a successor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly when the process will end, so I\u2019m leaving myself open without making any commitments to still help out if I\u2019m needed,\u201d he said.\n\nHochheiser has been credited with expanding collaborative efforts with surrounding medical facilities, most notably with University of Utah Health Care and most recently with Sublette County Rural Health Care District.\n\nHe also is known for \u201csignificantly expanding\u201d the community wellness program, which includes the \u201cDinner with a Doc\u201d series at the Senior Center of Jackson Hole and open house events about the Affordable Care Act, hospital spokeswoman Karen Connelly said.\n\n\u201cBefore Lou got here, we were a place defined by four walls,\u201d Connelly said.\n\n\u201cWith Lou at the helm, this hospital has come light years,\u201d said St. John\u2019s Board Trustee Scott Gibson. \u201cThe whole community wellness program, that\u2019s totally his.\u201d\n\nHochheiser also is credited for expanding St. John\u2019s staff to include additional surgeons, an internist and a cardiologist.\n\nGibson noted that Hochheiser\u2019s clinical experience allowed him to steer the hospital to what types of physicians to hire and which departments to expand.\n\n\u201cTo have that deep medical background as CEO, you can really weigh in on important medical calls,\u201d he said.\n\nThe three-person committee created to lead the search for a new CEO consists of trustees Cynthia Hogan and Gibson and board chair Michael Tennican. Hogan will chair the committee.\n\nHogan asked the board to approve hiring Witt/Kieffer, an Oak Brook, Illinois, firm that specializes in executive searches, to aid in the process. The board unanimously approved the firm, though a contract has yet to be negotiated.\n\n\u201cThe board believes it is appropriate again to cast our net widely to ensure ourselves and our community that we identify the best candidate possible to succeed Lou,\u201d Tennican said in Monday\u2019s board meeting. \u201cIt is our goal to have the next CEO in place by June 1, in order to pave the way for a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nThough the position will be open nationwide, Hochheiser said he has been grooming a candidate for more than a year: Dr. Marty Trott, an ear, nose and throat doctor who also serves as vice president for clinical operations.\n\nTrott moved into this part-time administrative role, a new position for the hospital, in December 2014.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working hard to create a successor, and we have a really strong candidate internally,\u201d Hochheiser said of Trott. \u201cBut the board feels this is so important to the community that they need to go through the process.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Jackson Hole News&Guide", "description": "St. John\u2019s Medical Center CEO Lou Hochheiser announced his retirement Monday, ending what will be a four-year term as the chief executive of the hospital.", "title": "St. John's CEO retires", "url": "http://www.jhnewsandguide.com/jackson_hole_daily/local/st-john-s-ceo-retires/article_e4754c54-d5a2-5d15-b605-e8a404148a84.html", "image": "http://jhnewsandguide.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/og_image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@JacksonHoleNews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "St. John\u2019s Medical Center CEO Lou Hochheiser announced his retirement Monday, ending what will be a four-year term as the chief executive of the hospital.", "fb": {"app_id": 1448656212045976}, "keywords": "lou hochheiser,st. johns medical center,karen connelly,university of utah health care,sublette county rural health care district,cynthia hogan,scott gibson,michael tennican,kieffer,marty trott,local,top_story", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no", "news_keywords": "lou hochheiser,st. johns medical center,karen connelly,university of utah health care,sublette county rural health care district,cynthia hogan,scott gibson,michael tennican,kieffer,marty trott,local,top_story"}, "article_summary": "Hochheiser, a former family physician and former chief medical leader for Humana, originally contracted with St. John\u2019s in 2012 for two years.\nSt. John\u2019s Medical Center CEO Lou Hochheiser announced his retirement Monday, ending what will be a four-year term as the chief executive of the hospital.\n\u201cWith Lou at the helm, this hospital has come light years,\u201d said St. John\u2019s Board Trustee Scott Gibson.\n\u201cThe whole community wellness program, that\u2019s totally his.\u201dHochheiser also is credited for expanding St. John\u2019s staff to include additional surgeons, an internist and a cardiologist.\n\u201cBut the board feels this is so important to the community that they need to go through the process.\u201d"}
