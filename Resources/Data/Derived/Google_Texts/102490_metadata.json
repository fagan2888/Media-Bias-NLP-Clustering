There\u2019s no reason for the government to make nuns be a part of this.\u201d\n\nSen. Roy Blunt, Missouri Republican, also applauded Justice Sotomayor\u2019s decision, calling the contraception mandate \u201can egregious and blatant violation\u201d of religious freedoms guaranteed under the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cNo American should be forced to surrender their religious freedom or abandon their deeply held religious beliefs,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAttorneys submitted their case to Justice Sotomayor after their request was denied Tuesday by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. Justice Sotomayor handles cases from the 10th Circuit.\n\nThe \u2018luxury of time\u2019\n\nKevin Walsh, University of Richmond law professor and co-counsel for the Little Sisters, said that once the government has responded to the injunction, Justice Sotomayor can decide whether to continue to block enforcement of the contraception mandate, pending a decision on the merits.\n\n\u201cUntil the injunction, there was no luxury of time,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. \u201cWhat this temporary injunction provides is some time for the Supreme Court to give it thorough consideration and also hear from the government.\u201d\n\nThe nuns and other religious organizations have the option of filing paperwork indicating it will not be covering contraceptives because of the tenets of their faith, but as Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, explained, \u201cthey don\u2019t want to be complicit in any way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration issued a rule that was a so-called accommodation for the views and interests of religious organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to pay for the product or procedures they object to, but their [insurance companies] will. They have to certify they\u2019re not covering it and authorize insurers to do so.\u201d\n\nDivided nation\n\nJudy Waxman, vice president for health and reproductive rights at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said her organization was \u201cnot happy\u201d with the order, but shared the view that many more steps would be taken before a final decision is rendered on the mandate.\n\n\u201cThe question at hand is: Is signing a piece of paper a burden on an institution\u2019s religious affiliation?\u201d Ms. Waxman said. \u201cI cannot imagine how it could be.\u201d\n\nMs. Waxman said that as the case progressed, the law center would take advantage of any opportunities for outside parties to weigh in.\n\nWednesday marked the start of the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance. Included in the program is an administrative rule requiring large employers to insure birth control as part of their health care plans, including morning-after pills that some religious groups equate to abortion.\n\nThe nuns are not the first to fight the mandate, though their injunction was filed just before the deadline. Numbers provided by the Becket Fund show that 91 cases have been filed against the contraceptive requirement, split roughly between profit and nonprofit organizations.\n\nLower courts have been divided on the constitutionality of the contraception mandate, and the U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments from for-profit organizations this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to see that almost every religious nonprofit that\u2019s asked for a preliminary injunction has gotten one,\u201d the Becket Fund\u2019s Mr. Rienzi said. \u201cThe momentum is big and strong and something to be positive about.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Advocates for a Denver-based congregation of Catholic nuns on Wednesday applauded an eleventh-hour order by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor to temporarily block a requirement under the Affordable Care Act to insure birth control procedures, but attorneys and analysts agreed the fight is far from over.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Advocates for a Denver-based congregation of Catholic nuns on Wednesday applauded an eleventh-hour order by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor to temporarily block a requirement under the Affordable Care Act to insure birth control procedures, but attorneys and analysts agreed the fight is far from over.", "title": "Ruling by Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor sets off another battle over Obamacare", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/1/ruling-by-supreme-court-justice-sotomayor-sets-off/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/01/united-states-new-years-evejpeg-0b0b2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/01/united-states-new-years-evejpeg-0b0b2.jpg", "description": "Advocates for a Denver-based congregation of Catholic nuns on Wednesday applauded an eleventh-hour order by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor to temporarily block a requirement under the Affordabl", "card": "summary", "title": "Ruling by Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor sets off another battle over"}, "Author": "Meredith Somers", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Religion Belief, Politics, Sonia Sotomayor, Barack Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b1c\"", "article_summary": "Attorneys submitted their case to Justice Sotomayor after their request was denied Tuesday by the 10th U.S.\nJustice Sotomayor handles cases from the 10th Circuit.\nThe justice\u2019s ruling was also the latest setback in a string of implementation problems that the Obama administration has encountered since the rollout of its health care exchanges in October.\nThe nuns are not the first to fight the mandate, though their injunction was filed just before the deadline.\nLower courts have been divided on the constitutionality of the contraception mandate, and the U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments from for-profit organizations this year."}
