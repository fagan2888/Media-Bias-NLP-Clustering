The Court will hear oral arguments on the challenges to the mandate on March 23.\n\nThe brief was signed by 240 students, faculty and staff at \u201creligious institutions.\u201d All but one of the colleges and universities represented in the brief are Catholic. The faculty and staff members who signed the brief are employed by DePaul University in Chicago, Fordham University, Fordham University School of Law, Georgetown University Law Center and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.\n\nStudents at Georgetown University, Loyola University New Orleans, Saint Louis University School of Law, University of Detroit Mercy School of Law and the University of Notre Dame also signed the brief.\n\n\u201cBecause they work or study at religiously affiliated entities and rely on the contraceptive coverage guaranteed to them and their dependents under the Affordable Care Act, amici bring special insight into the importance of the current accommodation regulations in ensuring that women are able to make their own reproductive decisions,\u201d according to the brief.\n\nThe brief defended the necessity of the HHS mandate \u2014 which attacks the religious freedom of Catholic employers and promotes moral evils \u2014 declaring that Catholic institutions resisting the mandate and its \u201caccommodation\u201d have \u201cno right to veto the government\u2019s provision of benefits and thereby to strip these students, faculty, and staff of access to coverage for critical preventive care.\u201d The Catholic college faculty and students went on to argue that contraception is imperative to women\u2019s professional advancement, and as such, the government has a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in requiring employers to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\n\u201cContraceptives prevent unintended pregnancy and abortion, expand women\u2019s educational and professional opportunities, and improve women\u2019s health,\u201d the brief argued. \u201cAs a result, the government\u2019s interests in ensuring access to contraceptive coverage is compelling, and the stakes for the affected women are high.\u201d\n\nFordham University is the most represented institution, with seven signatures from faculty and staff and 81 from students. Fordham signees include Amy Aronson, professor of journalism and media studies; Jeanne Flavin, professor of sociology; Kathryn Krasinski, adjunct professor of anthropology; Brenna Moore, associate professor of theology; Kirsten Swinth, associate professor of history; Laura Wernick, assistant professor at Fordham\u2019s School of Social Service; and Erin Coughlin, an executive secretary. Fordham University School of Law is represented by Chi Mgbako, a clinical professor of law and director of the School\u2019s Leitner International Human Rights Clinic, along with 59 student signatures.\n\nFlavin is a board member of National Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW), an organization that advocates for abortion rights. \u201cNAPW knows that there are many ways to reduce the number of abortions but that banning abortions is not one of them,\u201d the group\u2019s webpage on \u201cAbortion and Contraception Restrictions\u201d states.\n\nTwo professors from Georgetown University Law Center signed the brief: Deborah Epstein, professor of law and director of the Center\u2019s Domestic Violence Clinic; and Jill Morrison, visiting professor of law. Sixty-six students attending Georgetown Law also signed, as well as three students at Georgetown University.\n\nMorrison previously signed an amicus brief in support of abortionists in Texas in the case Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Cole, which was argued before the Supreme Court this month. She was one of 110 female attorneys that signed the brief who claimed they would not have been able to advance in their careers or achieve success had they not procured abortions. Morrison is also vice chair on the board of Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice (RCRC), an organization that partners with groups such as the dissident Catholics for Choice to advocate for abortion and contraception.\n\nThree professors from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, Calif., signed the brief: Lily Khadjavi, professor of mathematics; Anna Muraco, assistant professor of sociology; and Jennifer Pate, associate professor and chair of the economics department.\n\nMuraco and Pate were both quoted in a 2013 article in the Los Angeles Times on the subject of the University\u2019s decision to drop employee health insurance for \u201celective\u201d abortions. The move garnered some backlash from displeased faculty and staff. \u201cA total ban [on abortion coverage] would signal that the university \u2018values diversity less than our Catholic affiliation,\u2019\u201d Pate was quoted as stating. And Muraco reportedly claimed that the move \u201cstripped away a benefit and imposed an inequity on women in the workplace.\u201d\n\nHeather Sevener, an academic advisor at DePaul University in Chicago, also signed.\n\nAs demonstrated in Ex corde Ecclesiae, the Church is clear on the responsibility teachers at Catholic institutions are given in preserving and protecting Catholic identity:\n\nThe identity of a Catholic University is essentially linked to the quality of its teachers and to respect for Catholic doctrine. \u2026 All teachers and all administrators, at the time of their appointment, are to be informed about the Catholic identity of the Institution and its implications, and about their responsibility to promote, or at least to respect, that identity. \u2026 In ways appropriate to the different academic disciplines, all Catholic teachers are to be faithful to, and all other teachers are to respect, Catholic doctrine and morals in their research and teaching.\n\nThe signees\u2019 connection to Catholic institutions is particularly scandalous given the fact that many Catholic colleges are currently challenging the HHS mandate, arguing that any involvement in the distribution of contraceptives would significantly damage their Catholic identities.\n\nAt least 22 Catholic schools and 11 Catholic colleges have challenged the mandate in federal courts, including Aquinas College in Nashville, Tenn.; Ave Maria University in Ave Maria, Fla.; Belmont Abbey College in Belmont, N.C.; The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.; Franciscan University of Steubenville, Ohio; Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, Calif.; University of Dallas; and Wyoming Catholic College.\n\nFaithful Catholics are being encouraged to join in prayer and fasting for the protection of religious freedom leading up to and on the day of the March 23 oral arguments before the Court.\n\nCatholic Education Daily is an online publication of The Cardinal Newman Society.
