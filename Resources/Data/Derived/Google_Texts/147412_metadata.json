The agency fired off a press release late last week defending itself against \"an onslaught of negative press.\"\n\nOne leader of the Long Term Care Ombudsman Program who left, former deputy director Don Heming, said he resigned rather than cooperate with an internal investigation of how the ombudsman leaders were handling the move of Medicaid nursing home patients into managed care plans, The News Service of Florida reported.
