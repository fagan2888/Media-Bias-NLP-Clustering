(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)\n\n4916352\n\nEight of the 11 remaining Obamacare health insurance co-ops are in serious financial trouble and could collapse by the end of the year, Mandy Cohen, a top federal health official told Congress Thursday in testimony before a House oversight panel.\n\nCohen, the chief operating officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, generally stonewalled the House Oversight Subcommittee on Health Care, Benefits and Administrative Rules during a hearing focused on the status of the surviving Obamacare health insurance co-ops and the additional costs taxpayers could face in the event of more failures.\n\nTwenty three of the non-profit co-ops were established under Obamacare in 2012 to compete with commercial for-profit insurance companies. But so far half \u2014 or 12 \u2014 have closed their doors after only two years of operation. A thirteenth co-op in Vermont was never licensed to operate.\n\nCohen stubbornly refused to disclose which of the remaining 11 are struggling, but conceded that eight now face either federal \u201cenhanced oversight\u201d or are operating under a federal \u201ccorrective action plan.\u201d\n\nCohen refused to guarantee any of the three co-ops not presently operating under a corrective plan would survive the year. \u201cToo early to tell in the year,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAs new information comes up, if we need to, we will put more folks up on corrective action plans.\u201d\n\nThe CMS corrective plans identify operational problems, management deficiencies, poor vendor oversight, pricing problems, an inadequate medical network or a deficient business strategy, according to Cohen.\n\nThe co-ops face \u201cchallenges,\u201d Cohen told the panel, but refused to predict which are likely to fail, saying \u201cthey don\u2019t fix overnight.\u201d She also declined to estimate how much more taxpayers will lose on the co-op program or how much, if any, will be recovered.\n\n\u201cWe are just learning how much we will lose,\u201d she said.\n\nAbout $1.4 billion of the $2.5 billion in Obamacare loan funding was lost when the 12 failed co-ops went under.\n\nCohen ominously hinted that many local hospitals, medical clinics and doctors may not be paid for services they delivered to co-op patients, because federal law requires that the government be first in line among creditors.\n\n\u201cFor federal loans, there is an order of repayment,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe we are at the very top of all of the creditors,\u201d but who gets paid \u201cis on a case-by-case basis\u201d determined by the Justice Department.\n\nSubcommittee Chairman Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, wanted more public information for consumers about the performance of the surviving co-ops, but Cohen stoutly resisted the suggestion.\n\n\u201cSo your position is that certain information can\u2019t get out because it would somehow jeopardize the ability of co-ops to survive,\u201d he said. \u201cI fail to see that. Somehow if we get information about enrollment projections and profitability, that\u2019s going to ruin their reputation? Really?\u201d\n\nCohen said she was \u201chappy\u201d to share that information in private.\n\n\u201cIf consumers get that information that\u2019s somehow it\u2019s going to hurt them,\u201d Jordan asked. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of information they need to know so they can say, \u2018look, this thing is going down.'\u201d\n\nCohen still refused to disclose the troubled co-ops, saying that was up to the state insurance commissioners. \u201cThat\u2019s really the job of the state department of insurance.\u201d\n\nCohen also declined to discuss how many of the surviving co-ops were failing to meet enrollment projections. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to the specifics of any one of the co-ops, but that\u2019s definitely a factor we look at,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re first getting in the data.\u201d\n\nRep. Buddy Carter, a Georgia Republican, told Cohen the federal government ought to pull the plug on all of the remaining co-ops. \u201cOne of the things they told us is when you\u2019re in a hole, stop digging,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a hole here. Why are we still digging?\u201d\n\nCohen responded that \u201cwe share your concern here. This program certainly have challenges,\u201d and she promised \u201cextensive and aggressive oversight\u201d by her agency.\n\n\n\nFollow Richard on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
