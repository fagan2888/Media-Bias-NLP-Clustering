Welcome back to the Reason Weekly Contest! This week's question is:

Claremont College student Steven Glick was a tutor at his school's Writing Center until his right-leaning opinions were found to be at odds with the center's goal of creating a "safe space." Before he finally resigned, he was told to read a series of social justice articles, including "Heteropatriarchy and the Three Pillars of White Supremacy." Come up with the name of another article he may have been told to read.
