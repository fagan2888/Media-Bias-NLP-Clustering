Hershey has made the first step in its previously announced plans to use simpler ingredients — the chocolate company will now use real vanilla in its famous milk chocolate Kisses and bars, instead of artificial flavoring. Hershey said the new version of the chocolates began shipping a few weeks ago and are already in stores, or will be as soon as shelves are restocked.

“Natural flavor” will now be listed on the ingredients instead of vanillin, the artificial ingredient that used to give the chocolate a vanilla flavor. Lactose, a sugar in milk, is also set to be removed from the chocolates soon. Hershey has already gotten rid of PGPR, which used to make the chocolate flow better in a manufacturing plant. Instead, they’re adding more cocoa butter to create the right texture.

In February, the Pennsylvania-based chocolate manufacturer announced it would be combing through its products to simplify ingredients, an endeavor that will likely take a few years.
