He and guests David Miliband and David Frum debate the merits of a travel ban before Maher goes off on the "morons in that f--king hospital in Dallas." “They love their freedom down in Texas,” he said. “They don’t like rules and regulations and ‘tellin’ us what to do’ and revenuers and the federal government. What could go wrong? This.” Watch the clip above.
