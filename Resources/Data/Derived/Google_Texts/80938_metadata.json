The one on the left was severely pruned the previous spring while the tree on the right was left untouched.\n\nI once had a neighbor that would chop back a red maple from time to time. One day, the tree form would be full and the next it was a 10-foot-tall hat rack. He didn\u2019t really have a reason. He said the tree just needed it. When the foliage grew back, it looked less like a maple and more like something Dr. Seuss would invent.\n\nThe problem, as I once tried to explain, was that incorrect pruning leads to weak branching structure and subsequent decay. Pruning isn\u2019t always necessary.\n\nUnless plants are crowded or branching needs correcting, trees can be left alone. That goes for crape myrtles, by the way.\n\nIdeally, good landscape design allows space for trees and shrubs to grow unimpeded. From time to time, however, pruning is needed.\n\nWhen to prune\n\nTechnically, you can prune any time of the year. You won\u2019t kill a plant by pruning it at the wrong time, but you could cause undue stress and affect flowering.\n\nMany experts believe winter is the best time to prune. Branching structure is easier to examine once the leaves have fallen and damaged branches are easier to identify and correct.\n\nPruning cuts also will bleed much less sap in the winter.\n\nThe least desirable time to prune is shortly after new growth has emerged in spring. Healthy plants will tolerate pruning at this time, but you\u2019re causing stress by removing new foliage.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get excess bleeding that stains the trunk. While this isn\u2019t harmful, it is unsightly.\n\nLate fall also is a less-than-desirable time to prune since it can stimulate new growth at a time when the plant is hardening off for winter. Again, healthy plants are tolerant, but wait if you can.\n\nFlowering time\n\nTrees and shrubs will either produce flowers on last year\u2019s growth or the current season\u2019s growth.\n\nThere are some plants that produce flowers on both old and new growth, such as Encore azaleas and Endless Summer hydrangeas, but most trees and shrubs are one or the other.\n\nFor instance, the flower buds that will bloom on azaleas this April were set last summer.\n\nIf you prune an azalea now, you\u2019ll remove most of the flower buds. The blooms will be spotty at best. Trees and shrubs of this nature typically set the following year\u2019s flower buds in July.\n\nCrape myrtles are the best example of a plant that flowers on the current season\u2019s growth.\n\nIn fact, I believe the practice of severely pruning crape myrtles into submission was an attempt to force more new growth for more flowers. Clemson, however, has shown that correctly pruned crape myrtles flower more profusely (www.clemson.edu/crapemyrtle).\n\nIf you don\u2019t know when your tree or shrub sets flower buds, play it safe and prune right after it flowers.\n\nCorrect pruning\n\nAlways prune a branch back to another branch. Think of the letter Y.\n\nPrune the left line back to where the two lines split, so it now looks like a single line going up and angling to the right.\n\nRandom pruning results in numerous weak branches called water sprouts that disrupt the tree\u2019s natural form. The evidence, unfortunately, appears on too many crape myrtles.\n\nIf you grunt trying to make the cut, your pruners are likely too small. Hand pruners are for branches less than half an inch. Long-handled loppers typically cut branches up to 1 inch, although some designs cut up to 2 inches.\n\nPruning saws are often curved and cut large limbs on the backstroke. Folding pruning saws are convenient and very aggressive.\n\nWhile the chainsaw makes the roughest pruning cut, it does a lot of work. It\u2019s also very dangerous, so operate with care. Gas-powered chain saws are preferred, but electric chainsaws are frequently suitable for many homeowners.\n\nA proper pruning cut will seal over with callus tissue over time. There\u2019s no need to paint pruning cuts.\n\nTony Bertauski is a horticulture instructor at Trident Technical College.
