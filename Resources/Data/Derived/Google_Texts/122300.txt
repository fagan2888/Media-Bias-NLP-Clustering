KALAMAZOO, MI -- As a mother with four school-age children, Azzetta Matthews was thrilled about the Back to School Bash held Friday in the parking lot of Family Health Center in Kalamazoo's Northside neighborhood.

For Matthews, the best part of the event was making sure her children had the necessary immunizations before school starts, as well as the fact that each child received a new backpack filled with school supplies.

For her children, the major attraction were the carnival rides and other entertainment.

"It's very nice and very helpful," Matthews said about the bash. "They like the rides and the time with family and friends -- and I like the fact I can let them roam around until they're worn out."

Up to 1,800 children were expected at the Back to School Bash, said Seun Adelwale, chief operating officer of the Family Health Center and organizer of Friday's event.

"This is a signature event in the community," he said. "We make sure the kids come in, get their immunizations and get a backpack, and then they can have fun.

"This really reflects our focus as a community health center," Adelwale said. "It's kind of a summer love-filled event."

While the event is sponsored by the Family Health Center, the $40,000 cost is shared by a long list of donors and community partners, he said.

Many of those partners had booths at the bash, including health insurance companies offering information on MiChild and Healthy Michigan coverage and sign-ups for preschool.

"I think it's awesome, " said Marla Sykes, who was at the event with her son, Jeriean Steward, 11. "They've got very good turnout.

"It's a very good way to get the word out about health care and other things," she said.

"It's nice for the kids," agreed Tameka Williams, the mother of four. "And it helps me make sure they get school supplies."
