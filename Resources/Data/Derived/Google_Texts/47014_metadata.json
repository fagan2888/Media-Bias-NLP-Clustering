First, she said, the minimum wage should be a state, not federal, decision. \u201cIt makes no sense to say that the minimum wage in New York City is the same as the minimum wage in Mason City, Iowa,\u201d she said, according to National Journal. And second, she said people need to remember that a lot of minimum-wage jobs are where people start, and learn skills to move forward. \u201cOne of the consequences is that young people who are trapped in poor neighborhoods will have less opportunities to learn skills and move forward,\u201d she said. That argument, writes National Journal, is an alluring one for Republican primary voters, but one that is very hard to bear out in research.\n\nTrump on top: Donald Trump\u2019s polling keeps getting better. A new CNN/ORC poll, released Tuesday morning, finds Trump has won the Republican Party\u2019s trust on top issues more than any other GOP candidate. The survey finds Trump with the support of 24% of Republican registered voters. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is second with 13%, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is in third with 9%.\n\nWalker to blast Republican leaders: With anti-establishment Republicans gaining traction in polls, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is also trying to establish himself as an outsider. Politico reports Walker will take on the GOP\u2019s leaders in Congress in a speech he is set to deliver in Minnesota on Tuesday. \u201cRepublican leaders in Washington told us during the campaign last year that we needed a Republican Senate to repeal Obamacare,\u201d Walker will say, according to excerpts of his remarks. \u201cWell, Republicans have been in charge of both houses of Congress since January and there still isn\u2019t a bill on the president\u2019s desk to repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nObama no socialist, says Sanders: Bernie Sanders gave the New York Times a flat \u201cno\u201d when asked if he thought President Barack Obama is a socialist. In a Q&A with the New York Times Magazine, Sanders, who is challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, was also asked to give his \u201celevator pitch\u201d for socialism. \u201cMy elevator pitch is that the United States has a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality where the top one-tenth of one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, where almost 20 percent of our children are living in poverty, 40 percent of African-American children are living in poverty,\u201d said Sanders. He says it is imperative the U.S. develops a political movement \u201cthat says to the billionaire class they cannot have it all.\u201d\n\nNow on Yelp: Review the federal government: Have something to say about the federal government? Now you can share your opinion on Yelp. The Washington Post reports the government is officially encouraging the public to rate their experiences with things like renewing their passports and dealing with airport security screeners. The General Services Administration\u2019s DigitalGov team launched the initiative last week.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Carly Fiorina on why she opposes raising the federal minimum wage; Bernie Sanders on whether President Obama is a socialist; reviewing the federal government on Yelp; and more.", "creator": "@mktwrobs", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DL732_fiorin_ZG_20150511130543.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Robert Schroeder", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Carly Fiorina on why she opposes raising the federal minimum wage; Bernie Sanders on whether President Obama is a socialist; reviewing the federal government on Yelp; and more.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/carly-fiorina-says-raising-minimum-wage-would-lead-to-less-opportunity-2015-08-18", "author": "Robert Schroeder", "parsely-title": "Carly Fiorina says raising minimum wage would lead to less opportunity", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-08-18T07:31:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Carly Fiorina on why she opposes raising the federal minimum wage; Bernie Sanders on whether President Obama is a socialist; reviewing the federal government on Yelp; and more.", "title": "Carly Fiorina says raising minimum wage would lead to less opportunity", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/carly-fiorina-says-raising-minimum-wage-would-lead-to-less-opportunity-2015-08-18", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DL732_fiorin_ZG_20150511130543.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DL732_fiorin_ZG_20150511130543.jpg"}, "article.id": "130C830A-459A-11E5-8389-05EA20A11754", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd12f\"", "article_summary": "A higher minimum wage is a recipe for lowering opportunities for young people, according to Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina.\nSpeaking Monday at the Iowa State Fair, Fiorina gave two reasons for her opposition to hiking the federal minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour.\n\u201cIt makes no sense to say that the minimum wage in New York City is the same as the minimum wage in Mason City, Iowa,\u201d she said, according to National Journal.\nFirst, she said, the minimum wage should be a state, not federal, decision.\nWalker to blast Republican leaders: With anti-establishment Republicans gaining traction in polls, Wisconsin Gov."}
