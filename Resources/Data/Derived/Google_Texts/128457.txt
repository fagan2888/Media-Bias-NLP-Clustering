An Illinois man is accusing a Chicago-based insurance provider of overcharging customers for health insurance by calculating premiums differently than specified in the Affordable Care Act, according to a lawsuit filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court.

Lawrence Necheles, of Pontiac, Ill., is suing Land of Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance Co. for breach of contract and consumer fraud, according to court documents. Necheles searched the state's health insurance website, GetCovered Illinois, for coverage for himself and his daughter in December 2013 after which he enrolled in Land of Lincoln Mutual Health, the suit said.

Necheles alleges in the lawsuit that Land of Lincoln Mutual Health issued him a policy that was more expensive and provided less coverage than what he was quoted for through his search. The suit alleges the insurer computed Necheles' plan based on his pretax income rather than adjusted gross income.

"Defendant's unfair acts and practices in overcharging consumers for health insurance were unethical, oppressive, and unscrupulous," the lawsuit said.

Land of Lincoln Mutual Health didn't immediately respond to a call Monday night seeking comment.

Necheles is seeking damages, attorney costs, litigation fees and injunctive relief for those in a similar situation.
