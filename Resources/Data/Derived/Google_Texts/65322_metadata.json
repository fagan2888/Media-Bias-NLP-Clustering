The Department of Public Health is getting 10 new positions, mostly to help stop the spread of infectious diseases. The big problem right now is syphilis.\"We have experienced a huge increase in the number of cases of primary and secondary syphilis in the community in the past two years. Going along with that is the congenital syphilis, both primary, secondary, and congenital have increased ten fold since 2012,\" said Dr. Ken Bird, County Health Officer.The rapidly spreading disease is a dangerous threat to the unborn, and can lead to miscarriages and birth defects. The hope is the additional personnel will help stop the spread of the disease. State and Federal Health workers have already been called in to help.\"My biggest concern is finding the individuals that are infected and infectious and getting them treated so no further infection occurs,\" said Dr. Bird.The Board of Supervisors approved 45 additional positions in behavioral health and public health. They will be paid for with more than $4-million a year in federal and state funds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal and state governments are helping Fresno County help those with mental health problems, drug abuse, and sexually transmitted diseases.", "og": {"site_name": "ABC30 Fresno", "description": "The federal and state governments are helping Fresno County help those with mental health problems, drug abuse, and sexually transmitted diseases.", "title": "State and federal governments helping Fresno County help others with health issues", "url": "http://abc30.com/1310570/", "image": "http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/content/kfsn/images/cms/automation/vod/1310577_1280x720.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The federal and state governments are helping Fresno County help those with mental health problems, drug abuse, and sexually transmitted diseases.", "creator": "@abc30", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/abc30-fresno/id408436001", "iphone": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/abc30-fresno/id408436001", "googleplay": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abclocal.kfsn.news"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "ABC30 Fresno", "iphone": "ABC30 Fresno", "googleplay": "ABC30 Fresno"}, "id": {"ipad": 408436001, "iphone": 408436001, "googleplay": "com.abclocal.kfsn.news"}}, "title": "State and federal governments helping Fresno County help others with health issues", "site": "@abc30", "image": "http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/content/kfsn/images/cms/automation/vod/1310577_1280x720.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "59C39F9AA91BE12CB90B7EF18335463D", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=408436001, affiliate-data=ct=kfsn-smart-banner&pt=302756, app-argument=http://abc30.com/health/state-and-federal-governments-helping-fresno-county-help-others-with-health-issues/1310570/", "fb": {"app_id": 228176854052685, "pages": 160328526481}, "keywords": "Fresno County,State and federal governments,mental health,health issues,Behavioral Health,Dawan Utecht,Dr. Ken Bird,fresno county,mental health,grant,jobs", "google-site-verification": "vi6Z_KgHMFudo6Bxglnd2t2-OcbvfQQuv8ZdtX9ucRU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Fresno County,State and federal governments,mental health,health issues,Behavioral Health,Dawan Utecht,Dr. Ken Bird"}, "article_summary": "The federal and state governments are helping Fresno County help those with mental health problems, drug abuse, and sexually transmitted diseases.After years of cutting personnel Fresno County is hiring, because of the Affordable Care Act and state fund the County's drug treatment programs are set to expand.\nState and Federal Health workers have already been called in to help.\nThey will be paid for with more than $4-million a year in federal and state funds.\nThe Department of Public Health is getting 10 new positions, mostly to help stop the spread of infectious diseases.\n\"My biggest concern is finding the individuals that are infected and infectious and getting them treated so no further infection occurs,\" said Dr. Bird.The Board of Supervisors approved 45 additional positions in behavioral health and public health."}
