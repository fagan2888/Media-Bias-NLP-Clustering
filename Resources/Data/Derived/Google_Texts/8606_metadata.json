The county\u2019s human resources director said about 500 people did not report to work Wednesday.\n\nThe workers, represented by Service Employees International Union, said they have been in negotiations with the county since July.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get a fair contract for our members, and we want them to bargain with us fairly,\u201d said Nadeen Roach, an SEIU member who said her job at the county is to help people wanting to enroll for a health plan under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSolano County\u2019s Human Resources Director Marc Fox said there are six sticking points in the negotiations, but the workers have been offered a fair contract.\n\n\u201cThe county has offered a 3-percent wage increase immediately and a 3-percent wage increase in October of next year,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe union has asked for more. The county has offered continuation of health insurance with inflation factored in for 2016 and 2017. The union has asked for more.\u201d\n\nThe full impacts of the strike were difficult to measure Wednesday. Some of those protesting were social workers who tend to the elderly and disabled and check on at-risk children.\n\n\u201cRight now, all my clients are aged, blind and disabled,\u201d said Akbar Bibb, a social worker who is also president of the local SEIU chapter. \u201cSo, right now, me being out here, I\u2019m not able to serve my clients.\u201d\n\nSome county residents trying to use the Fairfield Civic Center Library Wednesday were not happy with the strike. Because of a lack of workers, the branch and four other libraries in the county were closed.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d said Fairfield resident Bob Albrecht, who was able to return books, but couldn\u2019t check any out. \u201cThey should allow people to get books all the time.\u201d\n\nThe strike was a one-day event and workers will report to work Thursday, union representatives said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Wed, 14 Oct 2015 19:20:23 PDT", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Sharokina Shams", "og": {"site_name": "KCRA", "description": "A large crowd of county workers on strike shut down public libraries Wednesday afternoon and descended on the Solano County administration building in Fairfield.", "title": "Solano County worker strike closes libraries", "url": "http://www.kcra.com/news/Solano-County-worker-strike-closes-libraries/35847170", "image": "http://www.kcra.com/image/view/-/35848346/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/tsibe3/-/FF-strike-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.kcra.com/news/Solano-County-worker-strike-closes-libraries/35847170", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "kcra://content/article/35847170", "iphone": "kcra://content/article/35847170", "googleplay": "kcra://content/article/35847170"}, "name": {"ipad": "kcra", "iphone": "kcra", "googleplay": "kcra"}, "id": {"ipad": 505581274, "iphone": 505581274, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}}, "site": "@kcranews", "card": "app"}, "description": "A large crowd of county workers on strike shut down public libraries Wednesday afternoon and descended on the Solano County administration building in Fairfield.", "al": {"android": {"url": "kcra://content/article/35847170", "app_name": "kcra", "package": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}, "ios": {"url": "kcra://content/article/35847170", "app_store_id": 505581274, "app_name": "kcra"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 102798321191}, "keywords": "Fairfield, union, strike, Solano County, march, kcra, kcra 3, kcra.com, kcra news", "google-site-verification": "lseesGPufjGiNJ4blx9-qW5A0JKGfgPc9Mw6RTc9Ulo", "news_keywords": "Fairfield, union, strike, Solano County, march, kcra, kcra 3, kcra.com, kcra news"}, "article_summary": "A large crowd of county workers on strike shut down public libraries Wednesday afternoon and descended on the Solano County administration building in Fairfield, demanding a new labor contract.\nSheriff\u2019s deputies estimated the crowd at 700 to 1,000 people, but not all were county workers.\nSome of those protesting were social workers who tend to the elderly and disabled and check on at-risk children.\n\u201cThe county has offered a 3-percent wage increase immediately and a 3-percent wage increase in October of next year,\u201d he explained.\nThe workers, represented by Service Employees International Union, said they have been in negotiations with the county since July."}
