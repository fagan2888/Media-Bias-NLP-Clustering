It repeals Obamacare. It does everything we need to do on the entitlement side to move people from welfare from work and to pay off this debt.\n\n\u201cSo we think this is a very good budget.\u201d\n\nTruth be told, the proposed budget continues the age-old fiscal gamesmanship that observers have come to expect from both parties. It assumes revenues and savings that are unlikely to ever materialize, while laying out greater expenditures in the future.\n\nDespite leadership claims to the contrary, there is a widely held belief among many federal budget watchers that Price had to resort to budgetary smoke and mirrors to create a pathway to a balanced budget without raising taxes.\n\nHere are three of the gimmicks the House GOP is relying on:\n\n1. The promise of savings.\n\nThe trillion-dollar roadmap sticks to the two-year budget deal struck last year by congressional leaders, with a level of spending that is unacceptable to fiscal hawks, including the roughly 40 members of the House Freedom Caucus, who want spending cut by at least $30 billion.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP\u2019s Budget Plans Are Going Off the Rails\n\nA previous proposal by Price was to accompany the budget with a \u201csidecar\u201d of real spending cuts, but the lawmakers ditched that. Instead, they approved a Republican amendment that encourages House leadership to find $30 billion in cuts in future fiscal bills and urges them to attach a separate deficit reduction measure to other must-pass legislation if the Senate doesn\u2019t take up the savings package.\n\nThe Senate isn't expected to act on either the budget or the accompanying package of cuts.\n\n2. Gaming the war fund.\n\nPresident Obama asked for $74 billion for the Defense Department\u2019s Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account, also known as the war fund. The House GOP budget matches that figure, but assumes that $23 billion will go toward the Pentagon\u2019s basic budget needs.\n\n\u201cBy increasing the amount of normal defense funding provided through the OCO designation while keeping the same total amount for OCO, the budget is effectively underfunding true OCO needs requested by the Defense Department by $18 billion,\u201d says an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nThe sleight of hand has enraged defense hawks, who argue it shortchanges the military, as well as fiscal hawks, who believe that the difference will likely be made up through a supplemental spending request.\n\n3. That it can pass.\n\nMore so than last year, when an intraparty brawl between defense and fiscal hawks over OCO funding nearly derailed the budget process, the fate of the fiscal 2017 resolution is grim, with the very real chance it won\u2019t even receive a vote on the floor of the House.\n\nRelated: Paul Ryan\u2019s Three Perilous Paths to a Budget Deal\n\nConsider the budget panel vote. Two Republicans, both members of the Freedom Caucus, joined Democrats in voting against the resolution, and a handful of others who supported it in committee said they would oppose it on the floor.\n\nRyan can\u2019t lose more than 28 votes to pass the budget, which is usually a party-line vote. Making it harder to round up the votes is the looming Easter recess, with lawmakers not set to return to Washington until April 12.\n\nRyan is being tight-lipped about the path forward.\n\n\u201cWe don't have an answer to that question yet. We're going to be discussing this with our conference on how best to proceed,\u201d he said, adding that he envisions \u201ca lot of budgets coming to the floor\u201d from groups like the congressional Black and Progressive caucuses, the conservative House Republican Study Committee and others.\n\nAsked if he agreed with recent efforts to revive \u201cNo Budget, No Pay\u201d legislation for congressional lawmakers \u2013 something GOP leaders used as a bludgeon against Democrats for failing to move a budget resolution when they controlled the Senate -- Ryan, a former budget chair who has not twisted arms to get a blueprint done, replied: \u201cI think we should pass a budget, plain and simple. I'll just leave it at that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "To hear House Republican leaders tell it, the GOP budget for fiscal 2017 contains cure", "title": "Why There\u2019s Trouble Ahead for Paul Ryan\u2019s Trillion-Dollar Budget", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/17/Why-There-s-Trouble-Ahead-Paul-Ryan-s-Trillion-Dollar-Budget", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/paul_ryan_gavel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/17/Why-There-s-Trouble-Ahead-Paul-Ryan-s-Trillion-Dollar-Budget", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/paul_ryan_gavel.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "To hear House Republican leaders tell it, the GOP budget for fiscal 2017 contains cure", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The House GOP budget matches that figure, but assumes that $23 billion will go toward the Pentagon\u2019s basic budget needs.\nRelated: Paul Ryan\u2019s Three Perilous Paths to a Budget DealConsider the budget panel vote.\nHere are three of the gimmicks the House GOP is relying on:1.\nPresident Obama asked for $74 billion for the Defense Department\u2019s Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account, also known as the war fund.\nThe sleight of hand has enraged defense hawks, who argue it shortchanges the military, as well as fiscal hawks, who believe that the difference will likely be made up through a supplemental spending request."}
