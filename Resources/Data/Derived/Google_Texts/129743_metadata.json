Last month a defense industry source told TASS, Russia\u2019s state-owned news agency, that the decades-old battlecruiser will get a major refurbishment.\n\n\u201cThe Pyotr Veliky will start repairs in the third or fourth quarter of 2019. Repairs and upgrade are due for completion in late 2022, the ship to be equipped with Zircon hypersonic anti-ship missiles,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe missile is undergoing development testing and will enter service if it passes.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear if the Zircon, which said to have a range of 250 miles and can reach speeds over Mach 5, even exists.\n\nOther weapons that could be put on the vessel include the family of Kalibr cruise missiles, the type that Russian ships launched from the Caspian Sea against targets inside Syria; as many as 80 anti-ship missiles; and a sea-based version of the S-400 missile defense system, according to FoxtrotAlpha.\n\nThe Pyotr Velikiy isn\u2019t the only cruiser getting a refit; its sister ship, the Admiral Nakhimov, is currently getting an overhaul for the relatively small cost of $33.5 million, according to Navyrecognition.com. The Admiral Nakhimov should be ready to go by 2019, in time for the Pyotr Velikiy\u2019s overhaul.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Unveils the Helicopter-Plane of the Future\n\nThe upgrades promise to transform the monstrous ships into floating missile wagons, the most powerful and heavily armed on the high seas. The improvements are in line with Russian military thinking on naval warfare that the best way to take out a threat is to simply overwhelm it.\n\nThe refurbishments are the latest in what is now a years-long series of moves by Russian President Vladimir Putin to modernize the country\u2019s military, and while there\u2019s some question about the utility of these ships, they could serve an important propaganda purpose: There is no country in Russia\u2019s sphere of influence that would want to see them parked off their coast.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Russia is investing tens of millions of dollars to refurbish a pair of hulking Cold Wa", "title": "Putin Is Upgrading Russia\u2019s Massive Cold War Battlecruisers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/10/Putin-Upgrading-Russia-s-Massive-Cold-War-Battlecruisers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Kirov-class_battlecruiser.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/10/Putin-Upgrading-Russia-s-Massive-Cold-War-Battlecruisers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Kirov-class_battlecruiser.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Russia is investing tens of millions of dollars to refurbish a pair of hulking Cold Wa", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The nuclear-powered Kirov-class battlecruisers were developed in the late 1970s and still rank among the world\u2019s largest surface combat ships.\nRussia is investing tens of millions of dollars to refurbish a pair of hulking Cold War-era ships, outfitting them with Moscow\u2019s latest anti-air and ship defense systems and next-generation missiles.\nLast month a defense industry source told TASS, Russia\u2019s state-owned news agency, that the decades-old battlecruiser will get a major refurbishment.\nRepairs and upgrade are due for completion in late 2022, the ship to be equipped with Zircon hypersonic anti-ship missiles,\u201d the source said.\nThe Admiral Nakhimov should be ready to go by 2019, in time for the Pyotr Velikiy\u2019s overhaul."}
