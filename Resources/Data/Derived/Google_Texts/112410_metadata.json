Dick Durbin\u2019s more than three decades in Washington have helped him become one of the most powerful Democrats on Capitol Hill - a position he says has helped him reap billions of dollars of federal funds and other valuable benefits for Illinois.\n\nHis Republican challenger, state Sen. Jim Oberweis, a dairy owner and investment manager, says Durbin\u2019s lengthy tenure also makes him a \u201ccareer politician\u201d who\u2019s out-of-touch with voters and clueless about how to create jobs in the private sector.\n\nAs the two face off in the Nov. 4 midterm election, Oberweis acknowledges it will take a significant Republican tide for him to unseat the Senate\u2019s second-ranking Democrat. But he says he has the background to help create much-needed jobs in Illinois.\n\n\u201cWe need to move in a different direction,\u201d Oberweis told The Associated Press.\n\nDurbin, who\u2019s seeking his fourth U.S. Senate term, said he wants to continue working to \u201clift up\u201d the middle class. \u201cThere is more to be done,\u201d he said.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the two candidates, based on recent interviews with the AP, a candidate questionnaire and statements on the campaign trail:\n\n_____\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, 69, of Springfield\n\nBackground: Served in U.S. House 1983 to 1997, when he started his first U.S. Senate term.\n\nFavorite book: \u201cThe Last Lion\u201d by William Manchester and \u201cA Short History of Nearly Everything\u201d by Bill Bryson.\n\nFavorite dessert: A tie between apple pie and hot fudge sundae with pecans.\n\nMost admired Illinois governor: \u201cIn history, John Peter Altgeld and Henry Horner. In my lifetime, Richard Ogilvie.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nRepublican state Sen. Jim Oberweis, 68, of Sugar Grove\n\nBackground: Chairman of Oberweis Dairy, founder of Oberweis Asset Management. Elected to the Illinois Senate in 2012.\n\nFavorite book: \u201cIllinois Pension Scam.\u201d\n\nFavorite dessert: \u201cOberweis ice cream, of course.\u201d\n\nMost admired Illinois governor: Jim Thompson and Jim Edgar.\n\n_____\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT:\n\nDurbin points to a digital manufacturing hub in Chicago, funded in part by a $75 million federal grant he helped secure, as an example of how federal grants can help spur new industry and create good jobs. He also says Illinois should build workforce training partnerships, focused on community colleges and supported by federal funds, to align the needs of businesses with workers who want to be trained for new careers.\n\nOberweis says more jobs will be created if the federal government stops \u201cover spending, over taxing, over regulating and demonizing job creators.\u201d\n\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS:\n\nDurbin agrees with President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to pull ground troops out of Iraq and not send them back to combat the Islamic State group. He told the Chicago Tribune editorial board during a televised debate that the U.S. learned from the war in Afghanistan that ground troops are \u201ceasily bogged down.\u201d He believes the Iraqis must be willing to fight for themselves.\n\nOberweis said it was a bad idea to withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq, and that leaving 5,000 to 10,000 troops there would have been reasonable. Oberweis also said Obama shouldn\u2019t have told the U.S.\u2019s enemies he didn\u2019t plan to send new combat troops to Iraq. He said U.S. leaders should pay attention to what the military generals want, and some have said ground troops may be needed.\n\nAFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\nDurbin supports Obama\u2019s health care overhaul, though he believes it\u2019s imperfect and Congress should make changes as needed over time.\n\nOberweis called it a \u201cpartisan train wreck\u201d and said he would push to repeal the law in his first 100 days in office. He says he would replace it with health care reform that\u2019s less intrusive and bureaucratic.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nDurbin helped draft an immigration overhaul that, among other things, would give some 11 million people who entered the U.S. illegally a path to citizenship. He has misgivings about provisions to put more guards and other security on the border, which he says goes \u201cbeyond what I would consider reasonable.\u201d\n\nOberweis has softened his stance on immigrants who entered the country illegally as young children, now saying they should be allowed to stay in the U.S. He doesn\u2019t support all parts of the federal immigration bill approved by the Senate because it sends a message that breaking the law is OK. He\u2019d first like to see more border security.\n\nGUNS\n\nDurbin supports expanded background checks for gun purchases, which he says will help keep weapons out of the hands of felons and people with mental health issues.\n\nOberweis says he\u2019s not convinced background checks would be effective, and he has concerns about the government maintaining a database of gun owners.\n\nMINIMUM WAGE\n\nDurbin wants to increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25 per hour.\n\nOberweis says he supports raising the wage to an as-yet-undetermined amount, but only for workers age 26 and older.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Sen.
