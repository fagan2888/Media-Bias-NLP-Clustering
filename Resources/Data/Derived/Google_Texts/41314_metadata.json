The clinic is now open for business, but only on a limited basis. ( Nic McVicker/KPBS )\n\nThe vast majority of Californians support unrestricted access to abortion and comprehensive sex education in schools.\n\nBut not in Imperial County, where religious groups have tried to prevent the region\u2019s first Planned Parenthood clinic from opening.\n\nDespite considerable opposition, the clinic is now providing care, but only on a limited basis.\n\nNew Clinic Opens\n\nThe new Planned Parenthood clinic sits right next to a Thai restaurant in El Centro, a city of 43,000 people 100 miles east of San Diego, near the Mexico border. Its waiting room is decorated in pastel colors, and all of the signs are in English and Spanish.\n\nThe clinic has six exam rooms and offers testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nMaykent Salazar, who works as a promotora, or health educator, for Planned Parenthood, goes door-to-door in Imperial County telling people about the services that are available.\n\nSalazar said family planning isn\u2019t usually discussed around here.\n\n\u201c \u2018Cause there\u2019s no access,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, we have no clinics where people can talk about what they feel or what they think. It\u2019s just taboo. It\u2019s there, but no one talks about it.\u201d\n\nSalazar said people in Imperial County should have the same access to care as any other Californian.\n\n\u201cI think we in the Valley all deserve the right to choose what we want to do with our bodies and with our lives \u2014 that involves choosing what contraceptives we want to use, choosing if we want to have a baby or if we don\u2019t want to have a baby, and when do we want to have him,\u201d she said.\n\nBlock That Clinic\n\nBut Planned Parenthood opponents have a totally different view.\n\nAt a meeting earlier this month of the El Centro City Council, opponents gathered outside and made their voices heard loud and clear.\n\nReligious groups held what they called a \u201cbaby shower for life.\u201d They collected donations of diapers, baby clothes, and set up anti-abortion displays.\n\nLisa Owens, who works with a Christian ministry called Woven, says she knows that some people believe in a woman\u2019s right to choose to have an abortion.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not what the Bible says,\u201d Owens said. \u201cThe Bible says that God gives life and he takes life. And he\u2019s the only one that can, and should.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen to that,\u201d said Chris Nunn. He\u2019s a minister at El Centro\u2019s Christ Community Church.\n\nNunn has urged local lawmakers to keep Planned Parenthood out of the area.\n\nHe said there\u2019s nothing wrong with a new clinic coming to town.\n\n\u201cBut Planned Parenthood kind of disguises itself as a clinic, and tries to come in under the guise of a clinic, in order to perform abortions, and prey on our young women,\u201d Nunn said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really what we have a problem with.\u201d\n\nOpponents like Nunn want the El Centro City Council to nullify a recently approved transfer agreement between the clinic and El Centro Regional Medical Center. Such agreements are standard between clinics and hospitals. They allow clinic patients and their records to be transferred should they suddenly need a higher level of care.\n\nNunn said the agreement is discretionary.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re saying \u2014 is that here in the community, that is 70 percent pro-life, is it prudent for our city-owned hospital to agree to a transfer agreement, that their constituents, by and large, would not agree with?\u201d Nunn said.\n\nCity Says It\u2019s Doing the Right Thing\n\nOpponents may not agree with it, but El Centro has no legal right to deny the transfer agreement. That\u2019s the opinion of an independent legal review the city recently obtained.\n\nEl Centro city manager Ruben Duran said he\u2019s familiar with opponents\u2019 views. After all, in such a small town, he knows most Planned Parenthood critics personally.\n\nNonetheless, Duran said he and other city officials are doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cActually, this goes back to the Reproductive Protection Act,\u201d Duran said. \u201cIt says that abortions are allowed in this state, and they are a protected right in this state. We\u2019re following the law.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood Sues City\n\nBut not exactly, argues Planned Parenthood.\n\nFor now, the clinic can offer all of its services in El Centro except abortions, and the clinic is only allowed to operate 20 hours a week.\n\nThat\u2019s because while the city has issued an occupancy permit, the city\u2019s fire chief has refused to sign off on the clinic\u2019s final fire safety clearance. The chief said it should be reclassified as an outpatient surgery center, which would require a pricey fire suppression system.\n\nThe city says it\u2019s seeking guidance from the state on this issue.\n\nBut Planned Parenthood said it\u2019s fed up and is suing the chief and the city. It\u2019s asking a judge to compel the chief to issue the final permit.\n\nTeen Pregnancy Problem\n\nIn the meantime, 21-year-old Ariana Gonzalez believes Imperial Valley really needs Planned Parenthood.\n\nShe grew up in El Centro. Gonzalez is expecting her second child; she had her first when she was 16 and still in high school.\n\nGonzalez said it\u2019s about time someone taught local teens the facts of life.\n\n\u201cI think education is the key factor in changing behaviors,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know, then what\u2019s to prevent you from going out and having unprotected sex?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a big problem in Imperial County, where the teen pregnancy rate is 70 percent higher than the statewide average.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite opposition from religious groups, the clinic is now providing care, but only on a limited basis.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Imperial County Divided Over Region's First Planned Parenthood Clinic\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/05\\/26\\/imperial-county-divided-over-regions-first-planned-parenthood-clinic\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-26 14:40:58\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-05-26 14:52:24\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":30425,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Abortion\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/05\\/Screen-Shot-2015-05-26-at-2.34.11-PM.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Despite opposition from religious groups, the clinic is now providing care, but only on a limited basis.", "title": "Imperial County Divided Over Region\u2019s First Planned Parenthood Clinic", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/05/26/imperial-county-divided-over-regions-first-planned-parenthood-clinic/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-26-at-2.34.11-PM-1440x710.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "abortion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb17d\"", "article_summary": "But not in Imperial County, where religious groups have tried to prevent the region\u2019s first Planned Parenthood clinic from opening.\nThe Imperial Valley's first Planned Parenthood clinic is shown on May 5, 2015.\nMaykent Salazar, who works as a promotora, or health educator, for Planned Parenthood, goes door-to-door in Imperial County telling people about the services that are available.\nWe\u2019re following the law.\u201dPlanned Parenthood Sues CityBut not exactly, argues Planned Parenthood.\nIt\u2019s there, but no one talks about it.\u201dSalazar said people in Imperial County should have the same access to care as any other Californian."}
