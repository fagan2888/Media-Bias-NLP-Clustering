Allergan Inc. has tentatively set a date for a special meeting of shareholders to decide whether the company’s board should be fired and control awarded to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.

Allergan /quotes/zigman/217110/delayed /quotes/zigman/217110/lastsale AGN could not be reached for comment, nor could officials from Valeant /quotes/zigman/122461/delayed /quotes/zigman/122461/lastsale VRX . But the date falls within the 120-day period by which Botox-maker Allergan had to call the meeting after receiving requests from those holding 31% of the company’s shares. Valeant needed 25% of shares to call for the meeting.

Valeant and William Ackman’s Pershing Square Management, an activist investor in Allergan, are pushing for a $53 billion merger. The shareholder vote would pave the way for such a merger.

Allergan plans to hold a board meeting on Sept. 4 to decide whether the meeting request is valid and follows company bylaws. Further, Allergan holds out hope that a federal judge might put an injunction on the meeting until it is determined whether Valeant and Ackman violated securities laws by collaborating to buy shares in preparation for Valeant’s bid. Ackman now holds 9.7% of Allergan.

Allergan was up marginally at the close to $163.97, while Valeant climbed 1.4% to $117.10.
