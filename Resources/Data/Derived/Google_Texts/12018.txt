Patients at the Partnership Community Health Center in Appleton can now look forward to a new and improved facility.

The Affordable Care Act's Community Health Center Fund is giving the center a $1 million award.

Center officials say the money will be used to create a new design within the center.

They also say new equipment will be purchased, including X-ray machines, which the center currently does not own.

"Now, we have an opportunity to really design a facility that's gonna really compliment our new model of care," said board chair of Partnership Community Health Center, Jeff Hacker. "We're very compassionate about our patients, to meet their needs, because they deserve the kind of care everyone should be able to get. "

The health center serves low income patients, who don't usually have access to the care they need.
