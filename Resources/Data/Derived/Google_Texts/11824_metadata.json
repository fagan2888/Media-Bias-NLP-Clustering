Watson Coleman explained she is \u201cfighting for every woman\u2019s right to make her own healthcare decisions without the interference of politicians or anyone else.\u201d\n\nMUST READ: Here Are 4 Things You Should Know To Prevent Heart Disease\n\n\u201cUnfortunately there are many in Congress who have taken a different path, committing themselves to an endless assault on access to affordable healthcare and limiting the options available for women as they consider growing their families,\u201dsaid Watson Coleman.\n\n\u201cThese attacks hurt every American family,\u201d Rep. Watson Colman said. \u201cBut their impact in Black communities is even more dangerous, making it that much harder to get the care we desperately need.\u201d\n\nCongresswoman Watson Coleman explained, \u201cAfrican-American women face many disparities, from how far we have to travel from home to get to a doctor, to the far greater numbers of us who face chronic illnesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack women face higher mortality rates, from breast and ovarian cancers. We are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS, with some of the fastest rates of new infections each year,\u201d said Watson Coleman.\n\nShe added, \u201cBlack children face more than double the infant mortality rates than White children and we still face outsized rates of unintended and teen pregnancies.\u201d\n\nMUST READ: WHO Says Zika Is \u2018Spreading Explosively\u2019: Here\u2019s 6 Things You Need To Know About The Virus\n\nTo combat the disparities faced by African-American women, Rep. Watson Coleman said, \u201cThose disparities require more resources, attention and care.\u201d\n\nShe rebuked the \u201ccuts, lies and demagoguery\u201d on display on Capitol Hill saying, \u201cWhen the majority in the House voted to defund Planned Parenthood, a vital healthcare provider for many women, they threatened the affordable care that our communities rely on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the same majority sought to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a law that has expanded access to care for nearly 6.8 million African-Americans, they put our families at risk,\u201d Watson Coleman said.\n\nShe explained that she can identify the \u201cattacks on women\u2019s rights\u201d and said, \u201cNow is not the time to play politics with the health of African-American women and their families.\u201d\n\nWatson Coleman concluded her remarks: \u201cThere are so many issues for Congress to get to work on. Issues like restoring the Voting Rights Act or making much-needed changes to our criminal justice system and the ways in which those who have served their time return to society, [but] limiting women\u2019s access to healthcare shouldn\u2019t be on that agenda.\u201d\n\nWatch Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman\u2019s address in the video clip above.\n\nFor more information about the Congressional Black Caucus, visit cbc-butterfield.house.gov.\n\n[SOURCE: NewsOne]\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nCBC Message To America: Rep.
