But in a city where nearly a third of the population lives below the poverty line, Dr. Villarreal does not accept health insurance. Instead, he has switched to a cash-based model, eschewing the laborious practice of filing out insurance forms in order to get paid.\n\nDoctors who use the model, which they call \u201cdirect primary care,\u201d say they can keep their costs down by avoiding the bureaucracy of the health insurance system and the high processing costs \u2014 including additional staff \u2014 associated with accepting coverage.\n\n\u201cIt had always been affordable and possible to maintain a practice with what insurance and patients paid, but about 10 or 15 years ago, you started seeing a decline\u201d in revenue, said Dr. Villarreal, who switched his traditional family practice to its current business model in 2012.\n\nMost direct primary care doctors limit their services to basic or preventive care \u2014 treatment their patients can afford without turning to their insurance providers \u2014 like prescribing medicine for colds and infections, treating minor lesions and overseeing long-term care for conditions like diabetes and osteoporosis.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen patients need additional treatment for serious ailments or tests and procedures that cannot be done in-house \u2014 like M.R.I.\u2019s and X-rays \u2014 physicians working under this model refer patients to specialists and technicians who accept insurance.\n\nWhile many of his patients are uninsured, Dr. Villarreal, who has been practicing medicine for more than three decades, said he regularly treats patients who have health insurance but are trying to avoid the need of meeting high deductibles.\n\nSome health care specialists worry that if too many practitioners choose this path, the state could be left struggling to find doctors to accommodate patients with insurance as the federal health care overhaul is making such coverage mandatory for most Texans. So far, efforts to enroll Texans in the federal insurance marketplace \u2014 crucial to the success of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 have made a small dent in the state\u2019s uninsured population, which has reached 6 million, according to United States Census Bureau data. The federal Department of Health and Human Services reported that 295,000 Texans had signed up for insurance coverage in the federal marketplace as of March 1.\n\n\u201cWe have to find ways of stretching the current number of primary care doctors to meet that demand,\u201d said Dr. Clare Hawkins, president of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians. \u201cDirect primary care goes in the other direction.\u201d\n\nInsurers say consumers should have flexibility when it comes to their health services, but they warn that not having health insurance leaves individuals unprotected from the hefty price tags associated with unanticipated medical costs.\n\n\u201cConsumers should anticipate their medical needs,\u201d said David Gonzales, the executive director of the Texas Association of Health Plans. \u201cHowever, when that is not possible, consumers should have financial protection from the unexpected.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe direct primary care model is not new. Before Congress passed legislation in 1973 that led to the expansion of managed care through prepaid health plans, or health maintenance organizations, physicians largely operated through this fee-for-service medical model. And the percentage of doctors who have reverted to this approach in Texas in recent years is not huge: 10 percent of state physicians do not currently have contracts with health insurers, according to preliminary results from a 2014 Texas Medical Association survey. (The T.M.A. and the Texas Association of Health Plans are corporate sponsors of The Texas Tribune.)\n\nLee Spangler, vice president of medical economics with the medical association, said Texas was seeing an increase in practices like these because they gave doctors more flexibility to determine the services they provide and to cut costs for their practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cA physician has very little ability to negotiate all policies and procedures that come with insurance contracts,\u201d Mr. Spangler said, adding that some insurance companies can even dictate the business hours during which doctors can be paid. \u201cBasically you get rid of all those shackles in terms of having a carrier dictate to the practice how to deliver medical services.\u201d\n\nIt is the direct primary care business model that proves most attractive, Mr. Spangler said, adding that doctors \u201cwant to get out from under what has been stacked up on them.\u201d\n\nUnder the current health insurance system, physicians who treat covered individuals submit claims for the services they provide and receive reimbursements to cover their costs. Private insurance providers and government-subsidized health programs like Medicare and Medicaid each have their own rules and regulations for filing claims, including specific time frames and billing systems.\n\nHealth providers who treat poor children and people with disabilities also face heightened scrutiny from state and federal agencies responsible for rooting out possible fraud, leaving some providers on edge that they could be subject to unwarranted or costly investigations.\n\nDoctors who have embraced the model have done so with a range of approaches. And most boast that the costs they have cut by forgoing insurance give them the ability to scale back on the number of patients they must see each day to turn a profit.\n\nIn Austin, Drs. William and Mason Jones \u2014 a father-son team \u2014 practice \u201cconcierge medicine,\u201d treating patients under a membership model in which patients pay annual fees for access to a variety of services, including unlimited office visits, routine vaccinations and round-the-clock medical assistance by phone.\n\nMason Jones said his office was a \u201clow-volume practice\u201d that gives him the \u201cluxury of time\u201d to spend with patients. \u201cThis works out great for preventive medicine,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Corpus Christi, Dr. Coleen Madigan works two days a week, during which she visits with about five patients a day and is able to make house calls. She said this gives her the opportunity to spend as much time with her patients as they require.\n\nIn Laredo, Dr. Villarreal has had a different experience. His business model frees up time for him to see more patients, he said, without the added costs that come from filing insurance claims. He still sees 40 to 60 patients a day, he said, 20 of whom tend to be new to his practice.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cTo me, there\u2019s no other way I would practice medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re a doctor again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140410192403, "twitter": {"description": "As Texas works to increase
