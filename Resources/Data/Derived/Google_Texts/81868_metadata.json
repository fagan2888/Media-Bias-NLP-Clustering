The complaint alleges:\n\n\u201c[Kawa Orthodontics] expended substantial time and resources, including money spent on legal fees and other costs, in preparation for the \u2018employer mandate\u2019 taking effect on January 1, 2014\u2026.[The company] would not have expended its time and resources and incurred these anticipatory costs in 2013 if the mandate had not been scheduled to take effect until 2015, but instead would have spent its time, resources, and money on other priorities.\u201d\n\nKawa Orthodontics has over 70 full-time employees, making it subject to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate.\n\n\u201cIf the law is to fail, let it fail now, not when it\u2019s politically convenient for the president,\u201d said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, according to the Washington Free Beacon.\n\n\u201cThe president wants to avoid the consequences of the law, and there are ways to do that legally, and that\u2019s through having Congress repeal it or modify it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s chosen not to do that and act as a one-man Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has no more power to do that than you or I,\u201d Kawa said. \u201cIn fact, he has an affirmative duty to enforce the law, and we are here to make sure that he does that.\u201d\n\nFitton added:\n\n\u201cWe obviously object to the employer mandate and the entire Obamacare law, but we understand that, under the U.S. Constitution, the law can only be changed by legislation passed by Congress and signed by the president. President Obama would delay the damage of his health care scheme until after the 2014 congressional elections. But politics do not trump the Constitution or the rule of law. And to paraphrase Ulysses S. Grant, the best way to ensure the repeal of a bad law is to enforce it vigorously.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit names as defendants the U.S. Department of Treasury, Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew, the Internal Revenue Service and IRS Acting Director Daniel Werfel.\n\n\u201dI am tired of Washington, DC, picking winners and losers and giving preferential treatment to those inside the Beltway,\u201d said Kawa. \u201cThis is just more of DC career politicians protecting their own.\u201d\n\n[poll id=\u201d105\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit Tuesday on behalf of Dr. Larry Kawa and Kawa Orthodontics of Boca Raton, Fla., challenging the Obama administration\u2019s one-year delay in enforcing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate.
