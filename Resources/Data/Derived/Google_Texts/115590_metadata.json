Brian Sandoval, the Nevada Republican Party re-elected chairman Michael McDonald at a party meeting Saturday, snubbing Sandoval's choice.\n\nSandoval, Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., and a clutch of Republican legislators had supported Robert Uithoven, a lobbyist for the Las Vegas Sands Corp., in an unsuccessful bid to unseat McDonald.\n\nThe election displayed yet another rift among Republicans as the state\u2019s top elected Republicans failed to wrangle the party under their control and grassroots party members appeared to reject a top-down approach to party leadership.\n\n\u201cThe work I do is to empower the people in the party,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving in the right direction. The grassroots is growing stronger. People are taking ownership back in the party \u2026 so if you truly want to get Republicans elected, clearly here\u2019s an avenue to get on board.\u201d\n\nThe grassroots base of Republicans who supported McDonald ultimately carried him to victory with 63 percent of the vote among about 300 Nevada Republican Party central committee members.\n\nSandoval\u2019s campaign team had tried to whip votes in favor of Uithoven, but McDonald supporters at the Republican meeting at the South Point appeared unconvinced that Uithoven could bring more money into the state party while also maintaining relations with party regulars.\n\n\u201cThe grassroots folks never believe they\u2019re appreciated by the donors,\u201d said Grant Hewitt, Republican political consultant with Red Point Strategies. \u201cIf you come here with the message of money, it doesn\u2019t resonate.\u201d\n\nBoth sides offered different paths to help register Republican voters, support Republican candidates and ultimately win at the ballot box in an increasingly Democratic-leaning battleground state.\n\nWith the backing of the governor, Uithoven had wanted to project confidence to a donor community wary of donating to the Nevada Republican Party.\n\nMcDonald said he has worked hard during his chairmanship to unite factions in the party and bolster grassroots involvement in the party.\n\n\u201cIf you want a voice in this party, I\u2019m your man,\u201d McDonald told Republicans in a speech before the voting began. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a top-down structure. That philosophy is, if you part your hair the wrong way, I\u2019ll stop funding you.\u201d\n\nDonor support was an issue that Uithoven brought to the forefront in his brief, week-long campaign to unseat McDonald.\n\nThe company he represents, the Las Vegas Sands, recently yanked its support from the party.\n\nThe Las Vegas Sands claimed it\u2019s responsible for donating the lion\u2019s share of the money the Nevada Republican Party has recently raised and said in a tweet that \u201csupport is over until the party is effective.\u201d\n\nMajor Republican donor and Las Vegas Sands owner Sheldon Adelson won\u2019t support a party that isn\u2019t \u201cfunctional\u201d and making strides in registering voters, welcoming elected officials and focusing on winning elections, said Andy Abboud, vice president of government relations at the Las Vegas Sands, at the meeting Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t see that happening,\u201d he said.\n\nUithoven said he was confident he could bring back donors like the Sands.\n\n\u201cWe have to get the grassroots funded,\u201d Uithoven told Republicans in a brief campaign speech Saturday morning in which he also touted the support of elected Republicans. \u201cI\u2019m honored to have the endorsement of Gov. Sandoval.\u201d\n\nBut Uithoven\u2019s support from Sandoval and Adelson may not have played well with party members.\n\nSome McDonald supporters arrived to the Nevada Republican Party meeting Saturday morning wearing T-shirts that said \u201cfighting for the soul of the party\u201d and featured a devil stirring a pot of money emblazoned with the words \u201cgreed\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d next to an elephant with boxing shorts displaying McDonald\u2019s name.\n\nThe T-shirt also displayed the words \u201cconsultants vs. the people\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were frustrated with the message that was coming out that it\u2019s all about the money,\u201d said Carl Bunce, a Republican who helped make and distribute the shirts. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of us in the grassroots who don\u2019t care. We care about the principles of the party.\u201d\n\nHe said elected officials like Sandoval, Heller and Rep. Joe Heck, R-Nev., employ consultants like November, Inc.\u2019s Mike Slanker and Red Rock Strategies\u2019 Ryan Erwin who care more about corporate sponsors than Republican principles.\n\nHe characterized the election as a fight over \u201cwhether we have meaning or not\u201d as a party with principles.\n\nOthers echoed similar concerns.\n\n\u201cI had a concern with a consultant for a major casino company running the state party,\u201d said James Smack, national committeeman for the Nevada Republican Party.\n\nStill, he said he hopes Sandoval and Heller will stay engaged in the party.\n\nAlthough McDonald called the race \u201cugly\u201d and full of \u201cdefamatory\u201d statements, he called for Republican unity in his victory speech.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new day,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans also elected Jim DeGraffenreid as vice chairman, Nan Adams as secretary, and Michael Bertrand as treasurer at the meeting Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a rebuke to Gov.
