Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.\"\n\nBrown's family had asked the Justice Department to oversee a second autopsy in order to ensure objectivity. According to the Associated Press, the family has put funeral arrangements on hold until a second autopsy can be performed.\n\nPreliminary results of the first autopsy showed that Brown had died of gunshot wounds.
