PLF represents Cedar Point Nursery in the Siskiyou County town of Dorris, and Fowler Packing Co. in Fresno.\n\n\n\nAt issue is an ALRB regulation that promotes trespassing by purporting to grant a \u201cright of access by union organizers to the premises of an agricultural employer for the purpose of meeting and talking with employees and soliciting their support . . . .\u201d This trespass regulation \u2014 Cal. Code Regs. tit. 8, \u00a7 20900(e) \u2014 violates owners\u2019 Fifth Amendment right against government-imposed takings, a right that includes the freedom to exclude trespassers; and their Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable, government-sanctioned intrusions, searches and seizures.\n\n\n\nDecades old, the trespass regulation survived a challenge at the state Supreme Court in 1976, but has never been challenged in federal court as a violation of fundamental property rights protected by the U.S. Constitution. Cedar Point Nursery and Fowler Packing have turned to the federal courts for help because they have had their operations disrupted in recent months by activists from the United Farm Workers (UFW) who trespassed, or attempted to trespass, citing ALRB\u2019s unconstitutional trespass regulation as their \u201cjustification.\u201d\n\nA lawsuit that defends everyone\u2019s property rights\n\n\u201cThis case is about basic protections for everyone who owns property,\u201d said PLF Principal Attorney Joshua P. Thompson. \u201cNothing is more fundamental for any property owner than being able to keep trespassers out. Bureaucrats can\u2019t cancel that right \u2014 especially not as a favor to organized labor.\n\n\n\n\u201cGovernment may not give out permission slips to unions, to trespass on private property,\u201d added Thompson. \u201cWhen government arm-twists an owner into allowing people onto his property against his will, that land, or at least an easement across it, is being commandeered for a government agenda. And government seizure of private property, without compensation, is strictly forbidden by the Fifth Amendment and its ban on takings.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of sites in local communities where unions could make their case to agricultural employees,\u201d Thompson continued. \u201cBut the union activists often seem more interested in forcing themselves onto private property and fomenting conflict. Bureaucrats have no business promoting this disruption by stripping property owners of their fundamental rights.\u201d\n\n\n\nPLF is asking the federal courts to affirm that ALRB\u2019s trespass regulation violates the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs, and enjoin ALRB from enforcing it against them.\n\nCedar Point Nursery: \u201cAmbushed\u201d by union trespassers\n\nLocated in Dorris, family-owned Cedar Point Nursery raises strawberry plants for producers both statewide and nationally. It employs more than 400 seasonal and about 100 year-round workers.\n\n\n\nCedar Point\u2019s employees have never considered forming a union. Consequently when the UFW staged its early morning strike it took everyone by surprise. The disruptive scene was staged on Cedar Point\u2019s property during its six-week strawberry plant harvest last year. Local news outlets reported that the union claimed to be protesting working conditions at the nursery, but management \u2014 and employees \u2014 rejected those allegations. As the Klamath Falls Herald & News reported, one employee \u2014 Jesus Mendoza \u2014 said \u201cthe demonstration was \u2018just a big joke\u2019 and said, after working 15 seasons at the nursery, he sees his co-workers as committed rather than exploited by their employers. \u2018We haven\u2019t had any problems out here,\u2019 he said. \u2018We\u2019re just focused on trying to do our jobs.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe take pride in offering a clean, safe work environment, and clean, safe housing, at a pay grade that meets or exceeds the market,\u201d said Mike Fahner, Cedar Point\u2019s owner and CEO. \u201cOur mindset has always been to treat all our employees with respect, and we get the same respect in return. We promote from within and reward dedication and hard work. As a consequence, employees stick with us. The tenure on our core group of 50 to 60 people is no less than 10 years.\n\n\u201cWhen the UFW came on our property without warning or permission, you might as well call what happened an ambush,\u201d said Fahner, a second generation Northern California farmer who founded Cedar Point 15 years ago. \u201cThis is the first time we experienced anything like this and it makes me feel very vulnerable as a business person. When people with their own agenda can brazenly enter your facilities and cause chaos and work stoppage, it ought to be illegal, it\u2019s certainly unconstitutional. If this were to happen in any other industry, or in any other state, the trespassers would be arrested. But in California, agricultural property owners are being denied their constitutional rights to be protected from these kinds of invasions.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t deny our employees\u2019 free speech,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnybody who is not satisfied with something that\u2019s going on, we\u2019re here to discuss it. But for union activists to be able to enter a private place of business, and create surprise and disruption, is unconstitutional. The law that targets agricultural businesses for trespassing has to be challenged, so along with PLF we\u2019re taking on that task.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor a company of our size, challenging the government by ourselves would be impossible,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful for PLF\u2019s help, and if what we\u2019re doing \u2014 believing in what is right \u2014 helps others, it\u2019s worth the fight all the more.\u201d\n\n\n\nFowler Packing Co., headquartered in Fresno, is one of the largest shippers in the fresh produce business, handling 15 million boxes of citrus, and five million boxes of table grapes, each year. Because Fowler has acted to defend its property rights by prohibiting union organizers from trespassing on its property, the United Farm Workers filed an unfair labor practices complaint with the ALRB last year. (Although the complaint has since been withdrawn, the mere fact of its filing caused disruption for Fowler\u2019s operations. It also shows the union\u2019s determination to trespass onto Fowler\u2019s property, with the unconstitutional trespass regulation as its \u201cjustification.\u201d)\n\n\n\nFowler employs more than 2,000 people at its facility in Fresno. They do not live on the premises and are fully accessible to the union when they are not at work.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe company takes its social responsibilities seriously,\u201d said Joshua Thompson. \u201cFor instance, a medical clinic serves employees and their families without charge.\u201d Every employee receives a wallet-sized card with a \u201chotline\u201d number and an explanation of its purpose, which is to provide an anonymous means of reporting any sign of abuse, misconduct, harassment, safety concern, or any other matter that may be concerning to employees. This phone line goes directly to the H.R. Director\u2019s office and is checked daily for any missed calls or messages.\n\nFiled in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, this constitutional property rights case is Cedar Point Nursery, et. al. v.
