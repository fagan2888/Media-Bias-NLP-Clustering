(It) is terrifying. It\u2019s literally almost biblical.\u201d\n\nWhile the turnout for the march was not grand, the participants continued to chant, \u201cno to war, yes to peace. U.S. out of the Middle East,\u201d and \u201cHey, (Gov. Greg) Abbott, Let\u2019s be clear, refugees are welcome here.\u201d\n\nCorporate communications senior Jonpaul Clayton watched the demonstration as he passed by.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s hilarious,\u201d Clayton said. \u201cThey got seven people out here, and they\u2019re wanting to turn over the GOP and all the government officials, in the safety of Texans and Americans to promote their left-wing extremist idea.\u201d\n\nClayton said the reason he\u2019s against Syrian refugees coming to Texas is because they will never become Americans.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t actually want to become Americans,\u201d Clayton said. \u201cThey just want to get out of where they are.\u201d\n\nClayton said the best option for anybody is for the Syrian refugees to find a friendly country in the Middle East, or a country that they\u2019re used to or more similar to, such as Turkey or Egypt.\n\n\u201c(It doesn\u2019t) matter if they\u2019re Middle Eastern or Europeans \u2014 find a country that would welcome them, and give them food source to help give them new lives in a country that\u2019s more like what they\u2019re used to,\u201d Clayton said. \u201cWe don\u2019t speak their language; those countries do.\u201d\n\nGarcia said it is terrifying to know that the Syrian refugees are suffering.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re caught in between a war, between powers that are so much more powerful than they are,\u201d Garcia said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t understand what that\u2019s like because we\u2019re in such a safe country, we\u2019re in such a powerful country. The fact that we\u2019re denying them, and there\u2019s this war wage between all these powers, it\u2019s terrifying and it\u2019s also killing them.\u201d\n\nHouston is expecting one of two refugee families to enter the state on Monday. Nine more refugees are scheduled to arrive on Thursday.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle reported that Texas officials will seek a hearing next week on how closely the federal government coordinates with the state on refugee settlement.\n\n\u201cTexas shouldn\u2019t have to go to court to require Washington to comply with federal law regarding its duties to consult with Texas in advance,\u201d State Attorney General Ken Paxton said in the report.\n\n\u201cOur state will continue legal proceedings to ensure we get the information necessary to adequately protect the safety of Texas residents. While we remain concerned about the federal government\u2019s overall refugee vetting process, we must ensure that Texas has the seat at the table that the Refugee Act requires.\u201d\n\n[email protected]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Students held a march in front of the library, protesting the emergency order to block the incoming Syrian refugees as well as chanting an end to U.S. wars.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Cougar", "description": "Students held a march in front of the library, protesting the emergency order to block the incoming Syrian refugees as well as chanting an end to U.S. wars.", "title": "Students protest Syrian refugees block, demand halt to war", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thedailycougar.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/WEB-Brandon-Garicia-refmar330.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-07T11:48:36+00:00", "url": "http://thedailycougar.com/2015/12/05/students-protest-syrian-refugees-block-demand-halt-to-war/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Cougar", "description": "Students held a march in front of the library, protesting the emergency order to block the incoming Syrian refugees as well as chanting an end to U.S. wars.", "title": "Students protest Syrian refugees block, demand halt to war", "image": {"src": "http://thedailycougar.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/WEB-Brandon-Garicia-refmar330.jpg"}, "creator": "@thedailycougar", "site": "@thedailycougar", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 37502686}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thedailycougar", "section": "News", "tag": "syrian refugee crisis", "published_time": "2015-12-05T17:30:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-07T11:48:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Students protest Syrian refugees block, demand halt to warThe Houston Anti-War Committee and the Students for a Democratic Society held a march in front of the library, protesting the emergency order to block the incoming Syrian refugees as well as chanting an end to U.S. wars.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t speak their language; those countries do.\u201dGarcia said it is terrifying to know that the Syrian refugees are suffering.\nGreg) Abbott, Let\u2019s be clear, refugees are welcome here.\u201dCorporate communications senior Jonpaul Clayton watched the demonstration as he passed by.\n\u201cThey\u2019re caught in between a war, between powers that are so much more powerful than they are,\u201d Garcia said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s insane to know that there are so many people just performing such a mass exodus of a country."}
