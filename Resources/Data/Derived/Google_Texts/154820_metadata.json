We\u2019ve already covered the potential bigger-picture implications of Looking, it being one of verrrrry few TV shows about gay lead characters, and we also put out our beginner\u2019s guide to the show. But what of the actual episode. Now that that\u2019s properly aired, we have some things to discuss.\n\nDo you think the show starts out too slow?\n\nJoe: I know when this show was first announced, it seems my entire social circle tensed up and was prepared to reflexively reject this show as being a bad reflection of gay people. Having seen the episode, that's not a concern. What IS my biggest concern after the first episode is that people won\u2019t be all that interested in these three guys. I know we\u2019ve both seen the first four episodes, and I\u2019m definitely hooked on their stories and want to follow them further, but I\u2019m not sure how compelled I would have been if I\u2019d been left hanging after a first episode that was this low-key. I almost wish THIS show had aired two episodes last week instead of Girls, but I know the realities of programming don\u2019t make that possible.\n\nAlex: That\u2019s a question I had, too. But there was a lot of stuff that happened\u2014 a handjob in the park, a gay bachelor party, a threesome, the decision to move in with one's boyfriend in Oakland, a terrible date, and possibly a new romance all in one episode. There was a ton of stuff that happened, even though it didn\u2019t feel like it.\n\nI do think that the show, like you said, is very low-key in the sense that its humor and plot\u2014at least for the first couple of episodes\u2014is more of the awkward and cringe-inducing variety than it is of the laugh-track or scenery-eating variety. And I have RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race (or this season of American Horror Story) for the latter.\n\n(That said, I wasn\u2019t really hooked until halfway through episode three.)\n\nJoe: Actually, I take some of what I said back. I was interested to see if Patrick was going to get any farther with Richie right off the bat. It's SO unfair that I run into mentally deranged preachers on the subway and Patrick gets this incredibly cute hairdresser/bouncer.\n\nSo. We have Patrick, the video-game designer, OkCupid-surfer, thinks-of-his-mom-during-anonymous-handjobs main character played by twink all-star Jonathan Groff. Agustin the disaffected artist who moves in with his boyfriend half-thoughtfully and half because he can save some money by cohabitating in Oakland. And Dom, older and mustachioed and really good at flirting with young co-workers even if he doesn\u2019t end up taking them home. Not to turn this into a competition right off the bat, but how do they rank after one episode?\n\nAlex: Oh, Joe. Are we really going to say who\u2019s on top and who\u2019s on bottom?\n\nJoe: Alex.\n\nAlex: First off, Patrick is a twunk. A twink that\u2019s transitioned into a hunk. If Richard Lawson were here, he\u2019d probably make a joke about Groff being \u201cswole\u201d, but that Lawson is out and about hanging with Jennifer Lawrence and giggling about Bradley Cooper\u2019s flatulence or something.\n\nBack to Patty, he\u2019s kind of like Rachel Leigh Cook in She\u2019s All That \u2014 an impossible standard of nerd beauty created by the media and television. He\u2019s going on dates with doctors, finding handies in the park, and getting picked up by good-looking guys on public transportation? Patty is doing fine for himself and at the top of this totem pole.\n\nAgustin\u2014 we don\u2019t really know yet. We don\u2019t know how his relationship works yet, or if he\u2019ll ultimately be happy in Oakland.\n\nAnd Dom. Oh Dom. Dom is not in a good place. Dom was in a much better when he was Oliver Spencer in Sex and the City. But that\u2019s neither here nor there. I think Dom is on the bottom of this odd totem pole \u2014 he\u2019s not getting sex, he\u2019s getting old, and he\u2019s having a career crisis. He also has friends who allow him to leave the house in a shearling jacket and a moustache.\n\nJoe: Wait, I thought all you flagrant homosexuals (I use an editorial distancing tactic here to emphasize how very un-typical I am) love mustaches? That weird retro idea of \u201870s masculinity?\n\nAlex: Joe, the moustache-shearling combination was the reason at least four people asked me if this show was set in the 70s. Stop talking to me like you aren\u2019t a flagrant homosexual yourself.\n\nJoe: Whatever, I\u2019m super into Dom, despite the fact that his life appears to be in shambles. (Maybe because of it?) I like his flirt game with that cute young waiter at the restaurant where he works. I like that he\u2019s our window into Doris, who is easily the funniest character on the show. I have some faith in him to get it together because he is wildly attractive, and I think it pisses God off when you walk past the color purple or Murray Bartlett and don\u2019t notice.\n\nAgust\u00edn sits at the middle of my totem pole as well. Obviously, this move to Oakland is not going to end well. The show is not shy about telegraphing that one to us. And I could do without him image-shaming OkCupid potentials with lazy eyes. None of us are perfect, Agust\u00edn! But at the moment, he\u2019s the only one of the leads with a boyfriend, and his boyfriend manages to be cute, nice, and up for threeways, so Agust\u00edn\u2019s not doing so bad. Yet.\n\nI think part of the reason why the unrealistic vision of a lovelorn Jonathan Groff doesn\u2019t take me out of the story is that I somehow find him the least appealing of the three leads. He really sells Patrick\u2019s whole precious, awkward mama-boy thing, to the point where I get why he\u2019s single. I completely identify with Patrick\u2019s sense that a lot of what\u2019s out there for gay men isn\u2019t an option for him, for one reason or another. But there\u2019s a not inconsiderable posture of superiority in him (and maybe me) that irks. I\u2019m still rooting for him to find some mans, but I think I\u2019m rooting for him to get his shit together first.\n\nCruising. The first episode spends a lot of time showing us how gay men find, umm, \u201cromance.\u201d But what the episode seemed to hammer home or critique, is the death of \u201ccruising\u201d, like the actual act of meeting someone spontaneously. What say you? Is it dead? Are we sad it\u2019s dead?\n\nAlex: The only guy Patty meets that we like is one that he meets in person. The guy he meets in the park has a lot of sexual hangups. And the doctor that he meets on OkCupid is just the worst\u2014 maybe it's jab about how you can\u2019t order men like pizzas, or maybe it's saying that what we want isn\u2019t that simple?\n\nJoe: I\u2019m not even sure we can say Patrick \u201cmeets\u201d the guy in the park.\n\nAlex: Fine. \u201cMeet\u201d is a term I use loosely.\n\nJoe: I think the whole point of that opening sequence is that Patrick is looking to meet someone (I swear to God, this makes me so self-conscious about my gerund usage when I discuss it) even when the social cues around him explicitly forbid that. I\u2019m not sure if the show is making a statement about cruising in and of itself (though it certainly doesn\u2019t get a ton of respect), rather just that meeting people in general is kind of a nightmare. Patrick tries to intellectualize it and take advantage of technology and nothing works out. He ends up being resistant to Richie at first because who expects to find someone on the BART? It\u2019s a pretty quaint notion, that meeting your dream guy must happen in person, but it\u2019s really hard to romanticize OkCupid. Harder still to romanticize cold handjobs in the park.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about that scene on the BART. How did you feel about \u201concology\u201d, and that Richie couldn\u2019t pronounce it? How did you feel about Patty and his feelings on Richie not being able to pronounce oncology? Also, is Richie the first gay character we\u2019ve seen in a while that isn\u2019t a) white b) affluent c) educated?\n\nJoe: I\u2019m not sure that joke plays quite so damning, especially since in the very next scene, Richie makes a crackabout being a \u201cresident in cosmetology. It played to me like standard meet-cute territory more than anything else, though, again, this is why it sucks that there is like one show on TV with gay characters of any ethnicity at all.\n\nAlex: Patty was being an asshole. And I\u2019m kinda glad it was made clear (maybe not enough) that gay guys can be cruel to each other. Though, in real life, when you act like a jerk the payback isn\u2019t usually a date with a really handsome Latino guy that you were a jerk to.\n\nCan we talk about how obnoxious it is to call this show the \u201cgay\u201d Girls? Where do you think that comes from?\n\nAlex: I think it\u2019s actually lazy. They\u2019re two completely different shows, and anyone that spends five minutes with the two will notice that. I think that there are arguments that could be made that Looking has more in common with Entourage or How to Make It in America than it is Girls. But I understand it \u2014 there aren\u2019t enough shows that feature lead female characters (it\u2019s getting better) or gay men, so lumping them together because they bring something different or cut through the layers of straight white men on television in the same way is much easier for people to do rather than figure out why they shouldn\u2019t.\n\nJoe: It\u2019s incredibly lazy. I tend to calm myself down about it by reminding myself that it\u2019s a generalization more about the audience that HBO is looking to reach than the show itself. I think that\u2019s where you see it separating from at least Entourage and probably How to Make It in America, too. The people who watched those shows are probably not going to be that keen on Looking. Everybody you know who watches, complains, and blogs about Girls are going to end up watching Looking, too.\n\nThe show cut away when the threeway with Agust\u00edn, Frank, and that hot art-mover was getting interesting. And even in the outdoor hookup scene at the beginning, things got aborted before anything really happened. The latter had a storyline reason, sure, but are you worried that this is a show that sees integrity and flesh as two separate things?\n\nAlex: I actually couldn\u2019t care less about the amount of penises on screen. And I\u2019d still watch the show if there was never another sex scene throughout the season. I mean, I just want a good story. If I, or anyone, wanted to see lots of fit, good-looking white men having sex, it would be as easy as firing up a web broswer. Or I could just watch that Michael Fassbender movie.\n\nI would be more worried if there\u2019s actual controversy here \u2014 from the show\u2019s writers and creator\u2014 that there was some reason they were shying away from showing the sex.\n\nJoe: Ultimately I think I\u2019m with you that flesh is incidental to my enjoyment of the show. I think this is another area where this show will be challenged to be all things to all people. Sure, it would be great to have a show that was unapologetic about gay sex and made everybody get the hell over it already, but that\u2019s not this show, and I don\u2019t think it has to be. If being confrontational about sex and nudity is going to overshadow a show that wants to be about forging emotional connections, I\u2019m onboard with that effort. I\u2019ve yet to get to the point with Looking where it feels like an unrealistic sense of modesty is interfering with the frankness of the rest of the show. If I do, I\u2019ll have to reevaluate. I also think I would feel a lot differently about things if the threeway didn\u2019t come across as sexy as it does, even despite the fact that not a penis nor a butt is revealed.\n\nIf you were asked to recommend this show, or not, to a friend who was on the fence about it, would you?\n\nAlex: Yes. Especially if you\u2019re watching the aggressively rage-inducing Girls or the anxiety bomb that is The Walking Dead (when it comes back), these guys are a nice way to bring you down and not hate humanity. I do think that it the windup is a bit slow. But I was absolutely hooked by the third episode.\n\nJoe: I would. I have been. I\u2019ve been adding a ton of caveats, of course, because nothing is worse than recommending a gay show to a cadre of bitchy homosexuals who then proceed to tear it apart in front of your eyes. I\u2019m telling people to give it time. Give it a few weeks. The characters grow on you and become more familiar. The comparisons to Andrew Haigh\u2019s Weekend are much more applicable than the comparisons to something like Girls. Girls is maybe better suited for the week-to-week rigors of being appointment television. There\u2019s always something that happens every week that is either memorable or funny or so annoying that you absolutely have to complain about it to everybody you encounter for the next few days. Looking is far more lived-in, and I think could ultimately be more rewarding as the season goes on. It\u2019s nice to have a show about gay guys that isn\u2019t constantly making its case for mere existence. We\u2019re here. We\u2019re queer. Now we have to get on with the business of the rest of it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This and other burning questions about the new HBO series' debut episode, including the death of cruising and the seductive properties of the BART.", "title": "News, opinion and aggregation on business, politics, entertainment, technology, global and national \u2013 The Wire", "og": {"site_name": "The Wire", "description": "This and other burning questions about the new HBO series' debut episode, including the death of cruising and the seductive properties of the BART.", "title": "Does 'Looking' Start Off Too Slow?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/01/19/looking/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/01/does-looking-start-too-slow/357165/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thewire", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/01/19/looking/lead_large.jpg", "description": "This and other burning questions about the new HBO series&#39; debut episode, including the death of cruising and the seductive properties of the BART.", "card": "summary", "title": "Does 'Looking' Start Off Too Slow?"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "app_id": 192759427473466}, "keywords": "The Wire, TheWire.com, TheWire.com, news, opinion, aggregation, business, politics, entertainment, technology, global, national", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlanticWire"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m still rooting for him to find some mans, but I think I\u2019m rooting for him to get his shit together first.\nI think that\u2019s where you see it separating from at least Entourage and probably How to Make It in America, too.\nJoe: Ultimately I think I\u2019m with you that flesh is incidental to my enjoyment of the show.\nCan we talk about how obnoxious it is to call this show the \u201cgay\u201d Girls?\nHaving seen the episode, that's not a concern."}
