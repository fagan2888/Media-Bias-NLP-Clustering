The pair will also work to delineate \u201cpeacetime cyber norms\u201d and present a united cyber front at international organizations, such as the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe United States and Japan are building a partnership that addresses global challenges,\u201d the White House and Japan said in a joint statement.\n\nPart of that \u201cbroad agenda\u201d includes ensuring \u201cthe safe and stable use of cyberspace based on the free flow of information and an open Internet,\u201d the two countries said.\n\nThe U.S. has struggled to hold foreign governments accountable for suspected cyberattacks on both the U.S. commercial sector and federal agencies.\n\nWithout strong, internationally negotiated rules governing state-sponsored hacking, the White House has been hesitant to take retaliatory action against \u2014 let alone blame \u2014 other countries for cyberattacks.\n\nIt\u2019s widely assumed that Beijing-backed digital warriors are behind intrusions at several major U.S. health insurers, large military contractors, the U.S. Postal Service and the federal weather system.\n\nBut the only major public step the administration has taken was to indict five Chinese military members last year for hacking \u2014 a largely symbolic measure.\n\nPresident Obama did recently sign an executive order giving the Treasury Department more authority to impose economic sanctions on governments as punishment for cyberattacks.\n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s agreement gives the White House an Asian ally to help put additional cyber pressure on China and North Korea, another cyber irritant in the region that reportedly took down Japan-owned Sony Pictures Entertainment in a massive digital hit last fall.\n\nThe strengthened partnership comes one day after Secretary of State John Kerry John KerryGOP senator calls for China to crack down on illegal opioid Obamas to live in home of former Clinton press secretary: report Even in defeat, Trump could harm the country irreparably MORE and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter released updated guidelines for U.S.-Japan military cooperation.\n\nThe revised rules would allow Tokyo to participate in more international security initiatives, including those in cyberspace. Specifically, the two countries vowed to cooperate on helping each other bolster cyber defenses for critical infrastructure.\n\nU.S. officials have publicly acknowledged that several countries \u2014 including Asian power China \u2014 are sitting on the United States' critical networks, collecting data and possibly waiting to attack.\n\nCybersecurity \u201chas become a common security issue for both nations,\u201d Japanese Minister of Defense Gen Nakatani said at a joint press conference with Carter earlier this month.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. and Japan said cyber threats are an unprecedented threat to international security.\n\n\u201cToday the international order faces fresh challenges, ranging from violent extremism to cyberattacks,\u201d they said. \u201cState actions that undermine respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity by attempting to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion pose challenges to the international order.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The two countries will work to establish international \"peacetime cyber norms.\"", "description": "The two countries will work to establish international \"peacetime cyber norms.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The two countries will work to establish international \"peacetime cyber norms.\"", "title": "White House unveils cyber pact with Japan", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/240283-white-house-unveils-unprecedented-cyber-partnership-with-japan", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/abeshinzo_032616getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/240283-white-house-unveils-unprecedented-cyber-partnership-with-japan", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-28T10:06-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",John Kerry,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-28T10:06:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/240283-white-house-unveils-unprecedented-cyber-partnership-with-japan", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The two countries will work to establish international \"peacetime cyber norms.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "White House unveils cyber pact with Japan"}, "dcterms.title": "White House unveils cyber pact with Japan"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe United States and Japan are building a partnership that addresses global challenges,\u201d the White House and Japan said in a joint statement.\nThe pair will also work to delineate \u201cpeacetime cyber norms\u201d and present a united cyber front at international organizations, such as the United Nations General Assembly.\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. and Japan said cyber threats are an unprecedented threat to international security.\n\u201cToday the international order faces fresh challenges, ranging from violent extremism to cyberattacks,\u201d they said.\nThe U.S. and Japan unveiled a wide-ranging cybersecurity alliance Tuesday morning, a step toward the White House's goal of creating international cyber norms amid growing hacking threats from China and North Korea."}
