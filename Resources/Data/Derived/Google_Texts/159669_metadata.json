Louise Eastty, an intensive care unit nurse for 15 years, said she\u2019s seen co-workers attacked physically by patients, and has been verbally abused countless times.\n\n\u201cWhen family and patients themselves come in, it's a very stressful situation being sick,\u201d the Pasco County nurse said. \u201cVarious things are going on -- life and death sometimes -- so it does lead to increased anxiety, increased stress, but people have to realize that the health care worker is not a punching bag. We're there to heal, not to be hurt.\u201d\n\nThe National Nurses Organizing Committee rally in Tampa's Ybor City pushed Florida\u2019s legislature for a law that would require hospitals to provide adequate training and protection. The committee is an affiliate of National Nurses United.\n\nBonnie Castillo is the union's associate executive director. She says the Florida law they are asking for mirrors a 2014 California law creating violence prevention plans in all hospitals.\n\n\u201cOur legislation is designed to prevent and not to criminalize our patients. We are patient advocates,\u201d said Castillo, a California nurse. \u201cAnd we understand that the hospitals bear the responsibility for ensuring the hospitals are safe for patients, for nurses, and for everyone.\u201d\n\nSo far, the proposal has no sponsors in either Florida's Senate or House of Representatives.\n\n--Health News Florida Editor Mary Shedden is part of WUSF Public Media in Tampa.
