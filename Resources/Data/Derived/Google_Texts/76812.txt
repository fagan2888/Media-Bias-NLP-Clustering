Co-host of Fox News’ “Outnumbered” Andrea Tantaros slammed the “incredibly arrogant” President Barack Obama, saying he has blamed everyone but himself for his own failures.

The comments came out of a discussion of President Obama’s recent comments on Al Sharpton’s radio show on Senate Democrats’ refusal to campaign alongside him, and the refusal of some to even admit they voted for him.

“This isn’t about my feelings being hurt,” Obama told Sharpton. (RELATED: Obama: Evasive Democratic Senators Are Still My Guys)

“I don’t think his feelings are hurt,” Tantaros said. “I actually think he thinks he did a really good job. I don’t think he’s embarrassed about his agenda at all.”

The other “Outnumbered” co-hosts pushed back, saying that Obama must have felt hurt after some rally attendees walked out on one of his speeches.

“But he has blamed everyone else but himself!” she responded. “He said it’s the media’s fault. He said it’s our fault because we don’t understand Obamacare. He thinks it’s everybody’s fault but his. He’s incredibly arrogant.”
