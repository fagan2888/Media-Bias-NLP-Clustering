In a video posted on the Facebook page of the Odessa Police Department on Monday, the suspect is seen standing alone in front of the body of an elderly woman for about a minute on Friday and apparently twisting the woman's finger to remove a ring. https://www.facebook.com/Odessa-Police-Department-824628704293521/

Police said after stealing the ring, the suspect fled in a car.

The daughter of the woman, whose funeral was scheduled for Monday, told the Odessa American newspaper the family did not know the suspect.
