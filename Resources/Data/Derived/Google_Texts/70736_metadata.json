Michael Burgess faces two political newcomers in the race for the 26th Congressional District, which includes all of Denton County and some parts of Tarrant and Dallas counties.\n\nLewisville resident Divenchy Watrous and Highland Village resident Joel Krause are challenging Burgess in the March 4 Republican primary election. The winner will face Libertarian candidate Mark Boler in the November general election; no Democrat filed for the position.\n\nCongressional members are paid $174,000 and serve two-year terms. Members represent their geographic districts in the U.S. House of Representatives, where they plan and pass federal legislation.\n\nThe GOP candidates agree that their top responsibilities are controling federal spending, reforming the Affordable Care Act and improving the economy.\n\nHowever, each candidate has a different approach to gaining the support of voters.\n\nBurgess, 63, of Lewisville, a former OB/GYN who has served for more than 11 years in Congress, said he wants voters to let his experience and track records speak for themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to look at the record and set politics aside,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are big problems that face the country and they\u2019re not going to be solved overnight. But I will be diligent and review every bill that comes across the floor and vote the way my constituents expect me to vote.\u201d\n\nBurgess said he agrees in the mission of the Affordable Care Act to lower the cost of health care and to provide coverage for all those who are currently uninsured, but he believes it needs to be reformed.\n\nWith a medical background, Burgess said much of his success has come from helping reform issues related to health care. He said he will continue to fight for the reforms in health care that will make it more affordable and accessible to everyone.\n\nKrause, 55, and president of Web Electronics in Lewisville, said his 28 years of business experience give him the skills to relate to the average resident, who he says is frustrated and angry with the current administration.\n\nHe said voters need someone they can look up to and trust. He said the biggest issue facing the nation is the deficit, health care costs and federal spending.\n\nKrause doesn\u2019t have much experience in politics, but he said he\u2019s always been interested in keeping up with current events and issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to listen to the people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of crafting legislation behind the closed doors of Washington, we should let the people dictate how our laws are written.\u201d\n\nWatrous, 26, a small business CEO, said he doesn\u2019t label himself as a politician, and has taken a few jabs at Burgess for being a part of the reason why Americans are frustrated with the president\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m young and inexperienced, but that\u2019s what makes me the best option,\u201d he said. \u201cI can show people I\u2019m just like them and that I know what it feels like to be a struggling American.\u201d\n\nWatrous graduated from Guyer High School in 2007 and doesn\u2019t have a college degree, but he says he\u2019s self-educated and knowledgeable on government policies.\n\n\u201cI believe that we should be electing statesmen, not career politicians that care not for individual rights but for how much they can pad their pocketbooks,\u201d he said.\n\nWatrous also says he\u2019s against any tax increases and says he will never vote for deficit spending. And like Krause, Watrous said he would work to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBoth Watrous and Krause agree that it\u2019s time for a change and that Burgess should step aside. They said a vote for Burgess is a vote for more frustration.\n\nBut Burgess argues that there\u2019s still more work to do and over time, he\u2019s been able to address important issues that have defined the country for the last 10 years. He said he has much success as a congressman and that his medical expertise will help address the concerns related to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nVisit each candidate\u2019s campaign page for more information about their platforms and experience.\n\nFor Burgess\u2019 website, visit www.burgessforcongress.com.
