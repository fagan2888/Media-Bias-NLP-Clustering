Simply put: the status quo is unacceptable and we can do better.\n\nThis week I spoke on Capitol Hill to urge action on some common sense solutions offered by Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health Chairman Kevin Brady Kevin BradyIRS doubted legality of ObamaCare payments, former official says Report: Pacific trade pact would boost growth, jobs and incomes Puerto Rico debt becomes constitutional fight on the right MORE (R-Texas) and Reps. Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.), Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.) and Frank Pallone (D-N.J.). Their proposals get to the heart of the problem: stopping inappropriate prescriptions from crossing the pharmacy counter.\n\nTwo basic reforms are needed to get this done.\n\nFirst, we need a \u201cSafe Pharmacy,\u201d or \u201cLock-In\u201d policy in Medicare in which the small segment of patients who are at risk of abusing opioids would choose \u2013 along with their health plan \u2013 a single, convenient pharmacy to fill their prescriptions for controlled substances. This is easy, because most patients would simply choose from among the pharmacies they already use.\n\nThe goal of such an approach is to prevent \u201cDrugstore Shopping,\u201d the practice of filling prescriptions for controlled substances \u2013 whether using copies of the same prescription over and over or separate ones procured from different prescribers \u2013 at multiple drugstores to avoid detection. Local, community pharmacists are often targeted because they can\u2019t communicate with each other and don\u2019t share centralized claims systems like chain drug stores.\n\nA recent report by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) called for a pharmacy \u201cLock-In\u201d program in Medicare Part D to help decrease prescription drug abuse. Currently, 46 state Medicaid agencies operate these programs, and 49 states have enacted prescription drug monitoring legislation.\n\nHHS, CDC, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Government Accountability Office and the Office of National Drug Control Policy have all called for a \u201cLock-In\u201d program, in Medicare, in one form or another.\n\nSecond, we must close the loophole in Medicare that prevents Part D plans from suspending payments to pharmacies suspected of fraud or diversion. Another OIG report found that 2,600 pharmacies had questionable billing practices. All providers in Medicare except druggists are subject to this routine accountability. It works well for hospitals and doctors and it would work for pharmacies, too.\n\nProtecting patients from harm by curbing prescription drug fraud, waste and abuse is important to all Americans. Fortunately, it\u2019s also the kind of reform Democrats and Republicans can work together on. The time to act is now.\n\nMerritt is president and CEO of the the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The CDC rightly calls prescription drug abuse a national epidemic.", "description": "The CDC rightly calls prescription drug abuse a national epidemic.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The CDC rightly calls prescription drug abuse a national epidemic.", "title": "Let's tackle prescription drug abuse in Medicare", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/219372-lets-tackle-prescription-drug-abuse-in-medicare", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/219372-lets-tackle-prescription-drug-abuse-in-medicare", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-10-01T16:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Mark Merritt", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-01T16:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Kevin Brady,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/219372-lets-tackle-prescription-drug-abuse-in-medicare", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The CDC rightly calls prescription drug abuse a national epidemic.", "card": "summary", "title": "Let's tackle prescription drug abuse in Medicare"}, "dcterms.title": "Let's tackle prescription drug abuse in Medicare"}, "article_summary": "Currently, 46 state Medicaid agencies operate these programs, and 49 states have enacted prescription drug monitoring legislation.\nProtecting patients from harm by curbing prescription drug fraud, waste and abuse is important to all Americans.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rightly calls prescription drug abuse a national epidemic, costing tens of thousands of lives and tens of billions of dollars a year.\nA recent report by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) called for a pharmacy \u201cLock-In\u201d program in Medicare Part D to help decrease prescription drug abuse.\nHHS, CDC, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Government Accountability Office and the Office of National Drug Control Policy have all called for a \u201cLock-In\u201d program, in Medicare, in one form or another."}
