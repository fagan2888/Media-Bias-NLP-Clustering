That\u2019s why I wanted our pinning ceremony, too. So that they know they are needed and valued in the medical field.\u201d\n\nLugo said the aging Baby Boomer Generation and implementation of the Affordable Care Act will generate an increase in patients in the near future and an increased demand for medical assistants.\n\n\u201cAs more and more people become insured, they\u2019re going to need us out there, and our students need to know they\u2019re needed,\u201d she said.\n\nFor more information on the Medical Assistant Program, go to www.tstc.edu/harlingenmedassist.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Valley Morning Star", "description": "For the first time in four years, students form the Medical Assistant Program enjoyed a Pinning Ceremony last week at the Harlingen Cultural Arts Center.", "title": "15 medical assistant students receive graduation pins", "url": "http://www.valleymorningstar.com/education/tstc/article_2bb73bc2-8270-11e4-9146-9bb156ec2d26.html", "image": "http://www.aim-ads.com/multimedia-themonitor-com/wwwroot/star_icon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@valleystar", "card": "summary"}, "description": "For the first time in four years, students form the Medical Assistant Program enjoyed a Pinning Ceremony last week at the Harlingen Cultural Arts Center.", "fb": {"app_id": 333523476743065}, "keywords": "tstc", "google-site-verification": "BXTS2lONfpmhbwkgYeWd5fN5Kfc5F3ATaP0EA89JLjA", "news_keywords": "tstc"}, "article_summary": "For the first time in four years, students form the Medical Assistant Program enjoyed a Pinning Ceremony last week at the Harlingen Cultural Arts Center.\nMedical assistants work in doctors\u2019 offices or clinics and assist the physician with anything from checking vital signs, to performing phlebotomy, EKGs or injections.\nThe ceremony is the symbolic welcoming of newly graduated medical assistants into the profession, and graduates are presented pins by the faculty of the MEA Program.\n\u201cAs more and more people become insured, they\u2019re going to need us out there, and our students need to know they\u2019re needed,\u201d she said.\nDepartment Chair Alicia Lugo said 15 students received pins in a celebration that involved a candle ceremony and the presentation of a scroll creed by the American Association of Medical Assistants."}
