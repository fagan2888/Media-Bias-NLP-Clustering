As of this writing, it appears that Paul Ryan has accepted the conditions the caucus laid down, including a promise to maintain the Hastert Rule \u2014 which means the stand-offs and showdowns will continue under his leadership. Whether that will be good enough for the Freedom Caucus is unknown; from the looks of it, nothing will have changed from Boehner era. And so it goes.\n\nBut with all the current sturm und drang, it\u2019s easy to forget that the right wing has been radical for a very long time. The only difference today is that they are literally running the party rather than toiling on the outside influencing from afar. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the outside influences are no longer exerting their will. The talk radio hosts are still agitating, the Fox News pundits are still pontificating and the right-wing think tankers are still\u2026 thinking. The wingnut industry is as active and engaged as ever.\n\nTake for example, the Godfather of the conservative movement, ,, who appeared on Brad Friedman\u2019s radio show yesterday and declared:\n\n\u201cVoters do not like establishment Republicans. They really do reject them across the board. When I talk to Republicans and they say \u2018We\u2019ve got to beat Hillary\u2019, I say that\u2019s fine, I understand that, but if you nominate an establishment Republican \u2014 a Chris Christie, a Jeb Bush type, a John Kasich \u2014 you\u2019re going to lose. The people don\u2019t want an establishment Republican.\u201d\n\nViguerie has been making lots of money and growing his power for more than four decades by railing against the Republican establishment. These little pipsqueaks in the Freedom Caucus are walking the path laid down long ago by the likes of Viguerie, back in the 1970s when he and Paul Weyrich and a few others created the modern conservative movement infrastructure that still exists today.\n\nIn the 1980s, a new generation of outside agitators came in with the Reagan Revolution. Among the most successful were a trio of friends \u2014 Grover Norquist, Ralph Reed and Jack Abramoff.\n\nReporter Nina Easton\u2019s book, \u201cGang of Five: Leaders at the Center of the Conservative Ascendancy,\u201d tracks their rise from their early years as college Republicans all the way up to the exalted positions they each held in the Bush years. Reed was the leader of the Christian Coalition, Abramoff the powerful K Street lobbyist, and Norquist the anti-tax activist.\n\nReed and Abramoff got caught up in a lurid corruption scandal and lost their positions as conservative movement leaders. Reed has fought his way back to some degree and now heads a different social conservative group, the Faith and Family coalition. Abramoff did jail time and became a critic of the lobbying industry upon his release. But Grover Norquist remains at the top of the conservative hierarchy, more powerful than ever.\n\nThese activists were of a different breed. Today\u2019s Tea Party/Freedom Caucus players are impatient and solipsistic, naively disruptive. Norquist, on the other hand, has been slowly changing the landscape of American life and the relationship of the people to its government over many, many years. He has done this with one very specific longterm strategy: He set out many years ago to starve the government of funds. Not that he hasn\u2019t been instrumental in most other conservative movement successes of the past 30 years \u2014 his regular Wednesday meeting of conservative activists remains hugely influential \u2014 but his Americans for Tax Reform \u201cpledge\u201d is the most significant. He has managed to put the government in a fiscal noose that just keeps tightening and strangling it ever so slowly.\n\nThis week, Michael Grunwald at Politico caught up with Norquist as the drama of the House Speakership crisis unfolded. The Republican Party may be in total disarray but Norquist keeps his eye on the prize:\n\nMichael Grunwald: You\u2019ve been at this for more than 30 years, pushing for lower taxes. So how\u2019s it going? Grover Norquist: People forget Republicans weren\u2019t always for tax cuts. Even during the Reagan years, it wasn\u2019t a settled issue. Bob Dole wanted to do a gas tax. A lot of Republicans wanted to get rid of various deductions and credits. Remember in 1988, even after Reagan passed tax reform, Dole refused to take the pledge. He won Iowa, but then during a debate in New Hampshire, Pete DuPont handed him the pledge, and he reacted like someone had thrown the cross in the lap of a vampire. George Bush took the pledge and won. But then Bush broke his pledge in 1990, and broke the Republican Party. It cost him the presidency. Well, no one\u2019s life is a complete waste; some people serve as bad examples to others. We haven\u2019t had someone break the pledge since Bush. In 1994, 95 percent of Republican candidates took the pledge, and we swept the House and Senate. Today, more than 90 percent of the Republicans in Congress have signed the pledge and kept it. And we\u2019re pushing it down to the state level, too\u2026 MG: That\u2019s one of the big political stories of the last 30-plus years. The Republicans all agree on this now. So how much have they actually lowered taxes? GN: The top tax rate was 70 percent when Reagan came in. When he left it was 28 percent. It climbed up to 39 percent under Clinton. Now it\u2019s 35.5 percent, plus 3.8 percent for Obamacare taxes. The corporate rate went from 50 percent to 35 percent, although it got stuck there. And at the state level, there are now nine states with no income tax.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP's Freedom Caucus has successfully hijacked Congress\u2014but Norquist is still an unmatched figure on the right", "title": "Long live the conservative puppet master: Why Grover Norquist is still more destructive than the House GOP", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The GOP's Freedom Caucus has successfully hijacked Congress\u2014but Norquist is still an unmatched figure on the right", "title": "Long live the conservative puppet master: Why Grover Norquist is still more destructive than the House GOP", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/22/long_live_the_conservative_puppet_master_why_grover_norquist_is_still_more_destructive_than_the_house_gop/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/grover_norquist2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The GOP's Freedom Caucus has successfully hijacked Congress\u2014but Norquist is still an unmatched figure on the right", "title": "Long live the conservative puppet master: Why Grover Norquist is still more destructive than the House GOP", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/grover_norquist2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Heather Digby Parton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, conservative movement, Grover Norquist, House GOP, Paul Ryan, The House of Representatives", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc09\"", "article_summary": "Reed and Abramoff got caught up in a lurid corruption scandal and lost their positions as conservative movement leaders.\nTopics: aol_on, conservative movement, Grover Norquist, House GOP, Paul Ryan, The House of Representatives, News, Politics NewsLast night, the so-called Freedom Caucus said most of them would \u201csupport\u201d Paul Ryan for Speaker of the House, but they would not \u201cendorse\u201d him.\nTake for example, the Godfather of the conservative movement, ,, who appeared on Brad Friedman\u2019s radio show yesterday and declared:\u201cVoters do not like establishment Republicans.\nThis week, Michael Grunwald at Politico caught up with Norquist as the drama of the House Speakership crisis unfolded.\nBut Grover Norquist remains at the top of the conservative hierarchy, more powerful than ever."}
