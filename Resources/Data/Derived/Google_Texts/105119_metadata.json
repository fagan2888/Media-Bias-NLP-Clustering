Burwell, of course, is that critically important health insurance subsidies are saved for more than 6 million Americans. And that, in turn, will save the functioning of the health insurance market in states across the country. But I have a more parochial observation: This may be the greatest Supreme Court term any solicitor general has ever had.\n\nBefore the government\u2019s briefing was submitted to the court, the legal community generally thought it would be an uphill battle to save the Affordable Care Act in states with a federally managed exchange. The solicitor general\u2019s brief changed that expectation because of the power of its arguments. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli\u2019s oral argument rebutted every point raised by those seeking a crabbed reading of the law. I have rarely seen an opinion of the court that more closely followed the government\u2019s arguments.\n\nLast week, the solicitor general won Zivotofsky v. Kerry, upholding a broad interpretation of the president\u2019s authority over foreign affairs. And Verrilli also argued and won the important case on racial redistricting, Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdd to that the victory for the government in preserving, in housing discrimination litigation, some role for disparate impact on racial minorities, and you have yet another uphill victory. Finally, if the court rules in favor of a national right to gay marriage, the solicitor general\u2019s great term will be complete. Many advocates played a role in that case, and Verrilli\u2019s outstanding argument was certainly one of those.\n\nThis is shaping up as one of the happiest Supreme Court final weeks a president has ever had. He should be pleased with his Justice Department.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "This may be the best term a solicitor general has ever had.", "fb-share": "The president should be proud of his Justice Department, and especially Donald Verrilli.", "sailthru.author": "Walter Dellinger", "description": "The most important thing about Thursday\u2019s ruling in King v.
