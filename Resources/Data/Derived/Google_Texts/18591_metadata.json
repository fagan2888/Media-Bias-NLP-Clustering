Topeka Blvd., won\u2019t be open to the public daily, but will be used to store items clients want to sell and also can be used for a monthly warehouse sale.\n\nShe said the opportunity to lease about 2,400 square feet of space came about after a client was moving items from Perry to Topeka. To accommodate that client, Kearney said she called about renting warehouse space, and she realized what an opportunity this offered for The Resale Lady of Topeka business. The area offers opportunities to expand the space as needed.\n\nHaving a permanent space will allow her to set up a monthly warehouse sale, which Kearney said she plans for the second weekend of every month. The dates and times will be announced online on her website and Facebook pages.\n\nTypically, her business has featured one sale for a customer \u2014 often in their homes or another location. While Kearney said her business will still do estate sales on location, having the warehouse space will allow her to take one or two items to sell from individuals.\n\n\u201cAs we move forward, we will start actually taking consignment stuff from people in the community to sell at our monthly warehouse sales,\u201d she said.\n\n40,000 KANSANS ENROLL IN HEALTH MARKETPLACE: The third open-enrollment period for the Health Insurance Marketplace signed up 4.9 million new customers for 2016, and about 40,000 of those were in Kansas, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported.\n\n\u201cAlmost 5 million Americans were new to the Health Insurance Marketplaces in 2015, and about 20 million uninsured Americans have gained coverage because of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said HHS Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell in the release. \u201cThis year\u2019s customers are more engaged, savvier and better informed. New customers came in earlier because they wanted a full year\u2019s coverage, and 70 percent of existing customers came back to shop and actively selected a plan.\u201d\n\nAs with previous years, most of the people who signed up in the marketplace received tax credits. In Kansas, the average tax credit was $246 per month, or 70 percent of the gross premium, and the average premium after tax credits was $106 per month.\n\nMR. O AUTO PARTNERS WITH U-HAUL: U-Haul trucks, trailers, towing equipment, support rental items and boxes now will be available at Mr. O Auto Sales, 430 S.E. University Blvd. Emeka Okoronkwo owns the business.\n\nAccording to U-Haul, every official community site helps keep 19 personally owned large-capacity vehicles, pickups, SUVs and vans off the road because of the ability the company offers to share trucks.
