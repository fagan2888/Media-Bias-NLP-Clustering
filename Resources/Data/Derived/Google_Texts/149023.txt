Denver police on Saturday identified the body found in an alley on New Year’s Day as Teodoro Leon.

But little else is known about Leon, whose body was discovered around 9:15 a.m. in Bannock Alley behind 1025 Acoma Street, according to police. The address is the same as The Gabriel Foundation, a parrot welfare organization.

In a photo supplied by Denver police, the aging Leon has long, straggly hair and a full beard speckled with gray hair.

On Friday, police said that the body had “obvious signs of trauma” and began a homicide investigation.

Tyrone Campbell, a Denver Police spokesman, said Saturday that investigators have no further details to share with the public, including how Leon was identified.

But police are working with Crime Stoppers to offer a $2,000 reward for information related to mysterious death.

Anyone with information should contact the Denver Police Department at 720-913-2000 or Crime Stoppers at 720-913-7867.

Updated 1/1/2016 3:58 p.m.: Due to a source error, Teodoro Leon was misidentified in the original article.
