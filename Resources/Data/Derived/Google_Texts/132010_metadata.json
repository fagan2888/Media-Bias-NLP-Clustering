Bush? Amid stronger-than-expected economic growth and an increasingly robust labor market, that right-wing boogeyman has gone missing. Contrary to conservative claims, Obamacare and environmental regulations haven\u2019t destroyed the economy, and with Obama\u2019s approval ratings on the rise as economic fortunes improve, Republicans confront the possibility that come 2016, voters will decide that they\u2019re better off than they eight years before.\n\nBut how much does Obama have to do with the economic upswing? That\u2019s the question Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman tackles in his New York Times column today. As Krugman notes, presidents typically have little influence on the economy\u2019s performance; business cycles fluctuate, regardless of which party holds the White House. To the extent that policy does shape the economy, it\u2019s often monetary policy, set by the politically independent Federal Reserve, that determines the country\u2019s economic climate. Krugman observes that the so-called Reagan boom of the 1980s was primarily the result of Fed chairman Paul Volcker\u2019s decision to lower interest rates after years of tightened monetary policy aimed at combatting inflation.\n\nWhile presidents may have less power over the economy than popularly imagined, Krugman contends that the same rule doesn\u2019t necessarily apply when it comes to the Obama-era economy. Though it may have been too small given the scale of the Great Recession, economists overwhelmingly agree that the president\u2019s 2009 stimulus package proved pivotal in softening the recession\u2019s impact.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With a real recovery seemingly underway, conservatives have egg on their faces", "title": "\u201cKnaves and fools\u201d: Paul Krugman on what Obama\u2019s critics get wrong", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With a real recovery seemingly underway, conservatives have egg on their faces", "title": "\u201cKnaves and fools\u201d: Paul Krugman on what Obama\u2019s critics get wrong", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/05/knaves_and_fools_paul_krugman_on_what_obamas_critics_get_wrong/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/paul_krugman.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With a real recovery seemingly underway, conservatives have egg on their faces", "title": "\u201cKnaves and fools\u201d: Paul Krugman on what Obama\u2019s critics get wrong", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/paul_krugman.jpg", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Conservatives, Federal Reserve, fiscal policy, Great Recession, Monetary policy, Paul Krugman, Republicans, Stimulus, The New York Times, U.S. Economy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s the question Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman tackles in his New York Times column today.\nAs Krugman notes, presidents typically have little influence on the economy\u2019s performance; business cycles fluctuate, regardless of which party holds the White House.\nTo the extent that policy does shape the economy, it\u2019s often monetary policy, set by the politically independent Federal Reserve, that determines the country\u2019s economic climate.\nKrugman observes that the so-called Reagan boom of the 1980s was primarily the result of Fed chairman Paul Volcker\u2019s decision to lower interest rates after years of tightened monetary policy aimed at combatting inflation.\nAmid stronger-than-expected economic growth and an increasingly robust labor market, that right-wing boogeyman has gone missing."}
