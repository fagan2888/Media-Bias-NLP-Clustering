The values promoted by this event go against all of that.\u201d\n\nZo\u00e9 Zebra is headlining the show, billed as the Boule-O-Thon \u2014 French slang for Boob-A-Thon \u2014 at the seedy-looking Bar 77 on the outskirts of Gatineau. It\u2019s not prostitution because the sex is free (so are the \u201cmasks and condoms\u201d). Admission is $15 for everybody else. \u201cZo\u00e9 offered to have sex with 25 guys at a party in exchange for new boobs, so the goal is 25 ejaculations!\u201d says the show\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nAlthough Zo\u00e9 may have offered, she voiced misgivings in the Sun report. \"I will do it. I took this decision,\"she said, adding that she\u2019s now under contract with the production company backing the event. \"If I cancel,\" she said, \"they will take me to court.\"\n\nThe production company, according to The Daily Dot, is the same one that tried to stage a similar event for another French Canadian porn star: 23 men for her 23rd birthday. But the actress, one month into her adult film career, backed out. For forced sex workers, this frequency of intercourse is tragically common. Yet, in 2004, a porn star from Kentucky named Lisa Sparks (that\u2019s Sparkxxx in the biz) won the Third Annual World Gangbang Championship by enduring a record-breaking 919 sexual partners, earning her a Wikipedia page.\n\nZo\u00e9\u2019s performance comes amid fierce debate about the adult entertainment industry. In May, a 19-year-old college freshman in Wisconsin killed herself after trolls outed her as a porn actress. \u201cWhat would her parents think?\u201d is a common line from haters \u2014 a question seldom directed at the supporting actors. (Isn\u2019t that what the masks are for?) But even among feminists, there is debate about whether a career in porn is healthy and legitimate or whether it transforms human beings into sex objects.\n\nMayor Pedneaud-Jobin is exploring municipal regulations in a last-ditch effort to shut down the Boule-O-Thon. But he said there may not be anything he can do. \u201cIf it is legal, they will have their event,\u201d he told the Sun. \u201cWe cannot invent regulations as we go.\u201d As the Facebook page says: \u201cPut on your mask and just fulfill her wish for a good cause.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "canadian, porn, star, will, pay, breast, implants, having, sex, 25, men", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A porn star decided to put on a sex stunt to pay for her boob job.
