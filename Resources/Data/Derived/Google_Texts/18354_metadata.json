This week, the company took out a building permit for a third store in the city valued at $14.75 million.\n\nIt will be built on the northeast corner of West 60th Street North and Marion Road. The store will be more than 196,000 square feet, according to the city's building services office. It is scheduled to be open late next year.\n\n\"So it will be convenient,\" homeowner Lanae Jeffer said.\n\nWhile a fourth Walmart store faces opposition from neighbors on 85th Street and Minnesota Avenue, some living in this area say they don't mind the development, including Jeffer. She moved in a block away from the new Walmart two weeks ago.\n\n\"Sioux Falls is booming so it will be nice having something on this end of town,\" Jeffer said. \"I guess it is going to increase traffic out here which is the downfall but it is anywhere with a growing city.\"\n\nShe says the retailer would save her long trips to the grocery store in central Sioux Falls.\n\nBut not everyone is willing to bring out the Walmart welcome wagon.\n\n\"I thought it was going to be farther away,\" Nick Lehnen said. \"I guess it's not anymore and I didn't know it was going to go up so quickly.\"\n\nEighteen months ago, Lehnen moved to this side of town because of it's rural feel and fears the fields will become history. He's got a clear shot of the development out his front door.\n\n\"It would be nice to have something on this side of town but I don't want it in my view when I step out during the day on a Saturday and see a huge Walmart and thousands of people standing not even a mile away,\" Lehnen said.\n\nWalmart announced plans for another in southern Sioux Falls in March. But neighbors who live near the 85th Street and Minnesota Avenue site are fighting that project.\n\nThey've collected signatures to put a rezoning decision to a public vote.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Walmart is moving forward with plans to build a new store in northwest Sioux Falls.
