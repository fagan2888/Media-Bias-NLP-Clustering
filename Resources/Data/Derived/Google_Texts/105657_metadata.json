Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Florida Republican, said Wednesday that suggesting Obama might consult Congress on matters of foreign policy or national security is \u201ckind of like fantasy football.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what she would tell the president if he came to Congress asking how to improve his credibility in foreign affairs, the chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa said that\u2019s a situation that would never happen.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he would be coming to us and asking us, that\u2019s kind of like fantasy football. I don\u2019t see that happening,\u201d she said at a Foundation for the Defense of Democracies conference in Washington. \u201cI think he considers us a nuisance instead of a helping partner.\u201d\n\nStill, if she could advise the president, she said she would tell him to stick by the promises he made during his campaign, especially in regard to a deal with Iran to prevent them from procuring a nuclear weapon.\n\nMs. Ros-Lehtinen said the deal with Iran lowers the bar too much and overlooks too many missteps the country has made.\n\n\u201cThe more we know, the more we should get disturbed and anxious and worried,\u201d she said of the deal.\n\nRep. Ted Deutch, Florida Democrat and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, said the congressional deal to vote on and approve a final deal with Iran allows lawmakers to focus in on details of the deal instead of a political fight over whether or not Congress gets a say.\n\n\u201cThese are lots of very legitimate questions that over the coming weeks we\u2019re going to really dig in to see if we can get to a deal that addresses them,\u201d he said.\n\nMs. Ros-Lehtinen also encouraged the administration to reassure allies that America is and will act as a world power in foreign policy. The president\u2019s meeting with Cuban President Raul Castro recently \u2014 but refusing to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his visit to Washington \u2014 sends the wrong message to allies.\n\n\u201cSome of our allies are questioning where we stand on these important issues because they see an administration that doesn\u2019t quite know the difference between an ally and an adversary,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
