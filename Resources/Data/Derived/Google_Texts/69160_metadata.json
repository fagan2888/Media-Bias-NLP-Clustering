You know, for her to have been a veteran, a wounded warrior for the United States Army, she should know that this is not the right thing. And hopefully, you know, she will remember the oath of office that she took as an Army officer and not the allegiance I guess she believes she has to the liberal progressives of the Democrat Party.\n\nHeaven knows, one can\u2019t be both a liberal and loyal to the United States. Doesn\u2019t the military oath oblige you to be a Republican anyway? We\u2019re pretty sure it does. You can just see in this photo of Duckworth in her helicopter in Iraq that she\u2019s already contemplating ways to betray the United States for the sake of protecting the Democrat Party.\n\n\n\nIf she really loved America, she\u2019d be pimping a book on Hannity and questioning the loyalties of fellow Americans, the way the Founders wanted.\n\nShould you have the stomach for it, here\u2019s the audio, in which West also notes the unfitness of other committee members like Adam Smith (\u201cone of those geeky little debaters that is going to try to micromanage every single detail\u201d) and Linda Sanchez, who is \u201cvery whiny.\u201d In fact, since Barack Obama sent emails to House Democrats about the IRS, there probably shouldn\u2019t be any Democrats on the committee, as they are all incapable of being as objective and fair-minded as House Republicans.\n\n\n\nBesides, isn\u2019t this Benghazi hearing just a big distraction from the failures of Obamacare?\n\n[MediaMatters]\n\nFollow Doktor Zoom on Twitter.
