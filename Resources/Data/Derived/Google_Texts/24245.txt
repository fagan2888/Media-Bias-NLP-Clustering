Sioux Falls, SD

This week we're dedicating the whole show to the Build Dakota scholarship, that offers qualified students a free ride to South Dakota's tech schools. Students can start applying for the next round of scholarships this week.

We talk to administrators, students and business leaders about the program's success.

Plus, for those students who have to pay to go to school they can rack up big bills during school and after graduation. One school is making sure its students learn a little financial literacy before heading into the real world.
