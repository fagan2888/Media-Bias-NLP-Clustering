Deborah M Marko\n\n. (Photo: File photo)\n\nVINELAND - In a quest for potential cost savings, the school district is looking into expanding substitute services provided by private firms.\n\nThe district is advertising for a vendor \u201cto provide substitute teachers, paraprofessionals, cafeteria/playground aides, guidance counselors, secretaries and custodians to fill positions on an as-needed basis,\u201d according the request for proposals.\n\nRELATED: Poor turnout at Vineland school budget hearing\n\nThis RFP does not include substitute services for nurses, assistant principals/principals or security, according to Joe Rossi, the district\u2019s personnel director.\n\nThe submission deadline is set for May 10.\n\n\u201cWe are consistently working to maintain a high quality educational product for the children of Vineland while addressing budgetary concerns, which most often derive from salaries and benefits,\u201d Rossi said.\n\nRequests for proposals do not commit the district to a contract.\n\nDistrict officials are \u201clooking to see what\u2019s out there,\u201d Rossi said, noting the RFP results could give the district some options for next school year.\n\nIn other news: VHS marching band adds to trophy case\n\nCentral administration worked on the RFP and the school board is aware of it, Rossi said, adding \u201cthe Affordable Care Act and workers' compensation costs are factors in this decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have maintained a long-standing discussion about if and when to expand external staffing services,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have tried to maintain a good faith relationship with our collective bargaining units and we understand their concerns about job loss as we attempt to grapple with annual multi-million dollar shortfalls.\u201d\n\nIn September 2014, the school district awarded contracts to two private firms to cover temporary substitute paraprofessionals, also called classroom aides, and security guards.\n\nThe school district didn\u2019t continue the contract for security personnel this school year, Rossi said. It does continue to employ Insight Workforce Solutions to assist with long-term substitute aides.\n\n\u201cThis is particularly helpful when new students arrive during the school year with individualized education programs,\u201d Rossi said.\n\nIf the district opts to purse a contract with a private provider, the contract would run from July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017, with a provision for two one-year terms or one two-year term, according to the RFP.\n\n\u201cAn approved vendor would be someone who verifies that they can and will provide quality individuals to work with or in support of our children at a competitive price,\u201d Rossi said, adding \u201call staffing vendor personnel must undergo a N.J. Department of Education background check.\u201d\n\nDeborah M.
