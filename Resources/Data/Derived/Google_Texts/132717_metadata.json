The platform, using proprietary technology, produces a list of clinics serving low-income patients and allows the donor facilities to select recipients. SIRUM handles the rest of the process, from producing labels and shipping boxes to tracking donations.\n\nDrug donations go directly to pharmacies at participating clinics. SIRUM, housed at the Haas Center for Public Service at Stanford University, does not directly handle any of the medications.\n\nSo far, Santa Clara Valley Medical Center is the only recipient of unused medications through SIRUM\u2019s program, but donations come from facilities across the state.\n\nIn Northern California, donors include Lincoln Glen Skilled Nursing Facility, Mt. Pleasant Nursing Center and Amberwood Gardens in San Jose; Villa Siena in Mountain View; Sunny View Manor in Cupertino; and Greenhills Manor in Campbell.\n\nThe number of donor organizations has grown from seven in 2010 to 150 in 2013. SIRUM anticipates adding 150 more California donors by the end of 2014.\n\nSIRUM works with skilled nursing facilities, assisted living and other health care services in the state to increase the number of donors and recipients. Its platform uses a peer-to-peer model with the goal of making the system easier to replicate in other counties and states.\n\nTo date, SIRUM has administered the redistribution of 444,380 units of medicine worth about $1.5 million wholesale.\n\nAlthough Williams said the idea of drug donation is not a new one, SIRUM has brought it to a new level. \u201cWe help remove barriers for those who cannot afford their medications because they may fall on and off insurance coverage and eliminate details complicating efforts by donors,\u201d she said.\n\nThe high cost of drugs hits low-income and uninsured Americans the hardest, resulting in nearly 25% of uninsured people not taking their prescription drugs as recommended in 2011, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This population was twice as likely as wealthier Americans to skip medications in order to save money.\n\nIn 2003, 23%, or 39 million people, did not fill their prescriptions. In 2012, those numbers jumped to 27%, or 50 million people, according to the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s 2012 biennial health insurance survey.\n\nAccording to an estimate by Capital Returns, a national firm that provides financial services to pharmaceutical companies, $5 billion worth of prescription drugs go to waste every year in the U.S. Some of those drugs are expired and destroyed, but a significant amount is usable if the right policies and procedures are in place, according to SIRUM officials.\n\nState Legislation Paved Way\n\nA group of Stanford University medical school students paved the way toward drug donation by proposing a change in California law through a \u201cThere Oughta Be a Law\u201d contest sponsored by then state Sen. Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto), now a Santa Clara County supervisor.\n\nThe result was SB 798. It was signed into law in 2005, allowing \u201ccounties to recover unused prescription medications from skilled nursing facilities, pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers and distribute them without charge to people of modest means who need the medications.\u201d The law is part of the state\u2019s Good Samaritan legislation.\n\nThe law, however, has some caveats: Donated drugs must be unexpired, collected and maintained under the authority of a licensed pharmacist, stored properly and received and maintained in their unopened, tamper-proof packaging. Controlled substances are not allowed.\n\nA second bill, SB 1329, also authored by Simitian, became law in 2012, further expanding drug donation. It eliminates county ordinances regulating drug donations, expands distribution to include not-for-profit clinics in addition to pharmacies and allows licensed physicians \u2014 not just pharmacists \u2014 to collect and maintain medications. SIRUM\u2019s Williams said some regulations in the past had produced hurdles for the program.\n\nSIRUM is preparing to take full advantage of the changes in the new law this year.\n\nThe Lucky Recipient\n\nSanta Clara Valley Medical Center tried its own hand in developing a medication donation program in 2006 without much success. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d said Mymy Phu, supervising pharmacist at the medical center, \u201cthere was not enough manpower to collect the medications.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Santa Clara found its savior in SIRUM.\n\n\u201cAs a county hospital, we are able to provide indigent patients who may be uninsured with medications that would otherwise be wasted. Our patients pay nothing for these drugs. There is a great need to provide this kind of pharmaceutical opportunity,\u201d Phu said.\n\nPrior to hooking up with SIRUM, the medical center relied primarily on taxpayer dollars to secure prescription medicines for patients who could not afford them.\n\n\u201cSIRUM has eliminated inefficiencies and improved communication between donors and our organization, and digitized Santa Clara County\u2019s online formulary to coordinate drugs with potential donors,\u201d she said.\n\nQuelan To, public health pharmacist at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, said the program prevents patients from seeking help from the emergency or acute care departments because medications are usually available when they need them.\n\nAlthough both Phu and To anticipate that the Affordable Care Act will provide some kind of insurance for their low-income patients, free drugs would still be available.\n\n\u201cSIRUM is another source of health services for those who may still remain without insurance even though the ACA has the potential to provide coverage for many of the them,\u201d Williams said.\n\nChallenges of Accepting Drug Donations\n\nPhu said that while the program is operating efficiently, the medical center lacks sufficient storage for donated drugs, along with enough people to manage the extra work demanded by the program.\n\nTo cited another challenge: Regulation mandates that donated medications must be kept in their original packaging until they are dispensed. About 90% of the donated medications arrive in blister cards, which necessitate taking each pill out of the pack, recounting the pills and repackaging them in a container before dispensing \u2014 a time-consuming process for pharmacists and patients.\n\n\u201cThere is also more potential for error because we are rushing to get the medications ready for patients,\u201d To said.\n\nFinally, she said it could be a logistical nightmare when the medical center receives more drugs than it can use and wants to send them to a sister pharmacy or an affiliate mental health center. \u201cThese facilities are seen as separate entities so that each transaction must be documented individually,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the first half of 2013, Santa Clara Valley Medical Center received the equivalent of about $240,000 worth of medications, based on the average wholesale price.\n\nOne of the Good Samaritans\n\nRebecca Turner, nursing administrator of the Lincoln Glen Skilled Nursing Facility in San Jose, said her facility doesn\u2019t donate a lot of drugs, but in total has given more than $10,000 worth of medicine and has assisted an estimated 150 patients in receiving one month of free drugs. Based on requests from Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, Lincoln Glen donates primarily respiratory, cardiovascular and behavioral health medicines on a quarterly basis.\n\nStarting participation in SIRUM\u2019s program in July 2010, it was the first skilled nursing facility in the state to donate its unused medicine to Santa Clara.\n\nDeane Kirchner, director of nursing at Lincoln Glen, said most of the unused drugs come from changes in prescriptions, discontinuation of drug treatment, changes in drug doses, discharged patients and residents who have passed away.\n\nLincoln Glen added a tracking tool to its administrative system to accommodate the program.\n\nSIRUM Backers\n\n\u201cSIRUM offers a novel solution to address the fact that many unused drugs are thrown away or flushed down the toilet while millions of uninsured Americans are denied access to appropriate care,\u201d said Brian Quinn, senior program officer and team director of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\u2019s Pioneer Portfolio.\n\nCalifornia HealthCare Foundation, which publishes California Healthline, and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation provided funding to SIRUM. CHCF has contributed nearly $350,000 since January 2012, and RWJF made a two-year grant of $409,430 in November 2012.\n\n\u201cThe grant is to help SIRUM grow its operations in California, explore the program\u2019s feasibility in other states and pilot a similar program in at least one state,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nQuinn said the SIRUM program is on the right track to alleviating the problem of wasted, unused drugs, but some wrinkles still need to be ironed out:\n\nUnderstanding state regulations;\n\nEnsuring that similar programs in other states conform to their laws related to drug donation;\n\nIncreasing the number of donors and recipients;\n\nStreamlining donation transactions through information technology; and\n\nMaking potential participants aware of the opportunity to donate.\n\n\u201cThe model is intuitively appealing and shouldn\u2019t take much to convince facilities to give or receive medications,\u201d he said. \u201cSIRUM\u2019s approach is game-changing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>SIRUM -- a Stanford-bred program that allows unused medications at hospitals and nursing homes to be donated to safety-net clinics -- hopes to expand within California and serve as a model for other states.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "SIRUM \u2014 a Stanford-bred program that allows unused medications at hospitals and nursing homes to be donated to safety-net clinics \u2014 hopes to expand within California and serve as a mode\u2026", "title": "Rx Drug Donation System Hopes To Grow", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/rx-drug-donation-system-hopes-to-grow/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2013-10-10T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-10T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Lucky RecipientSanta Clara Valley Medical Center tried its own hand in developing a medication donation program in 2006 without much success.\nAlthough Williams said the idea of drug donation is not a new one, SIRUM has brought it to a new level.\nSupporting Initiatives to Redistribute Unused Medicine \u2014 an online community matching drug donations with low-income health clinics whose patients could benefit from the medications \u2014 helped put California on the drug donation map.\nSo far, Santa Clara Valley Medical Center is the only recipient of unused medications through SIRUM\u2019s program, but donations come from facilities across the state.\nA second bill, SB 1329, also authored by Simitian, became law in 2012, further expanding drug donation."}
