The East Tennessee rally was held a little more than two months before the March 1 \u201cSEC primary.\u201d\n\nA first-term Texas senator, Cruz said he plans to rescind every unconstitutional executive order, ask the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate Planned Parenthood, end the persecution of religious liberties, and \u201crip to shreds\u201d the Iranian nuclear deal, which he called \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d\n\nCruz also said the U.S. Department of Education should be abolished, and welfare benefits should end for people who are in the country illegally. He pledged to protect the constitutional right to keep and bear arms, called for killing the Environmental Protection Agency, and jokingly compared regulators to locusts, with a difference being that pesticides can be used to control locusts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said he would make health care affordable and portable but keep government out of it.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal every word of Obamacare,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nIf he is president, Cruz said, \u201cWe will utterly destroy ISIS,\u201d the terrorist group that controls parts of Iraq and Syria and has inspired attacks overseas, including in Paris and San Bernardino, California.\n\n\u201cWe will defeat radical Islam,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nHe said he would move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\n\nCruz also said his administration would pass a single flat tax.\n\n\u201cWhen we do that, we should abolish the IRS,\u201d he said. Then, he suggested the 90,000 IRS employees could be put to work in another cause, helping to control the United States-Mexican border.\n\n\u201cWe need to padlock that door (IRS offices), take all 90,000, and put them down on the southern border,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said a nuclear Iran is the single greatest threat to the United States.\n\nSpeaking to residents at the Farragut gym, Cruz said Tennessee can help ensure the next president is a \u201creal, proven conservative.\u201d\n\nHe paraphrased from the New York Times, saying the newspaper said he couldn\u2019t win after he announced his campaign because the establishment despises him. But Cruz doesn\u2019t seem bothered by the possibility that \u201cthe establishment\u201d might not like him.\n\n\u201cI thought that was the whole point,\u201d Cruz said, echoing a line that\u2019s also shown up in a video ad created by a super PAC supporting him.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Cruz is one of the most disliked men in Washington among his fellow senators, including Republicans. But the newspaper said Cruz relishes his reputation as the bad boy of the Senate, where he has \u201cdragged his party into a government-shuttering budget fight and defied party leaders ever since arriving on Capitol Hill in 2013.\u201d He has also accused Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, of lying about a legislative matter.\n\nThere appears to be more disdain for the political establishment among the GOP electorate this campaign season, and that seems to have helped so-called outsider or anti-establishment candidates like Cruz, Donald Trump, and, briefly, Ben Carson. But some well-known Republicans such as former Senator Bob Dole, the GOP\u2019s 1996 presidential nominee, have expressed reluctance to support or vote for Cruz, and Senator John McCain, the 2008 GOP candidate, called Cruz and his allies \u201cwacko birds\u201d in 2013.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was none of that sentiment at the campaign rally in Farragut on Tuesday, when Cruz said, borrowing a phrase once used by former President Ronald Reagan to describe the United States, \u201cIf we stand as one, as we the people, we can restore that shining city on the hill that is America.\u201d\n\nThree people who attended the speech said they liked what Cruz said, agreed with him, or they praised him for what they consider his truthfulness and constitutional principles.\n\n\u201cGod bless a man who speaks the truth and upholds the Constitution of the United States,\u201d said Bryan Davis of Farragut. \u201cThat\u2019s Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought it was great,\u201d said Betsy Grace, an Oak Ridge resident. \u201cEverything I heard I agreed with.\u201d\n\nShe used to think Cruz was \u201ca troublemaker,\u201d Grace said, until she read his book.\n\nOne woman who asked not to be identified because she is a school system employee called Cruz a religious man who has a vision for the country.\n\nCruz is among a number of Republican candidates who have visited East Tennessee. Others include Carson, Trump, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich. Trump was reported to have more than twice as many people at his rally\u2014more than 5,000\u2014as Cruz did at his.\n\nCruz still trails Trump in national polls, but he leads in some polls in Iowa, where voting for party nominees starts with the February 1 caucuses, followed by the New Hampshire primaries on February 9.\n\nMore information will be added as it becomes available.\n\nCopyright 2015 Oak Ridge Today.
