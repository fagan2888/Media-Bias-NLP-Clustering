Alone some 20,000 park services employees were furloughed.\n\nYesterday\u2019s New York agreement will allow funding for the Statue of Liberty for six days, beginning tomorrow through October 17, with the state donating $369,300 to keep it running.\n\nArizona has agreed to fund the Grand Canyon, visited by millions of tourists from all over the world every year, for seven days beginning tomorrow, at a cost of $651,000.\n\nColorado\u2019s Rocky Mountain National Park will be funded for 10 days at a cost of $362,700, and eight national parks and monuments in Utah will reopen also for 10 days at a cost of $1.666 million to the western US state.\n\nMount Rushmore\n\nSouth Dakota governor Dennis Daugaard hailed the deal to reopen Mount Rushmore, a famous mountain face carved with four enormous busts of US presidents.\n\n\u201cVisitors from around the world come to the Black Hills to see Mount Rushmore, and I\u2019m pleased that our nation\u2019s shrine to democracy will be reopened,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the states will be reimbursed by federal authorities when the shutdown ends. The funding is considered a donation, not a loan, and it would require an act of Congress to authorize any type of reimbursement, according to an official source.\n\n\u201cWe want to reopen all of our national parks as quickly possible for everyone to enjoy and call on Congress to pass a clean continuing resolution to open the government,\u201d said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell in a statement.\n\nYosemite and Alcatraz\n\nBut California, America\u2019s most populous state and home to world-famous federally-run tourist attractions including Yosemite and the Alcatraz Island prison, has indicated it is too cash-strapped.\n\n\u201cEven if the state were to front general funds for this \u2026 the executive branch cannot unilaterally guarantee that the state would be reimbursed,\u201d a spokesman for the state\u2019s department of finance told the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nThe US Travel Association sent a letter to the White House and Congress on yesterday, urging them to work harder to resolve the budget standoff.\n\n\u201cThe government shutdown is throttling America\u2019s travel sector, which, until now, has been one of the principal drivers of US economic recovery,\u201d said its president, Roger Dow.\n\n\u201cEvery day the government remains closed compounds the very real consequences,\u201d he added.\n\n- \u00a9 AFP 2013.\n\nRead: 9 of the most emotional images from the US Government shutdown>\n\nRead: Obama meets with Republicans in bid to end crisis>", "article_metadata": {"description": "US states will temporarily pay the running costs of world-famous landmarks.", "application-name": "TheJournal", "author": "AFP", "og": {"site_name": "TheJournal.ie", "description": "US states will temporarily pay the running costs of world-famous landmarks.", "title": "Statue of Liberty and Grand Canyon to reopen", "url": "http://www.thejournal.ie/parks-us-open-1126869-Oct2013/", "image": "http://img2.thejournal.ie/article/1126869/river/?height=400&version=1126874", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "US states will temporarily pay the running costs of world-famous landmarks.", "title": "Statue of Liberty and Grand Canyon to reopen", "url": "http://www.thejournal.ie/parks-us-open-1126869-Oct2013/", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "jrnl://article/1126869/?app=Twitter&callback=twitter%3A%2F%2F", "iphone": "jrnl://article/1126869/?app=Twitter&callback=twitter%3A%2F%2F", "googleplay": "jrnl://article/1126869/?app=twitter"}, "name": {"ipad": "TheJournal.ie", "iphone": "TheJournal.ie", "googleplay": "TheJournal.ie"}, "id": {"ipad": 409359491, "iphone": 409359491, "googleplay": "com.distilledmedia.thejournal"}}, "site": "@thejournal_ie", "image": "http://img2.thejournal.ie/article/1126869/listing?version=1126874&width=590", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "jrnl://article/1126869?source=fbal", "app_name": "TheJournal.ie", "package": "com.distilledmedia.thejournal"}, "ios": {"url": "jrnl://article/1126869", "app_name": "TheJournal.ie", "app_store_id": 409359491}}, "msapplication-tooltip": "TheJournal.ie - Read, Share and Shape the news", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=409359491, app-argument=http://www.thejournal.ie/parks-us-open-1126869-Oct2013/", "fb": {"app_id": 116141121768215, "pages": 137576076262825}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.thejournal.ie/", "googlebot-news": "noindex", "keywords": "America, Barack Obama, democrats, Government, Grand Canyon, Healthcare, Obamacare, Republicans, Shutdown, Statue of Liberty, United States", "article": {"post_date": "2013-10-12T19:15:22+0100", "post_modified": "2013-10-12T19:04:38+0100", "author": "http://www.thejournal.ie/author/afp/"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Irish News;action-uri=http://www.thejournal.ie/irish/;icon-uri=http://b0.thejournal.ie/desktop/i/thejournal/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "America, Barack Obama, democrats, Government, Grand Canyon, Healthcare, Obamacare, Republicans, Shutdown, Statue of Liberty"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11e1\"", "article_summary": "Arizona governor Jan Brewer hailed the deal to reopen the Grand Canyon ahead of a three-day public holiday weekend.\n\u201cWith a long weekend in front of us, I am thrilled Grand Canyon will be open and fully operational,\u201d she said.\nTHE STATUE OF Liberty and the Grand Canyon are to reopen despite the US government shutdown, with US states temporarily paying the running costs of world-famous landmarks shuttered by the stand-off.\nMount Rushmore, Rocky Mountain National Park and eight federal sites in Utah will also reopen starting this weekend, officials said, although other world-famous destinations including Yosemite National Park and Alcatraz prison remain closed.\nArizona has agreed to fund the Grand Canyon, visited by millions of tourists from all over the world every year, for seven days beginning tomorrow, at a cost of $651,000."}
