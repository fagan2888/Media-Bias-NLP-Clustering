But there\u2019s a potential danger for Republicans lurking in the depths of the $1.1 trillion omnibus appropriation package that sailed through both houses: Obamacare.\n\nWhile the GOP managed to win some concessions on the Affordable Care Act, conservatives see the spending bill as \u201cfunding Obamacare,\u201d as RedState wrote. It\u2019s basically the same thing that Ted Cruz and other conservatives blocked a few months ago, forcing a government shutdown, and Cruz tried again to rally support for blocking the spending bill.\n\nTea-party and conservative groups railed against the bill, while Heritage Action warned lawmakers to vote against the package, saying that \u201cby continuing to fund implementation of Obamacare, the omnibus bill would continue to entangle taxpayer dollars in abortion coverage.\u201d The bill passed, of course, thanks in part to the lesson of October.\n\nThe same thing that Republicans shut the government down because they did not want the ACA funded. They stomped, screamed, faux filibustered, and raised millions of dollars. In the end, they did exactly what they said they wouldn\u2019t do by funding the ACA. The words of congressional Republicans say repeal and kill Obamacare, but their actions are an admission of defeat.\n\nElected Republicans and GOP candidates now use Obamacare much like they used to use abortion and same sex marriage. They fearmonger on the ACA to get the base to come out and vote on Election Day. The political reality is that the ACA isn\u2019t going anywhere. Republicans funded it in 2014. They will vote to fund it again in 2015. Since they won\u2019t want to risk a government shutdown during a presidential election year, they will fund it again in 2016.\n\nRepublicans lost, but they are still trying to fool their voters into believing that they can kill the ACA. The truth is that they will continue to vote to fund the ACA, because they are terrified of the political fallout from another government shutdown. Republicans will blow a lot of hot air about the \u201cevils of Obamacare\u201d from now until November, but they lost.\n\nThey know they lost, and that\u2019s why Republicans will continue to try to quietly vote to fund the very law that they rage against for years to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The dirty little secret that congressional Republicans are carrying around with them is that while they are campaigning on killing the ACA, they quietly threw up the white flag and voted to fund Obamacare before they left town.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The dirty little secret that congressional Republicans are carrying around with them is that while they are campaigning on killing the ACA, they quietly threw up the white flag and voted to fund Obamacare before they left town.", "title": "Republicans Have Admitted Defeat On The ACA By Voting to Fund Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/01/20/republicans-admitted-defeat-aca-voting-fund-obamacare.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/boehner-mcconnell-sad.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-20T12:05:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,ACA,budget bill,Obamacare,republicans vote to fund the aca,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-01-20T12:05:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-20T12:05:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA, budget bill, Obamacare, republicans vote to fund the aca"}, "article_summary": "While the GOP managed to win some concessions on the Affordable Care Act, conservatives see the spending bill as \u201cfunding Obamacare,\u201d as RedState wrote.\nThe words of congressional Republicans say repeal and kill Obamacare, but their actions are an admission of defeat.\nRepublicans will blow a lot of hot air about the \u201cevils of Obamacare\u201d from now until November, but they lost.\nThe truth is that they will continue to vote to fund the ACA, because they are terrified of the political fallout from another government shutdown.\nThe dirty little secret that congressional Republicans are carrying around with them is that while they are campaigning on killing the ACA, they quietly threw up the white flag and voted to fund Obamacare before they left town."}
