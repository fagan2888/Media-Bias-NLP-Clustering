Fitness DVDs reportedly earn $264 million a year, yet only three are dedicated to plus size women. Louise Green, founder of Body Exchange Lifestyles and fitness ambassador to the plus size community, knows it’s possible for women and men to be an athlete at any size — so she’ll bridge this gap herself.

Let’s take a step back: Green founded Body Exchange in 2008 after she realized through her personal journey that the needs of the plus size community weren’t being met by many service providers. This has to do with the idea people can’t be both fit and obese. However, some studies would disagree.

A study published in the European Heart Journal found overweight and obese people were at no greater risk for developing or dying from heart disease or cancer than normal weight people, as long was they were considered medically fit. Upworthy cited additional research that found walking an average of 30 minutes a day for five days a week qualifies a person as fit.

But don’t expect Green’s forthcoming Body Exchange Home Connection DVD series to be, well, a series of walking workouts. While this is an effective form of exercise, Green firmly believes fitness and adventure are the vehicle to a healthy, fulfilled lifestyle. And to make sure every person can benefit from the DVD, it starts off in a sitting position. Gradually, as the viewer feels more comfortable, they can progress to standing and increasing their range of motion.

“This isn’t just a fitness video,” Green said. “This is a fitness revolution.”
