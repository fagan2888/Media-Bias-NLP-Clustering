State Rep. Pat McElraft deserves credit for expressing her intent to introduce legislation that would legalize the use of a specific kind of marijuana oil that has shown promise in treating an especially horrific illness that afflicts children. The Republican lawmaker from Carteret County got emotional yesterday when she discussed the matter with WRAL’s Bruce Mildwurf. This is from Mildwurf’s online story:

“We’ve got to do this for them. It’s the only hope they have,” McElraft said as she choked back tears.

A good next step would be for McElraft and her colleagues to listen to the heartbreaking stories of any number of adults who have also found blessed relief from numerous forms of intense pain and suffering through the use of medical marijuana and to then think about addressing their needs as well.

Are there problems with marijuana use (in both its medicinal and recreational forms)? Sure. Do people abuse marijuana? Absolutely. Is abuse by kids an especially worrisome phenomenon? No doubt.

But as many other states and nations have already demonstrated, the notion that all people who could benefit from marijuana (and even just enjoy it responsibly) should be denied access because of the public health problems the substance causes for some people is seriously and destructively misguided. Let’s hope this obvious truth continues to dawn on Rep. McElraft and her colleagues as they advance the eminently logical proposal to help sick kids.
