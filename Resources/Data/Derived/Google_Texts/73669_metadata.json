Seven of their victories have been decided with fourth-quarter comebacks or game-winning drives.\n\nDenver\u2019s top-ranked defense has been relied upon throughout not only to set up game-winning drives but also to create them. But the offense \u2014 despite its inconsistency and myriad changes to its linemen and quarterbacks \u2014 has played its part in sealing victories late.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had all these tight games. It\u2019s time for us to blow out somebody,\u201d said all-pro outside linebacker Von Miller. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt like plays are going to happen. We need to make a play and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. This year, it\u2019s just been happening.\u201d\n\nHere is a look back at those seven thrilling finishes.\n\nWeek 2, at Kansas City \u2014 Sept. 17, 2015: With the score 24-24 and 35 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Broncos inside linebacker Brandon Marshall punched the ball loose and cornerback Bradley Roby quickly scooped it up, sprinting 21 yards to the end zone for a 31-24 victory.\n\nWeek 4, vs. Minnesota \u2014 Oct. 4, 2015: The Vikings erased a 10-point deficit in the second half to tie the score at 20. But with about five minutes left in the fourth quarter, Peyton Manning responded by engineering a nine-play, 55-yard drive that ended with a 39-yard field goal. A forced fumble and recovery by Denver sealed a 23-20 win.\n\nWeek 6, at Cleveland \u2014 Oct. 18, 2015: A highlight-reel, 75-yard touchdown catch by Emmanuel Sanders midway through the fourth quarter was followed by a Cleveland field goal to tie it up. But a 34-yard field goal by Brandon McManus capped 13-play, 72-yard drive in overtime for the 26-23 win.\n\nWeek 12, vs. New England \u2014 Nov. 29, 2015: With Brock Osweiler steering the ship, the Broncos racked up 433 total yards while holding the Patriots to 39 yards rushing. But it took an extra period and a 48-yard touchdown run up the left sideline by C.J. Anderson for Denver to hand New England its first loss of the season, 30-24.\n\nWeek 16, vs. Cincinnati \u2014 Dec. 28, 2015: A 39-yard touchdown run by Anderson in the fourth quarter gave the Broncos their first lead, 17-14. But that was followed by a Bengals field goal that sent the game to overtime. McManus\u2019 37-yard field goal capped a 14-play, 61-yard Denver drive, and DeMarcus Ware followed with a fumble recovery to close out a 20-17 win.\n\nWeek 17, vs. San Diego \u2014 Jan. 3, 2016: Manning returned from a foot injury in the second half to steady the Broncos\u2019 offense, but San Diego regained control at 20-17 with about 13 minutes left in the fourth quarter. McManus tied it with a field goal, then safety Shiloh Keo intercepted a pass to set up a game-winning, 23-yard touchdown run by Ronnie Hillman. Broncos 27, Chargers 20.\n\nAFC divisional playoff, vs. Pittsburgh \u2014 Jan. 17, 2016: The Broncos trailed 13-12 to start the fourth quarter, but a forced fumble by Ware and recovery by Roby set up a go-ahead, 1-yard touchdown run by Anderson with three minutes remaining. McManus sealed Denver\u2019s 23-16 win with a field goal.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Seven of Broncos\u2019 13 wins this season have been heart-stopping, fourth-quarter comebacks", "title": "Seven of Broncos\u2019 13 wins this season have been heart-stopping, fourth-quarter comebacks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/23/seven-of-broncos-13-wins-this-season-have-been-heart-stopping-fourth-quarter-comebacks/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160123__SP17STEELERSBRONCOS_JA24060xp1-5.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160123__SP17STEELERSBRONCOS_JA24060xp1-5.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-23T14:26:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T01:30:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But it took an extra period and a 48-yard touchdown run up the left sideline by C.J.\nBut that was followed by a Bengals field goal that sent the game to overtime.\nMcManus\u2019 37-yard field goal capped a 14-play, 61-yard Denver drive, and DeMarcus Ware followed with a fumble recovery to close out a 20-17 win.\nBut a 34-yard field goal by Brandon McManus capped 13-play, 72-yard drive in overtime for the 26-23 win.\nWeek 16, vs. Cincinnati \u2014 Dec. 28, 2015: A 39-yard touchdown run by Anderson in the fourth quarter gave the Broncos their first lead, 17-14."}
