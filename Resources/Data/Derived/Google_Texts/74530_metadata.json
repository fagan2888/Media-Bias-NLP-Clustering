I am in full agreement that failing to raise the debt ceiling would deliver a potentially catastrophic, self-inflicted wound to our nation\u2014a position, I happily note, that some of our counterparts at the American Enterprise Institute are now powerfully espousing.\n\nBut responding to this potential calamity by means of a declaration of emergency plus an executive order would be misguided and would do needless violence to our Constitutional order. Declarations of emergency have indeed played a prominent role in our nation\u2019s history, especially in the post-war era. But the President has no straightforward \u201cright\u201d to make such declarations. Nearly all recent declarations of emergency have been made pursuant to emergency Presidential powers conferred by statute\u2014certainly different from the situation with the debt ceiling, which is a law specifically designed to constrain the executive branch\u2019s borrowing decisions and which includes no mechanism for emergency raises dictated by the President.\n\nThe Challenges of an Executive Order\n\nEven supposing that declaring an emergency would be appropriate, issuing an executive order would be the wrong way to proceed. Executive orders are not meant to unilaterally change existing laws, but rather to determine their execution consistent with statutory language. That doesn\u2019t mean executive orders are trivial, as matters of great importance rest on how a statute is carried out and how ambiguous provisions are resolved. But it does mean that an executive order cannot simply say that a clear statutory command is null and void, emergency or not. I do not know of a single case in which an executive order was used to wipe a duly passed statute from the books. There is good reason for this: if the President could use executive orders in this way, it would mean the whole edifice of statutory law would be rendered uncertain during emergencies. Wherever the President felt it was important to depart from the clear commands of the law, he would simply change them. If the rule of law means anything, it is that our legal code cannot be made subject to the whim of one person in this way. If extra authority is needed, see the justly famous Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 638 (Jackson, J., concurring opinion) (\u201cWhen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter. \u201c).\n\nIt should be noted that the idea that President Obama could simply \u201cinvoke the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d to nullify the debt ceiling is troubling for all of the same reasons. As political scientist Greg Weiner points out, the fact that the Fourteenth Amendment clearly says that the nation\u2019s debt \u201cshall not be questioned\u201d does not mean \u201cthe President is somehow unilaterally empowered to raise the revenue needed to pay it.\u201d Indeed, were the President to now interpret the Constitution this way, he would be implying that Congress has no legitimate Constitutional say about the nation\u2019s debt issuance (which would repudiate 224 years of Constitutional practice). Sure, Jackman thinks it notable that \u201cthe Constitution does not clearly state that the President cannot raise the debt ceiling in times of crisis,\u201d but Article I, Section 8, gives the power \u201cTo borrow money on the credit of the United States\u201d to Congress quite clearly.\n\nA Different Solution\n\nSo what should the President do if he finds himself hard up against the statutory debt limit? This is a horribly difficult question, and anyone who pretends otherwise is wrongly making light of what would be a serious constitutional crisis. The President and Treasury Secretary would be wise to delay this moment as long as possible, inventing some new \u201cextra-extraordinary measures\u201d before dealing with the issue head-on. But if there are really no other options, then there is a strong case to be made that the President should seriously consider breaking the law embodied by the debt ceiling without pretending that his doing so is legal, as our Brookings colleague Henry Aaron argued.\n\nWait, isn\u2019t that just what Jackman recommended? I believe it is different in a crucial way. It is one thing for the President to say that in order to protect the country, he has been forced to break the law and potentially face the consequences for doing so. It is entirely another thing for the President to say that he can unilaterally rewrite the law so that his action is perfectly legal.\n\nIf the President were really hard up against the debt ceiling, one can plausibly argue that some law would have to be broken, and law professors Neil Buchanan and Michael Dorf have ably argued that breaking the debt ceiling statute would be the least-bad option. But that argument is not bulletproof, and in any case the President\u2019s making it would at best give shape to what would surely be a raucous and angry national debate including calls for his impeachment, rather than somehow ending the confrontation. The President\u2019s strongest defense would be that he is a conscientious and law-abiding executive, whose Constitutionally-prescribed duty to \u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed\u201d has become literally impossible. He should forthrightly accept political responsibility for choosing the best course available, submitting his action to Congress and to the American people to await their political judgment. That framing would be infinitely more compelling than saying that, given a national emergency, he possessed the unilateral power to bend existing statutes to his will, clear constraining text notwithstanding.\n\nHowever you see these difficult issues, two points bear repeating: as a first-order matter of policy, we would be better off without a debt ceiling. Though Congress may be constitutionally entitled to cap our national borrowing, or even micro-manage it, that does not make it wise for it to do so. We would be better off if Congress made fiscal decisions exclusively in the budget process, which we can think about ways of improving. Finally, most importantly, none of this is worth a financial or constitutional crisis, period. Our elected officials can, should, must find a way to keep things from coming to the point where we plumb the limits of executive branch authority. Let us hope they make all of this discussion moot, and quick.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the US approaches the debt ceiling, Phil Wallach argues that an executive order eliminating the debt ceiling is an unwise approach.
