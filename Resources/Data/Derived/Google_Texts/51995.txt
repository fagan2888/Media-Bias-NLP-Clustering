An emergency call about a stuck zipper takes the top prize this week in the Washington County, Oregon, dispatch agency’s “You called 9-1-1 for that?!” campaign.

A man called 9-1-1 because the zipper was stuck on his wife’s coat and she could not get it off. The man told the dispatcher he didn’t want to ruin the coat and needed help.

Listen to the 9-1-1 call:

OPERATOR: 9-1-1 police, fire and medical.



CALLER: Yeah we got a problem here. My wife is struggling in her jacket and can’t get it off. I want 9-1-1 here immediately.



OPERATOR: Is she not breathing?



CALLER: She’s alright, she just can’t get her [expletive] jacket off.

Mark Chandler, a spokesman for the dispatch center, said the fire department responded and removed the jacket without damaging it.

Each week, the agency posts the “most ridiculous use of 9-1-1″ winner on the their Facebook page and Twitter account. The campaign’s goal is to educate people on the proper use of the emergency service, according to the Oregonian newspaper.

The callers’ voices are electronically distorted to conceal their identities.
