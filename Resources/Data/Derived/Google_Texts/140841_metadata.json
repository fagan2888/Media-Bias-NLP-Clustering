And now given swarms of politically connected activists, parents also have something to fear with the starting of school: \u201cprogressive\u201d agendas overrunning academic curriculums.\n\nSchools are expected to be institutions for teaching math, science, reading and writing. But activists see them as another venue to peddle their platforms on labor unions, animal liberation, vegan diets and leftist environmental policy.\n\nLast month, Big Labor had a huge win. After several failed attempts, Connecticut unions pushed a bill through the state\u2019s legislature that directs public schools to provide curriculum on labor history and law, organized labor and collective bargaining \u2014 to be taught by unionized teachers, of course.\n\nThe bill likely passed due to its phony provision to include \u201cthe history of economics of free market capitalism and entrepreneurialism.\u201d Despite this feigned attempt at balance, the law will no doubt produce corrupted curriculum. Evidence comes from Delaware, where a task force made entirely of labor bosses ensures the \u201cfair and balanced instruction\u201d of mandated union propaganda.\n\nBut the king of labor education is still California. In 2012, the Golden State, which has mandated labor education in public schools for more than a decade, expanded their existing week of labor education \u2014 the entire month of May is now \u201cLabor History Month.\u201d\n\nThere is no limit to the type of fringe propaganda that can creep into kids\u2019 heads and hands. For those familiar with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals\u2019 (PETA) stripper stunts, it should come as no surprise that the material provided for kids often contains graphically violent, sexual and just plain grotesque. One comic book is titled, \u201cYour Mommy Kills Animals.\u201d\n\nIn protest of a dairy cow visiting an elementary school last year, PETA handed out an innocently titled comic, \u201cA Cow\u2019s Life.\u201d Inside, horrified children and parents discovered more than just a cartoon cow. The propaganda pamphlet contained graphic photographs of infected udders and bulls being de-horned. The Los Angeles Daily News reported one livid mother\u2019s thoughts on the matter, \u201cChildren are off-limits . This sort of thing is really to terrify you, not to teach.\u201d\n\nAnother extremist group, the misnamed Humane Society of the United States \u2014 not to be confused with your local animal shelter \u2014 has a more subtle approach to advance its vegan agenda. For years, the organization has pushed the \u201cMeatless Monday\u201d campaign to remove meat from school lunches once a week. Dozens of cities and school districts have fallen prey to the movement. Vegan activists flak the meatless movement as \u201chealthy,\u201d but there is nothing healthy about foregoing the hard-to-replace protein, zinc and iron found in meat. (When school districts banned candy and cupcakes, students started a black market. Chicken nuggets may be next).\n\nOn the environmental front, many schools are being infiltrated with solar and wind education programs that stress the necessity of these energy sources. One program in Illinois even installs insignificant, yet visible, wind turbines and solar panels at schools around the state. What\u2019s not taught to kids in these programs? How these \u201csustainable\u201d energy sources will reduce their parents\u2019 ability to pay for gas and groceries owing to sky-high electric bills. A recent study found that wind energy is three times more expensive than coal and four times more expensive than nuclear power.\n\nWe all want clean air and water for our children and grandchildren, but environmentalists\u2019 energy agendas compromise the future of affordable, reliable energy \u2014 and these activists are willing to induce hysteria to achieve their visions.\n\nWhatever the hype is about, it is clear liberal activists are not worried about the truth. They know thinking adults are an obstacle to many of their policies. Kids who don\u2019t know any better? A much easier audience to play to.\n\n\u2022 Rick Berman is president of Berman and Co., a Washington public affairs firm.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Like a swarm of bees, back-to-school advertisements sting vacationing kids with the reminder that the first day of school is around the corner.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Like a swarm of bees, back-to-school advertisements sting vacationing kids with the reminder that the first day of school is around the corner.", "title": "RICK BERMAN: A liberal dose of propaganda in schools", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/24/rick-berman-a-liberal-dose-of-propaganda-in-school/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/24/8_242015_b3-berm-bee-chalkbo8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/24/8_242015_b3-berm-bee-chalkbo8201.jpg", "description": "Like a swarm of bees, back-to-school advertisements sting vacationing kids with the reminder that the first day of school is around the corner.", "card": "summary", "title": "RICK BERMAN: A liberal dose of propaganda in schools"}, "Author": "Rick Berman", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Education"}, "article_summary": "A recent study found that wind energy is three times more expensive than coal and four times more expensive than nuclear power.\nVegan activists flak the meatless movement as \u201chealthy,\u201d but there is nothing healthy about foregoing the hard-to-replace protein, zinc and iron found in meat.\nOn the environmental front, many schools are being infiltrated with solar and wind education programs that stress the necessity of these energy sources.\nBut the king of labor education is still California.\n\u2022 Rick Berman is president of Berman and Co., a Washington public affairs firm."}
