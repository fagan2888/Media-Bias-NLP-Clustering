The clinic operators say that \u201cthe mission is complete\u201d now that more people have gained coverage under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cBecause people are qualifying for insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, our free medical clinic will not be needed anymore,\u201d clinic director Stacey Bowser told the Mena Star, a local outlet that covers Polk County. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from seeing around 300 people a month on a regular basis, but as people were enrolling in Obamacare, the numbers we were seeing have dropped.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Polk County Pulse, the faith-based clinic was a staple in the community for years. About 21 percent of the county\u2019s residents are living in poverty, and Ninth Street Ministries Clinic worked to serve \u201cpeople who have no insurance or do not have the means to acquire and maintain medical care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was such a need for many years that we would have people coming through the medical clinic from the time the doors opened early in the morning all the way until 4:00 in the afternoon,\u201d Bowser said. But over the past several months, that changed \u2014 and the number of patients in need has dwindled to next to nothing. Only about 80 people came through the clinic in February. By March, that was down to just three people.\n\n\u201cOur services won\u2019t be needed anymore, and this will conclude our mission,\u201d she explained.\n\nArkansas is one of the deeply red states that worked with former Health and Human Services Secretary Katheleen Sebelius to implement Obamacare on its own terms. The GOP-controlled legislature approved an alternative to the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion that allows low-income residents to qualify for subsidies to buy private plans on the state\u2019s marketplace. That\u2019s allowed about 100,000 poor residents to enroll in coverage so far. The cost of the program has stayed right on track so far, too.\n\nIn fact, Arkansas is one of five states that HHS has identified as particular success stories when it comes to Medicaid enrollment. Arkansas is using data for other government programs, like the supplemental nutritional assistance program (SNAP), to more easily identify additional residents who would qualify for Medicaid. Along with California, Illinois, Oregon, and West Virginia \u2014 which have also adopted this practice \u2014 it has seen a huge jump in enrollment after putting this policy into practice.\n\nPreliminary numbers suggest that at least nine million previously uninsured Americans have gained new health coverage under Obamacare. But not every state is seeing as much success at Arkansas. The GOP-led states that continue to resist Medicaid expansion are leaving an estimated five million low-income Americans without any access to affordable insurance whatsoever.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Our services won\u2019t be needed anymore, and this will conclude our mission.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"Our services won\u2019t be needed anymore, and this will conclude our mission.\"", "title": "Free Health Clinic In Rural Arkansas Is Closing Because People Now Have Coverage Under Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/04/11/3425604/health-clinic-arkansas/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/obamacare-13-e1390849956233.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Our services won\u2019t be needed anymore, and this will conclude our mission.\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/obamacare-13-e1388524094594-321x214.jpg", "title": "Free Health Clinic In Rural Arkansas Is Closing Because People Now Have Coverage Under Obamacare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/obamacare-13-e1390849956233.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/obamacare-13-e1390849956233.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-11T09:00:52+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Free Health Clinic In Rural Arkansas Is Closing Because People Now Have Coverage Under Obamacare CREDIT: Charles Dharapak / APThe Ninth Street Ministries Clinic, an organization that has been providing free health care for impoverished residents in rural Arkansas for the past 15 years, will close its doors at the end of its month.\nPreliminary numbers suggest that at least nine million previously uninsured Americans have gained new health coverage under Obamacare.\nThe clinic operators say that \u201cthe mission is complete\u201d now that more people have gained coverage under Obamacare.\n\u201cBecause people are qualifying for insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, our free medical clinic will not be needed anymore,\u201d clinic director Stacey Bowser told the Mena Star, a local outlet that covers Polk County.\nArkansas is one of the deeply red states that worked with former Health and Human Services Secretary Katheleen Sebelius to implement Obamacare on its own terms."}
