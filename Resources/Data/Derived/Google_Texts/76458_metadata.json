You can choose to see that headphone-wearing, texting, eye-rolling co-worker as brash, disrespectful and self-entitled OR you can see them as wired, aware and ready to collaborate. What\u2019s it going to be?\n\nIf you spend your workday collaborating with people just like yourself, you run the risk of putting a chokehold on innovation and new perspectives. You miss opportunities. Our younger co-workers brought us into social media, mobile apps, Salesforce and Chatter, online collaboration and technical improvements for off-site workers. (Not to mention an uptick in vegan offerings at company potlucks.) Our seasoned employees bring the gift of perspective and commitment to sustainability, as well as a steadying, thoughtful presence to rapid decision making. Lean meets Serene.\n\nIf you want to bridge a generational divide, consider two-way mentoring. There\u2019s no rule that says a mentor has to be older, more senior, than you. A Gen Y co-worker\u2013a hardworking rising star with a full-time job and a young family\u2013asked if I would mentor her as she assumed some new job responsibilities. I was happy to, especially if she mentored me in workforce development challenges for our younger employees. I\u2019m learning lots.\n\nIn my workplace, we operate under the shared culture of respect, teamwork and \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d We quote Goethe, \u201cThe way you see people is the way you treat them. The way you treat them is what they become.\u201d So, if you want a good way to deal with people you don\u2019t understand, be inclusive, give people the benefit of the doubt and listen well. Compassion works too. Remember, 30 years ago you were the brash, disrespectful, self-entitled one.\n\nMolly Mettler (@mollykmettler) is senior vice president of mission at Healthwise Inc., a nonprofit founded in 1975 with a mission to help people make better health decisions.
