And it is always disappointed. This happened most recently with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s Sept. cabinet reshuffle, which removed one of the few remaining economic moderates, Rafael Ram\u00edrez, and replaced him with more ideological party loyalists with scant practical economic experience.\n\nBefore the September changes, the whispered hope was that under the sway of the pragmatic Ram\u00edrez \u2013 who had consolidated his power with three key policy-making positions: head of the state oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A. (Petroleum of Venezuela), oil minister and vice president of the economy \u2013 the government would rein in public sector spending, devalue its wildly overvalued currency (the bolivar) and cut gasoline subsidies.\n\nWith the cabinet changes, however, a much-needed, economic course correction looks increasingly unlikely.\n\nIn the all-important post of energy minister, Maduro \u2013 the late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u2013 appointed the former president\u2019s cousin Asdr\u00fabal Ch\u00e1vez. Moreover, Maduro expanded the power of his vice president of finance (or finance minister) Rodolfo Torres by also appointing him vice president of the economy, replacing Ram\u00edrez.\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on Energy Policy]\n\nAs a result, the economy, which today is experiencing annual inflation of more than 60 percent and its second year of negative or zero growth, is unlikely to pull out of its rapid downward spiral. On currency black markets, the bolivar has slid to 90 to the dollar, more than 14 times its value under the country\u2019s complicated multi-tiered exchange rate. Rumors have increased that the country may default on its foreign debt, as foreign reserves reach record lows. At the same time, the expropriation of enterprises from soda to dairy farms, price controls and the bizarre exchange rate system have led to shortages in which close to 30 percent of basic consumer goods, including toilet paper, are in short supply.\n\nOptimism that the Venezuelan government will change course and rejoin the ranks of more stable, human-rights respecting countries has existed since Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 1998 election. Before his inauguration in 1999, observers and business leaders quietly expressed their hope that he would shed his populist rhetoric from the campaign trail and once in office would tack to the center and become more democratic and inclusive. (Indeed, the greatest tragedy of this era is the squandered opportunity to translate deep-seated popular frustration into a much-needed democratic shake-up of the ossified, two-party system that had dominated \u2013 and corrupted \u2013 Venezuela since 1961.)\n\nThose hopes were dashed soon after Ch\u00e1vez, the former lieutenant colonel who had attempted a coup d\u2019etat in 1992, reached office. The fiery populist continued to vilify opponents and, in short order, set out to consolidate his Bolivarian movement (named after his hero, Venezuelan independence leader Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar), remake the country\u2019s constitution and then gut, politicize and corrupt the very institutions his constitution had created. These included the judiciary, electoral institutions, local governments and once professional armed forces. Ch\u00e1vez and his cronies also counted the media among their enemies. Through intimidation, selective regulation and subtle buy-outs, they managed to close down or drown out nearly every single independent television and radio station or newspaper.\n\n[READ: Venezuela quietly secures Latin America's backing in bid to win seat on UN Security Council]\n\nNevertheless, hope has persisted. After Ch\u00e1vez won a negotiated recall referendum in 2004, lost a December 2007 referendum to allow him to amend the constitution to end presidential term limits and when his handpicked successor Maduro narrowly won a contested election in April 2013 after Ch\u00e1vez's death, there was always an expectation that the government would finally tone down the rhetoric by ceasing to call political and civic opponents fascists or oligarchs and seek a more balanced, inclusive government and economic policy.\n\nIt never happened. In fact, it only got worse with more denunciations, more accusations and more blame-shifting for the government\u2019s economic failures as the charismatically challenged Maduro struggled to maintain the authority of his benefactor.\n\nThen there was the hope inspired by the offer of the Union of South American Nations in March to mediate an end to a standoff between the government and citizens. The wave of violence and demonstrations started in February 2014 after students in T\u00e1chira state took to the streets to protest the rape of a student by security agents. The protests swept the nation and erupted into bloodshed when the government sent private militias and the National Guard to the streets to contain them. In the ensuing conflict and deadlock, more than 3,000 protesters were detained, 40 were killed and three opposition political leaders arrested, including former Chacao Mayor Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, who remains in prison. In a report issued in May 2014, Human Rights Watch concluded that state officials had engaged in a campaign of targeted, coordinated repression, torture, and denial of due process against peaceful protestors.\n\n[READ: Venezuela's New Exchange Rate System Is Paying Off]\n\nThe efforts at mediation by the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil did little to hold the government accountable and came to nothing in terms of a consensus. In fact, if Maduro\u2019s efforts to excoriate the opposition, often referring to them as \u201cnazis,\u201d \u201cfacists\u201d and \u201cheirs of Hitler\u201d, and continue on the country\u2019s disastrous economic course is any indication, the government is only doubling down on what it\u2019s always done best: Govern by victimization and blame.\n\nSo today, one of the few hopes left is that, despite the failed mediation efforts of South American countries, Venezuela\u2019s neighbors will hold the country to the international norms and standards that they have all signed up to. Numerous independent human rights groups have documented the multiple ways in which the Venezuelan government has violated them.\n\nLast week even that hope evaporated. A report by the Associated Press revealed that on July 23, the bloc of Latin American and Caribbean nations agreed to vote in favor of Venezuela gaining the rotating seat on the United Nations Security Council. Unfortunately, aside from the refusal of Venezuela to accept a request by U.N. rapporteurs to visit the country to investigate the human rights situation, the Maduro government has failed to meet the most basic conditions for membership including the institutional and political capacity to establish the essential national consensus to pursue security council decisions, the economic capacity to pursue and support council commitments and the political will and capacity to implement its decisions, which presumably include the protection of human rights.\n\nThese are important standards that speak to a commitment to international norms and the rule of law. Are Latin American and Caribbean states willing to testify that Venezuela meets them before they vote in this month\u2019s U.N. General Assembly? If they can\u2019t, what is the opposite of hope springing eternal?", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "World Report [Opinion]", "title": "Venezuela Doesn't Deserve a Seat on the U.N.
