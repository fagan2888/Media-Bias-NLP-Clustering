So you\u2019ll forgive us if we missed the news that a few of the walking yeast infections on the Republican side of the House have filed articles of impeachment against Attorney General Eric Holder for the high crime of being a black man in charge of upholding laws instead of breaking them the way God and Rush Limbaugh intended.\n\nHa ha, we\u2019re kidding! Of course Eric Holder has done all sorts of crimes. Otherwise would such intellectual luminaries as Michele Bachmann, Louie Gohmert, Ted \u201cYOLO\u201d Yoho, and this friggin\u2019 guy have gone to all the trouble? Let\u2019s take a quick look at the four (four! Nixon only got three! Holder is worse than Nixon, INPEACH!) articles of impeachment and join these upstanding lawmakers as they beat AG New Black Panther Dolemite with their Nightsticks of Justice.\n\nArticle I \u2013 FAST AND FUUUUURIOOOOUUUUSSSS! Something about not turning over documents that President Obama had exercised executive privilege over anyway, and since the F&F investigation was led by known lying sack of shit Darrell Issa (who couldn\u2019t even lie his way into finding evidence of wrongdoing on Holder\u2019s part because Darrell Issa sucks at everything including lying) we\u2019re going to rate this one \u201cFour AK-47 barrels blazing.\u201d\n\nArticle II \u2013 Not enforcing certain laws like DOMA, which the Obama Administration had decided to not defend in court. It is called prosecutorial discretion, you poop-flinging nitwits. But sure, let\u2019s impeach a sitting cabinet member for the first time in 137 years because you don\u2019t like the thought of two men buying a house and shopping for curtains together.\n\nArticle III \u2013 Not prosecuting anyone in last summer\u2019s IRS scandal. Probably because a zillion hours of hearings and investigations turned up absolutely zilch that is considered criminal by anyone who gets their news from anyplace but Townhall, and you guys know what we think of Townhall.\n\nArticle IV \u2013 Something about Holder\u2019s testimony over the potential prosecution of Fox News reporter for James Rosen under the Espionage Act. Which was actually a bad thing! But there is no evidence Holder actually perjured himself, which, you know, you kind of have to have if you\u2019re going to impeach the guy.\n\nNothing about Holder\u2019s myriad other violations though, like his refusal to go after the New Black Panthers for the crime of holding open doors for little old white ladies and not deporting every Hispanic person in the country not named Ted Cruz or Raul Labrador, because that would have been overkill.\n\n[Roll Call]", "article_metadata": {"description": "This has been a fun couple of days, what with watching the Cephalopod caucus in Congress run shrieking from the Affordable Care Act and dulling the pain by", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Gary Legum", "og": {"url": "http://wonkette.com/534352/house-nutball-caucus-files-articles-of-impeachment-on-eric-holder-elliot-richardson-still-dead", "image": "http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/default.png", "title": "House Nutball Caucus Files Articles Of Impeachment On Eric Holder, Elliot Richardson Still Dead"}, "twitter": {"description": "This has been a fun couple of days, what with watching the Cephalopod caucus in \u2026", "title": "House Nutball Caucus Files Articles Of Impeachment On Eric Holder, Elliot Richardson Still Dead", "url": "http://wonkette.com/534352/house-nutball-caucus-files-articles-of-impeachment-on-eric-holder-elliot-richardson-still-dead", "image": "http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/default.png", "creator": "@wonkette", "site": "@wonkette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2968\"", "article_summary": "articles of impeachment and join these upstanding lawmakers as they beat AG New Black Panther Dolemite with their Nightsticks of Justice.\nOf course Eric Holder has done all sorts of crimes.\nArticle IV \u2013 Something about Holder\u2019s testimony over the potential prosecution of Fox News reporter for James Rosen under the Espionage Act.\nOtherwise would such intellectual luminaries as Michele Bachmann, Louie Gohmert, Ted \u201cYOLO\u201d Yoho, and this friggin\u2019 guy have gone to all the trouble?\nBut there is no evidence Holder actually perjured himself, which, you know, you kind of have to have if you\u2019re going to impeach the guy."}
