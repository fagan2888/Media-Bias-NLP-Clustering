DENVER (AP) — Friends and family of a man who disappeared during last week’s Denver Broncos game are asking the public for help finding him.

They say 53-year-old Paul Kitterman of Kremmling was last seen leaving his seat at halftime during Thursday night’s Denver-San Diego game at Sports Authority Field.

He was at the game with his son, friend Tia Bakke (Bah-KEY’) and her boyfriend.

Bakke told KUSA-TV (http://on9news.tv/1rK6HSa ) that Kitterman is loyal and responsible and he would never leave people wondering where he was, especially not his son. She says Kitterman rode with them to the game and didn’t have a cell phone or credit cards with him.
