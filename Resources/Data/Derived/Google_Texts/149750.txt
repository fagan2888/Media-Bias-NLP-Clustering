Montgomery County, TN – The latest business to earn Clarksville-Montgomery County Green Certified and host a Green Ribbon Cutting is the Tree of Life Center.

Montgomery County Mayor Jim Durrett, City of Clarksville Chief of Staff Bill Harpel, standing in for Clarksville Mayor McMillan, and Chamber of Commerce Director Melinda Shepard were there to congratulate the owner and employees for their work.

Harpel followed by congratulating owner Yvonne Chamberlain and asking what type of things had been done at Tree of Life Center to earn Green Certification.

Chamberlain responded, “For me this is a way of life. When we gutted the bottom of the building, I had my sons pull copper, wood, nails etc. and we took everything to be recycled or reused in some way. The employees also embrace the conservation mentality. They are onboard and several of them voluntarily take items like glass and cans to the convenience centers rather than putting them in the trash.”

“My goal is to offer the residents of our community an alternative to driving to Nashville for organic and other healthy choices,” she added.

Tree of Life Center also recycles cardboard, plastic and paper with Bi-County Solid Waste Management. Some of the food is donated to local hunger relief organizations like Loaves and Fishes and Manna Café. They also compost for chickens owned by one of the employees. In addition, energy efficiency and using reclaimed materials was a major part of the remodeling process.

The Tree of Life Center is located at 30 Crossland Avenue. They offer a variety of local farm fresh produce, grass fed beef, chicken and duck, hand crafted artisan teas and organic foods as well as weekly cooking classes.
