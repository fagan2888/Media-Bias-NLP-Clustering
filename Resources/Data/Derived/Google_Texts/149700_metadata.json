He thinks that that will help revitalize Egyptian society. Consider what he said: \u201cI\u2019m not leaving a chance for people to act on their own. My program will be mandatory.\u201d\n\nSound familiar? Isn\u2019t that also the mindset of President Obama, especially with respect to his Obamacare program? Like Sisi, he doesn\u2019t want to leave a chance for people to act on their own when it comes to healthcare. That\u2019s why Obama made the program mandatory.\n\nAs the Times\u2019 article points out, \u201cMr. Sisi has shown that he, too, sees himself as a morally superior father figure responsible for directing and correcting the nation, with a firm hand if needed.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t that the mindset of U.S. officials, one that views the federal government as a parent and the American people as children? Isn\u2019t that what Social Security is all about\u2014forcing people to take care of the elderly? Indeed, isn\u2019t that what the entire welfare state is all about, with the income-tax and welfare-state system forcibly taking people\u2019s money from them to help the \u201cpoor, needy, and disadvantaged,\u201d while permitting the adult-children of the nation to have an allowance from what is supposed to be their income?\n\nSisi told fellow officers in a secret briefing that the military is \u201clike the very big brother, the very big father who has a son who is a bit of a failure and does not understand the facts.\u201d\n\nAren\u2019t the U.S. military, CIA, and NSA viewed as big brother here in the United States? Doesn\u2019t the U.S. national-security state apparatus operate in secret, arresting, incarcerating, torturing, executing, renditioning, spying on, or assassinating people, all with the aim of protecting \u201cthe security of the nation\u201d?\n\nJust like in Egypt, the adult-children here in the United States are not supposed to question the apparatus or reveal what it is doing. If they do, they are considered to be enemies of the state \u2014 i.e. communists, terrorists, drug dealers, subversives, etc. Like the citizens of Egypt, American adult-children are expected to trust big brother, defer to his authority, keep their heads down, conform their mindsets to that of the military, NSA, and CIA, and always \u201csupport the troops.\u201d In the halls of power both in the United States and Egypt, that\u2019s what being a \u201cpatriot\u201d is all about\n\nThe Egyptian government is going bankrupt. According to the Times, in \u201c10 months, the Egyptian government has burned through $20 billion of financial aid from supportive Persian Gulf monarchies\u2026.\u201d\n\nThat sounds familiar, doesn\u2019t it? Doesn\u2019t out of control spending (and debt) also characterize the welfare-warfare state here in the United States?\n\nSo, what does Sisi say about Egypt\u2019s economic and financial woes? He says the same thing that U.S. officials do: that it\u2019s not the fault of the state but rather the fault of the private sector.\n\nPeople just have to work harder, Sisi says: \u201cI will not sleep and neither will you. We must work, night and day, without rest.\u201d\n\nWhy not? He\u2019s the nation\u2019s daddy, isn\u2019t he? Isn\u2019t that what some parents tell their children?\n\nSisi has some specific proposals for Egypt\u2019s economic revitalization. According to the Times, he plans to compel private companies to reduce prices and profits. He wants to give trucks to the unemployed so that they will have a job. He\u2019s also got a massive public-works irrigation system in mind.\n\nIn other words, massive government involvement in economic activities, which means, not so coincidentally, that the Egyptian military will continue to maintain its permanent and exalted position in Egyptian life. \u201cThe state has to be in control here,\u201d Sisi declared.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nOh, that\u2019s not all. Sisi also sees his job as improving public morals and \u201cpresenting God\u201d in the right way. No doubt we\u2019ll soon be seeing the same increased cooperation between the drug enforcement agencies of the United States and Egypt that we see between the militaries and intelligence forces of the two governments.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that the U.S. government continues to be one of the major supporters of Sisi and the military coup that brought him to power. It has been decades of U.S. money and armaments that have built up and fortified Egypt\u2019s decades-long military dictatorship.\n\nIronically U.S. officials don\u2019t even view Sisi\u2019s ouster from power of the democratically elected president of Egypt, Mohamed Morsi, as a coup. They view what Sisi has done, including the brutal suppression of dissent and a sham election, as a necessary step in the restoration of democracy.\n\nWhat Sisi obviously fails to understand is precisely what U.S. officials fail to understand: That the problem with Egypt\u2019s economy lies not with the private sector but rather with the public sector, especially the continued existence of a massive national-security state apparatus that sucks the lifeblood out of society. Until that apparatus is dismantled, not reformed, the Egyptian people don\u2019t have a chance.\n\nIt\u2019s really too bad that the U.S. government continues to fortify and reinforce Egypt\u2019s military tyranny. But the support shouldn\u2019t really surprise us, given that so many U.S. officials share the same paternalistic, national-security mindset as that of Egypt\u2019s brutal military dictator Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nJacob G.
