More aggressive outreach by insurers and fewer glitches with the online marketplaces will create a \u201crobust 2015,\u201d agreed Ralph Giacobbe, an analyst at Credit Suisse.\n\nBut the analysts noted continuing challenges for insurers, from improving what McDonald called a \u201cpretty poor\u201d first-year effort to inform consumers about which doctors and hospitals are in their networks, to controlling spending as high-priced drugs hit the market.\n\nInsurers are also projecting that this year\u2019s enrollees will be younger and healthier than those who signed on in 2014, when the average age was 41, McDonald said. That was a problem for insurers who based this year\u2019s premium rates on the expectation they would see younger customers, he said.\n\nThe analysts agreed that enrollment would be unaffected by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to hear a lawsuit challenging the provision of subsidies to residents of states that are relying on the federal exchange. Only 14 states ran their own marketplaces this year.\n\nNick Leventis, an independent health care sector analyst, said concerns about the case are overblown because the government \u201ccould easily give some type of waiver to the states to shift from the federal to the state exchange.\u201d\n\nBut McDonald was less sanguine, although he said insurers are already discussing workaround ideas with state insurance officials. Still, he said that not all of the states would act if the court invalidated the subsidies. Some governors and state legislators would be unlikely \u201cto do anything to help reform,\u201d he said.\n\nGiacobbe predicted that governors and lawmakers in such states would be under great pressure, not only from the hospital and insurance industries, but also from consumers, to find ways to keep the subsidies flowing.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to take away a program once people are using it, he said, predicting, \u201cThis is not going to derail the ACA .\u201d\n\nShould subsidies be cut off by a ruling from the Supreme Court, the marketplaces where the subsidies were no longer available would essentially cease to function since all but the sickest customers would likely drop coverage, the analysts said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/wall-street-analysts-expect-big-2015-enrollment-affordable-care-act", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/wall-street-bull-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "A group of Wall Street analysts predicted Friday that enrollment in Affordable Care Act insurance plans will be higher than the 9 million projected by the Obama administration.", "title": "Wall Street analysts expects big 2015 enrollment in Affordable Care Act"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/wall-street-bull-feature.gif"}, "description": "A group of Wall Street analysts predicted Friday that enrollment in Affordable Care Act insurance plans will be higher than the 9 million projected by the Obama administration.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Wall Street analysts expects big 2015 enrollment in Affordable Care Act"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "&#13; A group of Wall Street analysts predicted Friday that enrollment in Affordable Care Act insurance plans will be higher than the 9 million projected by the Obama administration, because insurers are aggressively courting new customers and more small businesses are likely to send workers to the online exchanges in 2015.&#13; &#13; \u00a0&#13; &#13;", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92fd\"", "article_summary": "Still, he said that not all of the states would act if the court invalidated the subsidies.\n\u201cI\u2019m more optimistic,\u201d McDonald said at the 19th annual \u201cWall Street Comes to Washington\u201d roundtable, sponsored by the Jayne Koskinas Ted Giovanis Foundation for Health and Policy.\nMore aggressive outreach by insurers and fewer glitches with the online marketplaces will create a \u201crobust 2015,\u201d agreed Ralph Giacobbe, an analyst at Credit Suisse.\nThat was a problem for insurers who based this year\u2019s premium rates on the expectation they would see younger customers, he said.\nA group of Wall Street analysts predicted Friday that enrollment in Affordable Care Act insurance plans will be higher than the 9 million projected by the Obama administration, because insurers are aggressively courting new customers and more small businesses are likely to send workers to the online exchanges in 2015."}
