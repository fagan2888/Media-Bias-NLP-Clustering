In his first news conference as governor-elect, Bevin said scaling back the Medicaid expansion would be a top priority for his administration.\n\nBut Strong takes issue with the notion that she voted against her interests. She said she voted on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cMy religious beliefs outweigh whether or not I have insurance,\u201d she said.\n\nStrong lives in Jackson County, Ky., about 65 miles southeast of Lexington. Earlier this month, 83 percent of the county\u2019s voters supported the Republican Bevin.\n\nThe overwhelming support for the Obamacare opponent may take outsiders by surprise: Jackson County, population 13,289, has one of the highest Medicaid enrollment rates in Kentucky. At last tally, 50 percent of the county is enrolled in the program, according to state data. And Strong is one of 2,000 in the county to gain access through the expansion.\n\nKentucky\u2019s state-run health insurance exchange \u2014 Kynect \u2014 and its expansion of Medicaid led to about half a million people gaining health insurance. Some were insured for the first time.\n\nThe state had the sharpest decrease in uninsured residents nationwide, an achievement attributed to outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear\u2019s embrace of the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s an achievement that may be largely undone by his successor.\n\nThere\u2019s been a mad dash to explain why so many Kentuckians voted for a candidate who repeatedly vowed to roll back health care programs many of the state\u2019s residents recently began to rely upon. For their part, Jackson County residents like Strong offer a mix of explanations.\n\nGoing into the statewide election earlier this month, there were expectations that Democrats \u2014 who still outnumber Republicans in the state\u2019s voter rolls \u2014 would leap to the defense of these programs. But that\u2019s not what happened.\n\nInstead, Bevin ran against those efforts and won by 9 percentage points.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nThere are a couple theories about why \u2014 or whether \u2014 the working poor vote for candidates who openly oppose programs that benefit them.\n\nProPublica\u2019s Alec MacGillis, writing recently in The New York Times, argued low-income people aren\u2019t voting against their interests; they are largely not voting at all.\n\nIt\u2019s a widespread belief, including in Jackson County. Stephanie Wilson, who owns a hair salon here, said that\u2019s what she thinks happened in Kentucky this year.\n\n\u201cTypically those people are still at home,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThey are not leaving the house to go vote.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not the whole story. Ask Angel Strong, whose hair Wilson was cutting as she talked about this year\u2019s gubernatorial results.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nStrong said she\u2019s hoping to change her line of work. In the meantime, she needed health insurance, and so she signed up through the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cI had never had Medicaid because I had insurance at my job,\u201d Strong said. \u201cI was a nurse, you know. But now I am out of a job and I am looking for another job, but in the meantime I had no income.\u201d\n\nStill, she stands by her support of Bevin.\n\nShane Gabbard, the county\u2019s newly elected Republican judge-executive and a local pastor, said Medicaid was largely absent from political discussions around town.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that people was really worried about the health care swing of it because it wasn\u2019t a hot topic here, you know,\u201d he said.\n\nDale Emmons, a Democratic political operative in nearby Richmond, said he\u2019s not surprised to hear that a county heavily reliant on government health insurance would not vote to protect that program.\n\n\u201cPeople vote for different reasons,\u201d Emmons said. \u201cThey don\u2019t always necessarily vote for their material interests. I think there is an automatic assumption that they do that. But that\u2019s not always the case. And this election proves that.\u201d\n\nEmmons argues the election \u2014 in which Democrats lost important races down the ballot as well as the governor\u2019s office \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be seen as a \u201creferendum\u201d on the state\u2019s health care policies. In fact, he said this isn\u2019t about health care at all.\n\n\u201cElections sometimes have contradictions in them,\u201d he said.\n\nPoverty and Isolation\n\nJackson County is insular and struggles with poverty.\n\nAccording to recent Census figures, 99 percent of the population is white. About 34 percent of residents live below the poverty line. That\u2019s compared with less than 19 percent of the population statewide.\n\nIt\u2019s also isolated. People who do work have a long commute into cities such as Berea, London and Richmond.\n\nGabbard, who ran for office for the first time in his life this year, said he sees larger issues at play in McKee, a town nestled in the Daniel Boone National Forest and Jackson\u2019s county seat.\n\nHe said generational poverty and decades without industry nearby are what people are dealing with the most around here.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a movie theater,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a skating rink. We don\u2019t have a bowling alley. We don\u2019t have nothing. We got one red light in the whole county. It\u2019s about as small town as you can get.\u201d\n\nGabbard calls McKee \u201ca small town with a big heart.\u201d Even though there aren\u2019t a lot of material incentives to keep people around, most stay because they love their neighbors. Just about everyone in town will quickly tell you Jackson County is full of the friendliest people you will ever meet.\n\nAt a nearby barbershop, Chad Tankersaley, 35, said the people in McKee are what keep him there. He\u2019s worried, though, because there\u2019s not enough opportunity.\n\n\u201cThere are no jobs here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no money coming in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s always been that way. That was Tankersaley\u2019s reason for not voting in this election.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t. I just got tired of voting. Because it don\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t seem like who got in there or who it was or who you vote for \u2014 I don\u2019t know, it always ends up with the same result.\u201d\n\nBack at the hair salon next door, stylist Wilson said people in struggling rural communities feel like they don\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cI feel like \u2026 and I know this is going to sound terrible, but it\u2019s not going to matter what we think,\u201d she said. \u201cOur vote doesn\u2019t really count at all.\u201d\n\nThe Turnout Problem\n\nWilson was one of only 2,771 people in Jackson County who actually voted in the 2015 gubernatorial election.\n\nJust more than a quarter of the registered voters here cast ballots in this year\u2019s gubernatorial election. According to the state Board of Elections, there are 9,846 registered voters in the county; 83 percent are Republicans and 13 percent are Democrats.\n\nMany political observers say Kentucky Democrats lost this year largely because voters in Democrat-heavy counties didn\u2019t turn out on Election Day. Statewide turnout was 30 percent, and that included Republican-dominated counties such as Jackson.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not just those living in poverty, or those on Medicaid, or those with insurance through their jobs: Not many people are voting at all.\n\nEmmons said it\u2019s hard to say what people are voting for when so many are opting out of the process entirely. He also said there is a rise in low-information voting recently that may be driving new trends. A large percentage of people are voting straight-ticket, down party lines.\n\nAccording to the Jackson County Clerk of Courts office, about 1,400 people voted straight ticket. That\u2019s half the people who voted at all.\n\nMedicaid Ramifications\n\nRegardless of the motivations of voters and non-voters, some in Kentucky are hunkering down for the results of this election.\n\nDoug Justice is a \u201ckynector\u201d employed by the Kentucky River Foothills Development Council. He helps residents of Jackson County enroll in health care programs through Kynect. Every Monday and Wednesday, Justice can be found at the Jackson County Public Library waiting for people to come in for assistance.\n\nHe said a majority of the people he helps qualify for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cA lot of those people cannot afford the $200 or $300 [per month for private insurance],\u201d he said. \u201cSome of it is extremely expensive \u2026 and they simply can\u2019t afford that. They\u2019re either not working or they are working and their income level \u2014 they just can\u2019t afford it. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\n\nJustice, who\u2019s been a kynector since the first Kynect open enrollment period in 2013, said there are a few who are enrolled in qualified health plans and receive federal subsidies to help afford their premiums. But for the most part, he said, the people in his hometown have benefited from Kynect.\n\nRelated Story What May Happen If Obamacare Is Rolled Back in Kentucky\n\nUnder Bevin, the program may no longer exist in the way they\u2019ve come to know it these last two years. He has said the state\u2019s health insurance exchange is redundant because Kentuckians can get the same benefits via the federal exchange. As for Medicaid expansion, Bevin may apply for a federal waiver from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to give the state more flexibility in how it operates Medicaid.\n\nBevin has yet to offer details on what his scaled-back Medicaid expansion may look like, other than to suggest recipients contribute financially in some way. That could mean a program similar to Indiana\u2019s, where Medicaid enrollees pay some portion of a monthly premium. Experts say it will be at least a year before changes are approved and finalized.\n\nStill, Justice said some Jackson County residents are wondering what it may mean for them and their health insurance.\n\n\u201cI have had people ask me about that, and I tell them like everybody else, I know there is a new government coming in that\u2019s going to make changes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all the information I have about that.\u201d\n\nWith the economic challenges in Jackson County, people try to take life one day at time, Justice said. That doesn\u2019t always include concerns about what the state\u2019s next governor plans to do about health care.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not getting into the details of that either, because they don\u2019t understand the ramifications of that should it happen, or they\u2019re just going to deal with it when it takes place,\u201d Justice said.\n\nStill, Justice said he has helped many people who were in dire need of health care.\n\n\u201cI had a lady come to me who had cancer and lost her job,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she lost her job, she lost her insurance. Things just kind of snowballed. We were able to get her insurance to get her treatment. And that\u2019s just one example, and I\u2019ve had others as well.\u201d\n\nJustice said people may have varying opinions on Obamacare, but he believes it\u2019s done some good.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me on a scale of one to 10, the people that it has helped, did it help?\u201d he said. \u201cOn a scale of one to 10 \u2014 seven or eight, or better. It\u2019s helped them. Yep. It sure has.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In some parts of Kentucky, voters chose against a health care expansion that directly benefits them.
