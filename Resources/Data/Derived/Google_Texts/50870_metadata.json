Several groups complained it could result in workplace discrimination, a CDC spokeswoman said.\n\nThe program, which included an obesity cost calculator employers could use, is currently \u201cunder review,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has sued several companies, including Honeywell International Inc., on grounds that offering workers incentives to participate in wellness programs or required biometric screenings violate the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.\n\nThe EEOC earlier this year proposed a rule that would address how or if financial inducements and penalties could be incorporated into employer wellness programs, but further action is not expected until next year.\n\n\u201cThe ADA issue ... has certainly created challenges for employers. There's no doubt about it,\u201d said Tom Parry, president of the Integrated Benefits Institute in San Francisco. \u201cAt the same time, I don't see employers giving up because of the challenges of the ADA. They recognize that this is a significant issue that they absolutely have to deal with.\u201d\n\nTexas Mutual has had a wellness program since 2001 to help improve employee health and control costs associated with risks such as obesity or diabetes, Mr. Coates said. The outcomes-based incentive effort incorporates federal guidance for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, he said.\n\nEmployers \u201care going ahead and taking more aggressive action, and not taking the wait-and-see approach,\u201d Mr. Coates said. \u201cCompared to where it was five years ago, there are a lot more employers doing outcomes-based wellness incentives and also investing in wellness programs in general.\u201d\n\nAside from standard health care, the return on investment in wellness programs also can be seen in disability and workers comp programs, Ms. Price said. \u201cHigh-risk cultures are more likely to take some proactive measure,\u201d she said. \u201cBeyond health and wellness, are you willing to offer things like (weight loss) surgeries as a part of your health plan or your workers compensation plan? If you're a low-risk culture and ... you don't want to go down that path,\u201d think about what kinds of snacks are in break room vending machines. \u201cHave you made healthy options available to (workers)?\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the School District of Palm Beach County, Florida, is shifting to an outcomes-based wellness program in 2015, said Kim Sandmaier, wellness coordinator for risk and benefits management.\n\nThe revised program gives employees the option to complete a health risk assessment and a biometric screening \u201cand either meet targets for those biometrics or complete a reasonable alternative,\u201d such as an over-the-phone coaching program, she said.\n\n\u201cOur data specifically (showed) diabetes was a concern, so we're continuing to focus on that,\u201d Ms. Sandmaier said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Rising obesity-related health care costs are leading some employers to take a firmer approach to workplace wellness programs despite the potential to violate anti-discrimination laws.Claims by obese workers with chronic conditions often result in the highest medical costs, \u201cbecause what...", "title": "Employee wellness programs continue to focus on obesity despite lawsuits - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20141207/NEWS03/312079958", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20141207/NEWS03/312079958/AR/0/employee-wellness-programs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Rising obesity-related health care costs are leading some employers to take a firmer approach to workplace wellness programs despite the potential to violate anti-discrimination laws.Claims by obese workers with chronic conditions often result in the highest medical costs, \u201cbecause what...", "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Employee wellness programs continue to focus on obesity despite lawsuits - Business Insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd6e0\"", "article_summary": "In one November study, consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimated that obesity costs the global economy $2 trillion a year.\nRising obesity-related health care costs are leading some employers to take a firmer approach to workplace wellness programs despite the potential to violate anti-discrimination laws.\nworkplace obesity prevention and control campaign offline in early November.\n\u201cHave you made healthy options available to (workers)?\u201dElsewhere, the School District of Palm Beach County, Florida, is shifting to an outcomes-based wellness program in 2015, said Kim Sandmaier, wellness coordinator for risk and benefits management.\nThe EEOC earlier this year proposed a rule that would address how or if financial inducements and penalties could be incorporated into employer wellness programs, but further action is not expected until next year."}
