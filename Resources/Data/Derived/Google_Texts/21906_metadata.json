Summerville, Slands Bridge, Dorchester, Hollywood and Ravenel will likely experience flooding, according to the Weather Service.\n\nWhile flooding in the Charleston area has largely subsided as the water levels in the Ashley River receded, communities along the Edisto and Santee are still soaked.\n\nThe Edisto at Givhans Ferry entered a major flood stage Thursday, cresting at 16.06 feet. The river inundated the entire plain between Canadys and Norman Landing, and is slowly receding. Barnes said the Edisto likely won\u2019t drop below major flood stage until sometime Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cIt will probably be a week or so before it drops below flood level,\u201d he added\n\nOn the Santee River, \u201cthe worst is coming tonight,\u201d Barnes said Saturday. Forecasters expected the slowly rising Santee River at Jamestown, in a moderate flood stage Saturday, to swell to a major flood stage overnight or early Sunday at 22.4 feet, inundating numerous homes in the area.\n\nAt a news conference, Gov. Nikki Haley urged drivers to stay off the roads.\n\n\u201cAnd no sightseers on the water,\u201d she added.\n\nNineteen people have died so far in the aftermath of South Carolina\u2019s historic flood. Nearly 500 people are in shelters. Across the state, 336 roads are closed, including 105 bridges. Twenty dams have burst with another 100 being monitored.\n\nAbout 13 miles of Interstate 95, one of the East Coast\u2019s main highways linking Maine to Florida, remains closed, forcing long-distance travelers to take a 168-mile detour through Columbia.\n\nThere was no estimate when that stretch of interstate, which normally carries an average of 30,000 vehicles a day, could reopen.\n\nThe worst of the coastal area\u2019s flooding appeared to be over after the Black River crested overnight Saturday and water levels dropped 5 inches, Georgetown County spokeswoman Jackie Broach said. The nearby Waccamaw River crested Friday and began to recede.\n\nSaturday\u2019s rainfall brought October\u2019s total precipitation in the state capital to 12.75 inches \u2014 breaking the previous record of 12 inches in 1959 \u2014 with 21 days left in the month, the National Weather Service said.\n\nColumbia had gotten 1.25 inches of rain between midnight and mid-afternoon Saturday, Weather Service spokesman Al Moore said, with up to 2 inches in the western Piedmont. More showers were expected overnight, he said.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved $7 million in disaster assistance to flood victims, Haley said \u2014 a number she expects will grow.\n\nKim Stenson, the director of the S.C. Emergency Management Division, noted that rescue operations and extractions from homes \u201chave slowed down significantly in last 24 hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a day after today and a month from now, we will be better,\u201d Haley said. \u201cWe will get through this.\n\nMore rain is expected Sunday, with the day\u2019s forecast calling for mostly cloudy skies. A 40 percent chance of showers is expected during the day with a 20 percent chance of rain at night, heading into Monday.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Extra rain may slow receding river levels, authorities say, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nWeather, \r\nWeather, flooding,Weather", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Roughly an inch rainfall over the Lowcountry Saturday won\u2019t contribute to any additional significant flooding, but it may slow receding river levels, according to forecasters at the National Weather Service.", "title": "Extra rain may slow receding river levels, authorities say", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151010/151019903/extra-rain-may-slow-receding-river-levels-authorities-say", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151010/PC16/151019903/AR/0/AR-151019903.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151010/PC16/151019903/AR/0/AR-151019903.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Roughly an inch rainfall over the Lowcountry Saturday won\u2019t contribute to any additional significant flooding, but it may slow receding river levels, according to forecasters at the National Weather Service.", "title": "Extra rain may slow receding river levels, authorities say", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151010/PC16/151019903/AR/0/AR-151019903.jpg?201510102018", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151019903}}, "keywords": "Extra rain may slow receding river levels, authorities say , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nWeather, \r\nWeather, flooding,Weather", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-10T07:17:36Z", "modified_time": "2015-10-10T20:18:00Z", "author": "Deanna Pan"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Roughly an inch rainfall over the Lowcountry Saturday won\u2019t contribute to any additional significant flooding, but it may slow receding river levels, according to forecasters at the National Weather Service."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd94a8\"", "article_summary": "The Edisto at Givhans Ferry entered a major flood stage Thursday, cresting at 16.06 feet.\nBarnes said the Edisto likely won\u2019t drop below major flood stage until sometime Tuesday morning.\nRoughly an inch rainfall over the Lowcountry Saturday won\u2019t contribute to any additional significant flooding, but it may slow receding river levels, according to forecasters at the National Weather Service.\nFlood warnings are expected to remain in effect for Charleston and Dorchester counties until 2 p.m. Sunday, as the Edisto River \u2013 and the creeks and streams feeding into it \u2013 overflows.\nMore rain is expected Sunday, with the day\u2019s forecast calling for mostly cloudy skies."}
