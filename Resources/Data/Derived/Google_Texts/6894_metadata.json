Angels, Jesus, miracles, usually good TV shows coughing up saccharine episodes with morally pat endings: For those of us who aren\u2019t big fans of syrupy religiosity, the last month of the year is hard to take, no matter how many presents you get to make up for it. There\u2019s a lot of religious self-congratulation going on, so as a corrective, here\u2019s a list of 9 terrible things religion has brought upon American culture. To be clear, as many religious people also have their problems with some of the excesses of Christianity in America, this is more a reminder of the problems with those excesses than some kind of slam on religious people generally.\n\n1. War on Christmas hysteria\n\nIt\u2019s become an annual tradition, along with Christmas pop-up shops and holiday shopping specials: Fox News trying to scare their viewers into thinking the evil liberals are going to steal Christmas from them. This year, so far, the culprits are Muslims wanting their own holidays,women who dare complain if holiday stress gets to them, and Obama for supposedly not being gung-ho enough. (Reality check: The Obama White House has, if anything, upped the ante for White House Christmas decorating.)\n\nAll of this dishonest panic about the imminent demise of Christmas is little more than an excuse for conservative Christians to get even more aggressive. By redefining every reasonable limit on their proselytizing or attempt at being more inclusive as somehow \u201coppression,\u201d they\u2019re able to shove their religion on others in the guise of resisting this imaginary oppression.\n\n2. Terrible social safety net\n\nThe Jesus Christ of the Bible is forever going on about the need to clothe and feed the poor, but the Jesus Christ of the right-wing imagination is just as quick to kick a homeless person as he is to give him a meal. One of the biggest projects of fundamentalist Christianity of the past few decades is to create a religious justification for slashing the social safety net. That\u2019s why conservative Christians tend to ignore the hundreds of verses in the Bible about feeding the poor and focus instead on a single verse, 2 Thessalonians 3:10, which reads, \u201cFor even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.\u201d\n\nThis verse, in context, is little more than Apostle Paul laying out the community-specific rules for a church during his era\u2013basically saying that everyone in the church should pitch in and help\u2013but conservative Christians have exploited the hell out of this verse to justify all manner of starving the poor and casting them out to sleep in the cold. Megachurch pastor John Hagee interprets the verse to mean that welfare should be ended. Rep. Kevin Cramer whips the verse out to justify starving SNAP-dependent children. And Rep. Stephen Fincher does the same, even though he wasn\u2019t against taking millions in government aid himself, in the form of farm subsidies.\n\n3. Creationism\n\nOne of the most peculiar ways conservative Christians try to assert cultural dominance in the U.S. is to reject the theory of evolution and instead insist on some sort of Biblical literalism that suggests humans were created by God instead of evolved over time. Because of this, only Turkey has lower rates than the U.S. in the Western world of acceptance of the theory of evolution. Unfortunately, conservative Christians refuse to limit themselves to simply believing weird stuff. Instead, creationists are forever trying to find new ways to push their religious beliefs off as \u201cscience\u201d in science classrooms, even though the courts have firmly told them they really can\u2019t be doing this.\n\n4. Battles over proselytizing in schools\n\nCreationism is just a small part of a larger, ongoing hunger the Christian right has for access to children in public schools. The First Amendment should forbid exploiting the fact that kids are required to go to school to foist Christian beliefs on them, but the lure of all that captive audience means conservative Christians keep trying.\n\nIn a recent example, the school district in Orange County, Florida, thought they\u2019d be clever and merely \u201callow\u201d a Christian group to pass out literature at the high schools, by exploiting a loophole that says proselytizing is okay so long as all groups get to it. Their bad faith, however, was swiftly exposed when the Satanic Temple demanded equal access to the children, forcing the school to reconsider their pro-proselytization policy.\n\n5. Convincing people to vote against their own self-interests\n\nThe 2014 midterm elections were strange, in that nearly every time voters had a chance to vote directly on legislation\u2013such as raising the minimum wage\u2013they voted for the liberal side, but somehow Republicans still swept the elections. There are many complex reasons for this, but one of the most straightforward is that this is the problem with religiosity. Republicans thump the Bible hard and frequently, and that causes a lot of people to believe that a vote for Republicans is a \u201cChristian\u201d vote. The fact that Republicans refuse to walk the walk\u2013attacking the poor to fluff up the coffers of the wealthy every chance they get\u2013matters little. The religiosity is skin deep, but that\u2019s all it needs to be to get votes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Christmas nearly upon us, an examination of how religious fundamentalism holds the entire country back", "author": "Amanda Marcotte", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With Christmas nearly upon us, an examination of how religious fundamentalism holds the entire country back", "title": "9 ways Christian zealots cripple America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/06/9_ways_christian_zealots_cripple_america_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/shutterstock_154490453.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With Christmas nearly upon us, an examination of how religious fundamentalism holds the entire country back", "creator": "@AmandaMarcotte", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/shutterstock_154490453.jpg", "title": "9 ways Christian zealots cripple America", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "9 ways Christian zealots cripple America", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Christian Zealots, Christianity, Creationism, Rape Culture", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Republicans thump the Bible hard and frequently, and that causes a lot of people to believe that a vote for Republicans is a \u201cChristian\u201d vote.\nUnfortunately, conservative Christians refuse to limit themselves to simply believing weird stuff.\nAll of this dishonest panic about the imminent demise of Christmas is little more than an excuse for conservative Christians to get even more aggressive.\nThe First Amendment should forbid exploiting the fact that kids are required to go to school to foist Christian beliefs on them, but the lure of all that captive audience means conservative Christians keep trying.\nBattles over proselytizing in schoolsCreationism is just a small part of a larger, ongoing hunger the Christian right has for access to children in public schools."}
