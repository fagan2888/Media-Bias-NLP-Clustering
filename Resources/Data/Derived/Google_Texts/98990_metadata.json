Yet analysts say the record of impartial studies is limited, and researchers are still breaking down November\u2019s midterm contests.\n\n\u201cThere have been political scientists who\u2019ve tried to study the effect of these laws \u2014 the truth is it\u2019s very, very difficult to measure the effect of a single law on an election,\u201d said Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Voting Rights Project, which is fighting some of the states\u2019 voter ID laws in court.\n\n\u201cWhat we do know is how many documented instances there are of voter impersonation,\u201d he said. \u201cZero is the answer.\u201d\n\nConservative groups say states have the right to enact laws that build confidence in the security of their elections, while the other side has stockpiled testimonials from people who say they were turned away at the polls or discouraged from showing up at all.\n\nThirty-four states have laws requiring each voter to show a form of ID at the polls, although only 32 of the measures are in effect, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s was struck down in the courts, and North Carolina\u2019s is set to take effect next year. North Carolina has made it easier to obtain IDs, changing the tone of an upcoming trial over the state\u2019s election laws.\n\nAs matters stand, eight states \u2014 Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin \u2014 have strict photo ID requirements, in which voters without acceptable identification may cast provisional ballots, the validity of which are determined after Election Day.\n\n\u201cThose are the ones we\u2019re concerned about,\u201d Mr. Ho said.\n\nThree other states \u2014 Arizona, North Dakota and Ohio \u2014 have strict laws that allow non-photo identification, and the rest have a patchwork of strict laws in which voters may sign affidavits of identity or have poll workers vouch for them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that the states that are going to restrict have already done so,\u201d said Richard Briffault, a Columbia Law School professor. \u201cWhat we are seeing is the beginning of a litigation counterattack by the Democratic Party \u2014 particularly in key swing states like Wisconsin, Ohio, and North Carolina.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton homed in on voter access during a speech in Houston last month, in which she called out former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and several other potential Republican rivals by name and accused them of using voter ID and other election laws to bar blacks and poor Americans from polls.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are systematically and deliberately trying to stop millions of American citizens from voting,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton, a former first lady, senator and secretary of state who is the overwhelming front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nMr. Perry said Mrs. Clinton demeaned the people of Texas, as a \u201cvast majority\u201d of state residents support the voter ID law.\n\nNot to be outdone, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief rival for the Democratic nomination \u2014 Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont \u2014 called for an expansion of voting rights in the wake of a Supreme Court decision last week that upheld a state\u2019s right to redraw congressional districts with an independent commission, a method designed to reduce partisan gerrymandering.\n\n\u201cWe still must go further. It\u2019s time to restore the Voting Rights Act, expand early voting periods and make it easier for people to vote, not harder,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, criticizing a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that freed states, mostly in the South, from having to get advanced federal approval for changes to their voting laws and practices.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups are rejecting progressives\u2019 claims by taking a deep dive into the numbers on voter ID.\n\n\u201cNot only is there no evidence whatsoever that voter ID in any way decreased turnout, Texas seemed to do better in the 2014 election than many states without voter ID laws in place,\u201d said Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at Heritage who is drafting a paper on the Lone Star State\u2019s experience with its law.\n\nStill others say fluctuations in turnout aren\u2019t the story.\n\n\u201cThe story is whether any Americans are disenfranchised, and for what?\u201d said Myrna Perez, director of the Voting Rights and Elections Project at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThere\u2019s not a great deal of evidence these laws are more effective at making our elections more secure.\u201d\n\n\u2022 S.A.
