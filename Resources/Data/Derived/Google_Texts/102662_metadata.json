He\u2019ll still drop by the office on West Main Street to check in occasionally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new chapter,\u201d Richard said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming. As we make this transition, the point is that there\u2019s been a lot of planning and preparation involved \u2026 I think the foundation that was laid 32 years ago is solid. \u201d\n\nMcCarty Architects was founded in 1983 by Buddy McCarty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a story about two brothers who weren\u2019t the same age but always wanted to do something together,\u201d Richard said. \u201cLife\u2019s circumstances didn\u2019t align so that we could get our education at the same time. He started McCarty Architects a year after he started Construction Resources Inc. The year after he started the architectural firm, I came back after finishing architecture school.\u201d\n\nThe firm \u201cstayed small,\u201d as he put it, with four or five architects doing mostly local projects in Tupelo and north Mississippi.\n\nThen in 1988, North Mississippi Health Services tapped them to be its sole architect. Projects like the East Tower, South Expansion, Outpatient Cancer Treatment Center, West Bed Tower and Wellness Center have all been designed by McCarty Architects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a long-term relationship with them, allowing us the opportunity to grow and hire talented architects from around the country,\u201d McCarty said.\n\nThe baton has been passed to Kurt Shettles, whom Richard says \u201cis poised to carry on and keep the company going and keep providing services to our clients.\u201d\n\nShettles was hired as an intern at McCarty starting in 1994 and moved into one of three team leaders in the company.\n\nBuddy retired in 2002 from the firm to pursue his love for photography. Richard bought the architecture firm and the construction company from his brother, and the two businesses operate under The McCarty Co. umbrella as separate entities \u2013 McCarty Architects and McCarty-King Construction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve managed to keep them alive, hired more talented people and continued to grow,\u201d Richard said with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve expanded our market farther out to the rest of the state as well.\u201d\n\nMethodist Senior Service is another client of McCarty Architects. Together, they developed the innovative and award-winning Green Houses.\n\n\u201cThat whole effort has helped change senior living, and it was some way for us to give back tot he community,\u201d he said.\n\nOther large clients include Itawamba Community College, Northeast Mississippi Community College, Mississippi State University and the University of Mississippi.\n\nWith scores of projects big and small through the years, Richard McCarty said no single project stands out. However, he did say the company does have a specific focus when it comes working on projects.\n\n\u201cAt some point, we felt like our work contributed to the growth of the human spirit, whether it be education, healthcare or senior living, all of those were opportunities to touch people in a meaningful way,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCarty\u2019s personal favorite is his work on the Green House concept, which is designed to \u201cde-institutionalize nursing home life\u201d and concentrate on more home-like care and services. \u2026 it matters us to give back and contribute to people.\u201d\n\nPast and future\n\nEven though Tupelo is McCarty\u2019s hometown, he didn\u2019t think he would come back to the city after finishing architecture school.\n\n\u201cWhen I came back and saw what Buddy started, I wanted to be part of that and be a part of the community where I grew up,\u201d he said. \u201cI have absolutely no regrets about that.\n\n\u201cMy brother and I both grew up in a family business, and whatever that instilled in us, we wanted to foster our own company here.\u201d\n\nMcCarty isn\u2019t completely stepping away from the business. But he is slowing down his pace quite drastically.\n\nHe does have other hobbies to pursue, including a wood shop at his home and a sailboat on Chesapeake Bay.\n\nAnd his transition to semi-retirement includes his continued employment at McCarty Architects.\n\n\u201cHopefully Kurt won\u2019t fire me,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope to provide some assistance whenever they need me, and certainly I\u2019m interested in their continued success so anything I can help with that I want to be here.\u201d\n\nHe also said the employees and clients are like family, and simply walking out the door is not an option.\n\nAnd Shettles is as much as part of the family as anyone. Leaving the company in his hands was an easy decision.\n\nHe was quietly and gently groomed to eventually lead the company, McCarty said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased about the future prospects of the company,\u201d he said. \u201cOur family name is on it, and we\u2019re pleased Kurt is excited about taking on the company and leading it to the future. I know the people here have a great deal of confidence in what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Shettles said it was a natural fit joining McCarty 21 years ago.\n\n\u201cAt that time, the market was good for architects, and there were maybe 35 who graduated in my class,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone could have been hired to work in Jackson for larger firms. In fact, all but five went to work in Jackson. There were jobs everywhere.\n\n\u201cBut it felt like it would be meaningful to do my internship here. One of the reasons was the construction company, and I though I could get good experience through them as well. I told Richard I wanted to do my three-year internship here and then I wanted to look for some meaningful architecture when I was done. But I guess I didn\u2019t really know what that meant other than it looked cool.\u201d\n\nShettles grew up in Union County, and enjoyed coming back to the region and working on \u201cmeaningful\u201d projects after all.\n\n\u201cSeeing how Richard and Buddy cared for and crafted the business around client service was something that was never taught to me. It was very appealing to me to find that here.\u201d\n\nThat eagerness to do good work, together with his talent and intelligence made it easy for McCarty to tap Shettles two decades ago.\n\nAs for McCarty-King, the company will be led by Dan King, who bought a 49 percent stake a few years ago in what was McCarty Construction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with Buddy for the first 17 years or so of the company and the last 13 with Richard,\u201d King said. \u201cThey\u2019ve both been wonderful to work with them. We\u2019ve worked together with a lot of clients over the years, and I look forward to what the future will bring.\u201d\n\nShettles said there are no big changes in order.\n\n\u201cThe model is there for how to do the business, how to take care of clients and ultimately give good architecture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in good shape. I think more in my mind is, \u2018don\u2019t mess this thing up.\u2019 Stay who we are, stay grounded and take care of the clients \u2026 we have a great foundation from great leaders who started the company, and great people here that makes it easy to make me want to do this.\u201d\n\ndennis.seid@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @dennisseid", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Dennis Seid Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Richard McCarty is spending the new year with a new job: Figuring out what to do in retirement.
