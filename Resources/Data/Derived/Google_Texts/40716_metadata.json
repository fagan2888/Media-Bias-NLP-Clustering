(AP Photo/The Virginian-Pilot, Hyunsoo Leo Kim)\n\nVIRGINIA (WAVY) \u2013 For the first time, Virginia State Senator Creigh Deeds is opening up about the death of his son.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t want Gus to be defined by his illness,\u201d said Deeds. \u201cI don\u2019t want Gus defined by what happened on the 19th. Gus was a great kid. He was a perfect son.\u201d\n\nDeeds spoke to \u201c60 Minutes\u201d about his son\u2019s struggle with bipolar disorder. It\u2019s a struggle that ended in a brutal attack against his father and his own suicide.\n\n\u201cHe was coming home and I was concerned that if he came home, there was going to be a crisis,\u201d said Deeds.\n\nHis 24-year-old son, Gus, had been diagnosed as bipolar in 2011, soon after his father\u2019s run for Virginia Governor.\n\n\u201cGus was a great kid,\u201d said explained the state senator. \u201cHe was a perfect son. It\u2019s clear the system failed. It\u2019s clear it failed Gus. It killed Gus.\u201d\n\nLast November, Deeds had Gus hospitalized through a court order that was only to last six hours.\n\n\u201cIf he could have been hospitalized that night, they could have gotten him medicated,\u201d said Deeds. \u201cI could have worked to get Gus in some type of long term care.\u201d\n\nThe court order expired. A mental health representative told Deeds they didn\u2019t have a hospital bed appropriate for Gus\u2019 case. Deeds said he was told Gus wasn\u2019t considered to be suicidal, so he brought Gus back to their home in Bath County.\n\nDeeds described the next morning, Nov. 19, on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday night.\n\n\u201cI felt like there would be a confrontation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, I had no reason to think there would be violence\u2026 I went out to the barn to feed the horses and Gus was coming across the yard. And I said, \u2018Hey bud, how\u2019d you sleep?\u2019 He said, \u2018Fine.'\u201d\n\nDeeds said he turned around and Gus started attacking him.\n\n\u201cHe attacked me twice. Stabbed me twice,\u201d said Deeds. \u201cThe State Police told me they found a knife. I turned around and said, \u2018Bud, what\u2019s going on?\u2019 And he was just coming at me. And I said, \u2018Bud, I love you so much. Don\u2019t make this any worse than it is.\u2019 He just kept coming at me. I was bleeding a good bit.\u201d\n\nDeeds escaped and was found by a neighbor.\n\n\u201cWhen I was sitting in the rescue squad or helicopter, I heard about some call\u2026came over the scanner that there had been someone with a gunshot wound to the head,\u201d said Deeds.\n\nGus shot himself in the head and died.\n\nDeeds has said he wants to use Gus\u2019 life and story to address mental health problems Virginia and society faces. The state senator has already introduced new legislation in the Virginia General Assembly. One bill would extend emergency custody from six hours to 24 hours. He also wants to create a psychiatric bed registry, which would be a computer database that would list open hospital beds across the state.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Hampton Roads Virginia and Northeastern North Carolina News, Weather, Traffic and Sports", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488237027", "og": {"site_name": "WAVY-TV", "description": "VIRGINIA (WAVY) \u2013 For the first time, Virginia State Senator Creigh Deeds is opening up about the death of his son. \u201cI really don\u2019t want Gus to be defined by his illness,\u201d s\u2026", "title": "Creigh Deeds opens up about son\u2019s death", "url": "http://wavy.com/2014/01/26/creigh-deeds-opens-up-about-sons-death/", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "https://lintvwavy.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/creigh-deeds.jpg", "height": 306}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "VIRGINIA (WAVY) \u2013 For the first time, Virginia State Senator Creigh Deeds is opening up about the death of his son. \u201cI really don\u2019t want Gus to be defined by his illness,\u201d s\u2026", "title": "Creigh Deeds opens up about son\u2019s death", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwavy.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/creigh-deeds.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WAVY_News", "site": "wavy_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Hampton Roads, VA Local News, Weather, Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wavy", "fb": {"pages": 46472432035}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wavy.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/03a48a44367fdf73a3aab6bf39b901c9?s=16", "application-name": "WAVY-TV", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wavytv10", "published_time": "2014-01-27T04:05:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-27T04:05:25+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "2CoPRGeMIaPfiwY_gCqAl9743bQYuq-0QVkHsIreAV4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "VIRGINIA (WAVY) - For the first time, Virginia State Senator Creigh Deeds is opening up about the death of his son. \"I really don't want Gus to be defined by his illness,\" said Deeds. \"I don't want Gus defined by what happened on the 19th.
