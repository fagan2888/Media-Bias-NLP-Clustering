NBA legend Magic Johnson and former NBA star Alonzo Mourning, each who have battled highly-publicized health problems, appeared in similar ads.\n\nThe ads, largely paid for by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could go a long way in sparking conversations about the need for health insurance coverage in the Black community. According to a study by the Yale University Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity Black children and teens are exposed to at least 80 percent more ads than their White peers. Commercials often feature more positive portrayals of Black men when compared to prime time television.\n\nAccording to a new report by the Department of Health and Human Services, almost 2 million Americans suffered sports-related injuries. including ankle and knee sprains that landed them in the emergency room, one of the most expensive places to get medical treatment.\n\n\u201cSome sports-related injuries, such as sprained ankles, may be relatively minor, while others, such as head or neck injuries, can be quite serious,\u201d stated the HHS report.\n\nThe report sports-related injuries continued: \u201cThe most common of these were ankle or knee sprains and leg fractures. Estimated rates of sports-related injuries were even higher among children and young adults under the age of 25. An estimated 12 million individuals between the ages of 5 and 22 years suffer a sports related injury annually, and about 20 percent of all injury-related emergency room visits are among children 6 to 19 years of age.\u201d\n\nThe most common basketball injuries for adults 25 to 40 years-old were ankle and knee sprains, then facial injuries and broken fingers.\n\nNBA veteran and Miami Heat forward Shane Battier said that through 25 years of competitive basketball, he\u2019s received over 90 stitches from elbows to the face, sprained his ankles more than 25 times, suffered broken elbows, reconstructive ankle surgery and arthritis in the knees and the hip.\n\n\u201cThese injuries can happen to anyone,\u201d said Shellie Pfohl, executive director of the President\u2019s Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition. \u201cFor those without health insurance they can be very expensive.\u201d\n\nAccording to the HHS report: \u201cFor 25- to 40-year-olds, the estimated average charges for a leg fracture were about $3,403, while the estimated average charges for an arm fracture were about $7,666 (2011 dollars), according to 2009-2011 pooled data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, emergency departments treated nearly 600,000 basketball injuries. For adults, sprains cost on average $2,294 and broken arms cost $7,666, medical expenses that most people would struggle to pay out of pocket the report noted.\n\nEmergency rooms reported almost 500,000 football injuries coming through their doors and about 10,000 of those required hospitalization.\n\nThe costs associated with treating a broken leg for someone 10- to 19 years-old was $4,700 and a broken arm cost almost $3,000. Charges for treating dislocations for the same age group averaged $6,900 and for 25 to 40 year-olds the average was roughly $4,600. The average cost for treated sprains and strains was about $2,300.\n\nThe rate of injuries in basketball and football may have a disproportionate impact in the Black community, where young Black men play basketball and football at higher rates than their White peers.\n\nIn a study on high school sports participation and educational attainment, researchers from the University of Minnesota reported that Black boys \u201care 1.6 times more likely than their White counterparts to play football, and 2.5 times more likely to play basketball.\u201d\n\nThe University of Minnesota study observed: \u201cWhen other factors are controlled for, Black males are actually 2.5 times more likely to play football and 5.7 times more likely to play basketball than White males.\u201d\n\nNBA veteran Shane Battier said that sooner or later, if you\u2019re active and you play sports, chances are you\u2019re going to get banged up at some point.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is this: you have to protect yourself and make sure that if you get hurt on the court or on the field that you\u2019re covered,\u201d said Battier.\n\nIn a blog post on the report at http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/, Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services wrote that six out of 10 uninsured Americans will pay about $100 a month or less for a health insurance plan.\n\n\u201cThat broken arm would take almost 10 years to pay off at that rate without considering interest or harm to your credit,\u201d wrote Sebelius.\n\nSebelius added: \u201cWhether you\u2019re out on the slopes or playing the boss in a pickup game of basketball after that stressful meeting, you don\u2019t want to have to hold back because you aren\u2019t covered in case of injury.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Freddie Allen, NNPA Washington Correspondent", "description": "&nbsp; WASHINGTON (NNPA) \u2013 In the final, frenzied push to boost health insurance enrollment numbers under the Affordable Care Act, President Obama turned to sports figures to promote the health care law on television and online.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=", "og": {"site_name": "New Pittsburgh Courier", "description": "WASHINGTON (NNPA) \u2013 In the final, frenzied push to boost health insurance enrollment numbers under the Affordable Care Act, President Obama turned to sports figures to promote the health car\u2026", "title": "Obama teams up with pro athletes to meet ACA Deadline", "url": "http://newpittsburghcourieronline.com/2014/03/25/obama-teams-up-with-pro-athletes-to-meet-aca-deadline/", "image": "http://ionenewpittsburghcourier.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/magic_johnson_dodgers.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://ionenewpittsburghcourier.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/magic_johnson_dodgers.jpg?w=240", "site": "@NewPghCourier", "card": "summary", "creator": "@NewPghCourier"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-25 14:51:57", "sailthru.title": "Obama teams up with pro athletes to meet ACA\u00a0Deadline", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=, affiliate-data=, app-argument=", "fb": {"app_id": 788648951164276}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://newpittsburghcourieronline.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b4f60bd35762d37aa07531f20b161b08?s=16", "application-name": "New Pittsburgh Courier", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-03-25T18:51:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-25T18:52:46+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "30473C9E51B1FA7645F80C5736971CF1", "google-site-verification": "zagCC3pZZptPIt1ItBXcBVa1JWrKTE4mQx7HRuT2vNk", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd339b\"", "article_summary": "According to a new report by the Department of Health and Human Services, almost 2 million Americans suffered sports-related injuries.\nThe rate of injuries in basketball and football may have a disproportionate impact in the Black community, where young Black men play basketball and football at higher rates than their White peers.\nNBA legend Magic Johnson and former NBA star Alonzo Mourning, each who have battled highly-publicized health problems, appeared in similar ads.\nThe report sports-related injuries continued: \u201cThe most common of these were ankle or knee sprains and leg fractures.\nEstimated rates of sports-related injuries were even higher among children and young adults under the age of 25."}
