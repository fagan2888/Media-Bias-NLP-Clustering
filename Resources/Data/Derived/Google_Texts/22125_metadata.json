The federal government did not create the states; the states created the federal government.\u201d\n\nStover\u2019s analysis of the creation of the Constitution is right.\n\nUnderstanding that the states created the federal government will help state legislators and citizens appreciate the constitutional propriety and potency of the principles of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798.\n\nThe states created the federal government and reserve the right to resist the exercise by Congress of any powers not specifically granted to it by the states in the Constitution. For too long, Congresses, presidents, judges, and bureaucrats have \u201cworshipped and served the creature [the government] more than the creator [the states and the people].\u201d (Romans 1:25)\n\nIn his statement, state Representative Michael Caldwell invoked the 10th Amendment and the retention by states of the \u201cnumerous and indefinite\u201d powers not specifically granted to the federal government in the Constitution.\n\n\u201cI am here to protect and uphold the Constitution,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cThe federal takeover of healthcare in the United States is the single largest infringement upon the Constitution, upon the Tenth Amendment, upon individual rights in my lifetime, in recent history and, I would argue, in the history of our nation. HB 707 is telling the Obama Administration that if they want the ACA in Georgia, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to pay for it, you\u2019re going to have to implement it, and don\u2019t expect any aid from the State of Georgia in doing so.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs the states have become servants, they may yet regain their proper role as masters. In this there is hope, in fact.\n\nThe states, through the exercise of the 10th Amendment and their right to rule as sovereign entities, may stop ObamaCare at the state borders by enacting state statutes nullifying the healthcare law and criminalizing state participation in administering or executing the unconstitutional provisions thereof.\n\nNullification is the \u201crightful remedy\u201d and is a much more constitutionally sound method of checking federal usurpation. It is quicker and less complicated than an attempt to have the law repealed by Congress or overturned by a future federal bench more respectful of the Constitution. That said, there is no reason that concerned citizens should not use every weapon in the constitutional arsenal, including working to convince Congress to repeal this offensive act.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ratification of ObamaCare\u2019s individual mandate can be seen as a mandate of another sort. Americans should now turn their attention to removing from office every congressman who voted in favor of the \u201claw\u201d and electing those candidates for state legislature who will commit themselves to boldly asserting the sovereignty of the states and forcing the raging bull of the federal government back within the small and well-defined corral built by our Founding Fathers.\n\nAs the multitude of unconstitutional mandates contained within the ObamaCare behemoth begin breathing down the necks of Americans, thankfully, there are a few state legislators proposing bills to protect citizens from being subjected to the healthcare law.\n\nSoon, the South Carolina state senate will consider a bill aimed at preventing enforcement of ObamaCare within its borders.\n\nThe growth of this movement is not only encouraging, but evidence of a increase in state assemblies of the proper role of states in checking the federal government.\n\nObamaCare and all future and former unconstitutional acts of Congress can (and must!) be nullified by state legislators and governors. The power to negate any act of the federal government that exceeds the constitutional scope of its power is innate in the states. All observers recognize that the creature has grown so large that it threatens to consume the creator.\n\nIf nullification is to be successfully deployed and defended, states lawmakers must remember that the Constitution is a creature of the states and that the federal government was given very few and very limited powers over objects of national importance. Any act of Congress, the courts, or the president that exceeds that small scope is null, void, and of no legal effect. No exceptions. James Madison said it best in The Federalist, No. 45: \u201cThe powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.\u201d\n\nAfter news of the Georgia legislators\u2019 proposal began spreading on the Internet, opponents of nullification summoned up the old bogey man: the so-called Supremacy Clause of Article VI.\n\nThe Supremacy Clause does not declare that all laws passed by the federal government are the supreme law of the land, period. What it says is that the \u201claws of the United States made in pursuance\" of the Constitution are the supreme law of the land.\n\nIn pursuance thereof, not in violation thereof. Not one of the provisions of ObamaCare is permissible under any enumerated power given to Congress in the Constitution; therefore, they were not made in pursuance of the Constitution, and they are not the supreme law of the land.\n\nAlexander Hamilton promoted this interpretation of Article VI when he wrote in The Federalist, No. 33:\n\nIf a number of political societies enter into a larger political society, the laws which the latter may enact, pursuant to the powers intrusted [sic] to it by its constitution, must necessarily be supreme over those societies and the individuals of whom they are composed.... But it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the larger society which are not pursuant to its constitutional powers, but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies, will become the supreme law of the land. These will be merely acts of usurpation, and will deserve to be treated as such. [Emphasis in original.]\n\nState Representative Spencer understands this, and when asked at the press conference how he would respond to the argument that his bill is unconstitutional and trumped by federal law, he answered:\n\nWe do not think this is a constitutional law at all and I believe the federal government should not have a monopoly on what they deem is constitutional. The states created the federal government and we should have say as to what is constitutional as well. We are a party to the compact. So we have our duty to uphold the Constitution as well as they do.\n\nUnderstanding the facts of its formation demonstrates that although the government of the United States is a separate entity, it is not \u2014 indeed cannot be \u2014 superior to the states. Such a suggestion is illogical and there is not a single sentence of support for this supposition in all the annals of the history of the creation of the federal government.\n\nPhoto: Georgia State Capitol Building\n\n\n\nJoe A.
