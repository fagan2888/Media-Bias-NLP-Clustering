But the agency has not begun drafting privacy rules.\n\nWheeler had set a fall deadline to begin the privacy rules, but that slipped into 2016. In November, he said the rule-making process could get started in the next several months.\n\nIn their letter on Wednesday, the digital rights and consumer groups urged the commission to adopt rules to protect consumers from having their personal data shared or collected by Internet service providers without their explicit consent. They also want those companies to clearly disclose their data collection.\n\nIn addition, they said the privacy rules should require companies to disclose data breaches and hold them accountable for a failure to protect against an attack.\n\nMany opponents of net neutrality rules have criticized the FCC\u2019s new privacy mandate, accusing the agency of usurping authority from the Federal Trade Commission, which had policed the space for years. Opponents have also criticized the FCC\u2019s vague privacy guidance for Internet service providers.\n\nLast year, the FCC released an advisory that said it would initially judge providers on whether they are \"taking reasonable, good-faith steps\" to comply with the privacy provision of communications law, until tailored rules for the Internet can be developed.\n\nIt also recently signed a memorandum of understanding to work with the FTC on privacy.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The FCC's rule-making was supposed to start last fall.", "description": "The FCC's rule-making was supposed to start last fall.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The FCC's rule-making was supposed to start last fall.", "title": "FCC pressed to start drafting Internet privacy rules", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/266421-fcc-pressed-to-start-drafting-internet-privacy-rules", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/fcc_012915gn-3.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/266421-fcc-pressed-to-start-drafting-internet-privacy-rules", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-20T09:42-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Net neutrality, Privacy, Federal Communications Commission,,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-20T09:42:47-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/266421-fcc-pressed-to-start-drafting-internet-privacy-rules", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The FCC's rule-making was supposed to start last fall.", "card": "summary", "title": "FCC pressed to start drafting Internet privacy rules"}, "dcterms.title": "FCC pressed to start drafting Internet privacy rules"}, "article_summary": "When Internet service was reclassified last year as a telecommunications service, the FCC took on oversight of how Comcast, Verizon and other Internet service providers handle privacy.\nWheeler had set a fall deadline to begin the privacy rules, but that slipped into 2016.\nBut the agency has not begun drafting privacy rules.\nOpponents have also criticized the FCC\u2019s vague privacy guidance for Internet service providers.\nIn addition, they said the privacy rules should require companies to disclose data breaches and hold them accountable for a failure to protect against an attack."}
