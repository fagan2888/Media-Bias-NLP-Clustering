What we know is the man knows how to get a crowd, spark discussion, and steal media attention from his 16 GOP primary rivals. He has built his brand as a straight shooter on tough issues and unapologetic foil of political correctness.\n\nFriday night, the Donald show flew into Mobile, AL, and lit up a crowd estimated at 20,000 at the University of South Alabama football stadium. He left town on Trump Air dominating the weekend\u2019s media coverage, perplexing the pundits who were betting the Donald show would flame out.\n\nPolitical theater is prone to big stories like \u201cthe Donald\u201d. He\u2019s brash, cocky and unfiltered as he talks about dicey issues. He has simple solutions to immigration reform and the threat of ISIS. He promises to be a tough commander in chief in war zones and fierce negotiator in trade pacts. Healthcare is on his list as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriday night, he promised to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act. He called out insurers: \u201cThe biggest beneficiaries of Obamacare are the insurance companies\u2026 the insurance companies love it. They are so protected; they are making a fortune. We are going to end that \u2013 we are going to get so competitive by getting rid of the artificial barriers\u2026Just take a look at your premiums, your deductibles \u2013 they\u2019re so high it\u2019s impossible.\u201d He\u2019s on record saying the U.S. health system is the best in the world, needs less government intrusion and more free market-driven reform. End of story. Then he moved on to other issues and pitched his book, The Art of the Deal, unashamed. His teleprompter-less straight talk and the stadium fly-over by Trump Air reflect the uncanny showmanship the Donald is bringing to Campaign 2016.\n\nBut what if he had spent more time on healthcare Friday night? What if he had zeroed in on healthcare in Mobile? It\u2019s a market where big players dominate and consumer choice is limited. There\u2019s one major plan \u2013 Blue Cross of Alabama, and two major health systems, Providence and Mobile Infirmary. Utilization is high, health status is poor, and premiums are above the state\u2019s average and going up.\n\nIn vintage Trump-speak, he might have said \u201cYou\u2019re stupid. You\u2019re the problem: You are not very healthy and it\u2019s costing you. And your community isn\u2019t doing anything to fix it. That\u2019s why your premiums are going up. That\u2019s why you have more doctors and beds than you need. You\u2019re the problem..\u201d\n\nMight those cheers suddenly become jeers? Probably.\n\nThe fact is that communities like Mobile are more the rule than exception. Data show that a community\u2019s health\u2013 how its employers, payers, community leaders and providers address the healthiness of their citizens\u2013 is key to lower costs and better health. With due deference to efforts like accountable care organizations, bundled payments, and shared risk arrangements with payers, it takes a community to reform healthcare.\n\nSo if Mobile\u2019s a stage for fixing healthcare, the issue of community health must be on the table. In some communities, these efforts are underway; in most communities, these efforts are modest if at all.\n\nEven the Donald might be challenged to bring straight talk to healthcare. And straight talk about healthcare requires serious talk about the community\u2019s role. That could be the Donald effect.\n\nPhoto: Flickr user Gage Skidmore", "article_metadata": {"description": "What if Donald Trump had zeroed in on healthcare in Mobile?
