Two drivers are in the hospital, one in critical condition, after three cars collided late Friday morning in Meriden.

Police said Eileen Jenkins was driving her Prius eastbound on Liberty Street "at a high rate of speed" around 11:10 a.m. Friday.

She passed two cars stopped at a stop sign at the intersection of Liberty and Murray streets and was struck by a black Toyota Camry traveling northbound on Murray Street, according to police.

Jenkins' Prius then collided with a parked car on Liberty Street, police said.

Firefighters extricated Jenkins from her car. Police said she was taken to Hartford Hospital in critical condition. The driver of the Camry, identified as Marie Rivers, was taken to Yale-New Haven Hospital.

An accident reconstruction team is investigating the crash.

Anyone who witnessed the collision is asked to call Officer Christian Rodriguez at 203-630-6215 or Lt. Thomas Cossette at 203-630-6256.
