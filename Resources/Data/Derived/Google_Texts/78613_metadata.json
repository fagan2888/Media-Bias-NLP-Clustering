In California, almost half of the Hispanic population is eligible for Obamacare, but only 20 percent of those enrolled who have identified ethnicity are Hispanic, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThat means a lot of friends, families and neighbors \u2014 amigos, familia and vecinos, as Obama might say \u2013 aren\u2019t lining up.\n\nBesides the problems with the website, Obamacare is having trouble appealing to Hispanics because immigrants in the country legally fear seeking public assistance will hurt their citizenship chances (don\u2019t they know Democrats love citizens on the dole?). Others are afraid information they enter to enroll in Obamacare could get relatives who are here illegally deported, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThey don\u2019t need to worry, since the essentially lawless Obama administration is in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In an October memo cited by Bloomberg, the agency said it \u201cdoes not use information about such individuals or members of their household that is obtained for purposes of determining eligibility for such coverage as the basis for pursuing civil immigration enforcement action.\u201d\n\nIn other words, as el senor presidente might say, \u201cIf you like your illegal alien familia, you can keep your illegal alien familia.\u201d\n\nGracias.\n\nH/T: Weasel Zippers", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "In a sign of how desperately the administration needs to boost Obamacare numbers \u2013 or how poorly planned this whole operation was in the first place \u2013 the White House has\u00a0 released a video of President Obama pitching his \u201csignature\u201d achievement to Hispanics.
