That\u2019s why a bipartisan bill that would expand Medicare enrollees\u2019 ability to make care preferences known and fine tune their choices at a crucial time should be moving at a brisk clip through Congress instead of languishing.\n\nThe bill, known as the Care Planning Act of 2015, has been introduced by Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin are among the bill\u2019s influential five early cosponsors, along with Republican Sens. Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Susan Collins of Maine and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia.\n\nWarner introduced the bill last summer, shortly before Medicare announced a compassionate new end-of-life planning policy change, a reform supported by the Star Tribune Editorial Board. Medicare is the federal government\u2019s popular health insurance program for those 65 and older. Beginning in 2016, it will reimburse doctors who advise Medicare enrollees who wish to decide how they will be cared for in their dying days. Previously, this voluntary service had only been billable during a new enrollee\u2019s exam.\n\nWarner\u2019s bill goes a step further to better serve Medicare enrollees. The legislation laudably reflects that end-of-life planning is a dynamic process, especially when a diagnosis of a serious illness changes the theoretical to a reality. As patients adjust, it\u2019s understandable that many will want to update end-of-life plans. Those without a plan may wish to put a plan in place.\n\nThe Care Planning Act is a thoughtful measure to meet this need. \u201cIt creates a Medicare benefit for patient-centered care planning for people with serious illness. It will reimburse a team of health care professionals for providing a voluntary, structured discussion about the patient\u2019s goals, illness and treatment options,\u2019\u2019 according to information from Warner\u2019s office.\n\nIt\u2019s important to emphasize \u2014 after years of false \u201cdeath panel\u201d attacks on end-of-life planning \u2014 that the service is voluntary. Warner\u2019s bill also merits praise for its team approach. Having a variety of medical care professionals involved will give patients the most complete information about their options. Having the entire care team aware of those preferences will help ensure that these choices are respected in a fragmented care system.\n\nThe bill includes admirable steps to measure outcomes \u2014 health care jargon for determining whether the program is meeting its intended goal of reflecting a patient\u2019s choices in the treatment that is delivered. In addition, the bill would provide grants to increase public awareness of new end-of-life care planning options and the value of making decisions in advance.\n\nThe bill\u2019s bipartisan backing is a welcome advance, as well. For more than five years, toxic politics inspired by the death panel drivel regrettably made policymakers leery of reforms to add dignity and choice to final days. Medicare took over five years to make its recent end-of-life planning policy change. Congress should move much more quickly to make the compassionate Care Planning Act a reality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legislation backed by Klobuchar, Baldwin would expand choices for those with serious illnesses.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Legislation backed by Klobuchar, Baldwin would expand choices for those with serious illnesses.", "title": "Bill would allow patients to fine-tune care plans in face of serious illness", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/bill-would-allow-patients-to-fine-tune-care-plans-in-face-of-serious-illness/351542481/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144789058614537.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144789058614537.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Legislation backed by Klobuchar, Baldwin would expand choices for those with serious illnesses.", "title": "Bill would allow patients to fine-tune care plans in face of serious illness", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/bill-would-allow-patients-to-fine-tune-care-plans-in-face-of-serious-illness/351542481/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144789058614537.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144789058614537.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "death panels"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "end of life directive,Medicare,Care Planning Act,Sen.
