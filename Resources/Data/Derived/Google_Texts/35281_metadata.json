While the Air Force staked itself as the leader for such efforts, the Army was purchasing its own Predator platform known as Sky Warrior.\n\nIn 2008, Pentagon leaders ordered the Army and Air Force to combine their programs in a bid to save money, as they were essentially buying the same kind of drone from General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, though the aircraft differed in certain ways, such as the fuel they used.\n\nBut the services never acted on the order. The Air Force stopped buying the Predator, opting for its larger variant, the Reaper, which still flies in several versions in combat zones today.\n\nThe Pentagon plans to buy 29 Reapers in fiscal year 2016 at a cost of $821 million, up from 24 in 2015 and 20 in 2014. The drones cost about $14 million apiece.\n\nRelated: We Built a $335 Million Power Plant in Afghanistan that Can Barely Turn on Lightbulb\n\nThe increase isn\u2019t surprising, given President Obama\u2019s reliance on drones to conduct airstrikes against Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria and against other high-priority terror targets in other countries in the region, like Yemen.\n\nThe Reaper is also used by Britain, France and Italy, and has been ordered by the Netherlands.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A newly uncovered report by the Defense Department\u2019s own top watchdog says the Army and Air Force may have squandered more than $500 million to develop the same unmanned drone aircraft.", "title": "Did the Army and Air Force Squander $500 Million Fighting Over a Drone?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/13/Did-Army-and-Air-Force-Squander-500-Million-Fighting-Over-Drone", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02072013_drone_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/13/Did-Army-and-Air-Force-Squander-500-Million-Fighting-Over-Drone", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02072013_drone_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A newly uncovered report by the Defense Department\u2019s own top watchdog says the Army and Air Force may have squandered more than $500 million to develop the same unmanned drone aircraft.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda896\"", "article_summary": "A newly uncovered report by the Defense Department\u2019s own top watchdog says the Army and Air Force may have squandered more than $500 million to develop the same unmanned drone aircraft.\nWhile the Air Force staked itself as the leader for such efforts, the Army was purchasing its own Predator platform known as Sky Warrior.\nThe Air Force stopped buying the Predator, opting for its larger variant, the Reaper, which still flies in several versions in combat zones today.\nThe report lays bare the differences in how the two military branches approached their drone programs and how they employed them.\nThe Pentagon plans to buy 29 Reapers in fiscal year 2016 at a cost of $821 million, up from 24 in 2015 and 20 in 2014."}
