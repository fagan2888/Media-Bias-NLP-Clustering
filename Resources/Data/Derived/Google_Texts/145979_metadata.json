According to university officials, the brothers in Kappa Delta Rho have promoted a \u201cpersistent climate of humiliation\u201d for women.\n\nPenn State\u2019s chapter of Kappa Delta Rho made national headlines this past March, when police uncovered several private Facebook groups that fraternity brothers were using to collect and publish photos of naked women who appeared to be sleeping, passed out, or otherwise incapacitated.\n\nAccording to authorities, about 150 current and former members of Kappa Delta Rho had access to the photos, which were posted without the women\u2019s consent. After one of the woman found out her photo had been published to the first Facebook group, the brothers simply started a second one.\n\nWhen news broke about the Facebook photos, Penn State\u2019s Interfraternity Council (IFC), which oversees Greek organizations on campus, temporarily suspended the chapter. After launching its own investigation into the incident, the IFC ultimately concluded that Kappa Delta Rho shouldn\u2019t be stripped of its official recognition as a student group. IFC officials recommended that the brothers should be required to take steps to \u201cchange the culture of the fraternity\u201d through sexual assault prevention and bystander intervention training.\n\nBut this week, Penn State\u2019s Vice President for Student Affairs, Damon Sims, overrode that decision. Pointing out that \u201cthe sum of the organizational misbehaviors is far more than the University can tolerate from a student organization that seeks its imprimatur,\u201d Sims delivered a much harsher punishment than the IFC recommended and shut down the fraternity for next several years.\n\nPenn State spokeswoman Lisa Powers confirmed that the frat will essentially no longer be allowed to operate on campus. Powers told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that they won\u2019t be allowed to participate in any activities as a group, they won\u2019t be allowed to wear their Greek letters, and they may not mingle with other Greek organizations.\n\nThe university has not made its investigative report public, but Sims says that Penn State uncovered evidence of hazing and harassment at Kappa Delta Rho, including instances of members forcing pledges to run errands, clean the frat house, and participate in boxing matches. Pledges also were also required to use pornographic images to create stories about the \u201csex position of the day.\u201d Members, meanwhile, regularly posted embarrassing photos of women to their Facebook pages, used demeaning language to describe women, and persistently harassed two women.\n\n\u201cThe investigative report makes clear that some members of the KDR chapter promoted a culture of harassing behavior and degradation of women. These are not acceptable actions within a student organization that is recognized and supported by Penn State,\u201d Sims said in a statement. \u201cWe must respond accordingly, and we hope by doing so it is clearly understood that our University will not tolerate such actions.\u201d\n\nIn response to Sims\u2019 decision, Penn State President Eric Barron said his university is \u201cmaking a very strong statement about sexual harassment and sexual assault\u201d and he is \u201cnot going to go back on that stance that we\u2019re taking.\u201d\n\nThe conflict between Penn State officials and the university\u2019s IFC highlights a larger debate about how to properly spur reform within the Greek system, whose members have increasingly come under fire for bad behavior like hazing pledges, abusing drugs, sexually assaulting women, and displaying casual racism and misogyny.\n\nFraternities maintain that they should be allowed to work on reforming their culture from the inside. Members of national Greek organizations have recently been making more of an effort to talk to their members about sexual assault and consent, hoping to do their part to address the campus rape crisis by reframing misogynistic attitudes as unacceptable.\n\nHowever, particularly considering the evidence that fraternity brothers are statistically more likely to perpetrate sexual assault, some critics argue that harsher punishments are in order \u2014 suggesting that campus environments perhaps won\u2019t be safe until Greek life is disbanded altogether.\n\nStripping fraternities of their officials recognition doesn\u2019t always put an end to the controversies in this area. Last year, an unrecognized frat at American University that\u2019s technically not allowed to operate on campus sparked national backlash after some of their email exchanges were published. The emails revealed ongoing discussions about rape, assault, underage drinking, and drug abuse among the underground frat brothers, as well as conversations about how best to conceal this behavior.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The university says it's \"making a very strong statement about sexual harassment and sexual assault.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The university says it's \"making a very strong statement about sexual harassment and sexual assault.\"", "title": "Fraternity Shut Down For Creating A \u2018Persistent Climate Of Humiliation\u2019 For Women", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/05/27/3663014/penn-state-frat-investigation/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutterstock_220005613.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The university says it's \"making a very strong statement about sexual harassment and sexual assault.\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutterstock_220005613-321x214.jpg", "title": "Fraternity Shut Down For Creating A \u2018Persistent Climate Of Humiliation\u2019 For Women", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutterstock_220005613.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutterstock_220005613.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-27T09:30:19+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22df\"", "article_summary": "Health Fraternity Shut Down For Creating A \u2018Persistent Climate Of Humiliation\u2019 For Women CREDIT: ShutterstockA Penn State fraternity will be shut down for at least three years following a months-long university investigation that found significant evidence of sexual misconduct and harassment among its members.\nAccording to university officials, the brothers in Kappa Delta Rho have promoted a \u201cpersistent climate of humiliation\u201d for women.\nThese are not acceptable actions within a student organization that is recognized and supported by Penn State,\u201d Sims said in a statement.\nPenn State spokeswoman Lisa Powers confirmed that the frat will essentially no longer be allowed to operate on campus.\n\u201cThe investigative report makes clear that some members of the KDR chapter promoted a culture of harassing behavior and degradation of women."}
