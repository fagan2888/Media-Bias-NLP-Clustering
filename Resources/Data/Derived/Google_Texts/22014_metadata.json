It's really not about issues.\"\n\nCiboski has seen it for many years,.saying the Pompeo Tiahrt race is shaking out to be a real mudslinger.\n\n\"The primaries are always dangerous in this regard for any candidate. There's always going to be mudslinging. You're under a lot of scrutiny because it's about the personalities involved.\"\n\nHe says the commercials by the \"Kansans For Responsible Government\" political action committee are hurling the most mud in hopes of some of it sticking on Pompeo.\n\nFrom the day he announced, former Congressman Todd Tiahrt, has campaigned on connecting Congressman Pompeo to Obamacare.\n\nBut Ciboski says Pompeo hasn't supported Obamacare.\n\n\"IS THERE ANYTHING TO IT THOUGH? No. That's what I'm getting ready to say. What it is is it's part of a bill, part of an overall major funding bill or something like that. Do you as a member of congress do you want to vote against that when there are other things in that you really want? Congressman Pompeo has been adamant again, again and again.

He's opposed to it very vociferously.\n\nCiboski says don't expect much to change between now and the August 5th primary.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The 4th district race heats up with mudslinging says WSU Political Scientist Ken Ciboski.", "language": "english", "author": "Chris Frank", "og": {"description": "The 4th district race heats up with mudslinging says WSU Political Scientist Ken Ciboski.", "title": "Pompeo - Tiahrt race heating up", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Pompeo---Tiahrt-race-heating-up-266825401.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/E26/E05/E26E0583119F4986AEF85C59CD7A0D12", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/AEE/A24/AEEA24B02BD74E71BFA50C6B0A27F2DD.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The 4th district race heats up with mudslinging says WSU Political Scientist Ken Ciboski.", "title": "Pompeo - Tiahrt race heating up", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Pompeo---Tiahrt-race-heating-up-266825401.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Mike-Pompeo-and-Todd-Tiahrt.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Pompeo - Tiahrt race heating up", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Pompeo  Tiahrt race heating"}, "article_summary": "Ciboski has seen it for many years,.saying the Pompeo Tiahrt race is shaking out to be a real mudslinger.\nFrom the day he announced, former Congressman Todd Tiahrt, has campaigned on connecting Congressman Pompeo to Obamacare.\nRepresentative Mike Pompeo is being challenged by the former holder of that seat -- Todd Tiahrt.\nMike Pompeo and Todd TiahrtThe race for the Kansas 4th District Congressional seat is about as hot as the July weather right now.\nWichita State University Political Science Professor Ken Ciboski says the race is following a familiar pattern."}
