No, it\u2019s not soccer, lacrosse, gymnastics, basketball or even flag football.\n\nIt\u2019s cheerleading, also known as \u201ccompetitive cheer\u201d or \u201cacrobatics and tumbling,\u201d as the University of Maryland called the activity before killing it as a varsity sport during budget cuts last year.\n\nActually, my initial question was a bit of a trick, because some states don\u2019t recognize cheerleading as a sport, and neither does the NCAA, a major problem unto itself, some believe. Without the oversight of government and big-time sports, some of the people running cheer squads and competitions aren\u2019t held to the same safety, training and coaching standards applied to other sports, even rough ones such as football \u2014 though cheerleading does make considerable effort to police itself.\n\nWith or without government regulation, cheerleading poses by far the greatest risk of catastrophic injury to young female participants of any sport. According to a 2012 report and policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics, cheerleading \u201caccounted for 65 percent of all direct catastrophic injuries to girl athletes at the high school level and 70.8 percent at the college level\u201d between 1982 and 2009.\n\nThe overall number is small \u2014 110 closed-head injuries, skull fractures and cervical spine injuries that resulted in \u201cpermanent brain injury, paralysis or death\u201d over that period \u2014 and the number of participants in cheerleading is large, an estimated 3.6 million nationwide, the academy found. (A number of other girls suffered cardiac problems and heat stroke.) But the disproportionate number of severe injuries in this one activity is striking.\n\nSo as our sons head back to the gridiron this fall, and we head back to the stands to watch them, it might be worth taking a glance at what\u2019s happening with the daughters who have traditionally urged us both on. We\u2019ve begun a national debate about the concussion risks in youth football \u2014 President Obama said last season he was unsure he\u2019d let his son play if he had one \u2014 but there doesn\u2019t appear to be a corresponding discussion about our daughters. At least not one I\u2019ve heard about.\n\nIn part this is because the non-catastrophic injury rate in cheerleading is quite low. But it\u2019s also because some people don\u2019t know that cheer has left the sidelines in the past two decades to become a sport of tumbling, flying through the air and building tall human pyramids.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that the general impression has evolved as fast as the sport has,\u201d said Cynthia LaBella, lead author of the Academy of Pediatrics paper and an associate professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine. \u201cIt takes time for these things to register.\n\n\u201cThese girls \u2014 and boys \u2014 are at risk for injury,\u201d she added. \u201cThis should be considered a sport, and these folks should be treated as athletes, not as entertainers.\u201d Boys make up about 4 percent of cheerleaders.\n\nMariah Rivera, a cheerleader at the University of Maryland, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee as a junior at Centreville High School. She was at a national competition, spinning twice in mid-air while completing a flip, when she landed awkwardly.\n\n\u201cI tried to take a step, fell, then I got up and finished\u201d the routine, she said, including serving as a base in a pyramid. Her coach had to carry her off the stage.\n\nStill, she likes what cheerleading has become and wouldn\u2019t have it the old way. \u201cI feel we have more of a challenge these days,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wish people would recognize us. . . . A lot of people think cheerleading is standing on the sideline yelling, \u2018Go team.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe does that, too, she said, for Maryland\u2019s football and basketball teams. (Though U-Md. cut cheer as a school-funded varsity sport, the squad still cheers.) Rules restrict the routines that can be done on a hard basketball court, but sometimes she finds herself on concrete at the football stadium. It doesn\u2019t faze her. \u201cSome of my teammates are really nervous when it comes to concrete,\u201d she said. Rivera gets a little nervous only when a tumbling pass reminds her of her knee injury.\n\nJim Lord, executive director of the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators, said the sport has come a long way in addressing deficiencies noted by the Academy of Pediatrics. The number of catastrophic injuries has dropped every year since 2005-06, when there were 12, to just three in 2009-10, the last year for which data are available.\n\nThe sport\u2019s governing body also has spent considerable time and effort improving training for coaches, changing rules and raising awareness of the sport\u2019s dangers. Outlawing one difficult maneuver significantly reduced the number of concussions in a single year. Another rule change mandates that higher-level skills be performed only on mats. You\u2019d think that\u2019s common sense, but Lord said that because some high school cheer teams are not officially supported by schools, they are left to practice in hallways or parking lots.\n\nAlso in the common-sense category is the idea that kids not be allowed to try the more difficult and dangerous moves before they\u2019ve mastered lower-level skills. But if your cheer \u201ccoach\u201d is, say, a physics teacher untrained in the sport, he or she might not always require that.\n\nFinally, Lord said, every kid should have access to an athletic trainer and every team should have an emergency plan. LaBella would add that every kid should have a physical before taking part.\n\n\u201cWe want every state association to recognize that cheerleading is athletic, and it needs the same support as anything else,\u201d Lord said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/09/ll12MISFITS-cropHF.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Some 70 percent of catastrophic injuries in women\u2019s college sports happened in cheerleading"}, "article_summary": "By Lenny BernsteinThe Washington PostQuick, name the sport that causes the largest number of catastrophic injuries among girls and young women.\nWith or without government regulation, cheerleading poses by far the greatest risk of catastrophic injury to young female participants of any sport.\n\u201cThis should be considered a sport, and these folks should be treated as athletes, not as entertainers.\u201d Boys make up about 4 percent of cheerleaders.\nFinally, Lord said, every kid should have access to an athletic trainer and every team should have an emergency plan.\nBut if your cheer \u201ccoach\u201d is, say, a physics teacher untrained in the sport, he or she might not always require that."}
