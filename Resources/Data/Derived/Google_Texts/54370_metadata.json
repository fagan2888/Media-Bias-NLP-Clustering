He proposes a major new initiative to develop drugs tailored to the genetic characteristics of individual patients, but he expresses deep concern about the costs of such specialty medicines for consumers and for the Medicare program.\n\nHe has asked Congress to let Medicare officials negotiate prices with drug manufacturers \u2014 a practice explicitly forbidden by current law. At the same time, the administration, through the National Institutes of Health, is off and running with its \u201cprecision medicine\u201d initiative, meant to develop personalized therapies like those now on the market to treat illnesses like cancer and cystic fibrosis at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars. Prices over $50,000 or $100,000 a year are not unusual.\n\nMr. Obama announced the precision medicine initiative in his State of the Union address and followed up with a $215 million proposal, now under review in Congress. The proposal has received broad bipartisan support and has generated excitement among scientists, who are drafting plans to explore the molecular and genetic basis for disease with a national research cohort of a million or more volunteers.\n\n\u201cThe possibilities are boundless,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a recent White House event. Precision medicine \u201cgives us one of the greatest opportunities for new medical breakthroughs that we have ever seen,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the initiative is successful, scientists said, it could lead to new diagnostic tests and treatments for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s and other illnesses. One-third of the money would be used to seek cancer treatments using genetic information.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe excitement of scientists and patients\u2019 advocates is tempered by the knowledge that personalized medicines already on the market are costly. Patients often pay much of the expense out of pocket.\n\nDr. Francis S. Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, expressed concern about the price of these drugs. \u201cIs that the path that precision medicine inexorably is going to take? I would certainly hope not,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLong term,\u201d Dr. Collins said, \u201cit\u2019s likely that this approach can reduce health care costs by providing a more effective way to treat disease in an individualized way, so that treatments are more likely to work for a subset of individuals who have a particular form of a disease or disorder.\u201d\n\nHowever, he went on, \u201cI\u2019d be reluctant to say that in the short term those kinds of rewards are going to occur. I\u2019d love it if they did.\u201d\n\nEvery month researchers report that they have discovered genetic factors that appear to increase the likelihood that a person will develop some type of cancer or other disease. And every month consumer groups, doctors, health insurance companies or state officials express alarm about the skyrocketing cost of the specialty drugs.\n\n\u201cPlanning for the precision medicine initiative is going like gangbusters,\u201d said Sharon F. Terry, chief executive of the Genetic Alliance, an advocacy group for patients. \u201cBut I have grave concerns about the cost of medicines that will be developed. The prices that we\u2019ve been seeing for these treatments are just not sustainable.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama pointed to cystic fibrosis as a disease that was being treated effectively with a drug that helps people with specific mutations in a particular gene. One of those patients, William Elder Jr., attended his State of the Union address.\n\nWhat Mr. Obama did not say is that the list price for a one-year supply of the drug, Kalydeco, is $311,000, according to its manufacturer, Vertex Pharmaceuticals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCystic fibrosis clogs the lungs with mucus. Mr. Elder, 27, said in an interview that the cost of his treatments had been covered by insurance, and he described the drug as a godsend. He vividly recalled the day in 2012 when, after numerous hospitalizations, he was able to breathe through his nose for the first time in years. \u201cIt was exhilarating,\u201d he said.\n\nFive years after passage of the Affordable Care Act, drug prices are emerging again as a political issue. On a presidential campaign stop in Iowa this month, Hillary Rodham Clinton said the government needed to drive a harder bargain with drug companies. In the latest monthly poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the health care priority cited most often, by Democrats and Republicans alike, was making high-cost drugs affordable to people who need them.\n\nThe cost of analyzing a person\u2019s genes, using a technique known as DNA sequencing, has declined sharply in recent years, but the cost of medicines that target specific genes or mutations is high and climbing higher.\n\nA few examples show how expensive these drugs have become.\n\nFor a standard course of treatment with Blincyto, a new leukemia medicine sold by Amgen, the price is about $178,000, the company said. The government designated Blincyto a breakthrough therapy and gave it accelerated approval in December after finding that it \u201cmay offer a substantial improvement over available therapies.\u201d\n\nFor Xalkori, a lung cancer drug made by Pfizer for people with a genetic abnormality detected in a government-approved test, the list price is $12,000 a month. Treatments typically last seven months, the company said.\n\nAnd for Gleevec, a targeted therapy to treat a certain type of chronic myeloid leukemia, Novartis charges $9,210 a month, and most patients will need lifelong therapy, said Eric Althoff, a spokesman for the company.\n\nAll four companies \u2014 Vertex, Amgen, Pfizer and Novartis \u2014 said they had patient assistance programs to provide financial help or free medicines to people who could not afford the drugs.\n\nDespite such programs, Dr. John D. Bennett, president of the Capital District Physicians\u2019 Health Plan, which serves 460,000 people in upstate New York, said: \u201cThe rising cost of specialty drugs has the potential to bankrupt our health care system. What good is a miracle drug if you can\u2019t afford it?\u201d\n\nMore than 40 million people have prescription drug coverage through Medicare. The overall cost has been significantly less than originally projected in 2003. But an influential federal panel, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, told Congress last month that the \u201cuse of high-cost drugs poses a big challenge\u201d for the government and for Medicare beneficiaries, who typically pay 25 percent to 33 percent of the cost of specialty drugs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt would be unfortunate if we make scientific progress and then price patients out of the drugs we develop through that progress,\u201d said Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150427220856, "twitter": {"description": "Efforts to create precision medicines that use genetic information to aid treatment can cost well over $50,000 and as high as $311,000, raising issues for users and the Medicare system.", "title": "Obama Proposes That Medicare Be Given the Right to Negotiate the Cost of Drugs", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/us/obama-proposes-that-medicare-be-given-the-right-to-negotiate-the-cost-of-drugs.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003646022"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/us/obama-proposes-that-medicare-be-given-the-right-to-negotiate-the-cost-of-drugs.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003646022", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/us/obama-proposes-that-medicare-be-given-the-right-to-negotiate-the-cost-of-drugs.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Obama Proposes That Medicare Be Given the Right to Negotiate the Cost of Drugs", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 27, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Medicare Payment Advisory Commission", "keywords": "Drugs (Pharmaceuticals),Medicare,Genetics and Heredity,Obama  Barack,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Medicine and Health,Medicare Payment Advisory Commission", "news_keywords": "Medicare", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Efforts to create precision medicines that use genetic information to aid treatment can cost well over $50,000 and as high as $311,000, raising issues for users and the Medicare system.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Efforts to create precision medicines that use genetic information to aid treatment can cost well over $50,000 and as high as $311,000, raising issues for users and the Medicare system.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 27, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2015-04-29", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Medicare Payment Advisory Commission", "published": "2015-04-27", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "28health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150429145518, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/us/obama-proposes-that-medicare-be-given-the-right-to-negotiate-the-cost-of-drugs.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Efforts to create precision medicines that use genetic information to aid treatment can cost well over $50,000 and as high as $311,000, raising issues for users and the Medicare system.", "title": "Obama Proposes That Medicare Be Given the Right to Negotiate the Cost of Drugs"}, "pdate": 20150427, "des": "Medicine and Health", "articleid": 100000003646022, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Obama Proposes That Medicare Be Given the Right to Negotiate the Cost of Drugs", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc556\"", "article_summary": "He has asked Congress to let Medicare officials negotiate prices with drug manufacturers \u2014 a practice explicitly forbidden by current law.\nAnd every month consumer groups, doctors, health insurance companies or state officials express alarm about the skyrocketing cost of the specialty drugs.\nWhat good is a miracle drug if you can\u2019t afford it?\u201dMore than 40 million people have prescription drug coverage through Medicare.\nDr. Francis S.
