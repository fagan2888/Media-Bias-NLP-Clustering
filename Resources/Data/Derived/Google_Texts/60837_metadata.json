Bernard Sanders on Monday said that GOP rival Ben Carson\u2019s support for overturning Roe vs. Wade to make abortion illegal was emblematic of the Republican Party\u2019s \u201cextreme right-wing agenda.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders, a Vermont independent and avowed socialist, delivered his assessment of Mr. Carson and Republicans on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\nJoy Behar, a co-host of the daytime talk show, came to the defense of the GOP. \u201cThey\u2019re not all like that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cToo many of them really are. I mean, you just heard Ben Carson\u2019s statement,\u201d Mr. Sanders said of the retired neurosurgeon who is a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s on the fringe, I think,\u201d Ms. Behar said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Mr. Sanders responded.\n\nMr. Carson said Sunday that he would \u201clove\u201d to see overturned the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 ruling that made abortion legal nationwide.\n\nHe said he opposed abortion for unwanted pregnancies, including in cases of rape and incest, but could understand reasons for an exception in the rare case when a mother\u2019s life was at risk.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a reasonable person and if people can come up with a reasonable explanation of why they would like to kill a baby, I\u2019ll listen,\u201d Mr. Carson said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders explained the Republican agenda for the audience of \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are guys who basically believe, this is their agenda more or less: huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this county; cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, federal aid to education; virtually all of them are against a woman\u2019s right to chose; very few of them support gay rights, the right of gay people to marry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is their agenda, their extreme right-wing agenda.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
