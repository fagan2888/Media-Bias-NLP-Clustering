It also had to deal with higher temporary staffing, snow removal and utility costs.In addition, North Shore-LIJ is still in the early stages of launching and running its own health insurance operation , North Shore-LIJ CareConnect, which started offering commercial and Medicaid managed-care plans late last year. The plans are available both on and off New York's insurance exchange, created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nNorth Shore-LIJ is still working to staff and build its insurance arm, which has driven up expenses, executives said. In the first half of 2014, North Shore-LIJ's health insurance companies brought in more than $32 million in premium revenue.North Shore-LIJ's operating margin in the first six months of this year (PDF) totaled 1.1%, down from 1.7% in the same period in 2013. Revenue increased 4.9% to $3.6 billion as more volumes shifted to the outpatient setting. However, expenses increased at a faster 5.5% clip, leaving the system with a $38.1 million operating surplus. That's down more than a third from $57.2 million recorded in the first half of 2013.However, like many other health systems , investment income made up for much of the decline on the operations side. North Shore-LIJ's total surplus rose almost 25% to $122.2 million. That equated to a 3.4% overall margin, compared with 2.9% in the first six months last year.North Shore-LIJ has 15 hospitals, according to its website, and is the dominant provider on New York's Long Island\u2014and it's in the process of nabbing several facilities outside of its main service area.
