We all know the stock market\u2019s been doing great. So the richest among us are doing just fine. But what about the poor? What about working-class folks? What about folks who work in industries that liberals in Washington don\u2019t approve of, like coal?\n\n\n\n\u201cHow have these Americans been doing in the Obama economy?\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, record numbers of them are having a terrible time.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne indicator is the growth of the food stamp program. Consider this: since this President took office, the number of Americans who\u2019ve signed up for food stamps has skyrocketed \u2014 it\u2019s up almost half.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd nearly 4 out of 10 unemployed Americans are trapped in long-term unemployment.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s worse, the poorest Americans are the ones who\u2019ve often had the hardest time recovering in this economy. Yes, the President took office in the midst of an economic crisis. No one disputes that. But for many Americans, a terrible situation seems to have only gotten worse during over the course of this administration.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo for the President to turn around and try to blame his political opponents for the suffering we see out there, well, it takes nerve. It also assumes a collective case of national amnesia. Remember: these are the same folks who gave us the stimulus, who gave us tax increases, and who gave us Obamacare. All of it was done in the name of helping the little guy \u2014 in the name of greater equality. And what\u2019s it given us? This mess.\n\n\n\n\u201cRecord numbers of long-term unemployed, record numbers on food stamps, people losing their health care plans, others seeing the premiums shoot up when they can least afford it. And now, another call for a government fix. Washington Democrats have shown almost no interest for five years in working together on ways to create the kind of good, stable, high-paying jobs that people really want and need.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a real disservice, first and foremost, to those who are struggling the most out there \u2014 from the college graduate who suddenly finds herself wondering why she\u2019s got huge student loans debts but no prospects for work, to the 50-year old dad who\u2019s worked his whole adult life but suddenly can\u2019t find a job that meets either his needs or his potential.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd yet this administration\u2019s proposed solution is just to slap another Band-Aid from Washington on it and call it a day. Yes, we should work on solutions to support those who are out of work through no fault of their own. But there is no excuse to pass unemployment insurance legislation without also finding ways to create good, stable, high-paying jobs \u2013 and also trying to find the money to pay for it. So what I\u2019m saying is, let\u2019s support meaningful job creation measures, and let\u2019s find a way to pay for these UI benefits so we\u2019re not adding to an already unsustainable debt.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Administration seems almost totally disinterested in solutions that don\u2019t put government in the lead, and it seems nearly incapable of working with those who don\u2019t share that belief.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd that, in many ways, is precisely why we\u2019re in this situation.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s only when you believe government is the answer to all your problems that you talk about unemployment insurance instead of job creation, and the minimum wage instead of helping people reach their maximum potential\n\n\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s time to get away from \u2018temporary\u2019 government programs, and give the American people the tools they need to drive an economy that truly works for them and their families.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe could start with one of the real bright spots in our economy: energy \u2013 a field that\u2019s poised to help our economy create millions of jobs if only the administration would get out of the way.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother area where we should be able to work together is health care.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy almost any metric, affordability, accessibility and even the ratio of cancellations to enrollments, this law has imposed more pain and distress than many had thought possible. Centrists, moderates, conservatives and just about any sensible person outside the Democrat congressional delegation in Washington has long understood this.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut now, even the Left is starting to come to grips with the painfully obvious fact that the law it fell in love with can\u2019t possibly work. Last week, one of the Great Pooh-Bahs of the Left admitted that \u2018Obamacare is awful,\u2019 calling it \u2018the dirty little secret many liberals have avoided saying out loud.\u2019 I don\u2019t agree with this man on much else, including his broader ideas on health care, but it\u2019s good to hear a grandee of the Left at least admit this much.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd his words point to a larger truth: that the President\u2019s Amen chorus had ample opportunity to speak truth to power when it mattered, and that most chose to stay silent. For that, the law\u2019s apologists have left the American people to pay the price. Let me read you part of a letter I recently received from Jennifer Bell, a resident of Hopkinsville:\n\n\n\n\u2018I have less coverage than I did before. I didn't get to keep MY policy that I was happy with. Every dollar I have to pay more is a dollar taken from my family. I never thought that in America, we would be forced to purchase something we cannot afford. We worked hard to get to where we are. Now we are being forced to pay more in order to pay for someone else's insurance. How is that fair?\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cI hear you, Jennifer. Everyone on this side of the aisle hears these concerns.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s something else: many Kentuckians are finding that Obamacare is about more than just higher premiums and cuts to Medicare \u2013 it\u2019s also about a lack of access to doctors and hospitals. One of the most left-wing papers in my state recently ran a big story about how many Obamacare coverage networks exclude so many of the hospitals my constituents want to use.\n\n\n\n\u201cA few weeks ago, the Majority Leader basically said that criticisms of Obamacare amounted to jokes. Well, he might like to think this is all some \u2018joke\u2019 \u2013 but the constituents who\u2019ve been writing me about the consequences of this failed law don\u2019t see it that way. I know this must weigh heavily on our Democrat colleagues. I know they can\u2019t see so many Americans hurting because of decisions they made and feel nothing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, let me say this to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It\u2019s a new year, a time for new beginnings.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re ready to work with us, Republicans are here.\n\n\n\n\u201cTogether, we can start over on health care. Together, we can give the American people the kind of health reform they really deserve \u2013 reform that can lower costs and improve the quality of care.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut, just like with solving the problems of joblessness and unemployment, it\u2019s something that we can only do together.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following remarks on the Senate floor regarding the administration\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds need to focus on meaningful job creation:\r\n\r\n\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOver the past several days we\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdve seen a number of stories about how Democrats plan to spend the year gearing up for the November elections by making an issue out of the economic hardships faced by Americans.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIn other words, instead of working on reforms that would actually help people overcome the challenges so many of them face in this economy, Democrats plan to exploit these folks for political gain. \r\n \r\n\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds pretty amazing if you think about it. \r\n \r\n\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdre now in the sixth year of the Obama Administration.
