Now that the new health care exchanges are about to open, potential buyers of the new plans are trying to understand the law. Your Money columnist Tara Siegel Bernard has answers to some of the most perplexing questions and is standing by to answer more from readers. You can find her full column here.\n\nHere are a few:\n\nQ. How can I find out if my doctor accepts exchange-based insurance?\n\nA. Many insurance providers\u2019 networks of doctors and hospitals will be narrower than typically found in commercial insurance, as my colleague reported earlier this week. Just because your doctor accepts, say, a Blue Cross plan provided by your employer doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the doctor will take the same carrier\u2019s plan offered on the exchange.\n\nThe plans will be required to provide a directory of their providers, so inspect them carefully.\n\nQ. How will I know if my drugs are covered by the plans?\n\nA. The exchanges must include a summary of benefits and coverage for each plan, including information about co-payments for generic, brand-name and specialty drugs. There should also be a Web link to the plan\u2019s list of covered drug.\n\nQ. If I have employer-based coverage, can I go to the exchange for coverage?\n\nA. You can, but you probably won\u2019t want to. Your employer\u2019s plan is usually a better deal. Many employers heavily subsidize your premiums and you can pay for your coverage using pretax dollars, something you can\u2019t do if you buy coverage on the exchange.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20130927161530, "BN": "affordable-care-act", "per": "Bernard, Tara Siegel", "keywords": "Bernard Tara Siegel,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jane Bornemeier", "SCG": "affordable-care-act", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Jane Bornemeier", "byl": "Jane Bornemeier", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/09/27/answers-to-some-questions-about-health-care-exchanges/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "Your Money columnist Tara Siegel Bernard has answers to your questions about the new health care exchanges opening on Oct. 1.", "card": "summary", "title": "Answers to Some Questions About Health Care Exchanges"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/affordable-care-act/post", "description": "Your Money columnist Tara Siegel Bernard has answers to your questions about the new health care exchanges opening on Oct. 1.", "CG": "U.S.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 27, 2013", "article": {"section": "U.S.", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1380312930, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-10-01T17:50:43-04:00"}, "utime": 20131001175043, "PUD": 20130927, "pdate": 20130927, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "In Practice", "description": "Your Money columnist Tara Siegel Bernard has answers to your questions about the new health care exchanges opening on Oct. 1.", "title": "Answers to Some Questions About Health Care Exchanges", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/09/27/answers-to-some-questions-about-health-care-exchanges/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v3/../../packages/images/nytdesign/2013/national/inPractice/inPractice-75.png", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Answers to Some Questions About Health Care Exchanges", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 27, 2013"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda1bd\"", "article_summary": "Now that the new health care exchanges are about to open, potential buyers of the new plans are trying to understand the law.\nMany insurance providers\u2019 networks of doctors and hospitals will be narrower than typically found in commercial insurance, as my colleague reported earlier this week.\nYour employer\u2019s plan is usually a better deal.\nYour Money columnist Tara Siegel Bernard has answers to some of the most perplexing questions and is standing by to answer more from readers.\nThe exchanges must include a summary of benefits and coverage for each plan, including information about co-payments for generic, brand-name and specialty drugs."}
