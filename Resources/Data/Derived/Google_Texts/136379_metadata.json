Now 27, he's making his mark in the world of poetry.\n\nVuong is the 2016 winner of the Whiting Award for poetry and published a new book of poems called Night Sky with Exit Wounds, weaving his personal stories of growing up with his family memories of life in Vietnam.\n\nHis poem \"Someday I'll Love Ocean Vuong\" was published last year in The New Yorker:\n\nOcean, don't be afraid.\n\nThe end of the road is so far ahead\n\nit is already behind us.\n\nDon't worry. Your father is only your father\n\nuntil one of you forgets. Like how the spine\n\nwon't remember its wings\n\nno matter how many times our knees\n\nkiss the pavement. Ocean,\n\nare you listening? The most beautiful part\n\nof your body is wherever\n\nyour mother's shadow falls.\n\nHere's the house with childhood\n\nwhittled down to a single red tripwire.\n\nDon't worry. Just call it horizon\n\n& you'll never reach it.\n\nHere's today. Jump. I promise it's not\n\na lifeboat. Here's the man\n\nwhose arms are wide enough to gather\n\nyour leaving. & here the moment,\n\njust after the lights go out, when you can still see\n\nthe faint torch between his legs.\n\nHow you use it again & again\n\nto find your own hands.\n\nYou asked for a second chance\n\n& are given a mouth to empty into.\n\nDon't be afraid, the gunfire\n\nis only the sound of people\n\ntrying to live a little longer. Ocean. Ocean,\n\nget up. The most beautiful part of your body\n\nis where it's headed. & remember,\n\nloneliness is still time spent\n\nwith the world. Here's\n\nthe room with everyone in it.\n\nYour dead friends passing\n\nthrough you like wind\n\nthrough a wind chime. Here's a desk\n\nwith the gimp leg & a brick\n\nto make it last. Yes, here's a room\n\nso warm & blood-close,\n\nI swear, you will wake\u2014\n\n& mistake these walls\n\nfor skin.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn his mother naming him \"Ocean\"\n\nShe was working in a nail salon, and like many Vietnamese immigrants she learned English just talking to customers. One summer day she said, \"It's so hot, I wish I was at the beach,\" except she pronounced it in a word that resembled a derogatory term.\n\nAnd so the customer suggested, \"why not ocean?\"\n\nWhen she learned what that word was, and what it meant \u2014 which is a body of water that touches both America and Vietnam, she decided to rename me Ocean. I always say that I come from a line of poets even though my family cannot read or write. As you can see, her mind was already a mind geared and keen towards the imagination.\n\nOn preserving his Vietnamese culture in the U.S.\n\nI was raised in a one-bedroom apartment in Hartford. It was in a way a small village of Vietnamese women who raised me, so Vietnam was preserved in this American city \u2014 the city of Mark Twain, Wallace Stevens, Harriet Beecher Stowe. And here we are, a group of seven Vietnamese people speaking only Vietnamese every day \u2014 eating Vietnamese food with a little KFC sprinkled in.\n\nOn writing about war in his poetry\n\nIt feels quintessentially very American to me to be an inheritor of war. My life and my poems try to investigate that intersection of what it means to be an American body born out of violence, making sense out of violence.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "NPR Staff", "og": {"site_name": "WAMU 88.5", "description": "When he was 2 years old, Ocean Vuong's family immigrated from Vietnam to the U.S. He tells NPR's Michel Martin that he didn't learn to read English until he was 11.
