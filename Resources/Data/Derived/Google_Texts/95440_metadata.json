His apparent intimate familiarity with what Boonstra and others have experienced is a remarkable feat that places him in the pantheon of soothsayers next to Merlin the Magician. Either that or the problem of tax data being leaked out of the Internal Revenue Service is much, much worse than anyone ever imagined.\n\nIt strains credibility to believe that every single story being told about the harmful impact of the Affordable Care Act is totally inaccurate. As usual, Reid blames those responsible for the message, the individual American citizens funding the effort against the progressive agenda whom the Nevada senator once again accuses of distorting the truth.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Democratic Party.]\n\nThis raises the question, however, of why the progressives are \u2013 save for their effort to muzzle the critics of the ACA \u2013 generally silent. Why, if Obamacare has done such a good job of controlling costs and insuring the uninsured, hasn\u2019t George Soros or some other well-heeled progressive piggy bank moved to bankroll competing commercials singing its praises.\n\nSouth Dakota Sen. John Thune, the chamber\u2019s number three Republican, stood up to Reid\u2019s bullying by releasing a statement that called him out for having \u201cquestioned the validity of the stories that Americans throughout the country have been sharing about the struggles they are facing thanks to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nHe could have used stronger language. Yet his observation that Reid \u201cand any Democrat who agrees with him, owes an apology to all Americans who are suffering under this disastrous law and whose personal stories he has dismissed as \u2018untrue\u201d is precisely on point. Has the Democratic Party become so shallow, so morally bankrupt, so hungry for power that it can so easily and so venomously dismiss the concerns expressed by John and Jane Q. Public \u2013 or are its operatives merely seething at the way the GOP has taken a page from its playbook to sensationalize the failure of government to deliver as promised?\n\n[Check out our editorial cartoons on President Obama.]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "peter-roff/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Harry Reid Attacks Cancer Patient Julie Boonstra, Ignores Obamacare's Flaws", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Sen.
