New Hampshire and Maine health insurance regulators are working together to monitor a financially struggling health insurance co-operative that serves customers in both states.

Lewiston, Maine-based Community Health Options co-op was the only entity in the nation to make money on the federal government’s Affordable Care Act public insurance exchanges in 2014. However, it suffered big losses in 2015.

The struggling co-op stopped accepting new customers in December. Around a week ago, the Maine Bureau of Insurance announced that it would monitor and post financial updates about the co-op on monthly basis.

New Hampshire Insurance Commissioner Roger Sevigny announced that his top priority is to make sure that the state residents are treated fairly. In New Hampshire, the co-op is one of the five entities that are offering individual ACA plans.

After experiencing higher-than-expected enrollment and claims costs, the co-op posted a loss of $31 million in 2015. Now, it has set aside $43 million to cover this year’s possible losses. Officials have warned that premiums will likely significantly go up.

With more than 71,500 customers in Maine, the struggling co-op is the biggest provider of individual health insurance in the state. In New Hampshire, it has nearly 12,700 customers.
