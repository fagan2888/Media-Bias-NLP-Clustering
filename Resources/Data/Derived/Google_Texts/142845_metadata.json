Mike Michaud, covers 80 percent of the state\u2019s area and the northern half of its population. The median household income is $41,500 \u2013 $11,000 less than the rest of Maine and less than any other district in New England.\n\nDemocrat Emily Cain, an Orono state senator, and Republican Bruce Poliquin, a former state treasurer from Oakland, have sparred largely along party lines on economic issues this election season, with independent candidate Blaine Richardson advocating that government generally play a hands-off role in policy. Pocketbook issues, including Social Security, health care, energy and wages, should go a long way in deciding the outcome of the race Nov. 4.\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE\n\nThe context: The 2nd District is the oldest district in Maine, the state with the nation\u2019s oldest median age. That makes for heavy reliance on federal programs such as Social Security, the national retirement system and Medicare, the health care program for seniors.\n\nHowever, the programs are marching toward insolvency: The main part of Medicare is projected to run out of money in 2030, while Social Security is expected to become insolvent shortly after that. The two parties differ largely on ways to fix that.\n\nCain supports boosting the amount of money flowing into the Social Security system by increasing the minimum wage and increasing the maximum amount of income \u2013 now $117,000 \u2013 on which federal payroll taxes must be paid. On Medicare, she would support allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices with companies to scale costs back.\n\n\u201cEvery senior in Maine deserves to retire with dignity,\u201d she said at a recent debate.\n\nPoliquin doesn\u2019t support changes for current retirees, but he would raise the retirement age for future beneficiaries to account for longer life spans, as well as means-testing Social Security so richer recipients receive less of a benefit.\n\nHe often invokes his 24-year-old son, Sam, in saying there must be a \u201cfrank conversation\u201d with younger Americans about the programs.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to have Social Security and Medicare down the road, we need to reform that program to save it,\u201d he said.\n\nRichardson says the programs must be saved for current retirees, but younger Americans should look to private savings and investment accounts and shouldn\u2019t trust the federal government to manage the system effectively.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve clearly demonstrated they couldn\u2019t handle the program we all invested in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious problem and we need to address it immediately.\u201d\n\nAFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\nThe context: The 2nd District has long had higher rates of people without health insurance than the rest of Maine. According to Census estimates for 2013, 85,000 people were uninsured there, about 8,000 more than in the 1st District.\n\nCain is a supporter of the health care law and, like many in her party, would support a single-payer, universal health care system.\n\n\u201cWe have great models, whether it\u2019s in veterans\u2019 benefits in health care or in Medicare itself,\u201d she said at a debate during the primary season. \u201cWe have models that show us when more people are covered, costs are lower.\u201d\n\nPoliquin has called for repeal of the health care law, but he has said he supports parts of it.\n\nHe supports a provision banning insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, but opposes parts that he says \u201ckill jobs,\u201d including an impending mandate that will require businesses with 50 or more people to provide health care to employees.\n\n\u201cSo you have many small businesses \u2026 who are very, very hesitant to hire that 50th worker,\u201d he said.\n\nRichardson would fully repeal the law, calling it \u201cfar from affordable.\u201d\n\nENERGY\n\nThe context: Maine has the lowest energy costs in New England, but among the highest in the country. That has inhibited manufacturing in the 2nd District: Soaring natural gas prices were one factor blamed for the upcoming closure of the Verso paper mill in Bucksport.\n\nCain opposes Keystone XL, a proposed pipeline that would carry oil from the tar sands of western Canada to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, and supports a carbon tax, which Poliquin has criticized her for. She has supported natural gas expansion, but she says it should be seen as a transition to renewable sources like tidal, wind and solar power, calling them \u201crenewable sources right here in our state that will create jobs.\u201d\n\nPoliquin supports Keystone XL and has said he favors increasing the production of all forms of domestic energy, including oil and natural gas.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that we fully develop, in this country, all sources of energy, because when you increase production, you drive down the price,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re able to do that, our mills will be more competitive.\u201d\n\nRichardson supports Keystone XL, saying the federal government is \u201cin the way\u201d of lowering costs for consumers. He has touted natural gas as a way to help save manufacturing jobs in the 2nd District.\n\nMINIMUM WAGE\n\nThe context: The federal minimum wage is $7.25, while Maine\u2019s is $7.50. According to a report from Oxfam, an anti-poverty group, 23 percent of workers in the 2nd District \u2013 the highest share of any congressional district in New England \u2013 would benefit from a federal minimum wage hike to $10.10, which President Barack Obama wants.\n\nCain has said she supports an increase as a matter of fairness and to help save Social Security, but she said before taking the vote, she would talk with business owners across the district to make sure the effect of an increase is understood.\n\n\u201cNo one who works full time should live in poverty,\u201d she said.\n\nPoliquin, in debates, has somewhat dodged questions on the topic. He hasn\u2019t ruled out supporting a compromise effort to raise the federal minimum wage. But if past is prologue, he\u2019ll be a hard sell: As state treasurer in 2012, he wrote an op-ed in the Sun Journal newspaper to oppose a state minimum wage increase to $9 an hour.\n\n\u201cI will not support anything in Congress that kills jobs and hurts our economy,\u201d he has said. \u201cWe need to make sure we grow the economy so there are more jobs and better-paying jobs and career jobs, not just minimum-wage jobs.\u201d\n\nRichardson opposes a federal minimum wage increase, saying the U.S. must \u201cget the heavy thumb of the government off the backs\u201d of businesses. Deregulation would spur more jobs and higher wages, he has said.\n\nMichael Shepherd \u2014 370-7652\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @mikeshepherdme", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrat Emily Cain, Republican Bruce Poliquin and independent Blaine Richardson weigh in on Social Security, Medicare and the minimum wage.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "Democrat Emily Cain, Republican Bruce Poliquin and independent Blaine Richardson weigh in on Social Security, Medicare and the minimum wage.", "title": "Candidates for Maine's 2nd Congressional District talk about jobs, the economy - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/poliquin-cain-richardson.jpg", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-10-25T23:40:10-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/10/25/candidates-for-maines-2nd-congressional-district-talk-about-jobs-the-economy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/poliquin-cain-richardson.jpg", "description": "Democrat Emily Cain, Republican Bruce Poliquin and independent Blaine Richardson weigh in on Social Security, Medicare and the minimum wage.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Candidates for Maine's 2nd Congressional District talk about jobs, the economy - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2014-10-25T16:42:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-25T23:40:10-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Cain is a supporter of the health care law and, like many in her party, would support a single-payer, universal health care system.\nSOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICAREThe context: The 2nd District is the oldest district in Maine, the state with the nation\u2019s oldest median age.\nThe 2nd District, now represented by U.S. Rep.
