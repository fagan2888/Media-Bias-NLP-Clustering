The is\u00adsue also ap\u00adplies to some who likely qual\u00adi\u00adfy for cov\u00ader\u00adage from Med\u00adic\u00adaid, the health in\u00adsur\u00adance program for the state\u2019s low\u00adest-in\u00adcome resi\u00addents.\n\nThe root of the prob\u00adlem, Johnson said, is that peo\u00adple are try\u00ading to enroll in cov\u00ader\u00adage for 2015 through a new ac\u00adcount, rath\u00ader than the ac\u00adcount they cre\u00adat\u00aded to ob\u00adtain cov\u00ader\u00adage for 2014.\n\n\u201cBy de\u00adsign, the sys\u00adtem says: \u2018Whoa, whoa, whoa \u2014 we can\u2019t enroll this per\u00adson un\u00adtil we re\u00adsolve what\u2019s going on with this oth\u00ader ac\u00adcount that has the same so\u00adcial se\u00adcuri\u00adty num\u00adber on it,\u2019?\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s hold\u00ading those cases up, and they need in\u00adter\u00adven\u00adtion to get re\u00adsolved.\u201d\n\nThe glitch ap\u00adpar\u00adent\u00adly catch\u00ades only those who didn\u2019t qual\u00adi\u00adfy last year for one of the public health in\u00adsur\u00adance programs, he said, but are now el\u00adi\u00adgi\u00adble for such cov\u00ader\u00adage in 2015.\n\nMinnesota launched the MNsure health ex\u00adchange in 2013 to im\u00adple\u00adment the fed\u00ader\u00adal Af\u00adford\u00ada\u00adble Care Act, which re\u00adquires al\u00admost all Ameri\u00adcans to have health in\u00adsur\u00adance or pay a tax pen\u00adal\u00adty. The roll\u00adout was rock\u00ady, in\u00adclud\u00ading one prob\u00adlem that prompt\u00aded the state to re\u00adproc\u00adess some 30,000 ap\u00adpli\u00adca\u00adtions to make sure MNsure was prop\u00ader\u00adly con\u00adnect\u00ading peo\u00adple with sub\u00adsi\u00addies. Dur\u00ading much of De\u00adcem\u00adber 2013, prob\u00adlems prompt\u00aded thou\u00adsands of peo\u00adple to wait hours on hold for help from an over\u00adwhelmed MNsure call cen\u00adter.\n\nThe cur\u00adrent open en\u00adroll\u00adment pe\u00adriod start\u00aded Nov. 15, and call cen\u00adter waits have been much short\u00ader. MNsure users re\u00adport the website has been work\u00ading bet\u00adter, al\u00adthough of\u00adfi\u00adcials ac\u00adknowl\u00adedge it\u2019s far from per\u00adfect. In De\u00adcem\u00adber, MNsure of\u00adfi\u00adcials de\u00adtailed five glitch\u00ades, say\u00ading each prob\u00adlem af\u00adfect\u00aded any\u00adwhere from a few doz\u00aden to a few hun\u00addred peo\u00adple.\n\nAs of Jan. 6, about 42,000 people had used MNsure to enroll in public health insurance programs during the current open enrollment period. Another 33,000 people had used the exchange to buy private health insurance.\n\nJohnson said Mon\u00adday that DHS had been track\u00ading cases af\u00adfect\u00aded by the lat\u00adest glitch for a few months, but the num\u00adber of peo\u00adple af\u00adfect\u00aded spiked in De\u00adcem\u00adber. By Jan. 6, about 160 peo\u00adple who con\u00adtacted DHS about the prob\u00adlem had their cases re\u00adsolved, he said.\n\nFor the 7,500 peo\u00adple still af\u00adfect\u00aded by the prob\u00adlem, DHS says it will send them no\u00adti\u00adces about their cov\u00ader\u00adage as cases are re\u00adsolved.\n\nThe ul\u00adti\u00admate fix to the prob\u00adlem, Johnson said, would stop peo\u00adple using the MNsure website from cre\u00adat\u00ading a du\u00adpli\u00adcate ac\u00adcounts, rath\u00ader than flag\u00adging du\u00adpli\u00adcates as peo\u00adple try to enroll. There\u2019s no timeline for when such a fix will be im\u00adple\u00adment\u00aded, he said, al\u00adthough state of\u00adfi\u00adcials are work\u00ading on it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pre\u00advent\u00ading them at the point of en\u00adroll\u00adment,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt would prob\u00ada\u00adbly work bet\u00adter if they were be\u00ading caught at the point that they were cre\u00adat\u00ading the ac\u00adcount.\u201d\n\nAnother way to prevent the problem, Johnson said, would be for website users to work within their original accounts. The state asks that people \u201ckeep track of your passwords and user names, so you\u2019re able to sign in and work through a single account in managing your health care,\u201d he said.\n\n\u00a92015 the Star Tribune (Minneapolis)", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "The state Department of Hu\u00adman Services has dedicated 30 employees to help peo\u00adple af\u00adfect\u00aded by the snag and ex\u00adpects to re\u00adsolve the sit\u00adu\u00ada\u00adtion in about 10 days.", "pubDate": "2015-01-13", "og": {"title": "MNsure Website Flaw Keeps 7,500 People From Enrolling"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/computing", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Computing Platforms", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe27\"", "article_summary": "Minnesota launched the MNsure health ex\u00adchange in 2013 to im\u00adple\u00adment the fed\u00ader\u00adal Af\u00adford\u00ada\u00adble Care Act, which re\u00adquires al\u00admost all Ameri\u00adcans to have health in\u00adsur\u00adance or pay a tax pen\u00adal\u00adty.\nIn De\u00adcem\u00adber, MNsure of\u00adfi\u00adcials de\u00adtailed five glitch\u00ades, say\u00ading each prob\u00adlem af\u00adfect\u00aded any\u00adwhere from a few doz\u00aden to a few hun\u00addred peo\u00adple.\nThe is\u00adsue also ap\u00adplies to some who likely qual\u00adi\u00adfy for cov\u00ader\u00adage from Med\u00adic\u00adaid, the health in\u00adsur\u00adance program for the state\u2019s low\u00adest-in\u00adcome resi\u00addents.\nAs of Jan. 6, about 42,000 people had used MNsure to enroll in public health insurance programs during the current open enrollment period.\nThe ul\u00adti\u00admate fix to the prob\u00adlem, Johnson said, would stop peo\u00adple using the MNsure website from cre\u00adat\u00ading a du\u00adpli\u00adcate ac\u00adcounts, rath\u00ader than flag\u00adging du\u00adpli\u00adcates as peo\u00adple try to enroll."}
