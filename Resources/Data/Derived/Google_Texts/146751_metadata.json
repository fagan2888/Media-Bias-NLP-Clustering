You do only live once, after all, but most people also only get one shot at retirement.\n\nMore than a third of Americans say that they\u2019re not saving for tomorrow because they are unwilling to sacrifice their quality of life today and would rather spend their money on things like dinners and vacations, according to a new study by Charles Schwab.\n\nMaintaining their current lifestyle was the number one reason that people aren\u2019t saving for retirement, followed by unexpected expenses (31 percent), covering monthly bills (31 percent), and paying off credit card debt (24 percent).\n\nEven if they\u2019re not prioritizing saving for retirement, they do want to work for a company that offers a retirement plan. Nine in 10 of those surveyed said that they would think twice about taking a job if the company did not offer a 401(k) plan, and 80 percent said they wouldn\u2019t be confident in their ability to save for retirement without a 401(k) plan.\n\nRelated: Here are 7 Ways People Screw Up Their 401(k)s\n\nThose who do have 401(k) plans said they don\u2019t feel they\u2019re getting enough guidance. Nearly half of those surveyed said that the materials explaining investment options are more confusing than those explaining health and medical benefits.\n\nMore than two-thirds of employees said that they want personalized investment counseling, but only 12 percent are currently getting professional advice. About half of those surveyed said that they would expect better performance if they used professional advice.\n\nNearly three-quarters of people said they\u2019d rather have their 401(k) balance grow by 15 percent this year than lose 15 pounds. Maybe if they stopped eating dinners out, they could have both.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Americans may be taking their #YOLO lifestyle a bit too far.
