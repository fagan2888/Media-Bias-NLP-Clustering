If you listen to Susan Lundy, a 35-year health insurance veteran and owner of Larkspur, Calif.-based Benefits by Design, that trend will only continue.\u201cI spend my life putting out fires and calling billing offices. For that I get $8 a month!\u201d Lundy laughed. \u201cNo one is going to stay in this business who does health insurance only.\u201dTo plump up profit, many agencies have expanded their product offerings and received their P/C license. Greg Hellmich, vice president of agent distribution at Smart and Simple insurance development, has another solution\u2014offering a supplemental, or gap, plan alongside a high-deductible ACA-compliant plan.Gap plans offer historically higher premiums than ACA-compliant plans, Hellmich noted, and may even offer lower payments and better benefits for clients.Hellmich suggested that a $6,000 silver plan for $209.45 a month, paired with a $5,000 gap plan for $139.04 a month would still come to a lower premium payment than a platinum plan.\u201cPurchasing these two plans together saves your client almost $100 a month and provides first-dollar benefits for hospital/ICU stays, ER visits, office visits and so forth,\u201d Hellmich said. \u201cSince few people are accustomed to or comfortable with such high out-of-pocket costs, you\u2019re also providing psychological relief, which is just as valuable a service as the financial savings.\u201dHowever, some in the industry aren\u2019t too sure that gap plans will be the producer sector\u2019s salvation.Mark Brown, president of M. Brown & Associates, has been active in the financial services industry for more than 25 years and has yet to find a gap product he feels comfortable recommending in lieu of a more comprehensive health plan or health savings account.\u201cIt is without a question not a slam dunk,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI know [gap plans] exist, I know they\u2019re out there, but I just don\u2019t see where they pay for themselves. They\u2019d have to be very, very inexpensive to cover the difference, to take up just a little of the premium, yet still pay out a decent amount of money if something occurs.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this an awfully long time and I just don\u2019t see it working,\u201d he added.Brown noted that he recently worked with a client considering supplementing a high-deductible plan with gap coverage for employees, and the total expense came out to be more than what the client would have paid with a more comprehensive, low-deductible plan.Brown added that selling gap policies simply because they pay higher commissions is not a good reason for producers to push the products.\u201cWhen we go to these higher deductible plans, the premiums come down and the commissions go down with them, but the question is, are they saving the client money, or have they just found another product they can sell?\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just that people like selling more products.\u201dDan Eich, a producer in Olympia, Wash., said his office was still too busy digging out from the last minute rush for health insurance to note how the ACA would affect his sales of gap insurance. He did have a hunch, however.\u201cMy initial thought would be I certainly think that it\u2019s hurt it,\u201d Eich said. \u201cBut maybe that will change as the year goes on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/is-gap-coverage-the-solution-to-low-aca-commissions-16938.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Greed(300x250).jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "The debate over pushing gap coverage to offset low ACA commissions has divided the agent and broker community.", "title": "Is gap coverage the solution to low ACA commissions?"}, "twitter": {"description": "The debate over pushing gap coverage to offset low ACA commissions has divided the agent and broker community.", "title": "Is gap coverage the solution to low ACA commissions?", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/is-gap-coverage-the-solution-to-low-aca-commissions-16938.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Greed(300x250).jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The debate over pushing gap coverage to offset low ACA commissions has divided the agent and broker community.", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef88\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI know [gap plans] exist, I know they\u2019re out there, but I just don\u2019t see where they pay for themselves.\nIf you listen to Susan Lundy, a 35-year health insurance veteran and owner of Larkspur, Calif.-based Benefits by Design, that trend will only continue.\u201cI spend my life putting out fires and calling billing offices.\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s restrictions on how insurers spend their premium dollars have compressed producer commissions to the point that many have left the industry.\n\u201cNo one is going to stay in this business who does health insurance only.\u201dTo plump up profit, many agencies have expanded their product offerings and received their P/C license.\nHe did have a hunch, however.\u201cMy initial thought would be I certainly think that it\u2019s hurt it,\u201d Eich said."}
