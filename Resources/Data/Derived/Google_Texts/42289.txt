A GOP official in Arizona mocked President Barack Obama in a Facebook post on Thursday, saying he's "shucking and jiving" on Obamacare.

Bruce Ash, Republican National Committeeman from Arizona, linked to this BuzzFeed post with the following comment:

Some people wonder why I cannot figure out why I believe Obama is shucking and jiving on ObamaCare.

Others have used "shuck and jive" in reference to Obama before. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) defended her use of the phrase in October 2012, saying there was "nothing remotely racist" about saying "President Obama's shuck and jive shtick with these Benghazi lies must end."

Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh has also used the phrase, calling Obama's operation in Syria "Operation Shuck and Jive."
