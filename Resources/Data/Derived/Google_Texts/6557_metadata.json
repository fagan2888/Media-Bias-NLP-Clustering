That\u2019s up seventeen cents (eight percent) from last month \u2013 and up a whopping fifty-seven cents (33.3 percent) from it low of $1.71 back in February.\n\nHere in South Carolina, the average currently stands at $2.05. Once again, that\u2019s the lowest price available anywhere in the country \u2013 although it\u2019s up sixteen cents (or 11.6 percent) from our last check-in and up fifty-eight cents (37.9 percent) from its low of $1.53 just three months ago.\n\nAlso, cheap gas is of little consolation to our dirt poor citizens \u2013 who pay a disproportionately higher percentage of their income due to their anemic incomes.\n\nAnyway, for those of you visually-inclined, take a look at this chart \u2026\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\n(Chart via AAA)\n\nGas prices generally rise during warmer months as demand increases, although at this point they remain well below last year\u2019s levels ($2.68 nationally and $2.38 here in South Carolina).\n\nAlso there is speculation that the recent surge \u2013 a spike not seen since 2009 \u2013 could be a fleeting phenomenon.\n\n\u201cThere may be a peak hit in the next few weeks as refiners finish remaining maintenance and crank up production,\u201d the website Gas Buddy noted. \u201cGasBuddy expects the national average (to) be $2.29/gallon on Memorial Day and peak in the $2.30s in early June before declining and spending much of the summer in the low $2 per gallon range.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s good \u2026 although as we\u2019ve long noted low gas prices don\u2019t translate into expanded consumerism (especially with those pesky Obamacare mandates hanging out there).\n\nWhat are gas prices like in your area?
