What is older than the idea that some exalted elite know what is good for us better than we know ourselves? Obama uses the rhetoric of going \u201cforward,\u201d but he is in fact going backward to an age when despots told everybody what they had better do and better not do.\n\nObamacare is old in yet another way. One of the fundamental reasons why private medical insurance has gotten so expensive is that politicians in state after state have mandated what this insurance must cover, regardless of what individuals want.\n\nInsurance covering everything from baldness treatments to sex-change operations is a lot more expensive than insurance covering only major illnesses that can drain your life\u2019s savings. Now these mandates have moved up from the state to the federal level.\n\nInsurance is an institution for dealing with risks. It is a costly and counterproductive way to pay for things that are not risks \u2014 such as annual checkups, which are known in advance to occur every year.\n\nYour annual checkup does not cost any less because it is covered by insurance. In fact it costs more, because the person who is insured must pay premiums that cover not only the cost of the checkup itself, but also the costs of insurance-company paperwork.\n\nIf automobile insurance covered the cost of paying for your oil changes, would that make oil changes cheaper or more expensive? Obviously more expensive, since additional people would have to be paid to become involved in handling the transaction, instead of your simply paying directly out of your own pocket to the people who changed your oil.\n\nDifferent people have different risks and different willingness to take care of risks themselves, instead of paying to have them transferred to an insurance company. But politicians in state after state have mandated what must be covered by insurance, regardless of what policy-holders and insurance companies might agree on if left free to make their own choices.\n\nThat has made it impossible to get less-expensive insurance that covers only costly but rare medical problems.\n\nPoliticians love to play Santa Claus by handing out favors to voters, while depicting insurance companies as Scrooge when they raise insurance premiums to cover the costs of government mandates.\n\nThis kind of political game has been played for generations in other areas besides insurance.\n\nMunicipal transit used to be privately owned and run, but politicians would not allow the fares to be raised to a level that would cover costs. The net result was that private companies were driven out of business and local governments took over, saddling the taxpayers with the costs that fares don\u2019t cover.\n\nThat is what \u201csingle payer\u201d means in any context \u2014 a government monopoly that virtually guarantees worse service. Why would anyone want that for something as crucial as medical care?\n\nOne reason, of course, is the ever seductive illusion of something for nothing, an illusion spread by glib politicians, posing as saviors of the public against villains in the private sector.\n\nYet another way in which Obamacare is an old political story is that it began as supposedly a way to deal with the problem of a segment of the population \u2014 those without health insurance.\n\nBut, instead of directly helping those particular people to get insurance, the \u201csolution\u201d was to expand the government\u2019s power over everybody, including people who already had health insurance that they wanted to keep.\n\nSince there has never been a society of human beings without at least some segment with some problem, this is a formula for a never-ending expansion of government power. Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid are all on record as believing in a \u201csingle payer\u201d system \u2014 that is, a government monopoly able to impose its own will on everybody.
