Instead, the two sides brokered a deal to defuse the tension.\n\nRegardless of the motive, the Obama administration and its allies warned the Pyongyang to halt its actions immediately.\n\n\u201cWe will repeat our call that North Korea should refrain from irresponsible provocation that aggravate regional tensions,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday during a press briefing.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said a rocket launch would be a \"serious provocation.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Weeks after narrowly averting a potential armed conflict with its neighbor to the south, North Korea is once again saber-rattling, this time claiming it has resumed work at a major nuclear site.", "title": "North Korea Warns the United States: Our Nukes Are Ready", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/16/North-Korea-Warns-United-States-Our-Nukes-Are-Ready", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/northkorea-kim_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/16/North-Korea-Warns-United-States-Our-Nukes-Are-Ready", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/northkorea-kim_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Weeks after narrowly averting a potential armed conflict with its neighbor to the south, North Korea is once again saber-rattling, this time claiming it has resumed work at a major nuclear site.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba63\"", "article_summary": "If true, that would violate a 2007 agreement reached through \u201csix party\u201d talks between the United States, China, Russia, Japan and both North and South Korea.\n\u201cWe will repeat our call that North Korea should refrain from irresponsible provocation that aggravate regional tensions,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday during a press briefing.\nWeeks after narrowly averting a potential armed conflict with its neighbor to the south, North Korea is once again rattling its sabers, this time claiming it has resumed work at a major nuclear site.\nThe official claimed the main nuclear hub at Yongbyon, which boasts a uranium enrichment plant and a plutonium production reactor, is operating normally.\nRelated: The Situation on the Korean Peninsula Is Worse Than You RealizedNorth Korea conducted its third nuclear test in 2013, which prompted international condemnation and additional economic sanctions."}
