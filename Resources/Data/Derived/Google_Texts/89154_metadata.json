Gov. Dan Patrick and the entire state Senate Republican Caucus sent a letter Monday to the White House demanding that program benefits be tied to work requirements and personal accountability, including cost sharing and fines for missed appointments.\n\nThe two-page letter also called for Texas to be exempted from some fees and regulations included in President Barack Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"The federal government's continued refusal to grant our state more autonomy over our own Medicaid program leaves us with an unsustainable cost growth trajectory and frustrating, inflexible mandates that prevent effective program management,\" the officials wrote.\n\nThe demands are similar in some ways to what other GOP-led states have requested as part of compromises that have led to acceptances of Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe changes the Texas senators are seeking would go much further, however, because they would apply to all Medicaid recipients, not just those newly eligible for coverage.\n\nIn a news conference scheduled to align with Texas Independence Day, state Sen. Charles Schwertner framed the changes as a prerequisite to any discussions about expanding Medicaid in Texas.\n\n\"Until we recieve the kind of federal flexibility we're calling for here today -- the kind needed to fundamentally reform Texas's existing Medicaid program in a way that preserves it for our most vulnerable Texans -- any expansion of Medicaid in Texas is simply not worth discussing,\" said Schwertner, R-Georgetown, a doctor who chairs the Senate Health and Human Services Committee.\n\nSchwertner and Patrick noted in the news conference that Medicaid now covers about 4 million Texans, up from 2.1 million in 2002. The program, which is funded jointly by the federal and state government, now makes up 29 percent of the Texas budget, they said.\n\nTexas Democrats quickly pointed out the per-recipient cost of Medicaid has been declining.\n\nThe Democrats dismissed the proposal as unserious and unlikely to be accepted by the federal government.\n\n\"A good way to judge the seriousness of a proposal is to look at its content -- and health savings accounts for children are among the many ridiculous ideas suggested in this one,\" state Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, said in a statement. \"This is a nonstarter and everyone knows it.\"\n\nIn Texas, most Medicaid recipients are children.\n\nEd Espinoza, executive director of Progress Texas, a liberal group, cited a part of the letter in which the Republicans said they should get more flexibility in Medicaid because, they said, they have proven to be \"reliable stewards of state and federal funds.\" That is far from true, Espinoza said, given the recent scandals related to no-bid contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\"The only things Republicans have proven to be reliable for are contracting controversies, cover-ups, and mismanaged health care funds,\" Espinoza said. \"Why should they be trusted?\"\n\nThe full list of changes requested by the group is below:\n\n\u2022 personal accountability requirements, including cost-sharing, missed appointment fees, and health savings accounts;\n\n\u2022 tailored benefit packages;\n\n\u2022 work requirements for able-bodied adults;\n\n\u2022 reduced provider administrative burdens;\n\n\u2022 asset testing as part of eligibility criteria;\n\n\u2022 reinstatement of the active renewal process;\n\n\u2022 customized certification periods;\n\n\u2022 exemption from the ACA (Affordable Care Act) health insurance issuer fee;\n\n\u2022 exemption from ACA maintenance of effort requirements; and\n\n\u2022 exemption from hospital presumptive eligibility.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "vf": {"section": "news", "unique_id": "chron-article-6110144"}, "og": {"site_name": "Houston Chronicle", "description": "AUSTIN -- Calling the current cost of Medicaid \"unsustainable,\" Texas Lt.
