Singer Brittany Howard is a force of nature, her howl ranging from a controlled yelp to a full on-wail. Her prowess as a guitarist shouldn't be underrated, either. The group's new material melds '70s soul with southern rock in a purely singular way.\n\n\n\nAs far as rock acts, headliner AC/DC once again had a strong showing, with their butt-rock standing the test of time even if the stage-show -- complete with fireworks that seemed to fire long after they were supposed to -- was a retread directly of last week's, and early in the day 66-year-old throwback soulman Charles Bradley stunned his mid-sized audience with dance moves that would have been impressive even if he were 30 years younger.\n\n\n\nThe night's surprises were mostly relegated to the dance tent: pop singer Ciara spent some time onstage with producer R3Hab for two songs, while rapper DMX and AlunaGeorge, among others, popped up with \"Turn Down For What\"-guy DJ Snake.\n\n\n\nRumors abound, though, that Drake will trade in Madonna's awkward make-out for a series of other guest stars on Sunday, which could turn his lackluster set into something memorable -- if it materializes.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Weekend two of Coachella 2015 kicked off on Friday (April 17) with performances by Alabama Shakes, Ciara, AC/DC and many more.
