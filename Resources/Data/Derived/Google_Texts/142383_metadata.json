It\u2019ll also pick up work with the IRS, Securities and Exchange Commission, Agriculture and Labor.\n\nAcentia also will add $210 million in annual revenue and 1,000 employees.\n\nThe deal is expected to close during the company\u2019s fiscal 2015 third quarter \u2013 April 1 to June 30.\n\nMaximus CEO Richard Montoni said that Acentia complements his company\u2019s business process management offerings. The bulk of Maximus\u2019 business is built on taking over and running a business process for an agency. For example, it does Medicaid eligibility appeals work, and it runs a welfare-to-work program in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe acquisition also \u201cincreases our ability to leverage technology, innovation, subject matter expertise and business development resources,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAcentia will be a new growth platform for the company, he said.\n\nOnce the deal closes, Acentia will fall under the leadership of Tom Romeo, who leads Maximus\u2019 federal services business. He\u2019s led strong growth in the business since taking over in 2010, when federal work accounted for about $75.9 million in annual revenue. At the end of the company\u2019s fiscal 2014, federal work stood at about $289 million. Overall, Maximus had revenue of $1.7 billion in 2014. [Read my January interview with Romeo.]\n\nThe company is best known for its state and local work, which accounted for 55 percent of revenue last year. The company also has a significant international business led by work it is doing in the U.K. and Australia.\n\nRomeo said he sees three major things that Acentia adds to Maximus:\n\nIT capabilities that will make Maximus\u2019 business process services business more efficient and more profitable.\n\nBringing Maximus\u2019 business outcome approach to Acentia\u2019s IT projects and making them more effective.\n\nThe synergies between the companies two customer bases.\n\n\u201cWe have very little overlap and where there is, it is very complementary,\u201d he said.\n\nAll of Acentia will be integrated under Romeo as part of Maximus Federal Services. Acentia CEO Todd Stottlemyer has agreed to stay on through the integration process. The rest of the Acentia management team will stay on board, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is really transformational for Maximus Federal Services,\u201d Romeo said.\n\nThere was no single contract or customer that made Acentia an attractive target. \u201cThat\u2019s what I really liked the most about them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a balanced book of large contracts.\u201d\n\nThose contracts include NIH CIO-SP3, Alliant, the CDC Information Management Services contract known as CIMS, the Army\u2019s R2-3, and the IRS TIPSS-4 contract.\n\nThese will all be new contracts for Maximus, and while it is a subcontractor on a couple of them, it has limited visibility into the opportunities coming out under these contracts, he said. When they are the prime, that will all change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see everything,\u201d he said.\n\nCIO-SP in particular is being heavily used by the Census Bureau as it gears up for the 2020 census, which Romeo said is an important opportunity for Maximus.\n\nAs the deal moves toward its closing, the two companies will be diving deeper into their business pipelines looking for new opportunities.\n\nAcentia, which is owned by the private equity group Snow Phipps, worked with the investment bank Houlihan Lokey to set up the sales process. Romeo said he\u2019s sure there were other interested buyers.\n\n\u201cWe went through our process and did our due diligence and we were the winning bidder,\u201d he said.\n\nMaximus worked with Avascent, BDO and Hogal Lovells LLP as its advisors. In addition to Houlihan Lokey, Acentia worked with the law firm Holland & Knight.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Maximus, Acentia, government contracting, mergers and acquisitions, M&A", "og": {"url": "https://washingtontechnology.com/blogs/editors-notebook/2015/03/maximus-buys-acentia.aspx", "image": "https://washingtontechnology.com/~/media/GIG/People/W/nickwakeman150.gif", "site_name": "Washington Technology", "description": "Maximus is acquiring Acentia in a $300 million deal that significantly adds to its federal business by bringing on new customers and new contract vehicles.", "title": "Maximus makes $300M federal play -- Washington Technology"}, "description": "Maximus is acquiring Acentia in a $300 million deal that significantly adds to its federal business by bringing on new customers and new contract vehicles."}, "article_summary": "The bulk of Maximus\u2019 business is built on taking over and running a business process for an agency.\n\u201cThis is really transformational for Maximus Federal Services,\u201d Romeo said.\nOnce the deal closes, Acentia will fall under the leadership of Tom Romeo, who leads Maximus\u2019 federal services business.\nMaximus makes $300M federal playMaximus is buying Acentia in a $300 million deal that adds significantly to the company\u2019s federal business by bringing on new customers and new contract vehicles.\nOver the last four years, Maximus has been building its federal work, much of that driven by requirements of the Affordable Care Act."}
