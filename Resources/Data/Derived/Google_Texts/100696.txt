(WSMV) Every town has one. The house all the local kids avoid, claiming it's haunted. Now some Clarksville, Tennessee Realtors have a plan to use the scary stories around their new property to turn them into a sale.

"Everyone's scared to go to it because they say it's haunted," says neighbor Joyce Stepp."We don't go anywhere close to this house at night," adds Deidra Pinckney.

Shrouded in trees since 1876, stories have been told about the house on Halloween night for decades.

But a sign reveals the truth about the house on Madison Street. It's not haunted. There's no room full of flies, no closet portal to another dimension and no voices saying to "Get out!"

This house is clean.

Dorothy Havens and Toniann Thompson aren't paranormal investigators.

They're Realtors with Keller Williams looking to sell with a sign listing their latest property with the clarification, "Not Haunted."
