This includes a 90 days\u2019 post-care watch.\n\nThe reason behind this move is the cost of post-acute care, which is a common expense for patients.\n\nGragnolati compared his five acute care systems with his time at his previous employer, Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\n\"One of my hospitals had 42 percent going to rehab, and another hospital had 97 percent,\" he said. \"At Johns Hopkins, one of the best in the nation, 15 percent went to rehab. Why do we have that clinical variation?\"\n\nThe U.S. outspends many European countries, as well as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, by at least 50 percent. In 2014, more than 17 percent of the gross domestic product, about $9,523 per person, was spent on health care, Gragnolati said.\n\nThe only way to curb that spending is by innovation, and specifically innovation geared towards the country's largest health care consumers: millennials.\n\nMillennials demand flexibility, choices and apps, and don't do well with lengthy explanations of benefits.\n\nThe future is consumer reviews of a health facility, Gragnolati said.\n\nWith his position on the board of the American Hospital Association, he often gets asked about the effect the presidential election can have on the ACA.\n\nHe believes that, even if Obamacare is repealed, it is unlikely that the trend will change, and he is a huge proponent of price transparency.\n\n\"There is lots of money pouring into health care, both from private equity and institutional,\" he said, so innovation is here to stay.\n\n\"Are we going to throw 26-year-olds back into the uninsured market? Are we going to go back to pre-existing conditions and the prejudice associated with that? I don't think so,\" Gragnolati said. \"Consumerism is here to stay.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "The U.S. does spectacular doctors well, but not reliable doctors, according to someone who should know.", "title": "Atlantic Health's Gragnolati explains need for innovation in health care | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20160413/NJBIZ01/160419910/atlantic-healths-gragnolati-explains-need-for-innovation-in-health-care", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20160413/NJBIZ01/160419910/AR/0/AR-160419910.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "The U.S. does spectacular doctors well, but not reliable doctors, according to someone who should know.", "title": "Atlantic Health's Gragnolati explains need for innovation in health care | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20160413/NJBIZ01/160419910/AR/0/AR-160419910.jpg"}, "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The U.S. does spectacular doctors well, but not reliable doctors, according to someone who should know.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In 2014, more than 17 percent of the gross domestic product, about $9,523 per person, was spent on health care, Gragnolati said.\nThe only way to curb that spending is by innovation, and specifically innovation geared towards the country's largest health care consumers: millennials.\n\"There is lots of money pouring into health care, both from private equity and institutional,\" he said, so innovation is here to stay.\nGragnolati was the only health system representative at PHARMFEST, an event geared toward the biopharmaceutical industry held Wednesday at Montclair State University.\nGragnolati compared his five acute care systems with his time at his previous employer, Johns Hopkins Medicine."}
