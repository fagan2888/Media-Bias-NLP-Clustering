(Photo: Romain Blanquart | Michigan.com)\n\nIt has been three weeks since Jessica Mast and 65 fellow nurse anesthetists were sedating patients and earning six-figure salaries in the St. John Providence Health System.\n\nToday, they remain out of their jobs since rejecting the nonprofit health system\u2019s plan to outsource them on Jan. 1 to PSJ Anesthesia, a new outside contractor run by a metro Detroit doctor.\n\nIt was a rare act of defiance by a group of non-unionized employees against what has been a nationwide trend in the health care business.\n\nIn doing so, they relinquished jobs that pay an average $174,290 salary across metro Detroit, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for unemployment insurance,\u201d Mast, 38, of Northville told the desk clerk last week inside a Michigan Works! service center in Livonia, where she and her now-former colleagues registered for benefits.\n\nThe two hospitals affected \u2014 Providence Park Hospital, Novi, and Providence Park Hospital, Southfield \u2014 have been trying to absorb the abrupt loss of so many highly trained workers. They are part of nonprofit Ascension Health, a St. Louis-based Catholic health system.\n\nThe two hospitals have stayed open since the 66 workers were laid off Dec. 31, and Jean Meyer, president and CEO of St. John Providence, says no surgeries have been canceled, delayed or transferred.\n\n\u201cEvery site for anesthesia has been covered and the atmosphere is positive and professional,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThere is not a CRNA shortage.\u201d\n\nYet other nurse anesthetists in the area and some staffing agencies have refused to help replace the anesthetists who lost their jobs.\n\nThis labor dispute arose in mid-October, when a group of 80 anesthetists received notice that their jobs with Providence were being outsourced to PSJ Anesthesia starting in 2016. They could either sign a contract with PSJ or lose their jobs. After several contract offers, 14 nurses took jobs and 66 refused.\n\n\u201cWe have no problem in taking a pay cut, and we as a group have said that multiple times,\u201d said Marie Williams of Farmington, one of the nurse anesthetists who wouldn\u2019t sign with PSJ. \u201cIt was the manner in which it was rolled out. It was the take-it-or-leave-it approach. It was the complete and total devaluation of CRNA services.\u201d\n\nKnown as Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists, or CRNAs, they are required to have bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees and several years of critical care experience; many in the profession consider themselves a third category of hospital worker between registered nurses and doctors.\n\nPSJ Anesthesia was incorporated in September and is run by Dr. Dominick Lago, an anesthesiologist at both the Southfield and Novi hospitals where the anesthetists worked. He is also a member of the more established Southfield-based medical practice Northland Anesthesia Associates, which has provided anesthesiologists at Providence hospitals for years.\n\nNeither Lago nor his attorney returned multiple messages seeking comment.\n\nMeyer said Providence\u2019s leadership \u201chas been respectful, accommodating and transparent with the CRNAs throughout this process.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery employed CRNA was offered a position at the exact same salary rate, with an excellent benefits package, and with the opportunity to work with the same physicians they had been working with for years,\u201d Meyer\u2019s statement said. \u201cIt was each individual\u2019s personal decision to accept or reject the offer.\u201d\n\nMeyer\u2019s statement did not specifically address reports that anesthesia departments in both hospitals had been losing money, but she did say that CRNAs\u2019 overtime and on-call costs were unsustainable and the decision to outsource them \u201cwas driven by need to create a more efficient way to provide care and better manage costs.\u201d\n\nThe new arrangement with PSJ was 100% supported by Providence\u2019s doctors, Meyer\u2019s statement said, and is expected to lead to better experiences and outcomes for patients.\n\n8 contracts rejected\n\nAttorney David Shea, who is representing the nurses, said the initial employment offer from PSJ \u2014 ultimately rejected \u2014 involved a 35% cut in total compensation because of reductions in overtime, call-in pay and life insurance benefits, among other things.\n\nSubsequent contract offers restored some of those cuts, but kept restrictions on taking temporary CRNA shifts at other hospitals and barred them from working at certain other hospitals for up to a year if they left, according to Shea.\n\nMost of the group ultimately rejected eight different contract offers from PSJ, although some voluntarily signed and others lacked the financial resources to reject an offer.\n\n\u201cFor us as a group, the verbiage in the contract elicited such a sense of mistrust,\u201d said Williams, who like many in the group, works a couple days per month on a freelance basis at another surgery center. \u201cWhen I have to ask permission for a second job, I find that oppressive.\u201d\n\nVirtual picket line\n\nWhile no one is actually picketing outside Providence\u2019s Novi or Southfield hospitals, other nurse anesthetists have been reluctant to fill in for the laid-off workers and some staffing agencies, including North Carolina-based United Anesthesia, have said they won\u2019t place anesthetists in either hospital.\n\n\u201cNobody has really jumped to help staff those two hospitals,\u201d said Phillip Lim of Beverly Hills in metro Detroit, a current nurse anesthetist in the Providence system but not among those laid off. \u201cIt\u2019s a very small community and the vast majority of the community feel that those CRNAs were treated unfairly.\u201d\n\nAttorney Shea said, \u201cI like to call it a virtual picket line. They feel that this group of Providence CRNAs was dealt an unfair blow and they won\u2019t go and take their jobs.\u201d\n\nIn metro Detroit, the Detroit Medical Center and McLaren Macomb hospital in Mt. Clemens have outsourced CRNA services in recent years without sparking labor unrest.\n\nShea also represented those McLaren Macomb CRNAs. In an interview, he said the main difference between the McLaren outsourcing of about 50 CRNAs and what happened at Providence was that McLaren\u2019s CRNAs felt they were included in the contract negotiation process, which built trust. Another difference was timing.\n\n\u201cThe McLaren deal happened over the span of eight or nine months. And this contract happened over a matter of weeks,\u201d Shea said.\n\nOutsourcing on the rise\n\nManagement consultant Jason Trudell, CEO of Tampa-based Executive Anesthesia Solutions, said the trend of hospitals outsourcing anesthesia services has been going on for years and has lately picked up.\n\nA number of anesthesia companies that are getting contracts are backed by private equity or venture capital firms, which can help finance the significant start-up costs involved in such businesses.\n\nThe outsourcing firms help hospitals hold down costs and get more revenue from insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid through more efficient billing procedures, he said. A CRNA himself, Trudell said it is common for companies like PSJ to hold a contract for about two or three years and then sell to another company.\n\n\u201cHospital billing is notoriously inefficient ... they leave a lot of money on the table,\u201d he said.\n\nSome in the health care industry have blamed the rush by hospitals to cut costs and outsource workers to the Affordable Care Act, which brought smaller increases in hospitals\u2019 Medicare reimbursement rates and new penalties for patient re-admissions, However, hospital lobbyists long ago agreed to those measures in return for more newly insured patients under the health care law.\n\nThe 66 CRNAs were unanimous in their rejection of the contract offer, but they now appear split on their willingness to again work for the Providence hospitals. Some anesthetists still hope the hospital system will come around, perhaps drop its outsourcing plan, and offer them employment on agreeable terms.\n\n\u201cThere is still a very large group of us who want to go back to Providence and work,\u201d Williams said.\n\nBut others, including Greg O\u2019Dell, 52, of Commerce Township, are already interviewing for CRNA positions at other systems and doubt they will make a return to St. John Providence.\n\n\u201cThe window of opportunity for them to take us is rapidly closing,\u201d he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.hometownlife.com/story/money/business/2016/01/18/nurse-anesthetists-say-disrespect-led-resistance/78969368/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A group of 66 nurse anesthetists say that lack of respect, trust and disclosure -- not pay -- led to their departure.", "og": {"site_name": "HometownLife", "description": "A group of 66 nurse anesthetists say that lack of respect, trust and disclosure -- not pay -- led to their departure.", "title": "Nurse anesthetists say disrespect led to resistance", "url": "http://www.hometownlife.com/story/money/business/2016/01/18/nurse-anesthetists-say-disrespect-led-resistance/78969368/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/hometownlife.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A group of 66 nurse anesthetists say that lack of respect, trust and disclosure -- not pay -- led to their departure.", "title": "Nurse anesthetists say disrespect led to resistance", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b060368d1c6587fbcde0a917652710bb90784354/c=0-400-1600-2000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/18/Livonia/B9320560650Z.1_20160118145449_000_GSCD5FF16.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@hometownlife", "site": "@hometownlife", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 169969316374298}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "providence hospital, novi, crna, anethesthist"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd361d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere is not a CRNA shortage.\u201dYet other nurse anesthetists in the area and some staffing agencies have refused to help replace the anesthetists who lost their jobs.\nDefiant nurse anesthetists cite lack of trust, not pay, in labor disputeThe CRNAs are now filing for unemployment insurance benefits.\n(Photo: Romain Blanquart | Michigan.com)It has been three weeks since Jessica Mast and 65 fellow nurse anesthetists were sedating patients and earning six-figure salaries in the St. John Providence Health System.\nPSJ Anesthesia was incorporated in September and is run by Dr. Dominick Lago, an anesthesiologist at both the Southfield and Novi hospitals where the anesthetists worked.\nHe is also a member of the more established Southfield-based medical practice Northland Anesthesia Associates, which has provided anesthesiologists at Providence hospitals for years."}
