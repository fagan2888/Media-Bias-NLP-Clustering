Tom Woodward\n\nBritish policy has long supported mixed-income neighborhoods, believed to be helpful for struggling families and more socially equitable. However, a new study of these neighborhoods overturns such egalitarian ideas. Boys from low-income families fare worse, not better, growing up beside wealthier neighbors, say Duke University researchers, the effects worsening as the economic gap between the boys and their peers widens.\n\n\u201cIt is quite possible that the relationships are different in the United States,\u201d Dr. Candice Odgers, associate director of the Duke Center for Child and Family Policy, told Medical Daily. \u201cThe big difference is you don\u2019t actually have the opportunity, a similar opportunity, to study these things in the U.S. because poverty is still highly concentrated. So it\u2019s relatively rare to find low-income children living among the most affluent, these more affluent peers.\u201d Soon, though, that may no longer be true; emerging policy trends support the creation of mixed-income neighborhoods in the U.S.\n\nTo conduct the study, Odgers and her colleagues followed 1,600 children in urban and suburban areas of England and Wales from birth to age 12. She and her team performed intensive home assessments, spoke to both teachers and neighbors, and gathered additional data from other sources, including census reports. Strikingly, Google Street View aided the team in their surveys of neighborhood conditions; this 21st century technique revealed the presence of parks, quantity of graffiti, property maintenance, and other details.\n\nSo what did the researchers discover?\n\nAntisocial behavior among the low-income boys grew in economically mixed settings: the boys lied, cheated, swore, and fought more. In fact, their bad behavior worsened as surrounding conditions grew rosier \u2014 antisocial acts increased in middle-income neighborhoods, and grew worse in the wealthiest neighborhoods. These findings held true between the ages 5 through 12.\n\n\u201cYes, it was a very thorough study,\u201d Odgers told Medical Daily. \u201cBut of course it\u2019s associational, we cannot claim causation. We cannot say that economically mixed communities cause anti-social behavior.\u201d\n\nStrikingly, the low-income boys living in hard-pressed neighborhoods \u2014 where three-quarters of the community or more could be considered poor \u2014 showed the least amount of antisocial behavior. One other significant result of the study suggests environment has no effect on girls; an affluent setting did not negatively influence the behavior of the low-income girls.\n\nHigher Income Boys\n\nNotably, Odgers' study did not exclude observations about children at the other end of the economic spectrum; the authors also gathered data on working class, middle class, and more affluent children. Sadly, they fared worse when they grew up alongside poverty. As their neighborhoods grew more impoverished, their antisocial behavior increased.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Odgers? She and her team will focus on education. \u201cHow are these children doing in terms of their early reading, their school achievement, and where they end up as adults,\u201d she told Medical Daily.\n\nSource: Odgers CL, Donley S, Caspi A, et al.
