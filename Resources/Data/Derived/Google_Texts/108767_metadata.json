The non-profit organization Global Genes found an estimated 95 percent of rare diseases don\u2019t have a single FDA-approved drug treatment \u2014 there are only 400 treatments approved to treat some 7,000 rare diseases believed to be affecting people today. It's clearly not enough.\n\nBut with more awareness and education, Global Genes reported, doctors, patients, and their families have improved access to treatments and medical representation. So while Feb. 28 (depending on if it\u2019s a leap year) recognizes rare diseases worldwide, June 19 specifically focuses on SCD. The United Nations created the awareness campaign back in 2006.\n\n\u201c[SCD] is an extremely debilitating medical condition. It is characterized by chronic pain with frequent bouts of acute severe pain that requires large amounts of narcotics that often provide incomplete relief,\u201d said Dr. Yutaka Niihara, chief scientific officer of Emmaus Medical and professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, in an article last year. \u201cIt is also marked by social stigma that makes others, including medical professionals, view sickle cell patients as \u2018drug seekers\u2019 due to their need for large amounts of pain medication.\u201d\n\nEssentially patients who inherit SCD (it\u2019s a hereditary disease) have poorly oxygenated red blood cells in the shape of a C-shaped farm tool called a \u201csickle.\u201d Patients\u2019 cells are hard, sticky, and sometimes travel backwards, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Cells get stuck this way and clog blood flow, leading to \u201cpain and other serious problems such as infection, acute chest syndrome, and stroke.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny day without pain is a good day,\u201d Shakir, an activist for SCD awareness and research, told Global Genes. Niihara added patients \u201chave an annual average of three episodes of severe pain that requires hospitalization and narcotics.\u201d But unfortunately, he said many people, and that includes medical providers, don\u2019t understand their pain and undertreat them, if at all.\n\n\u201c[SCD] patients\u2019 pain is real and is triggered by damage to major parts of their bodies, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain,\u201d Niihara said. \u201cAlso, they are very susceptible to infection, which can be life threatening. These organ damage-induced bouts of pain and infectious episodes are two causes of mortality at a very young age.\u201d\n\nI.D.E.A.L. Magazine advocates for sickle-cell disease in Harrisburg, Pa. I.D.E.A.L Magazine, Twitter.com\n\nToday, the CDC reports an estimated 90,000 to 100,000 people in the U.S. are affected by the disease, mainly blacks or African-Americans;\u201d Hispanics come in second. Worldwide, however, SCD is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, South America, Central America, Saudi Arabia, India, Turkey, Greece, and Italy.\n\nThe life span of someone with SCD is about 40 years if they live in the U.S. Niihara explained that in underdeveloped countries, where there\u2019s limited access to medical care, 90 percent of patients won\u2019t live past age 5.\n\nRelief, especially for SCD-related pain, is limited. Some experts recommend patients drink plenty of water, keep their body temperature regulated, and avoid high altitudes and low oxygen levels. For more severe cases, the CDC says hydroxyurea is an option, a medication designed to reduce the number of painful episodes. However, the medication boasts serious side-effects and anyone taking it should do so under a doctor's supervision.\n\nEven the multiple blood transfusions that keep red blood cell levels up pose health risks with increased transfusions overloading the body with iron. Too much iron can lead to liver, heart, and pancreas damage, the CDC found. The only source of long-term relief for SCD patients is either bone marrow or stem cell transplants, which on their own are very risk.\n\nBeing vocal about the realities of living with SCD has a positive domino effect.\n\n\u201cBy telling a story, you can help shed light on a condition\u2019s symptoms, prognosis, and other details for those still searching for the correct diagnosis or for someone who knows their disease firsthand,\u201d Global Genes found. \u201cMedical terminology and data, though important, can obscure what it means to live with a disease and make it difficult for most people to relate. Personal stories, though, frame our individual rare experiences in a way that lets others connect.\u201d\n\nThat said, patients are hesitant to come forward with their stories. In the Mental Health Channel\u2019s video \u201cTHE COMMON GOOD: Above The Crisis,\u201d patients admit they don\u2019t want to be the person to say, \u201cHey, you know I have sickle cell\u2026 but in essence that\u2019s our problem, we keep it to ourselves, so that\u2019s kind of why we don\u2019t have a community.\u201d Encouraging others to speak up chips away at the stigma regarding SCD, inviting others to address the day-to-day challenges of SCD, especially those pertaining to mental health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to be consumed by sadness when you\u2019re this sick,\u201d LeDarrin, who has SCD and directed MHC\u2019s video, said. \u201cYou have to make a conscious decision not to be. And I just decide every day to have some joy.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the video in full below:\n\nTHE COMMON GOOD: Above The Crisis from mental health channel on Vimeo.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "world, sickle, cell, day, 2015, how, rare, disease, awareness, leads, quality, care, treatment", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "World Sickle Cell Days hopes to reduce the disease's stigma and invite others to share their story in order to build a community that fosters improved care and treatment.", "title": "Why We Need Awareness For Sickle Cell And Other Rare Diseases", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/world-sickle-cell-day-2015-how-rare-disease-awareness-leads-quality-care-treatment-338846", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/18/sickle-cell-disease.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "World Sickle Cell Days hopes to reduce the disease's stigma and invite others to share their story in order to build a community that fosters improved care and treatment.", "title": "Why We Need Awareness For Sickle Cell And Other Rare Diseases", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/world-sickle-cell-day-2015-how-rare-disease-awareness-leads-quality-care-treatment-338846", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/18/sickle-cell-disease.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/18/sickle-cell-disease.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-18T12:18:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-19T10:08:57-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "World Sickle Cell Days hopes to reduce the disease's stigma and invite others to share their story in order to build a community that fosters improved care and treatment."}, "article_summary": "Wellcome Images (cropped for size), CC BY-NC-ND 2.0Rare diseases, like sickle-cell disease (SCD), often don\u2019t get the attention they deserve.\nWorld Sickle Cell Days hopes to reduce the disease's stigma and invite others to share their story in order to build a community that fosters improved care and treatment.\n\u201c[SCD] patients\u2019 pain is real and is triggered by damage to major parts of their bodies, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain,\u201d Niihara said.\nThe non-profit organization Global Genes found an estimated 95 percent of rare diseases don\u2019t have a single FDA-approved drug treatment \u2014 there are only 400 treatments approved to treat some 7,000 rare diseases believed to be affecting people today.\nThe only source of long-term relief for SCD patients is either bone marrow or stem cell transplants, which on their own are very risk."}
