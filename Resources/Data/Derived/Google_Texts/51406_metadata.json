Joining Coke\u2019s classic red can, Diet Coke, and Coke Zero is the company\u2019s newest \u201chealthier\u201d addition: Coca-Cola Life, also known as Coke Life. The small green can, which is a Stevia-sweetened version of regular Coca-Cola, is the first addition to the Coke brand in almost eight years.\n\n\u201cWith Coca-Cola Life, we have innovated to provide consumers with a new option with fewer calories,\u201d said James Quincey, Coca-Cola Europe president, in a press release. \u201cIt complements our existing brands and is well-positioned to meet changing lifestyle trends, providing people with a great-tasting, lower calorie cola sweetened from natural sources.\u201d Coca-Coca Life is one of the latest initiatives from Coke to address the obesity rates around the world as it promotes \u201cactive lifestyles\u201d in its recyclable packaging and green label.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence the company\u2019s development of this product is a response to the continually steady decline of soda sales in the U.S. in the last nine years. Last year alone, soda sales have dropped three percent, or more than double the 1.2 percent they had fallen the year before, according to Beverage Digest. Now, soda is already down a further two percent this year. However, diet soda sales, although dropping to about seven percent last year, have remained relatively steady.\n\nCoca-Cola has used the artificial sweetener, aspartame, in their diet beverages. An eight fluid ounce Diet Coke contains 60 milligrams (mg) of phenylalanine, 48mg of aspartic acid, and 123mg of methanol \u2013 the amino acids the artificial sweetener is comprised of. Although aspartame has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at an \u201cacceptable\u201d daily intake of 50mg/kg body weight for adults and children, the ingredient can kill certain neurons by allowing the influx of too much calcium into the cells.\n\nThe beverage company has touted how \u201chealthy\u201d their new drink is, with natural ingredients like Stevia. Stevia is a plant-based product, made from a plant native to Paraguay that is calorie-free and can be up to 200 times sweeter than regular sugar. But Coke Life still contains more than four teaspoons of sugar per 330ml can, which is the equivalent to 25 percent of an adult's daily recommended maximum intake, according to the American Heart Association, compared to 39 percent from a regular 330ml can of Coca-Cola.\n\nThe color and design of the new coke bottle is also part of the company\u2019s attempt to convince consumers their product is \u201chealthier,\u201d despite its copious amounts of sugar. Its vegetable green color, and plant decorations are mimicking those of health drinks that encourage \u201chealthy living.\u201d Although Coke Life may be a healthier alternative in comparison to regular coke, it contains a lot of sugar. \u201cWhatever the company says, this is a product with a high sugar content and it will encourage people to have a sweet tooth,\u201d said Dr. Aseem Malhotra, scientific director of the UK-based association Action on Sugar, told The Guardian.\n\nAs Coca-Cola tries to masquerade the unhealthy ingredients with its product release, PepsiCo has decided to take a different route from its rival company. PepsiCo is working with Senomyx, a San Diego-based biotech company, to create an additive that would fool people\u2019s taste buds into tasting more sugar than what is actually in the product, according to Bloomberg News. The soda industry is desperately trying to find ways to stay alive amid health advocates pushing for stronger warning labels, and even bans on the drinks throughout the U.S.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s Coke Life, first piloted in Argentina and Chile, with enticing commercials that compare drinking the coke to having your first kiss, is expected to hit shelves in the U.K. in the fall. There is no word yet when this sugar-laden product will make its North American debut. We have to wait and see whether this product can give the company the boost it needs. Until then, the healthiest option of all is to not drink soda.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "coke life, coca-cola life, coke life, low-calorie, low-sugar, soft drink, soft beverage, soda, sugars, natural, artificial sweetener", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "\u2018Coke Life,\u2019 Coca-Cola\u2019s new low-calorie and low-sugar Stevia-sweetened drink, is advertising itself as \u2018healthy\u2019 and \u2018natural,\u2019 but is it?", "title": "Is Stevia-Sweetened Coca-Cola Healthier Than The Sugary Stuff?
