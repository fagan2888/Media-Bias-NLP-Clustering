He told the BBC: \u2018What I\u2019m doing is keeping faith with my constituents and keeping my promises to them.\n\n\u2018You heard the Prime Minister just now say the Conservative-led government was dealing with the deficit and cutting immigration.\n\n'The reality is we\u2019ve increased the national debt by more in five years than even Labour managed in 13 and immigration is now back up to the levels we saw under Labour.\u2019\n\nBut Mr Cameron said the MP\u2019s defection, and that of Douglas Carswell last month, were \u2018senseless and counter-productive\u2019 \u2013 adding that voting Ukip would simply increase the chances of Ed Miliband winning the election.\n\nAnd party chairman Grant Shapps used the opening speech of the conference to mount a sustained attack on Mr Reckless. Mr Shapps declared: \u2018He lied and lied and lied again.\u2019\n\nHe said the MP had accepted the donations and time of supporters while plotting treachery.\n\n\u2018We have been betrayed,\u2019 Mr Shapps told Conservative activists. \u2018We all know individual MPs don\u2019t succeed on their own. They do so by standing on the shoulders of others. Your shoulders.\n\n'People who volunteered for Mr Reckless, they supported him as a Conservative. People who pounded the streets, they supported him as a Conservative.\n\nThe pair posed for the cameras in a pub, but Mr Reckless faced increasingly hostile questions from the media\n\nThere was some UKIP support on the ground, but it is far from clear that Mr Reckless will hold the seat in the forthcoming by-election\n\n\u2018Today, your trust has been abused. You have been cheated. But worse; the people of Rochester and Strood have been cast aside.\n\n'As your party chairman, I share your deep sense of betrayal and anger. We have been let down by somebody who has repeatedly lied to his constituents, and to you: Who said one thing, and then did another.\u2019\n\nEmbarrassingly for Mr Reckless, just last month he argued against defecting to Ukip, claiming only Mr Cameron could deliver an in/out referendum on the EU.\n\nMr Reckless was also confronted during a TV interview about a voicemail he left, promising to campaign for the party this weekend.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron today insisted defecting to UKIP was 'senseless and counter-productive'.\n\nIn the voicemail, he said: \u2018It\u2019s Mark Reckless, I\u2019ve just picked up your email about the Birmingham Northfield event. Yes, and I\u2019m very, very happy to do a photo or speak to a coach.\u2019\n\nEurosceptic Tory MP Mark Pritchard said he had cornered Mr Reckless in the Commons last week and demanded to know whether he was planning to defect, and was told he was not.\n\n\u2018I would say that Douglas Carswell has been dishonourable with a small d, but Mark Reckless was a capital D,\u2019 he said.\n\nThree days before last week\u2019s emergency vote on air strikes on fanatics in Iraq, Mr Reckless sent a message to the Government whips\u2019 office saying: \u2018Thanks for your message. I would be happy to support UK action with IS in Iraq e.g. air strikes.\u2019\n\nHe then voted against the Government. Mr Shapps said: \u2018He lied and lied and lied again.\u2019\n\nMr Farage yesterday scrapped plans for a \u2018WAG tax\u2019 on handbags and shoes \u2013 less than 48 hours after it was announced at his party conference.\n\nOn Friday, the Ukip leader welcomed the idea of raising the rate of VAT to 25 per cent on designer handbags, expensive shoes and sports cars.\n\nBut yesterday he admitted the policy was \u2018dead\u2019 and would not be introduced by the party. He said the tax was no more than a \u2018discussion point\u2019 that \u2018isn\u2019t going to happen\u2019, adding: \u2018As far as I am concerned, it\u2019s dead.\u2019", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "He,lied,lied,lied,Furious,Tory,chairman,Grant,Shapps,tears,UKIP,defector,Mark,Reckless,gets,jostled,voters,jumping,ship", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2772600/He-lied-lied-lied-Furious-Tory-chairman-Grant-Shapps-tears-UKIP-defector-Mark-Reckless-gets-jostled-voters-jumping-ship.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Mr Reckless insisted he was trying to 'keep faith with my constituents and keep my promises to them', but he received a rough ride when he toured his Rochester and Strood constituency.", "title": "'He lied and lied and lied again': \u00a0Furious Tory chairman Grant Shapps tears into UKIP defector Mark Reckless who gets jostled by his own voters after jumping ship", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2772600/He-lied-lied-lied-Furious-Tory-chairman-Grant-Shapps-tears-UKIP-defector-Mark-Reckless-gets-jostled-voters-jumping-ship.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/29/1411958440455_wps_11_MP_MARK_RECKLESS_AND_A_DI.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2772600/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2772600/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2772600, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "He,lied,lied,lied,Furious,Tory,chairman,Grant,Shapps,tears,UKIP,defector,Mark,Reckless,gets,jostled,voters,jumping,ship", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-09-28T13:12:43.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=James+Chapman,+Political+Editor+for+the+Daily+Mail", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-09-29T02:51:06.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "He lied lied lied Furious Tory chairman Grant Shapps tears UKIP defector Mark Reckless gets jostled voters jumping ship"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Mr Reckless insisted he was trying to 'keep faith with my constituents and keep my promises to them', but he received a rough ride when he toured his Rochester and Strood constituency.", "title": "'He lied and lied and lied again': \u00a0Furious Tory chairman Grant Shapps tears into UKIP defector Mark Reckless who gets jostled by his own voters after jumping ship", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2772600/He-lied-lied-lied-Furious-Tory-chairman-Grant-Shapps-tears-UKIP-defector-Mark-Reckless-gets-jostled-voters-jumping-ship.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/29/1411958440455_wps_11_MP_MARK_RECKLESS_AND_A_DI.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2014/09/1418450360_3811122355001_farage.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Mr Reckless insisted he was trying to 'keep faith with my constituents and keep my promises to them', but he received a rough ride when he toured his Rochester and Strood constituency."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf51f\"", "article_summary": "Senior Conservatives yesterday lashed out at Ukip defector Mark Reckless for having \u2018lied and lied and lied again\u2019.\nAnd party chairman Grant Shapps used the opening speech of the conference to mount a sustained attack on Mr Reckless.\n\u2018I would say that Douglas Carswell has been dishonourable with a small d, but Mark Reckless was a capital D,\u2019 he said.\nMr Shapps declared: \u2018He lied and lied and lied again.\u2019He said the MP had accepted the donations and time of supporters while plotting treachery.\nIn the voicemail, he said: \u2018It\u2019s Mark Reckless, I\u2019ve just picked up your email about the Birmingham Northfield event."}
