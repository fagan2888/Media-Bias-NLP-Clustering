Those are the hospitals that previously employed 49-year-old nurse Elet Neilson, who contracted a rare strain of the disease, genome 2b. Both that strain and a different variation of hepatitis C have been identified through testing, according to the Standard Examiner. Exposure to the disease is thought to have occurred between June 17, 2013 and Nov. 25, 2014, according to FOX13.\n\nNeilson was fired for reportedly using medications illegally and eventually pleaded to a misdemeanor for possession of a controlled substance, paying a $413 fine and serving no jail time.\n\nDunn told KUTV the current outbreak was the first one ever reported for hepatitis C in Utah, though a similar outbreak occurred in Denver in 2009. In that instance a nurse who was stealing drugs replaced them with used syringes filled with saline.\n\nDunn said it was important for everyone contacted to be tested because symptoms of hepatitis C can lay dormant for decades.\n\n\u201cPeople can have no symptoms for decades and then all of the sudden their liver will start failing and that\u2019s a deadly part of the disease,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cSo it\u2019s important to be identified early in the disease court when people don\u2019t have symptoms so they can get effective treatment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX
