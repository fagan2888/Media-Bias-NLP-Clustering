He said 33 percent of Louisianans are obese, and Louisiana ranks 49th in health literacy.\n\n\"The root cause of a lot of the problems we'll talk about today is obesity,\" Katzmarzyk said.\n\nOchsner Health System President Warner Thomas said private businesses need to encourage better health practices. Ochsner has a incentive program that Thomas said is effective for people that take advantage of it.\n\n\"It's about creating momentum. It's about creating an 'I can do' attitude,\" Thomas said.\n\nThomas said another piece of the puzzle is insurance companies offering affordable plans that still provide the coverage people need.\n\n\"Middle class America cannot afford health insurance anymore. They just can't. If we don't solve it, it's going to be solved for us, and we're not going to like it,\" Thomas said.\n\nRandy Watson, director of insurance for the Caddo Parish School Board, said the Affordable Care Act is not reducing costs the way it should because subsidies are putting a higher burden on customers by way of costs for premiums. He said the law is too restrictive on what the minimum and maximum benefits of a plan can be.\n\nHe said resources need to be shifted to primary care.\n\n\"Members need to be responsible too,\" Watson said. \"The person that takes care of themselves should have a lower premium or cost out of pocket than someone who doesn't.\"\n\nThe discussion Wednesday was part of a program sponsored by The Atlantic where experts are brought together to discuss solutions to health care issues.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nCole Avery is a legislative and state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge.
