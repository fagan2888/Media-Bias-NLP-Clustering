St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Passaic would likewise suffer a second straight year of cuts, having lost $526,659 in 2014-15.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY THE POTENTIAL CUTS?\n\nDue to the expansion of the state\u2019s Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act - commonly known as Obamacare \u2013 about 390,000 New Jersey residents have enrolled in managed care plans since January of 2014, according to state officials. Another 250,000 people have received insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.\n\nAnd according to the governor\u2019s recent proposed budget summary, this is why the state plans to cut $74 million in aid for \u201ccharity care reimbursements,\u201d which are used to help offset local hospitals for the cost of treating uninsured patients.\n\nThis loss may total as much as $148 million if matching federal funds are also cut, according to health care advocates.\n\nIn a joint statement, several health care advocacy groups blasted the proposed cuts and called them \u201cpotentially devastating.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve made some strides in insuring more New Jerseyans, 11.7 percent of New Jersey\u2019s 8.9 million residents remain uninsured,\u201d the release stated.\n\n\u201cCharity Care and Medicaid are a statewide challenge. Hospitals depend on Charity Care funding to support the care of those 1 million New Jersey residents who are still uninsured and to offset insufficient Medicaid payments, but the budget introduced this week doesn\u2019t recognize the ongoing challenges hospitals face as they provide excellent care for all.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, hospitals spent more than $1 billion treating uninsured patients. Today, more than 400,000 additional people are covered by expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but Medicaid pays hospitals just 70 percent of the actual costs of patient care. Our hospitals struggle to fulfill their caring mission when they lose money each time they care for a Medicaid beneficiary.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPictured in photo: Hackensack UMC \u2013 Mountainside Hospital in Montclair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend news tips to eric.kiefer@patch.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Livingston, NJ Patch", "description": "St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston bucks trend, would gain $1.6 million", "title": "New Jersey Hospitals May Lose Millions in State Funding for 2015-16", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.patch.com/users/22844250/stock/T800x600/20150354fde5d392fa2.jpg", "url": "http://patch.com/new-jersey/livingston/area-hospitals-may-lose-millions-state-funding-2015-16-0", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": 116541048368485, "section": "Politics & Government", "published_time": "2015-03-09T14:39:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-09T14:48:07-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521361477908471}, "description": "Livingston, NJ - St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston bucks trend, would gain $1.6 million", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca248\"", "article_summary": "Several New Jersey hospitals will lose considerable amounts of state funding next year if Governor Chris Christie\u2019s proposed 2015-16 budget gets approved without a hitch.\nMost hospitals across the state lost funding in the proposed budget, but two local hospitals managed to buck the trend: Clara Maass Medical Center in Belleville, with a proposed $216,611 gain, and the St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, with a proposed $1,633,215 gain.\nSt. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Passaic would likewise suffer a second straight year of cuts, having lost $526,659 in 2014-15.\nToday, more than 400,000 additional people are covered by expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but Medicaid pays hospitals just 70 percent of the actual costs of patient care.\nOur hospitals struggle to fulfill their caring mission when they lose money each time they care for a Medicaid beneficiary.\u201dPictured in photo: Hackensack UMC \u2013 Mountainside Hospital in MontclairSend news tips to eric.kiefer@patch.com"}
