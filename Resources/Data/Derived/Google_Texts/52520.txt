A trailer home in Fountain was destroyed by a fire, but the family was able to save something very special from the remains.

Saturday afternoon, Bay County Fire officials responded to a fully involved fire on Evergreen Street in Fountain.

Firefighters were able to contain the fire in about 15 minutes, but they say the home is total loss.

The owners of the property lived in another trailer next to the one that was destroyed and they were worried that a family urn was lost in the fire.

Firefighters were able to locate the urn and deliver it back to the family.

"The homeowner's husband's remains were in there," explained Lt. Travis Williams, of the Bay County Fire Department. "They were in an urn and they advised us where it was at roughly and we went in and recovered it. They hold that deeply. For us to be able to return that, undamaged, that's real nice."

Officials are still investigating the cause of the fire.
