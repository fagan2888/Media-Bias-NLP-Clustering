It started with him running across the street to the neighbor\u2019s house. Then he wandered farther and farther, but always returned to the Greenes\u2019 town of Hudson home.\n\nThe invisible fence in the Greenes\u2019 yard hasn\u2019t been working lately, but Patch usually sticks around if a family member accompanies him outside.\n\nOn the afternoon of Jan. 5, wanderlust overtook the lovable white pooch with a black patch over his left eye, and off he darted into the cold.\n\nAn hour later, the Greenes received a call from an owner of the Red Star Kennel, who had spotted Patch along the road and tried to catch him.\n\nThe kennel owner followed Patch to near the Hudson Town Hall on County A, where he saw the dog get hit by a car and roll into the ditch.\n\nRelatively uninjured, and now frightened, Patch took off again.\n\nIt turns out that the Greenes did a number of things correctly in their attempt to find Patch.\n\n\u201cWe looked and looked that Monday night, but couldn\u2019t find him,\u201d Greene said.\n\nOne of his daughters had done volunteer work for the Animal Humane Society as part of a Girl Scout Gold Star project, so they called the Woodbury shelter right away to let them know about their missing dog.\n\nA photo of Patch was posted on the Humane Society\u2019s lost pets page.\n\nThe Greenes also called pet hospitals in the area, in case someone brought in an injured rat terrier.\n\nThey called neighbors and used Facebook to spread the word, including a page run by volunteers called Lost Dogs of Wisconsin.\n\nAnd they called the rangers at nearby Willow River State Park, where Patch is often taken on outings.\n\nIt got down to 8 degrees below zero that night, but at about 2 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 6, a ranger called to say that Patch had been spotted in the park.\n\nGreene and his daughter Fiona, a Hudson High School junior, spent the next three hours searching the park, but darkness fell with Patch still missing.\n\nAt around 7 p.m. that night, Greene was preparing to tell his daughters that the odds of seeing Patch again were slim when a family a couple of miles away called to say that they had him.\n\nThe Greenes\u2019 phone number was on Patch\u2019s collar.\n\n\u201cHe was cold, rundown, tired and finally succumbed to having to go to a person. He went up to somebody\u2019s porch, they brought him in their house and called us,\u201d Pete Greene reported.\n\nPatch had a surgery to remove a couple of inches of his frostbit tail scheduled for Wednesday. But he\u2019s back with the family that has loved him ever since adopting him from an Amery shelter more than 11 years ago.\n\n\u201cYou know the old saying, the harder you work the luckier you get. I think that\u2019s about the case of it here,\u201d Greene said.\n\n\u201cAnd we had a lot of help from the neighbors, too,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s when you know you\u2019ve got good neighbors, when everybody and their kids get in their vehicles and start driving around for hours at a clip trying to help you.\n\nThat\u2019s Hudson for you.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t wait\n\nThe Greene family\u2019s quick action after Patch ran away was very appropriate, according to Kathi Pelnar, the animal control officer for all of the municipalities in the Hudson area.\n\n\u201cIf your pet takes off, do not wait to start calling around looking for it,\u201d Pelnar said. \u201cDon\u2019t wait a day. Start calling right away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat dog or cat could wind up who knows where, because people just don\u2019t think,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey will pick up a cat in North Hudson and take it to Prescott, and then wonder why they can\u2019t find the owner.\n\n\u201d\n\nPelnar said the first call people should make is to the animal control officer for their municipality.\n\n\u201cIf they contact me, usually I know who to send them to,\u201d she explained.\n\nAnd if someone reports the missing pet as a stray animal, she will know who it belongs to.\n\nPelnar is available 24 hours a day at (715) 386-7789.\n\nShe also stresses the importance of licensing your pet, and attaching identification tags to its collar.\n\nMunicipalities don\u2019t require pet licenses just because they need the fee money, Pelnar said.\n\n\u201cLicensing is for identification purposes. If your dog is wearing a license, it is going to go home,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to track that license down and we\u2019re going to be able to find where that dog goes.\u201d\n\nShe said that pets with identification microchips imbedded in their skin also make it home if the information on the chip is up to date.\n\nAnother call people should make when their pet goes missing is to the Animal Humane Society at Woodbury, Minn., according to Pelnar.\n\nThe Humane Society is the impound facility for stray animals picked up in the Hudson area.\n\nIts website, www.animalhumanesociety.org, has photos and information about lost pets taken to the shelter, as well as a page where owners of unrecovered missing pets can post pictures of them.\n\nThe Humane Society\u2019s phone number is (651) 730-6008.\n\nPelnar also recommends that people call the St. Croix County dispatch center\u2019s non-emergency number, (715) 386-4701, and area veterinarians to report missing pets.\n\n\u201cThey should call anybody they can think of to call,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to get the word out right away that their pet is missing, because the sooner they get it out and the more people that know, the more likely they are to get their pet back \u2026 I can\u2019t stress that enough.\u201d\n\nAngela Fellrath of Hudson has started a Facebook page to assist people in finding their missing cats. It\u2019s called Lost Cats of Wisconsin, and is modeled after a Facebook page dedicated with reuniting lost dogs with their owners (Lost Dogs of Wisconsin).\n\nThe Facebook pages automatically generate a printable poster that people can distribute in their neighborhood once the information on their pet is entered.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people just don\u2019t know who to call,\u201d Fellrath said.\n\nShe gave the example of an area woman whose dog was taken to the Humane Society in Woodbury.\n\nThe woman said it never occurred to her that the dog might be taken to a shelter in another state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not common knowledge,\u201d Fellrath said.\n\nShe said people who see a dog or cat running loose should think of the possibility of it being lost.\n\nShe recommends that owners keep a current photo of their pet, along with information about its distinctive markings, the color of its collar and its ID tags.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Life,Family,lifestyles,Health,Family,st.
