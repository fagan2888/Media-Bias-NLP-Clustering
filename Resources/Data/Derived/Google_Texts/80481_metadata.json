So far this year, Texas has added an average of 40,343 jobs each month, compared with a monthly average of 27,520 jobs for the first seven months of last year.\n\n\u201cThose are some really good-looking numbers,\u201d said Robert A. Dye, chief economist for Dallas-based Comerica Bank. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing strong acceleration in job growth from last year.\u201d\n\nTexas has added 396,200 jobs over the last 12 months, putting the state on pace for a record number of new jobs this year. That\u2019s in line with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u2019 forecast of a 3.5 percent job growth rate for 2014, which equates to 400,000 jobs.\n\nDallas Fed senior economist Keith R. Phillips said this is the strongest year of job growth since 1998, when the Texas economy was booming.\n\nOther recent statistics also point to a strengthening economy in Texas.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige Book showed moderate economic growth for the six weeks through early July, thanks largely to manufacturing, retail and energy. Other reports show increased growth in Texas manufacturing, service sector activity and business optimism in July.\n\nJuly\u2019s job growth was across all industries, reflecting a general pickup in the economy.\n\nProfessional and business services led July\u2019s growth with 10,600 jobs, but seven of Texas\u2019 11 major industry groups each added at least 4,000 jobs. The six others were health services; leisure and hospitality; trade, transportation and utility; construction; services; and government.\n\nEnergy is still the largest driver of Texas\u2019 long-term job growth, with 7.8 percent growth in the last 12 months. Overall, eight of Texas\u2019 11 major industry groups have seen employment growth of at least 3 percent in that period.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Texas remained at 5.1 percent in July, well below the U.S. jobless rate of 6.2 percent. Ten of Texas\u2019 25 metropolitan statistical areas had jobless rates below 5 percent last month.\n\nDallas-Fort Worth\u2019s unemployment rate was 5.5 percent. The Midland area had the lowest rate in the state at 2.9 percent. McAllen-Edinburg-Mission had the highest rate at 9.9 percent. Local rates are not adjusted for seasonal variations.\n\nDye is worried about potentially \u201cvery tight\u201d unemployment rates in Texas in 2015 and 2016. He sees two possible scenarios: Stronger in-migration to Texas from other states to keep the labor force growing, or \u201crecord low unemployment rates\u201d if in-migration doesn\u2019t pick up.\n\nHousing markets are starting to loosen in other parts of the country, allowing people to move, which could help boost population growth in Texas, Dye said.\n\nEmployment growth typically leads to higher wages and increased inflation.\n\nOverall inflation is being kept in check, with the inflation rate averaging about 1.5 percent in the first seven months of this year.\n\nWages and salaries for Dallas-Fort Worth employees rose 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending June 30, more than double the national growth rate, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nEconomists expect wages to grow in Texas in the coming months.\n\n\u201cContacts have told us they\u2019re having troubling finding workers, and typically when you see that, you see higher wages so companies can attract more workers,\u201d the Dallas Fed\u2019s Phillips said. \u201cIn the short run, it creates some profit squeeze for employers unless they can get more productivity from workers, but companies have seen increased productivity in the last few years. Employees have had little negotiating power on wages for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe BLS will release employment and unemployment data for other states Monday.\n\nFollow Sheryl Jean on Twitter at @SJeanDallas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas employers added 46,600 jobs last month, leading some economists to say wages will increase at a faster pace.", "og": {"description": "Texas employers added 46,600 jobs last month, leading some economists to say wages will increase at a faster pace.", "title": "Higher wages likely to follow Texas job growth, economists say", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140815-higher-wages-likely-to-follow-texas-job-growth-economists-say.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140815-nb_22jobs4_38921823.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NB_22JOBS4_38921823.JPG", "height": 419}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-08-16T05:22:51Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-08-16T04:06:49Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Higher wages likely to follow Texas job growth, economists say\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140815-higher-wages-likely-to-follow-texas-job-growth-economists-say.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1863069\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-16T04:06:49Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"SHERYL JEAN\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-16T04:06:49Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Energy is still the largest driver of Texas\u2019 long-term job growth, with 7.8 percent growth in the last 12 months.\nJuly\u2019s job growth was across all industries, reflecting a general pickup in the economy.\nDallas Fed senior economist Keith R.
