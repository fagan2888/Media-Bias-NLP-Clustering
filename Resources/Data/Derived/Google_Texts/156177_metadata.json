Very spirited, intense practice. But no Semyon Varlamov, who was scratched Tuesday with another (or the same) groin injury. In his post-practice presser, coach Patrick Roy said he expects Varlamov to participate in Thursday\u2019s morning skate and he might start against the New Jersey Devils. Roy also said the groin injury is not as serious as the one that forced him to miss 15 games over three stretches earlier in the season, or even to the same muscle. But he declined to get into it further.\n\nAs for speculation, there\u2019s obviously a chance Varlamov\u2019s groin might require long-term rest, and if the Avs don\u2019t win their next three games it seems like a good opportunity to see what Calvin Pickard and Reto Berra can do the rest of the way, a nice challenge for both. But Roy said that\u2019s not the case right now and it\u2019s a playoff-push mindset all the way.\n\nAvs coach Patrick Roy after the loss to L.A., which was relatively healthy and unquestionably very good at Colorado:\n\nAvs captain Gabe Landeskog after Tuesday\u2019s game:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Calvin Pickard,Colorado Avalanche,Patrick Roy,Reto Berra,Semyon Varlamov", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Semyon Varlamov missed practice on Wednesday, but he could be ready to play on Thursday at home against the New Jersey Devils.", "title": "Semyon Varlamov's groin still day-to-day, could start vs. Devils", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/03/11/semyon-varlamov-practicing-wednesday-will-shut-season/21044/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/03/semyon-varlamov-vs-wild.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Semyon Varlamov missed practice on Wednesday, but he could be ready to play on Thursday at home against the New Jersey Devils.", "title": "Semyon Varlamov misses practice, but might start Thursday vs. New Jersey", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/03/11/semyon-varlamov-practicing-wednesday-will-shut-season/21044/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/03/semyon-varlamov-vs-wild.jpg", "creator": "@mikechambers", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Semyon Varlamov missed practice on Wednesday, but he could be ready to play on Thursday at home against the New Jersey Devils."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ded\"", "article_summary": "But no Semyon Varlamov, who was scratched Tuesday with another (or the same) groin injury.\nIn his post-practice presser, coach Patrick Roy said he expects Varlamov to participate in Thursday\u2019s morning skate and he might start against the New Jersey Devils.\nAvs coach Patrick Roy after the loss to L.A., which was relatively healthy and unquestionably very good at Colorado:Avs captain Gabe Landeskog after Tuesday\u2019s game:\nThe Avalanche game story from Tuesday\u2019s 5-2 loss to the Los Angeles Kings is here.\nRoy also said the groin injury is not as serious as the one that forced him to miss 15 games over three stretches earlier in the season, or even to the same muscle."}
