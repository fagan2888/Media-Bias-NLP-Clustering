In fact, big business is getting even bigger. It\u2019s the little businesses we\u2019re destroying. So, it\u2019s the family-owned businesses, the small businesses, the community-based businesses.\u201d\n\nFiorina added:\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re crushing the small, when we\u2019re crushing the powerless, when we\u2019re crushing those who don\u2019t have the resources or the power to influence what\u2019s going on in Washington, we\u2019re crushing possibilities for all kinds of people.\u201d\n\nIn addition to talking up her business experience, Fiorina said that she is uniquely qualified to serve as president because she has known and worked with world leaders for many years.\n\nShe said on her first day in office she would make two phone calls. The first would be to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to let him know he has a friend in the Oval Office.\n\nThe second would be to the supreme leader of Iran to tell him she would implement severe economic sanctions against the country unless they agreed to unrestricted inspections of their nuclear facilities.\n\n\u201cHe might not take the phone call, but he would get the message,\u201d Fiorina said.\n\nFiorina said that leaders who \u201cchallenge the status quo\u201d often make enemies, but that challenging the status quo is the \u201chighest calling\u201d of leadership.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carly Fiorina said that Americans are tired of a \u201cprofessional political class\u201d during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday night.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Carly Fiorina said that Americans are tired of a \u201cprofessional political class\u201d during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday night.", "title": "Carly Fiorina Vows to \u2018Challenge' Status Quo", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/FiorinaScanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-10T13:40:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1F89dah"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Carly Fiorina said that Americans are tired of a \u201cprofessional political class\u201d during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday night.", "title": "Carly Fiorina Vows to \u2018Challenge' Status Quo", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/FiorinaScanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-06-10T10:10:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-10T13:40:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Carly Fiorina, politics, New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton, republican presidential candidates, presidential candidates"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3261\"", "article_summary": "Fiorina said that leaders who \u201cchallenge the status quo\u201d often make enemies, but that challenging the status quo is the \u201chighest calling\u201d of leadership.\nShe said Americans are losing their sense of \u201climitless potential,\u201d and that Americans need a president who understands \u201chow the economy actually works.\u201d\u201cYou have the right to fulfill your potential,\u201d Fiorina said.\nNEW BOSTON, N.H.\u2014Carly Fiorina said that Americans are tired of a \u201cprofessional political class\u201d during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday night.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what our founders meant when they said \u2018life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u2019\u201dShe said that her life story\u2014starting as a secretary and eventually becoming a CEO\u2014is only possible in the United States.\n\u201cWe\u2019re destroying more businesses than we are creating,\u201d Fiorina said."}
