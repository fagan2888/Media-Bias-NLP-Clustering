The 84-page document spanned Catholic topics from social justice to interfaith dialogue, but Francis\u2019 comments and critcisms of the free market, hardly new ground for him or for the Catholic Church, opened the door for supporters of aggressive market intervention by government to claim the pope as their own\u2014yet free markets provide the very environment in which the pope's professed goals would be easiest to pursue.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of stuff about Jesus in his thinking that I can't really sign on to,\u201d wrote Slate\u2019s Matthew Yglesias as he highlighted several comments in the exhortation that focused on the \u201ctyranny\u201d of unfettered capitalism. For example, in one passage pulled by Yglesias, the pope hit on a favorite hobby horse of the left, income inequality: \"While the earnings of a minority are growing exponentially, so too is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few. This imbalance is the result of ideologies which defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation. Consequently, they reject the right of states, charged with vigilance for the common good, to exercise any form of control. A new tyranny is thus born, invisible and often virtual, which unilaterally and relentlessly imposes its own laws and rules.\"\n\nBut Yglesias skips the next sentence, even though he picks up another passage just a couple of sentences later. That comment? \u201cDebt and the accumulation of interest also make it difficult for countries to realize the potential of their own economies and keep citizens from enjoying their purchasing power.\"\n\nOpponents of the United States\u2019 ballooning debt, which included Barack Obama before he became president, often frame their opposition as a moral issue: Governments shouldn\u2019t borrow from future generations to spend on current ones. That intergenerational injustice is often covered here at Reason. Yet it would be silly to argue that therefore the pope would oppose, say, raising the debt limit. Like caring for the poor, however, spending within your means is a Christian value, too, as is not stealing or coveting your neighbor\u2019s things.\n\nNevertheless, even if every passage related to economics is used to co-opt the pope\u2019s message to the billion-plus members of his church for an advantage in temporal politics, it would be inadequate and inaccurate. The \u201cstuff about Jesus\u201d should come as no surprise, as it is fundamental to the pope\u2019s thinking. When exhorting government and financial leaders to work \u201cto ensure that all citizens have dignified work, education and healthcare,\u201d the pope asks, \u201cWhy not turn to God and ask him to inspire their plans?\u201d In his apostolic exhortation, Pope Francis writes that politics, \u201cthough often denigrated, remains a lofty vocation and one of the highest forms of charity, insomuch as it seeks the common good,\u201d choosing to describe politics charitably. At one point, while discussing the Christian concept of solidarity in pushing for social change, the pope writes that \u201c[c]hanging structures without generating new convictions and attitudes will only ensure that those same structures will become, sooner or later, corrupt, oppressive and ineffectual.\u201d Yet it\u2019d be easier to get a camel through the eye of a needle than to create a political class of selfless actors interested in people\u2019s well-being and not their own enrichment.\n\nLast week, Reason\u2019s Matt Welch called the pope\u2019s comments on economics \u201cembarrassing in their wrongness,\u201d as the evidence shows free markets lifting a record-breaking number of people out of poverty in the last century. The pope\u2019s omission and obliviousness to those facts on the ground, Welch wrote, advertised his own ignorance. Welch concluded that the pope was \u201cnot primarily interested in spreading truth, but rather in exciting popular passions.\u201d And, indeed, Pope Francis\u2019 exhortation was meant to excite at least the passion of Catholics, to whom it was addressed. As such, his economic naivet\u00e9 is born of optimism.\n\nDignified work, education, and healthcare are things any good Christian ought to help others gain access to; social justice, like family values before it, meant something in a religious context before being politicized, respectively, by the partisan left and the right. And the pope is right that individual acts of charity are not enough (he also said welfare ought to be a temporary measure, but don\u2019t tell the liberals); structures that improve access to work, education, and healthcare do far more. But the faith in government and political leaders is misplaced.\n\nFor example, in the United States, politicians pushing the Affordable Care Act claimed the legislation was a solution to a moral problem, lack of access to healthcare. Yet the legislation didn\u2019t deal with increasing access to healthcare, but on imposing controls on the market for insurance and on healthcare. While hundreds of thousands of Americans have learned they\u2019re losing their insurance plans in the last few months, the Catholic Church learned what Obamacare had in store for it far earlier\u2014the so-called contraceptive mandate is far from what the Church would consider \u201cdignified,\u201d and is being challenged in court on religious liberty grounds. The Archdiocese of Washington, DC argued the Obama Administration was implementing a \u201cconscious political strategy to marginalize and delegitimize\u201d Catholic teaching. The Archbishop of Chicago warns Obamacare rules could put an end to Catholic hospitals all together; no dignity and no healthcare.\n\nAnd despite all that, America\u2019s system of government is among the most tolerant of the freedom of religion on the planet, as the pope\u2019s concern in his exhortation for the persecution of Christians and other people of faith elsewhere in the world attests. The attempt to politicize healthcare has provided ample illustration that political leaders are interested primarily in control, and not in actually increasing access to anything. \u201cRealities are greater than ideas,\u201d the pope wrote, a principle related to the \u201cincarnation of the word and its being put into practice.\u201d But not everyone has the Holy Spirit.\n\nFree markets, and freedom, work because they are realities, not just ideas. This summer, Reason\u2019s Ronald Bailey responded to a juvenile anti-libertarian attack centered around the idea that because no libertarian utopia exists, the philosophy ought to be considered discredited. Bailey disassembled the argument, and showed how actual existing policies centered on principles of freedom (from liberalized trade to school choice) have improved the well-being of humanity. Pope Francis could learn something here. His attack on \u201cunfettered\u201d capitalism shouldn\u2019t be construed as an attack on the free market, as no such system exists today. As a former citizen of Argentina, Pope Francis\u2019 primary exposure to capitalism was likely the corrupt and cronyist kind prevalent there, and, increasingly, around the world. That\u2019s the reality. And as the Catholic Church\u2019s experience with Obamacare shows, the desire by the political classes to accumulate raw power even in advanced liberal democracies is a reality, too. Freedom is an idea that can improve those realities. The pope claims the \u201cinvisible hand of the free market\u201d can\u2019t be trusted to foster \u201cgrowth in justice,\u201d which \"requires decisions, programmes, mechanisms and processes specifically geared to a better distribution of income, the creation of sources of employment and an integral promotion of the poor which goes beyond a simple welfare mentality.\u201d Yet only the free market can guarantee just growth. The pope\u2019s ideas are not grounded in realities, but in an unbridled optimism about the nature of political leaders. Free markets, on the other hand, when unencumbered by self-interested government intervention, allow for a measure of self-organization and emergent order. They\u2019re a place where, contrary to the pope\u2019s inclinations, Christian solidarity with the poor and marginalized has a better chance of succeeding than in the top-down power structures that have tended, and continue, to snuff it out.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Give freedom a chance", "title": "Pope Francis\u2019 Apostolic Exhortation, Free Markets, and Social Justice", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2013/12/03/pope-francis-apostolic-exhortation-free", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13860341741033.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the \nEvangelii Gaudium (pdf), the first apostolic\nexhortation of his papacy, Pope Francis \nfocused on the church\u2019s mission of evangelization, urging\nclergy and the laity to \u201crecover the original freshness of the\nGospel.\u201d In the new pope\u2019s missionary church, the \u201cdoors should\nalways be open,\u201d he wrote.
