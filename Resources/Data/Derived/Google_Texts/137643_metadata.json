In 2013, the French pushed Islamic militants out of Mali\u2019s northern cities and towns although jihadists continue to carry out attacks on U.N. peacekeepers.\n\n\u201cI want to reiterate that these attacks will not impede the determination of the United Nations to support the Malian people and the peace process,\u201d said Mongi Hamdi, the head of the U.N. mission and the special representative for the secretary-general in Mali. \u201cI express my solidarity and salute the brave men and women serving (the U.N. mission) throughout the country for their efforts to bringing lasting peace to Mali in these difficult conditions.\u201d\n\nNorthern Mali has been unstable since it fell to Tuareg separatists and Islamic extremists following a military coup in 2012. Despite the presence of French troops and the U.N. force, the extremists have continued attacks in the north. Extremists have also extended attacks farther south this year, including an assault on a Bamako restaurant/nightclub popular with foreigners in March and a Nov. 20 attack on a luxury hotel in the capital.\n\nMalian authorities said they\u2019ve arrested two men over the attack at the Radisson Blu hotel that killed 20 people.
