NEW YORK – Gary Harris will suit up for his second straight game, Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said Sunday morning.

The rookie impressed in his NBA debut, scoring 13 points on 6-of-10 shooting against the Indiana Pacers on Friday night. He added two steals and a block, displaying flashes of the type of defense he was known for in his two collegiate seasons at Michigan State.

“I liked the fact that he was poised,” Shaw said. “It was his first NBA action, in his hometown, and he looked like he belonged. He didn’t look back. He was very aggressive offensively, he was aggressive defensively. It was exactly what we needed. I think he got caught up a couple of times because he was going good, had a couple of heat-checks. But for the most part I was encouraged by his performance.”



Harris is getting this chance mainly because Randy Foye is dealing with a bruised right knee. Foye did not practice on Saturday and will be questionable for Monday’s game at Cleveland.

“It’s a day-to-day thing,” Shaw said. “We just have to kind of wait it out and see how long it will take.”
