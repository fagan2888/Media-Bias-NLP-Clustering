Sleep with a cumbersome CPAP machine at night, or play the tuba during the day?\n\nBoth may be prove to be equally effective against sleep apnea, a new study shows.\n\nResearchers in India compared the risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea in 64 people who played a wind instrument versus 65 people who did not.\n\nThe wind players won. While they didn't have a greater lung capacity, they did have nearly half the risk of developing sleep apnea. The findings applied to all wind players, so piccolo, saxophone or French horn, it matters not.\n\nResearchers theorize the difference is due to the increased muscle tone of the upper airways that wind players have likely developed. Sleep apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat relax, briefly cutting off the ability to breathe. The patient awakens momentarily to catch his breath - as many as 30 times an hour. Besides causing fatigue, it can also lead to high blood pressure.\n\nStrengthening those muscles by playing a wind instrument could be \"a cheap and non-invasive method\" of preventing sleep apnea.\n\nMaybe there's a marketing idea in there somewhere: Band camp for grown-ups?\n\nKathleen O'Brien may be reached at kobrien@njadvancemedia.com, or at (732) 902-4557.
