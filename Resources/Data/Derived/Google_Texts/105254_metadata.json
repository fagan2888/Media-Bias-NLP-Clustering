Eric Hites, Facebook.com\n\nEric Hites, 40, would do anything for his estranged wife, and that includes riding a bicycle from the east to west coast over the next several months. Hites is already two months into his ride, documenting his every pedal on the website \u201cFat Guy Across America.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hites\u2019s website, he\u2019s always liked \u201cto do big things and make his family proud.\u201d So when his weight gain over the years started to interfere with his marriage \u2014 ABC News reported being overweight sparked a depression and grumpiness that caused things to \u201cfall apart\u201d \u2014 he knew he needed to do something big in order to show his wife he was still committed to her and their marriage. The answer was revealed to him through \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles),\" the classic song by scottish duo The Proclaimers.\n\n\u201cI blame the Proclaimers, I really do,\u201d he explains on his GoFundMe page. The page was set up to raise the money he\u2019ll need for supplies and equipment, camping, and eating as he gets further into his ride. Newport Bicycle, a bicycle shop in Rhode Island (where Hites currently is), recently donated a bicycle, helmet, and other \u201cgoodies\u201d he's going to need.\n\nAlthough it's been just a couple of months, ABC found Hites and his wife are \u201crededicated unofficially.\u201d She thought he was all talk prior to embarking on this epic bike ride, and now that she sees he\u2019s serious, there may be hope for them yet. On the weight loss front, Hites is currently down 60 pounds.\n\nUltimately, he plans for the ride to \"launch the rest of his life in the direction needed to be successful and healthy.\u201d And he fully intends on compiling all the videos, journal entries, and images he collects into a book about his experiences. He concluded on his website that this will be his defining moment, \"and hopefully forgiveness and a new solid start\" toward the life he's always wanted.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "560, pound, indiana, man, eric, hites, biking, cross, country, love, and, physical, change", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Eric Hites will be on a bike the next seven months to prove to his estranged wife he's committed to their marriage and his health.", "title": "560-Pound Man Biking Across America To Win Back His Wife And His Life [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/560-pound-indiana-man-eric-hites-biking-cross-country-love-and-physical-change-344542", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/07/24/eric-hites.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eric Hites will be on a bike the next seven months to prove to his estranged wife he's committed to their marriage and his health.", "title": "560-Pound Man Biking Across America To Win Back His Wife And His Life [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/560-pound-indiana-man-eric-hites-biking-cross-country-love-and-physical-change-344542", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/07/24/eric-hites.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/24/eric-hites.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-24T12:24:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-24T12:24:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Eric Hites will be on a bike the next seven months to prove to his estranged wife he's committed to their marriage and his health."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2000\"", "article_summary": "Eric Hites will be on a bike the next seven months to prove to his estranged wife he's committed to their marriage and his health.\nEric Hites, Facebook.comEric Hites, 40, would do anything for his estranged wife, and that includes riding a bicycle from the east to west coast over the next several months.\nNewport Bicycle, a bicycle shop in Rhode Island (where Hites currently is), recently donated a bicycle, helmet, and other \u201cgoodies\u201d he's going to need.\nThe answer was revealed to him through \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles),\" the classic song by scottish duo The Proclaimers.\nHe concluded on his website that this will be his defining moment, \"and hopefully forgiveness and a new solid start\" toward the life he's always wanted."}
