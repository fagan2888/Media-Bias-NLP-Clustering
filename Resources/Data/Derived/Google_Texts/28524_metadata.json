Aside from some technical glitches during the first month, the health insurance exchanges are operational and open for enrollment. However, many of your clients may still have lingering questions, especially those clients in the baby boomer generation. Here are some things to keep in mind as you contemplate how the new Affordable Care Act will affect your clients.\n\nQualification Guidelines\n\nIf your client currently receives health care coverage through his employer, he won\u2019t be eligible to choose a health insurance option on the health exchanges. These marketplaces are for those purchasing non-group insurance for themselves or their families. However, companies that have less than 50 employees will be able to apply through the health exchange. Those age 65 or older who are on Medicare won\u2019t have to do anything to continue receiving their government benefits. Medicare fulfills their insurance requirement.\n\nIf your client doesn\u2019t have coverage through his employer, Medicare, Medicaid or some military or veteran\u2019s plans, he will need to purchase health care or pay a penalty come April during tax time.\n\nNo More Denials\n\nIn the past, many baby boomers were worried about being denied access to health insurance benefits because of their health. This is now a thing of the past. Beginning in January 2014, insurance companies can no longer deny insurance because of pre-existing conditions; those with pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes can\u2019t be charged more because of their health status or be issued a policy that excludes coverage for specific conditions.\n\nDeadlines to Remember\n\nCoverage on marketplace health plans will begin on Jan. 1, 2014. Open enrollment runs until March 31, 2014. If your client enroll between the 1st and the 15th of the month and pays his premium, his coverage will begin the on the first day of the following month. Therefore, if your client wants health insurance to begin on Jan. 1, he must be enrolled by Dec. 15 and pay his first month\u2019s premium.\n\nIf your client enrolls for insurance between the 16th and the end of a month, his coverage will be effective on the first day of the month after that. For example, if your clients enroll on March 31, the last day to enroll and pay the premium, his insurance will begin on May 1.\n\nEnroll in the Proper State\n\nIf your client is fortunate enough to spend part of his year in another state, he must pay attention to which state he signs up in. Each state has its own health insurance marketplace, and your client must sign up for your insurance in the state of his primary residence. If your client is a snowbird who splits his time between states, he\u2019ll have a choice of multistate plans available to him on the marketplace.\n\nIf your client moves his primary residence out of the state he signed up in, he\u2019ll need to re-enroll for insurance coverage in his new state. Such a move will allow him to sign up for insurance outside of the open enrollment period.\n\nForget about Job Lock\n\nSome may feel they are locked into their current insurance policy at their present job until they become eligible for Medicare at age 65. This is likely because they developed a medical condition while under their current policy that will preclude them from qualifying for a new health insurance policy elsewhere. Now that insurance companies can\u2019t turn individuals down or charge them more for pre-existing conditions, it will stimulate job mobility among the baby boomers. It\u2019s expected that this change will encourage many to start their own businesses or even consider early retirement.\n\nRates Can Still Increase\n\nWith the new law, insurance companies can no longer increase your client\u2019s premium at a renewal time after your client has been diagnosed with a disease such as cancer. Rates can increase, however, across the board for everyone who brought the same plan from the same insurer. Premiums will stay the same throughout the calendar year, but can be increased from year to year.\n\nThis initial coverage period runs from Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, 2014. If insurers find that they\u2019re paying out more than they planned for on policies offered on the marketplace, they will likely increase premiums the following year. This will be stated during the open enrollment period for the following year, and consumers will have the option of choosing another plan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many of your clients may still have lingering questions about the Affordable Care Act, especially those clients in the baby boomer generation.
