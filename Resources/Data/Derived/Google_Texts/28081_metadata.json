Compared to whites, Hispanics have higher death rates from diabetes, chronic liver disease and homicide.\n\nYet, despite these facts, Hispanics are living longer than whites or blacks \u2013 and are surpassing the life expectancy of other groups \u2013 according to a comprehensive report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday. The data used for the report came from health surveys, death and U.S. census data and covered the years 2009 through 2013.\n\n\"For many years there has been a description of the Hispanic paradox, that despite \u2026 lower socioeconomic status they live longer,\" said CDC Director Tom Frieden, during a phone conference Tuesday.\n\nThere are two reasons for the paradox, he indicated. One is that Hispanics who immigrate to the U.S. tend to be among the healthiest in their home countries. Another reason, he said, is because U.S. Hispanics smoke less than other groups.\n\nAbout 13.5 percent of Latinos smoke, compared to 23.8 percent of non-Hispanic whites.\n\n\"The fact that people smoke less makes it more likely that they will live longer,\" Frieden said.\n\nThe study also found differences between Hispanics born in the U.S. and those who are foreign born. Latinos born here experience higher rates of obesity, heart disease and cancer.\n\n\"I think that has a lot to do with the types of food that are marketed toward folks \u2013 for example, sugary drinks, fatty foods get a lot of play on TV,\" said Dr. Ken Dominguez, the CDC researcher who led the study, according to the Houston Chronicle.\n\nImmigrants are healthier than second- and third-generation Hispanics, a clear indication that the \u201cHispanic paradox\u201d has nothing to do with genetics. Frieden said the longer Latinos are in the U.S., the more their health begins to degrade because many begin eating more junk food or take up smoking.\n\n\"One thing that's clear is it's not genetics, because genes don't change when they come to this country,\" Frieden said.\n\nAmong Hispanic groups in the United States, Puerto Ricans appear to have the worst health.\n\nAmong other findings:\n\n\u2014 Puerto Ricans have higher rates of cancer and heart disease than Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans or those with roots in Central or South America.\n\n\u2014 Compared to Mexican-Americans and Cuban-Americans, Puerto Ricans have the highest death rates from cancer, heart disease, homicide and five other leading causes.\n\n\u2014 Hispanics, as a whole, have a substantially lower cigarette smoking rate than whites, but the Puerto Rican smoking rate is the highest among Hispanics \u2013 as high as the national average.\n\n\"We think [the smoking rate] is the biggest reason\" why Puerto Ricans look so unhealthy compared to other Hispanics, Dominguez said.\n\nThe analysis was specific to Hispanics living in the 50 states and did not include residents of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. Puerto Ricans represent about 10 percent of the U.S. Hispanic population. Mexican-Americans account for 64 percent, Cuban-Americans are 4 percent, and Dominicans, 3 percent.\n\nIncludes reporting by the Associated Press.\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "article_metadata": {"classification": "LANGUAGES/English", "dcterms.modified": "2015-05-06 10:59:45 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "Hispanics are living longer than whites or blacks \u2013 and are surpassing the life expectancy of other groups, according to a comprehensive report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday.", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/health/0/0/hispanic%20health%20latino.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"\\u0027Hispanic paradox\\u0027 - U.S. Latinos outliving richer whites - not genetic, study finds\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/health/2015/05/06/hispanic-paradox-us-latinos-outliving-richer-whites-not-genetic-study-finds/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/health/0/0/hispanic%20health%20latino.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"e29ad8edbb92d410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"health\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-06T14:59:45Z\",\"tags\":[\"LANGUAGES/English\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "front", "keywords": "United States,heart disease,South America,cigarette smoking,America,health insurance,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,Associated Press,Centers for Disease Control,Tom Frieden,life expectancy,Disease Control", "prism.channel": "fnl", "dc.description": "Hispanics are living longer than whites or blacks \u2013 and are surpassing the life expectancy of other groups, according to a comprehensive report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday.", "dc.identifier": "urn:uuid:e29ad8edbb92d410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD", "pagetype": "article", "dc.subject": "United States,heart disease,South America,cigarette smoking,America,health insurance,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,Associated Press,Centers for Disease Control,Tom Frieden,life expectancy,Disease Control", "description": "El gigante de Redmond podr\u00eda lanzar dos nuevos modelos de Xbox One que llegar\u00edan al mercado en los pr\u00f3ximos dos a\u00f1os, seg\u00fan reporta Kotaku.
