Would lifting sanctions actually lead to dismantling of the rogue state\u2019s atomic agenda? Despite some healthy skepticism early on\u2014which was based, as it should be, on actual security concerns\u2014discussion mainly hinged on whether or not the deal was safe and if it was a positive step for global preservation. The actual provisions in the deal were analyzed. Inspections. Centrifuges. All of which is to say, it was actually encouraging to see a political culture with the attention span of an episode of Dance Moms really tune in on an important issue and think it over on its merits.\n\nExcept that: During the conversation, former Governor Huckabee took a break from pandering to Evangelical voters by defending Josh Duggar and attempted to frighten Jewish voters by saying that the nuclear deal would lead to nothing short of \u201cmarching Israelis to the door of the oven.\u201d This was one of those things where you get a shock wave that\u2019s actually physical. See, despite a right-wing tradition going all the way back to early 2009 that loves to invoke the Second World War at the drop of a hat (\u201cThe Obamas getting a second dog is like Germany in the thirties!\u201d heaved Fox & Friends), this comparison of a policy deal to death\u2019s actual threshold was scandalous. I don\u2019t necessarily peg Mr. Huckabee\u2019s wane as candidate to that one moment: but it sure didn\u2019t help. It might even have ushered him a little faster to exit, unnoticed, stage right.\n\nWhat a difference six months makes.\n\nIn the intervening toboggan run downwards, we\u2019ve actually debated the Ku Klux Klan. And who knew there was a pro and a con there? The Klan always seemed to me above point/counterpoint, and an exemplar of a moral absolute truth that I thought to be incontrovertible, but, then, I\u2019ve never thought about booking Jeffrey Lord on television. I thought that as an American there was no need to be fair or balanced about the Klan, and that the Klan was one story where there weren\u2019t two sides. Thank you 2016: I stand disgusted, yet corrected.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that this dark mood is most exemplified by activity at the campaign rallies of Donald Trump. That\u2019s not breaking news at this point and is a story that will continue to unfold in real time, and be examined. But there\u2019s something else that goes way beyond that campaign or its events: it\u2019s reflected by what I can only describe as fury that\u2019s almost bloodlust on the right. And it\u2019s not just in the margins. This is in the mainstream Republican side of a Presidential race.\n\nIn 2010, I was horrified when sitting members of Congress held up signs from a balustrade on The Mall exhorting Tea Party protestors below to \u201cKill The Bill\u201d during the churning final days of frantic Affordable Care Act voting. And sweaty gasbags screamed, \u201cYou lie!\u201d and, \u201cBaby killer!\u201d at the President on the Floor of the House. I remember being flabbergasted that people whose station would suggest control, or at the very least not chaos, would use terms that push at pressure points until they threaten to break. Then it was Sharron Angle and her \u201cSecond Amendment solutions.\u201d\n\nFast forward. At televised Republican debates the crowd gleefully roars approval when they hear words like \u201cdeath penalty\u201d or \u201cgun\u201d or \u201crape, incest and the life of the mother.\u201d Scary words. Violent words. They seem to want to tear something apart and rip its limbs off. And not just the individual mandate, EPA regulations, or the Common Core.\n\nI guess my point goes back to the lesson our mothers told us, or hopefully told us, as small children. Words matter. And yes, I see a movement that started with \u201cKill The Bill\u201d and paused at \u201cleading to the door of the ovens\u201d and now has deposited us in this current radioactive wasteland.\n\nImages at those rallies resemble the twisted faces behind Elizabeth Eckford as she walked into Central High. White, but out of control and red with rage. Now people have progressed from getting shoved to getting punched in the face\u2014and, post-punch, as if the puncher somehow left the job unfinished, he was quoted as saying that, next time, they \u201cmay have to kill him.\u201d Last weekend some weird old lady did a \u2018Heil-Hitler\u2019 in a widely distributed image. Not to be outdone, a guy with a mustache did his own reciprocal sig-heil and screamed that people should \u201cgo back to Auschwitz.\u201d And now, this week, there\u2019s word of militias forming. Dude, let me be the not-first-one to say that any sentence that starts with \u201cmilitias,\u201d unless it accompanies a retelling of the Battle of Lexington and Concord, does not end well.\n\nOver the past several years\u2014and coming into sharp focus during the course of the campaign\u2014it\u2019s gone from bad to worse. And please bore somebody else with platitudes about \u201cthe public doesn\u2019t want politically correct career politicians!\u201d or, my least favorite and the most meaningless, \u201cit\u2019s not an establishment year!\u201d Bull. It\u2019s something else. The establishment has been mean and cruel before, and said\u2014and legislated\u2014terrible, heartless things entirely bereft of humanity. After all, look at the history of the United States for the first three hundred plus years\u2014or at Simon Cowell or that odd little lady with the glasses who said that you were the weakest link. But until this sustained, white-hot period, I rested assured that the arc really did bend toward a more perfect union and that, despite fits and starts in social justice, and the fact that we are very imperfect, different people all jumbled together, there was a broad agreement and a basic understanding that bound us together. That seems to be hanging by a thread.\n\nAnd it\u2019s only March.\n\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher of Observer Media.\n\nJon Reinish is a native New Yorker who works in political communications, strategy and media.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Jon Reinish", "sailthru.author": "Jon Reinish", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-515126872.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-515126872.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "Death Penalty, Donald Trump, Holocaust, Jeffrey Lord, josh duggar, Ku Klux Klan, Mike Huckabee, second amendment, Sharron Angle, Simon Cowell, TEA PARTY, WWII, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "death penalty, donald trump, holocaust, jeffrey lord, josh duggar, ku klux klan, mike huckabee, second amendment, sharron angle, simon cowell, tea party, wwii", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-515126872.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "%tags%", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "The GOP Wasteland: Where Basic Humanity Goes to Die", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "jon-reinish", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-515126872.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "Long gone are the days where the Klan had two sides.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/jon-reinish-headshot.jpg?quality=80&w=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "sailthru.byline_twitter": "@jonreinish", "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2016-03-16T13:30:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-16T13:30:08+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/jon-reinish"}, "sailthru.description": "Long gone are the days where the Klan had two sides.", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "Long gone are the days where the Klan had two sides.", "title": "The GOP Wasteland: Where Basic Humanity Goes to Die", "url": "http://observer.com/2016/03/this-gop-wasteland-where-basic-humanity-goes-to-die/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-515126872.jpg?quality=80&w=1200", "height": 826}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Jon Reinish is a native New Yorker who works in political communications, strategy and media.
