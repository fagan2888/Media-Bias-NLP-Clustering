Holand won the event. ( Brandon Hopper / Daily Record )\n\nCole Alford during the Pueblo Centennial Invitational on Saturday at Dutch Clark Stadium in Pueblo. (Brandon Hopper / Daily Record)\n\nPueblo \u2014 Taylor Holand isn't at her best this early in the season. But where she was at on Saturday was good enough to win.\n\nFlorence's sophomore standout jumped 4 feet, 11 inches for the high jump championship at the Pueblo Centennial Invitational at Dutch Clark Stadium.\n\nLast year at the state meet, Holand cleared 5 feet to finish second in Class 3A. Her personal best is 5 feet, 1 inch. On Saturday, her 4-foot-11-inch mark was good enough to beat Class 4A Pueblo East's Kaitlyn Simony.\n\nHoland wasn't at her peek. Instead she found herself battling nagging shin splints and her body's unwillingness to do what her training has taught her.\n\n\"I was just trying to ignore the pain,\" she said minutes after winning the jumpoff against Simony. \"It was really hard.\"\n\nShe said she was tipping her head back and not looking at her feet while in the air, and she also was frustrated that she repeatedly slowed down on her approach instead of speeding up.\n\n\"She's got to get her steps down. She didn't have a great week of practice \u2014 she's nursing a little bit of shin splints. All in all she did pretty well,\" Florence coach Tom Torres said, adding that the field provided her with great competition.\n\nMakenna Green finished fourth in the shot put, 13th in the discus and 18th in the 100-meter hurdles. Her shot put distance of 35 feet, 1/2 inch was a personal best, Torres said.\n\nOn Deck Wednesday: Florence @ St. Mary's Invite, 3:30 p.m. April 5: Florence @ Pueblo County meet, 9 a.m. April 9: Florence @ St. Mary's Invite, 3:30 p.m.\n\nMorgan Weaver finished seventh in the long jump and 10th in the 100-meter dash.\n\nThe girls finished 13th as a team, while the boys failed to place any competitors and didn't score points, although they did have some solid performances.\n\nMatthew Miller took 12th in the 110-meter hurdles and 12th in the high jump. Brent Leggitt finished 23rd in the 100-meter.\n\n\"This weather has really been damaging,\" Torres said. \"We're so young, it's just really hard for them to compete (in it).\"\n\nThe Huskies will be in action Wednesday at St. Mary's in Colorado Springs.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_25402401/florence-huskies-taylor-holand-wins-high-jump", "modificationDate": "2014-03-22T22:11:29-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0322/20140322__24drFTRw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Brandon Hopper \n \n  hopperb@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Florence's sophomore standout jumped 4 feet, 11 inches for the high jump championship at the Pueblo Centennial Invitational at Dutch Clark Stadium.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:25402401:view"}, "startDate": "2014-03-22T22:10:43-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_25402401/florence-huskies-taylor-holand-wins-high-jump", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0322/20140322__24drFTRw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Florence's sophomore standout jumped 4 feet, 11 inches for the high jump championship at the Pueblo Centennial Invitational at Dutch Clark Stadium.", "title": "Florence Huskies' Taylor Holand wins high jump"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Florence's sophomore standout jumped 4 feet, 11 inches for the high jump championship at the Pueblo Centennial Invitational at Dutch Clark Stadium.", "title": "Florence Huskies' Taylor Holand wins high jump", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_25402401/florence-huskies-taylor-holand-wins-high-jump", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0322/20140322__24drFTRw~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-22T22:10:43-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2024-03-22T22:09:40-0600", "sailthru.title": "Florence Huskies' Taylor Holand wins high jump", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Brandon Hopperhopperb@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0322/20140322__24drFTRw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-03-22T22:12:39-0600", "news_keywords": "Canyon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canyon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd550\"", "article_summary": "On Deck Wednesday: Florence @ St. Mary's Invite, 3:30 p.m. April 5: Florence @ Pueblo County meet, 9 a.m. April 9: Florence @ St. Mary's Invite, 3:30 p.m.Morgan Weaver finished seventh in the long jump and 10th in the 100-meter dash.\nThe Huskies will be in action Wednesday at St. Mary's in Colorado Springs.\nHuskies sophomore leads team; Green, Weaver place wellTaylor Holand during the Pueblo Centennial Invitational on Saturday at Dutch Clark Stadium in Pueblo.\nFlorence's sophomore standout jumped 4 feet, 11 inches for the high jump championship at the Pueblo Centennial Invitational at Dutch Clark Stadium.\n(Brandon Hopper / Daily Record)Pueblo \u2014 Taylor Holand isn't at her best this early in the season."}
