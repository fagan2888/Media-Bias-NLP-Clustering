She quickly had a double mastectomy and her breast tissue was sent to the lab.\n\n\u201cThey found absolutely no cancer,\u201d Loewen said. \u201cBut they think it could have turned cancerous at any time. It was on the verge of changing.\u201d\n\nMom survived, had breast reconstruction surgery and is approaching her 80s in good health.\n\nThis year, Loewen went in for her mammogram and the results came back.\n\n\u201cSo here I am, 47 and I get my mammogram and the word \u2018calcification\u2019 hits,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m headed right down the same path as Mom.\u201d\n\nLoewen said she has a team of doctors who \u201care watching everything that happens in my tissue with a fine-tooth comb. The trick is catching it before it turns to cancer.\u201d\n\nThe upbeat Loewen, who ran the Remember When antiques shop from 2002-2012 before landing a job in communications, said she would not have caught the calcification problem if not for the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI worked my (tail) off and I could not afford health insurance when I was a small business owner,\u201d Loewen said. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know how much it costs. Now, with Obamacare, I have health insurance for the first time in 15 years. That\u2019s how this (calcification) got found.\u201d\n\nWhile Loewen keeps a close eye on her health, she gets plenty of exercise by using her bicycle as her primary mode of transportation around the city. She also volunteers with Meals On Wheels, where she uses her bike to travel 20 to 25 miles per day delivering food to elderly citizens in Frenchtown.\n\n\u201cWe love to do it by bike,\u201d she said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.tdo.com/1vUJMZe", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Karen Loewen\u2019s mother was around 50 when she went to get a mammogram.", "og": {"site_name": "Tallahassee Democrat", "description": "Karen Loewen\u2019s mother was around 50 when she went to get a mammogram.", "title": "Calcification:\u2018I\u2019m headed right down the same path as Mom\u2019", "url": "http://www.tallahassee.com/story/life/wellness/2014/10/09/calcificationim-headed-right-path-mom/16990869/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tallahassee.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Karen Loewen\u2019s mother was around 50 when she went to get a mammogram.", "creator": "@tdonline", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Tallahassee/2014/10/09/karenloewenphoto.jpg", "title": "Calcification:\u2018I\u2019m headed right down the same path as Mom\u2019", "site": "@tdonline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=828466230", "fb": {"app_id": 176414652381033}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1470\"", "article_summary": "She quickly had a double mastectomy and her breast tissue was sent to the lab.\n\u201cI\u2019m headed right down the same path as Mom.\u201dLoewen said she has a team of doctors who \u201care watching everything that happens in my tissue with a fine-tooth comb.\nNow, with Obamacare, I have health insurance for the first time in 15 years.\n\u201cI worked my (tail) off and I could not afford health insurance when I was a small business owner,\u201d Loewen said.\nBuy Photo Karen Loewen (Photo: Mark Hinson/Democrat )Buy PhotoIn the mid-\u201980s, Karen Loewen\u2019s mother was around 50 when she went to get a mammogram."}
