On Sunday, after Israel struck another UN school, Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the UN, called on Israel \u201cto conduct a full and prompt investigation of this incident as well as the recent strikes that hit other UNRWA schools. Civilians, many of whom have been told to evacuate their homes by the Israel Defense Forces, must be able to find refuge in safe, UN-designated shelters.\u201d\n\nThis followed pointed criticism from the White House and the State Department last week. Both called Israeli strikes on UN schools unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe shelling of a U.N. facility that is housing innocent civilians who are fleeing violence is totally unacceptable and totally indefensible,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said last week. \u201cAnd it is clear that we need our allies in Israel to do more to live up to the high standards that they have set for themselves.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most surprising criticism, however, came from the Pentagon. DOD spokesman Colonel Steve Warren, in a rare public rebuke of Israel from within the Pentagon, said that civilian casualties must be limited.\n\nRelated: Why Israel, Under Siege from All Sides, Stands Firm\n\n\u201cThe civilian casualties in Gaza have been too high,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s become clear that the Israelis need to do more to live up to their very high standards \u2013 their very high and very public standards \u2013 for protecting civilian life.\u201d\n\nPlaying Both Sides\n\nThe rebuke from the Pentagon raised eyebrows because DOD has been perhaps the most fervent supporter of Israel, in this conflict and in the past. As the current fight started, the Pentagon requested that Congress approve $225 million to bolster Israel\u2019s Iron Dome protection system. Congress approved this funding last week.\n\nThe U.S. also has provided, and continues to provide, billions in military aid to Israel. Since the end of World War II, Israel has been the biggest beneficiary of American military aid. It also buys billions of dollars worth of weapons and vehicles from American military contractors.\n\nThis close relationship continued a day after DOD denounced Israel. Last Friday, DOD confirmed that it has released a large cache of ammunition worth $1 billion to the Israelis.\n\nRelated: The Kerry Quote That Really Matters Isn\u2019t About Israel\n\n\u201cThe United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability,\u201d Pentagon spokesperson Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement. \u201cThis defense sale is consistent with those objectives.\u201d\n\nPlaying Politics?\n\nChristian Whiton, a former Bush administration State Department senior advisor, says that DOD\u2019s statement is an instance of the White House injecting politics into the military, a place where it doesn\u2019t belong.\n\n\u201cThis fits with the Obama administration's consistent politicization of military matters at the Pentagon. You have the head of Pacific Command saying that climate change is the biggest threat,\u201d Whiton said in an interview. \u201cYou have the joint chiefs failing to admit to Congress the military risks posed by rapid withdrawal from Afghanistan. And now this move, which conveys a separation between us and a key ally.\u201d\n\nHe also said DOD\u2019s statement sends a mixed message to the American people.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't clarify matters for the American people, nor will it keep our people safe. It's just another lamentable move motivated by politics and bad judgment prevailing over a sound military assessment,\u201d Whiton added.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Last week, in a rare rebuke, DOD criticized Israel for civilian deaths.
