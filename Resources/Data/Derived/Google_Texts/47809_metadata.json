FuriousPete.com\n\nFurious Pete, a competitive eating champion and amateur bodybuilder, created a protein bar with over 1,000 grams of protein and celebrated by eating the entire thing in one go. Even with Pete\u2019s rigorous workout regimen, is 1,000 grams of protein too much for one day?\n\nIn the video seen below, Furious Pete, whose real name is Pete Czerwinski, used 24 White Chocolate Raspberry Quest Bars and 25 Chocolate Cookie Dough Quest Bars to make one big protein bar equaling 1,004 grams of protein and 833 grams of fiber.\n\nHealth and fitness professionals recommend protein after a workout to help the body recover the energy it burnt while exercising and to build up muscle mass. Foods rich in protein include a glass of milk with 8 grams, a 3-ounce piece of meat with 21 grams, a cup of dry beans with 16 grams, and 8 ounces of yogurt with 11 grams.\n\nAlthough Pete jokingly claims that he \u201cgained 420 lbs of instant muscle,\u201d that much protein in one sitting could lead to devastating health effects. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 10 to 35 percent of our daily calories should come from protein. A man over the age of 19 is recommended 56 grams of protein each day while a woman over 19 is recommended 46 grams each day.\n\nWhile protein is a staple of every bodybuilder\u2019s post-workout routine, taking in too much can also wreak havoc on our bodies. For instance, too much protein consumption can tire out our liver, which is tasked with breaking down otherwise harmful toxins \u2014 known as ammonia \u2014 that are produced when we eat protein. Thus, protein overload can result in significant damage to the body\u2019s liver, brain, and nervous system.\n\nA high-protein diet means a diet high in cholesterol. Even though we need cholesterol, too much can spell trouble for the body\u2019s most important muscle, the heart. Fortunately for humans, it\u2019s our body\u2019s job to produce 75 percent of our cholesterol intake while the other 25 percent comes from the food we eat.\n\nA recent study gauged how much protein was needed to supplement a high-energy workout. Participants were asked to perform intense resistance exercises, and then consume 5, 10, 20, or 40 grams of egg protein. Result showed that participants who consumed 40 grams of protein exhibited the same amount of protein synthesis stimulation as someone who consumed 20 grams of protein.\n\nSo, remember to talk to your doctor or a healthcare professional before putting any foreign substance into your body, and that includes whey protein.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "furious, pete, 1,000, gram, protein", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Competitive eater Furious Pete created a 1,000-gram protein bar that you have to see to believe.", "title": "Furious Pete Creates 1,000-Gram Protein Bar, Consumes It In Record Time", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/furious-pete-creates-1000-gram-protein-bar-consumes-it-record-time-1000-calories-too-much-1-man", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/19/furious-pete.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Competitive eater Furious Pete created a 1,000-gram protein bar that you have to see to believe.", "title": "Furious Pete Creates 1,000-Gram Protein Bar, Consumes It In Record Time", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/furious-pete-creates-1000-gram-protein-bar-consumes-it-record-time-1000-calories-too-much-1-man", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/19/furious-pete.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/19/furious-pete.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-19T14:32:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-19T14:31:59-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Competitive eater Furious Pete created a 1,000-gram protein bar that you have to see to believe."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd263\"", "article_summary": "Competitive eater Furious Pete created a 1,000-gram protein bar that you have to see to believe.\nFuriousPete.comFurious Pete, a competitive eating champion and amateur bodybuilder, created a protein bar with over 1,000 grams of protein and celebrated by eating the entire thing in one go.\nResult showed that participants who consumed 40 grams of protein exhibited the same amount of protein synthesis stimulation as someone who consumed 20 grams of protein.\nIn the video seen below, Furious Pete, whose real name is Pete Czerwinski, used 24 White Chocolate Raspberry Quest Bars and 25 Chocolate Cookie Dough Quest Bars to make one big protein bar equaling 1,004 grams of protein and 833 grams of fiber.\nEven with Pete\u2019s rigorous workout regimen, is 1,000 grams of protein too much for one day?"}
