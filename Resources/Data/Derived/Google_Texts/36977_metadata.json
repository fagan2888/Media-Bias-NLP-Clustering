But this has occurred as others countries, including China, offer enticing alternatives to American businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have a moment that is passing us by,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations African Affairs subcommittee. \u201c[But] our relationship has moved from predominantly aid and relief in response to disasters to predominantly trade and facilitating economic growth. \u2026 We do not neglect our values in those conversations.\u201dPresident Obama, former President Clinton, Vice President Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry are some of the U.S. officials on this week\u2019s schedule, as well as the heads of state of African countries.Witney W. Schneidman, senior international adviser for Africa at Covington & Burling LLP, said some of the main issues that could come up include the reauthorization of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which is set to expire next year.African countries are pushing for a longer-term reauthorization of the AGOA, which incentivizes U.S.-Africa business partnerships. Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are advocating that the AGOA include incentives for American companies looking to export to the continent.Schneidman, who worked in the Clinton administration as the deputy assistant secretary of State for African affairs, said that the business summit \u201cis important because Africa has never registered very highly on the American foreign policy agenda.\u201d\u201cThis is an indication that\u2019s changed,\u201d Schneidman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that we\u2019re playing catch-up to competing countries, like China.\u201dStephen Hayes, CEO at The Corporate Council on Africa (CCA), was more blunt.\u201cChina is the cliche 800-pound gorilla in the room that no one can ignore,\u201d said Hayes, whose group works to encourage U.S.-Africa business and has members including Ford Motors, Exxon Mobil and Boeing.\u201cWe need CEOs to understand the market potential and the importance of Africa to the global economy,\u201d Hayes added. \u201cWe also need to understand the very high quality of African CEOs as potential partners for our companies.\u201dAccording to the administration\u2019s estimates, Africa is home to six of the 10 fastest growing economies in the world; real income has increased more than 30 percent over the past decade.U.S. businesses are taking notice. Their previous tepidity to enter into the continent for fears of political corruption and stability have subsided, as markets overseas have expanded.Case in point: Tuesday\u2019s event featured the CEOs of dozens of American companies, including General Electric, Wal-Mart and MasterCard. They\u2019ll be able to meet with the presidents of top African businesses and the heads of state for African countries.\u201cChina is aggressively investing in Africa,\u201d said Tom Hart, U.S. executive director at the ONE Campaign, which advocates to end extreme poverty in Africa. \u201c[But] a criticism we often hear from Africans is China brings in its own workers, limiting the economic prospects for African citizens.\u201dCoons said the U.S. is \u201clooking to leverage our incredibly active private sector\u201d beyond extracting minerals and mining and into manufacturing consumer goods.Other top business leaders who are on this week\u2019s agenda include former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. The event is co-hosted by the U.S. Department of Commerce and Bloomberg Philanthropies.\u201cThe U.S. has never hosted a summit of African leaders like this before,\u201d Hart said. \u201cWhile the summit won\u2019t meet everyone\u2019s expectations, President Obama is making a huge statement about the importance of U.S.-Africa relations and helping reframe the debate for Washington, companies and the public.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "The shadow of China: An \u2018800-pound gorilla\u2019 lurks over the effort to improve ties between the US and Africa", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2014-08-06T06:01-04:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "The shadow of China: An \u2018800-pound gorilla\u2019 lurks over the effort to improve ties between the US and Africa", "url": "http://thehill.com/special-reports/us-africa-leader-summit-august-6-2014/214398-the-shadow-of-china-an-800-pound", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/special_reports/shippingcontainers.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-06T06:01:01-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Kevin Cirilli", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/special-reports/us-africa-leader-summit-august-6-2014/214398-the-shadow-of-china-an-800-pound", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-06T06:01-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Jennifer Yingling", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-06T06:01:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-06T06:01:01-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/special-reports/us-africa-leader-summit-august-6-2014/214398-the-shadow-of-china-an-800-pound", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "The shadow of China: An \u2018800-pound gorilla\u2019 lurks over the effort to improve ties between the US and Africa"}}, "article_summary": "Trade poses a major dilemma for policymakers at this week\u2019s U.S.-Africa Business Forum.\nThe Obama administration and Congress have recently expanded U.S. foreign policy in Africa beyond humanitarian and health efforts, and into economic policy.\nBut this has occurred as others countries, including China, offer enticing alternatives to American businesses.\nThe event is co-hosted by the U.S. Department of Commerce and Bloomberg Philanthropies.\u201cThe U.S. has never hosted a summit of African leaders like this before,\u201d Hart said.\n\u201c[But] our relationship has moved from predominantly aid and relief in response to disasters to predominantly trade and facilitating economic growth."}
