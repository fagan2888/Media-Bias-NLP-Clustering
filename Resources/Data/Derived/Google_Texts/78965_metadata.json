Now we have to change.\u201d\n\nMr. Batts said he was surprised to learn that six of his officers would be charged in the case of Freddie Gray, who died April 19 of a spinal injury he incurred while in police custody.\n\n\u201cAnd then my mind started going to, what is going to be the response in community?\u201d he said. \u201cMy officers, how do I keep them engaged, how do I keep them focused on getting their job done as a whole?\u201d\n\nMr. Batts argued that Baltimore police and law enforcement nationwide must build trust with the urban communities they serve, CNN reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be an overnight thing,\u201d he added.\n\nThe commissioner pointed out programs already in place, including one that allows inner-city children to play sports with police officers, CNN reported.
