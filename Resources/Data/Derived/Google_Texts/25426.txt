President Obama's approval ratings have shifted back into positive territory, a new poll shows, as voters grow increasingly optimistic about the U.S. economy.

According to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday, 48% of Americans say they approve of the job Obama is doing as commander-in-chief, compared to 47% who say they disapprove — the first time since May 2013 that positive views outnumber negative views in the poll.

Most voters pointed to the improving economy as the reason behind their warming up to Obama.

The poll found that 52% of respondents described the economy as very or somewhat good, compared to 48% who said it was very or somewhat poor — the first time in Obama's entire presidency that a CNN/ORC poll found more people having positive views of the economy than negative.

The poll also picked up on optimism for the future, with 60% saying they expected the economy to be very or somewhat good in one year and only 38% saying they felt it would be very or somewhat poor in a year's time.

By comparison, 67% of those who responded to the April 16-19 poll said they disapproved of the job Republicans in the House and Senate are doing, compared to 28% who said they approved.

Meanwhile, a separate poll published Tuesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation showed even more good news for Obama.

Obamacare, the President’s signature healthcare law, received its own approval rating of 43%, the Kaiser survey showed, compared with 42% who said they viewed the policy unfavorably.

The poll marks the first time since 2012 that more people viewed the law favorably than not.
