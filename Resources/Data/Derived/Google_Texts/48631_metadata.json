Kaiser Family Foundation released a new survey showing that 44 percent of the public has a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act, while 41 percent has an unfavorable view. The numbers are nearly identical to what they were in Kaiser\u2019s most recent survey, back in late June, and statistically unchanged since March . Prior to that, the public had negative views of the president\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement, by a modest margin that varied from survey to survey.\n\nYou can't say this latest survey or the previous ones constitute a strong endorsement of the law -- particularly since the Kaiser Foundation\u2019s poll tends to get more positive responses about the Affordable Care Act than other surveys do. In fact, if you take an average including those other surveys, as HuffPost Pollster and sites such as RealClearPolitics do, Obamacare remains \u201cunder water.\u201d That is, the number of people opposed to it outnumber those in favor of it.\n\nStill, the averages also reveal a trend underway, with the public less skeptical of the law than it was in 2014. If that trend continues -- emphasis on the \u201cif\u201d -- that would help insulate the Affordable Care Act from political attacks and challenge the Republican presidential candidates, all of whom favor total repeal.\n\nMitt Romney made the same pledge in 2012. And while nobody has done a careful study of how that position affected his candidacy, it probably didn\u2019t help and may even have hurt. The reason? Polls usually, although not always, show that even many people opposed to the law don\u2019t actually favor getting rid of it. They'd prefer Congress find ways of improving it.\n\nFour years after Romney's campaign, with millions of people getting coverage through the law, a repeal pledge could be even more difficult to defend. That may help explain why Hillary Clinton, front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, just released an advertisement skewering Republicans for the vows to take away the law without specifying a replacement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Polls show the health care law picking up support, ever so slowly.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-08-21 03:00:55 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Polls show the health care law picking up support, ever so slowly.", "title": "Obamacare Haters Are Getting Harder To Find", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-haters-are-getting-harder-to-find_us_55d50578e4b055a6dab2dc34", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55d507331400002e002e3740.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Polls show the health care law picking up support, ever so slowly.", "creator": "@citizencohn", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55d507331400002e002e3740.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Obamacare Haters Are Getting Harder To Find", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-20 03:00:55 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_55d50578e4b055a6dab2dc34", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Obamacare,Kaiser Family Foundation,survey,public opinion,repeal,Hillary Clinton", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,Obamacare,Kaiser Family Foundation,survey,public opinion,repeal,Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2015-08-20 03:00:55 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-08-20 03:00:55 -0400", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/CitizenCohn"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Polls usually, although not always, show that even many people opposed to the law don\u2019t actually favor getting rid of it.\nFour years after Romney's campaign, with millions of people getting coverage through the law, a repeal pledge could be even more difficult to defend.\nPrior to that, the public had negative views of the president\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement, by a modest margin that varied from survey to survey.\nStill, the averages also reveal a trend underway, with the public less skeptical of the law than it was in 2014.\nThe numbers are nearly identical to what they were in Kaiser\u2019s most recent survey, back in late June, and statistically unchanged since March ."}
