RYAN WANTS TO TAKE THE POLICY LEAD FOR THE GOP. House Speaker Paul Ryan is ringing in the new year by reminding his Republican colleagues that he’s ready to lead the party when it comes to policy. Ryan has been pushing the message for weeks and the Wall Street Journal writes that Ryan sees himself as the man in charge.

While Mr. Ryan is soliciting ideas from the rank and file, he has made clear he believes the party should tackle an overhaul of the tax code, which could include consolidating tax brackets and lowering rates but also targeting some popular tax breaks. He has also promised that the party this year will come up with a health-coverage plan that would replace the Affordable Care Act.

A YEAR OF FRESH OBAMACARE FIGHTS. House Republicans are planning to vote this week on a Senate-passed bill that would repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood. President Obama is expected to veto the bill, but it signals the start of a big year of tests for Obama’s signature health-care law, and the Hill reports that not all of the attacks will come from the GOP.

There has been a historic increase in the number of people with health insurance, and the law appears at little risk of fully collapsing. But with 29 million people still uninsured, can ObamaCare go further? And how much will it all cost, both to the individual and the system as a whole?
