Hundreds turned out for the event the night after he battled GOP opponents like Carly Fiorina.

"So with Carly, she did a terrible job at Lucent," Trump said. "She did a terrible, terrible job at Hewlett-Packard, terrible job. Stories that have been written are legendary."

There were also a couple interruptions at the event. A man known as the "Flower Guy" quoted the Bible verse Timothy 3:2, then gave Trump flowers. Another man heckled Trump on climate change. The candidate took a survey of the room.

"Who believes in global warming?" Trump said. "Wow, not much, huh?"



Dozens of people asked questions of Trump.

"So in the U.S. we don't have a good record for paying off debt," someone asked.



"No, we owe $19 trillion.I would say it's not so good," Trump responded.



"Exactly, so how will we expect Mexico to repay debt?" the person responded.



"Because they make a fortune off us," Trump said.

Trump promised to tackle illegal immigration as president, building a "Trump Wall" at the U.S.-Mexico border that he said will keep out criminals.

"People aren't going to Home Depot and buying a ladder and walking over. Not this one."

Trump also talked about saving Social Security, protecting the Second Amendment and repealing Obamacare.
