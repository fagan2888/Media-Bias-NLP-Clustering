She was born at Avista Adventist Hospital in Louisville to mother Melanie Nolasco at 12:03 a.m. Jan. 1, making her the first baby born in 2014 in Boulder County.\n\nThe family was aware that Brooklyn's birth occurred just after midnight, but they didn't know they might have the state's first 2014 baby until a Wednesday morning call from a coworker who heard media reports about the birth.\n\nNo baby was born earlier than Brooklyn, but as it turned out, her first-baby status wasn't hers alone. The Colorado Springs Gazette reported Wednesday that another girl, Bo Elizabeth Sieck, also was born at 12:03 a.m.\n\nBrooklyn's New Year's arrival made sense to Louie, who said his children seem to have a knack for holiday births. One son was born on Earth Day and the other was born just shy of Thanksgiving.\n\nMelanie joked about the Brooklyn's New Year's birth.\n\n\"I hope that doesn't mean she's a party animal,\" she said. \"She was a little crazy in the womb.\"\n\nLouie and Melanie, who live in Broomfield, had long liked the name Brooklyn for a girl and held on to it through the birth of two sons, who are now 3 and 2 years old, Louie said.\n\nAt the time a reporter visited her in the afternoon of Jan. 1, Brooklyn was sleeping quietly in her mother's arms.\n\n\"I think it's the first time we've had the first baby in Colorado,\" Burnette said of Avista.\n\nAvista was also the site of the first Boulder County baby born in 2013 -- Katya Solis-Hernandez was born at 12:57 a.m. Jan. 1 2013.\n\nThe first 2014 baby born in Longmont was Lilyanette Marie Rosas, born at 5:11 a.m. to Tasha Garcia Carrillo and Gustavo Rosas.\n\nQuentin Young can be reached at 303-684-5319 or qyoung@times-call.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_24828605/boulder-countys-first-2014-baby-born-at-avista", "modificationDate": "2014-01-01T21:24:01-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0101/20140101__0102tcabab1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Quentin Young   Longmont Times-Call", "description": "Louie Nolasco thought his third child might hold out for just several more weeks before entering the world, because then they could share a birthday.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:24828605:view"}, "startDate": "2014-01-01T10:38:03-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_24828605/boulder-countys-first-2014-baby-born-at-avista", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0101/20140101__0102tcabab1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Louie Nolasco thought his third child might hold out for just several more weeks before entering the world, because then they could share a birthday.", "title": "Girl born in Louisville shares state's first-baby status"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Louie Nolasco thought his third child might hold out for just several more weeks before entering the world, because then they could share a birthday.", "title": "Girl born in Louisville shares state's first-baby status", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_24828605/boulder-countys-first-2014-baby-born-at-avista", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0101/20140101__0102tcabab1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-01T10:38:03-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2024-01-01T10:33:50-0700", "sailthru.title": "Girl born in Louisville shares state's first-baby status", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Quentin Young", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0101/20140101__0102tcabab1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-01-01T10:43:04-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac45\"", "article_summary": "The first 2014 baby born in Longmont was Lilyanette Marie Rosas, born at 5:11 a.m. to Tasha Garcia Carrillo and Gustavo Rosas.\nShe was born at Avista Adventist Hospital in Louisville to mother Melanie Nolasco at 12:03 a.m. Jan. 1, making her the first baby born in 2014 in Boulder County.\nHis baby, Brooklyn Nolasco, had different plans.\nAvista was also the site of the first Boulder County baby born in 2013 -- Katya Solis-Hernandez was born at 12:57 a.m. Jan. 1 2013.\nNo baby was born earlier than Brooklyn, but as it turned out, her first-baby status wasn't hers alone."}
