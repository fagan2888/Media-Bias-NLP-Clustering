Mike Pence released a statement this afternoon defending his decision to not apply for a federal grant that could have given the state $80 million to develop preschool infrastructure for low-income three- and four-year-olds.\n\nWe reported yesterday that the governor stopped the application process, despite the work the Indiana Department of Education and other state agencies had already done to apply for the money.\n\nThe grant was only available to states with little or no state funded preschool for low-income children, making Indiana one of 16 eligible states.\n\nIn his statement, Pence said the state can meet Indiana\u2019s pre-k needs without federal assistance.\n\nIt is important not to allow the lure of federal grant dollars to define our state\u2019s mission and programs. More federal dollars do not necessarily equal success, especially when those dollars come with requirements and conditions that will not help\u2014and may even hinder\u2014running a successful program of our own making. An important part of our pre-K pilot is the requirement that we study the program so we understand what works and what doesn\u2019t. I do not believe it is wise policy to expand our pre-K pilot before we have a chance to study and learn from the program. While accepting federal grant dollars can at times be justified to advance our state\u2019s objectives, when it comes to early childhood education, I believe Indiana must develop our own pre-K program without federal intrusion. Our pilot program will give Hoosiers the opportunity to assist some of our most vulnerable children while we examine the merits of quality pre-K education. Generous, thoughtful and careful development of new policies for our most disadvantaged kids is the Indiana way.\n\nPence\u2019s decision upset many Democrats including House Minority Leader Scott Pelath.\n\n\u201cLet us contemplate the continued public pronouncements of those who want to take a lot of credit for establishing a modest pre-school program, yet show no inclination for moving beyond the symbolism,\u201d Pelath said in a statement Friday.\n\nBut while Democratic leaders expressed disappointment in the decision, Heather Crossin of Hoosiers Against Common Core, the group that lobbied against Common Core Standards because they didn\u2019t want federal participation in public education, penned a blog post praising the decision:\n\n\u201cSo powerful is the lure of federal funding that, far more often than not, it\u2019s difficult to find a governor of either party who is willing to say \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Crossin wrote. \u201cAnd yet, that is exactly what is needed \u2013 governors who are willing to stand at the constitutional line and reclaim the right of the states to govern themselves \u2013 to be responsive to their citizens rather than to the federal government.\u201d\n\nBack in August, when the U.S. Department of Education announced which states were eligible for the grant, state superintendent Glenda Ritz told StateImpact if the state received the money she wanted to use it to put all preschools in Indiana on the same level and work with families.\n\n\u201cLetting parents know, here\u2019s what is expected of children as they enter school and making sure we have a quality preschool program set up. There shouldn\u2019t be a big disparity between programs in which children attend,\u201d she said.\n\nWith that federal money off the table now, the state\u2019s new pre-k pilot program is the only state-funded option for low-incomes families and is only available right now in five counties.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Governor Mike Pence released a statement explaining why he chose to not apply for federal funding to expand preschool opportunities in the state.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/stateimpact/2014/10/17/governor-pence-explains-choice-apply-prek-grant/", "site_name": "StateImpact StateImpact Indiana", "type": "article", "description": "Governor Mike Pence released a statement explaining why he chose to not apply for federal funding to expand preschool opportunities in the state.", "title": "Governor Pence Explains Choice To Not Apply For Pre-K Grant"}, "fb": {"admins": 10217706}, "keywords": "mike pence,pre-k", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Governor Pence Explains Choice To Not Apply For Pre-K Grant By Claire McInerny TweetBrandon Smith / IPBSGov.\nIt is important not to allow the lure of federal grant dollars to define our state\u2019s mission and programs.\nOur pilot program will give Hoosiers the opportunity to assist some of our most vulnerable children while we examine the merits of quality pre-K education.\n\u201cLetting parents know, here\u2019s what is expected of children as they enter school and making sure we have a quality preschool program set up.\nAn important part of our pre-K pilot is the requirement that we study the program so we understand what works and what doesn\u2019t."}
