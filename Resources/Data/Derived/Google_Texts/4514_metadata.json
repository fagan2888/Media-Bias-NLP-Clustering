This announcement was made at KronosWorks, the world's leading workforce information exchange, taking place on 9-12 November in Las Vegas.\n\nJim Munoz, managing partner of Presence of IT, said the new plug-in offers human resources and benefits leaders maximum insight into their Kronos workforce management data. \"With this plug-in, Kronos customers can further leverage the power of the Kronos Workforce Analytics solution and drive even more value from their Kronos solution.\"\n\nACA places newfound pressure on organizational leaders to know the status of their workforce at all times and they must be able to provide the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with relevant audit-ready reporting information about the workforce. The focal point of the ACA plug-in is its ability to compare the amount an organization plans to spend on healthcare versus what is projected to be spent in a given timeframe. With this information, organizations can make proactive business decisions regarding how to manage their ACA compliance and budgets.\n\n\"Organizations put significant effort into collecting data to calculate paychecks and develop schedules. There is a large opportunity for organizations to re-use this data again in the context of business intelligence and big data analysis,\" said Gregg Gordon, senior director, Big Data for Workforce Management Practice Group, Kronos. \"Those that take advantage of this opportunity will have a significant competitive advantage over those that only store workforce data to meet regulatory requirements. With ACA regulations upon us, we are pleased that Presence of IT built its ACA plug-in on the Kronos Workforce Analytics platform.\"\n\nPresence of IT's ACA plug-in uses predictive analytics to highlight variances in healthcare costs from an organization's planned healthcare allocation, both current and future. The plug-in, powered by Kronos Workforce Analytics, will alert organizations to their risk exposure while there is time to manage their compliance efforts.\n\nKey data metrics of the plug-in include:\n\nthe number of full- and part-time employees compared to plan and budget;\n\nroll-up and drill-down capabilities through an unlimited number of measurement periods;\n\nthe likely cost of benefits, both current and future, under the current staffing mix; and\n\nthe best-fit coverage options to manage service levels and benefits budget.\n\n\"We've collaborated with Kronos and created this plug-in to give employers clear visibility into the risk if they exceed their planned healthcare costs, as well as provide viable options for managing the risk,\" Munoz said. \"This is a classic analytics problem: identify the problem, drill down to the big areas of risk and opportunity, and take meaningful action. Kronos Workforce Analytics offers a tailor-made foundation for implementing any corporate ACA strategy and we are taking advantage of that with this first in a series of plug-ins we plan to bring to the market.\"\n\nAbout Presence of IT\n\nPresence of IT is a leading consultancy and provider of the world's foremost Workforce Management and Human Capital Management solutions.
