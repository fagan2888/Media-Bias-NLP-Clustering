Stoddard. As the White House touted new numbers claiming 5 million people have selected plans on Healthcare.gov, the panel \u201cchecked up\u201d on the healthcare law as the clock winds down on the open enrollment period.\n\nKrauthammer took umbrage at Obama\u2019s earlier promises that the law would require little or no changes to implement \u2014 despite the concerns of many to the contrary.\n\n\u201cWatching him at the time, there were all kinds of problems you were throwing at him,\u201d he told host Bret Baier, referencing an earlier interview between the reporter and the president. \u201cAnd he pretended everything was explainable.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking at it now retrospectively, knowing what we know, it is clear that his responses were disinformation, deception to some extent, and dissimulation,\u201d Krauthammer added.\n\nStoddard took on the administration\u2019s claim of 5 million enrollees. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know from HHS whether or not \u2018enrollee\u2019 is someone who\u2019s paid an insurance company for a policy is indeed insured,\u201d she noted, \u201cand we don\u2019t know what the effects of all the waivers and extensions have been, so we don\u2019t know how many people in the lack of compliance \u2014 how that\u2019s going to change the system.\u201d\n\nHayes agreed, expressing disbelief that the mainstream media is lending the White House number any credulity. \u201cThe 5 million enrollee numbers is nonsense,\u201d he declared. \u201cAll of the previous enrollee numbers have been nonsense. When you can\u2019t account for how many people have actually paid the first month\u2019s premium, those numbers become virtually meaningless.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many people are actual enrollees,\u201d he asserted. \u201cAnd I think when historians go back and look at this period of the signups and all the controversy, they\u2019re going to back and say, \u2018It\u2019s amazing the media reported these as actual enrollments,\u2019 when they\u2019re not actual enrollments!\u201d (RELATED: How many have paid Obamacare premiums?).\u201d\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
