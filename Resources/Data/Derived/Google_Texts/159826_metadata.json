For those newly covered by Medicaid since 2014, the study says, their medical debt was reduced by about $600 to $1,000 each year.\n\nCredit.com has extensively covered the damage medical debt can wreak on one\u2019s credit profile. Some hospitals or medical providers offer expensive credit cards with introductory rates that quickly ramp up to over 20% and patients can get taken to court over bills they can\u2019t afford to pay. In some cases, spouses of patients have been pursued for payment even though they didn\u2019t live in a common law state.\n\nGet Your Free Credit Score & Monitoring Plus Weekly Updates From Our 50+ Experts Get It Now\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\u201cI just turned 26, and I can\u2019t even get a new contract with AT&T without a $750 security deposit, let alone finance a new (used) vehicle,\u201d Richard Barnes told the New York Times recently. He was reportedly uninsured when he was diagnosed with appendicitis three years ago. \u201cWhen I was moving in May 2015, I had extreme trouble finding someone who would rent to me.\u201d\n\nInside the Study\n\nAs the Times reported, the new study examined credit reports on a sample of Americans across the country. Researchers then compared debt incurred by people in two different sets of states: \u201cthose that expanded Medicaid to provide free insurance to those earning under about $16,000,\u201dand those that either \u201cchose not to cover that population or had expanded their programs earlier.\u201d\n\nThe researchers honed in on the 25% of ZIP codes with the highest percentage of low-income, uninsured people before 2014 to compare debt incurred by those in the unchanged states with the debt of those in states offering new insurance options.\n\nTurns out, Medicaid expansion did affect how many bills were sent to collections and the amount they were for. Researchers arrived at their $600 to $1,000 estimate by using the American Community Survey to approximate that 17% of individuals in the measured areas were uninsured and had incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level.\n\n\u201cIf we assume that half of this group gained coverage as a result of the Medicaid expansions and scaled our estimates by this figure, the implied treatment-on-treated (TOT) estimates range between -$600 and -$1,000,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe study did have two caveats: It could only examine those with credit reports and couldn\u2019t pinpoint exactly who got Medicaid. As the Times put it, \u201cInstead, it tracked everyone in the places where researchers anticipated the biggest changes in Medicaid enrollment.\u201d\n\nIf you have outstanding medical bills, it\u2019s a smart idea to review your free annual credit reports for accuracy and dispute any errors you find.
