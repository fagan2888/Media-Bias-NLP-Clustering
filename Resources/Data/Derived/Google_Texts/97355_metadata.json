The last time we tackled the issue together it primarily revolved around the case of Brittany Maynard, the young woman with brain cancer who moved to Oregon so she could end her life on her own terms. There\u2019s been plenty of time for that story to sink into the national consciousness since then and the nation seems to remain firmly divided on the question. But this week George Will \u2013 not exactly known for being a liberal \u2013 has chimed in with his own feelings and he seems to find some room in his heart for compassion when it comes to those making such decisions.\n\nPhysician-assisted dying has been done surreptitiously \u201cas long as we have been practicing medicine,\u201d says Cederquist, professor of internal medicine at the University of California at San Diego. Today, even in the 46 states without physician-assisted dying, doctors may legally offer \u201cterminal sedation\u201d \u2014 say, a life-shortening dose of morphine \u2014 when intense physical suffering cannot otherwise be satisfactorily alleviated. Some Catholic and other ethicists endorse a \u201cdouble effect\u201d standard: If the intent is to alleviate suffering but a consequence is death, the intent justifies the act. Cederquist says the most common reason for requesting assistance in dying is not \u201cintolerable physical suffering.\u201d Rather, it is \u201cexistential suffering,\u201d including \u201closs of meaning,\u201d as from the ability to relate to others. The prospect of being \u201cunable to interact\u201d can be as intolerable as physical suffering and cannot be alleviated by hospice or other palliative care.\n\nWill brings up a different case than Maynard\u2019s, specifically the one involving Jennifer Glass. I was rather taken with a quote from her when she addressed California state legislators shortly before her death. \u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can to extend my life. No one should have the right to prolong my death.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a powerful argument, and one made by many patients when faced with such a difficult choice. Recently, Stephanie O\u2019neill at CNN took a fresh look at the writings of Dr. Ken Murray, which I examined here at Hot Air last year. Rather than looking at the wishes and needs of patients versus the reaction to their plight from their legislators, Murry did some extensive research into how doctor\u2019s themselves choose to die. It\u2019s a telling analysis which shows that the same professionals who make available to the rest of us every means under the sun to squeeze the last few moments of life out of our existence rarely choose such drastic options for themselves.\n\n\u201cI fit with the vast majority that want to have a gentle death, and don\u2019t want extraordinary measures taken when they have no meaning,\u201d Murray says. A majority of seniors report feeling the same way. Yet, they often die while hooked up to life support. And only about one in 10 doctors report having conversations with their patients about death. One reason for the disconnect, says Dr. Babak Goldman, is that too few doctors are trained to talk about death with their patients. \u201cWe\u2019re trained to prolong life,\u201d he says.\n\nAll persuasive arguments, but I don\u2019t want to give the impression that I haven\u2019t heard the arguments from the other side in this discussion. One of the most common is the idea of a slippery slope which could lead to death panels or simply cases where doctors take the easy way out for patients less able to pay their bills. In my experience, slippery slopes are very real and we ignore them at our peril. But returning to George Will\u2019s piece, he acknowledges the same and yet still comes up with an admirable answer.\n\nToday\u2019s culture of casual death (see the Planned Parenthood videos) should deepen worries about a slippery slope from physician-assisted dying to a further diminution of life\u2019s sanctity. Life, however, is inevitably lived on multiple slippery slopes: Taxation could become confiscation, police could become instruments of oppression, public education could become indoctrination, etc. Everywhere and always, civilization depends on the drawing of intelligent distinctions.\n\nIn the end, Will makes a good case for recognizing the needs and beliefs of people on both sides of the argument. He talks about the nobility in suffering bravely borne, while at the same time citing the distinctive human dignity of autonomous choice. It\u2019s no doubt one of the most painful choices many people will ever make, but in the end, isn\u2019t that what this is all about? It should not be the place of the government to tell you when you should die, but at the same time are we to place the power in the government\u2019s hands to tell you that you must go on living under terminal distress? In the end it\u2019s not the government who will hold you accountable for the path you choose. That will come down to you and the Almighty.\n\nFood for thought this weekend.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Mortality vs morality", "title": "\u201cSuffering bravely borne\u201d vs prolonging another\u2019s death", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/08/29/suffering-bravely-borne-vs-prolonging-anothers-death/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-29T17:01:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-29T14:42:20+00:00"}, "keywords": "assisted suicide, death, death panels, doctors,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfcab\"", "article_summary": "The prospect of being \u201cunable to interact\u201d can be as intolerable as physical suffering and cannot be alleviated by hospice or other palliative care.\nToday, even in the 46 states without physician-assisted dying, doctors may legally offer \u201cterminal sedation\u201d \u2014 say, a life-shortening dose of morphine \u2014 when intense physical suffering cannot otherwise be satisfactorily alleviated.\nCederquist says the most common reason for requesting assistance in dying is not \u201cintolerable physical suffering.\u201d Rather, it is \u201cexistential suffering,\u201d including \u201closs of meaning,\u201d as from the ability to relate to others.\nHe talks about the nobility in suffering bravely borne, while at the same time citing the distinctive human dignity of autonomous choice.\nSome Catholic and other ethicists endorse a \u201cdouble effect\u201d standard: If the intent is to alleviate suffering but a consequence is death, the intent justifies the act."}
