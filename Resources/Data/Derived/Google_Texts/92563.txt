Piers Morgan took to Twitter to slam Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly as a “flaming hypocrite,” for suggesting the CNN host will be fired soon for engaging in personal attacks on air.

“CNN doesn’t do [personal attacks] except there is one guy who does it on CNN and he is going to be fired soon, the guy in the 9 p.m. slot, all right? But nobody else,” O’Reilly said Wednesday on his Fox News program, “The O’Reilly Factor,” during a discussion about over-the-line comments about Sarah Palin by Martin Bashir of MSNBC.

O’Reilly’s not-so-subtle jab, sparked a response from Morgan, who fired off a series of tweets against the Fox News host.
