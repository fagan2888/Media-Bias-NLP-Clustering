I'm constantly amazed by the passion of Young Democrats across Texas.

Today is no different. When seeing the crisis of child refugees, some people compared these young folks to violent criminals and claimed they carry disease. A group of Texas Young Democrats saw them as children in need regardless of where they came from. And these TYDs stepped up to help.

Please join our movement to help these young people. We've created an Amazon Wish List of requested donation items that will be shipped to the Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley. These items will be directly distributed to the children sheltered in the southern tip of Texas. You can help out by simply purchasing an item on the list.

Share this list with family, friends, coworkers, and anyone you know. Send your support out on Twitter and Facebook with #LoveFromTexas. We know as Texans, whatever our political views, in the end what matters are the people we help.

By young people, for young people, we will make a difference.John Canales Gorczynski, a native Houstonian, is the President of the Texas Young Democrats.
