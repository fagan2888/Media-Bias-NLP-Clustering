YiWen Tseng\n\nIf patches, pills, gum, strips, tablets, hypnosis, and going cold turkey don\u2019t help you to curb your smoking habits, maybe Taiwanese designer YiWen Tseng\u2019s project, \u201cTobacco,\u201d could help.\n\nWith the exception of going cold turkey, nearly all cessation methods rely on gradually weaning the user off her nicotine dependency. Rather than sever the addict\u2019s ties to the drug completely, patches and gums offer a manageable off-ramp that keeps the brain happy, but moves forward in the process. Tseng\u2019s new concept series reimagines that process, only with the cigarettes themselves.\n\nThe artist says she first got interested in designing the products after her grandfather passed away from smoking-related cancer. \u201cThis was the first time I experienced my dearest family got a such serious ill due to his habit which he really loved to do,\u201d Tseng told Medical Daily. While she conceded that she doesn\u2019t necessarily see her designs as immediate quitting tools, they could be a jumping off point. \u201cI just tried to think whether I can slightly change the cigarette itself to get more health back.\u201d\n\nTseng\u2019s designs come in several varieties. The first is called Tobacco-Luck, which features a pack of cigarettes with increasingly longer filters, which also means less tobacco.\n\nTobacco-Luck cigarettes use longer and longer filters to get smokers used to consuming less tobacco.

Two smokers can share the stunted cigarette without each having to buy two regular-sized ones.\n\nTobacco-Sharing cigarettes are meant to be broken in half, into two half-length cigarettes, for two people.

Each Tobacco-Trace cigarette is branded with its own identification number, which people can look up online to trace the butt back to the smoker.\n\nTobacco-Trace cigarettes effectively shame smokers into throwing away their butts, rather than littering, or else people can track them online.

The idea, as Tseng sees it, is smokers will become more mindful about their habits if they can actively and immediately know how far into the pack they are.\n\nTobacco-Day cigarettes remind smokers how far into each pack they are, hopefully encouraging them to quit.

YiWen Tseng\n\nWhile Tseng\u2019s designs are so far only a concept series, she hopes the buzz that it generates could get people to see smoking as still within their control. If the data are anything to go by, she may be capitalizing at just the right time. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cigarette smoking has declined from over 40 percent prevalence in 1965 to just over 18 percent today. The CDC hopes to cut that rate nearly in half by the year 2020.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tobacco, design, project, imagines, cigarettes, twist, each, designed, help, you, quit", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Designer YiWen Tseng has designed several cigarettes that cause smokers to see their habit in a new light.", "title": "These Cigarettes Will Make You Rethink How To Quit [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tobacco-design-project-imagines-cigarettes-twist-each-designed-help-you-quit-286112", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/tseng1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Designer YiWen Tseng has designed several cigarettes that cause smokers to see their habit in a new light.", "title": "These Cigarettes Will Make You Rethink How To Quit [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tobacco-design-project-imagines-cigarettes-twist-each-designed-help-you-quit-286112", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/tseng1.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/tseng1.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-03T10:36:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-03T10:36:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Designer YiWen Tseng has designed several cigarettes that cause smokers to see their habit in a new light."}, "article_summary": "YiWen TsengIf patches, pills, gum, strips, tablets, hypnosis, and going cold turkey don\u2019t help you to curb your smoking habits, maybe Taiwanese designer YiWen Tseng\u2019s project, \u201cTobacco,\u201d could help.\nDesigner YiWen Tseng has designed several cigarettes that cause smokers to see their habit in a new light.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cigarette smoking has declined from over 40 percent prevalence in 1965 to just over 18 percent today.\nYiWen TsengThe final design, Tobacco-Day, is a pack of 30 cigarettes where each cigarette carries a number, representing the day of the month.\nThe first is called Tobacco-Luck, which features a pack of cigarettes with increasingly longer filters, which also means less tobacco."}
