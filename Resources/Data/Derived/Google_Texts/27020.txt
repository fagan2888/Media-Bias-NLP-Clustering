The high temperature in Denver reached the expected high of 91 degrees on Friday despite partly cloudy skies, which made for a muggy day.

Isolated thunderstorms remain possible for the rest of the day.

On Saturday, weather is expected to be mostly dry and “very warm,” forecasters say.

“Look for a slightly better chance of afternoon and evening thunderstorms Sunday and Monday with an influx of subtropical moisture,” the bulletin said.

A cold front is forecast to move south across northeast Colorado on Tuesday and lead to lower temperatures.

“Upslope flow behind this front is expected to (produce) isolated to scattered thunderstorms over and near the Front Range by evening,” according to the bulletin. “Wednesday and Thursday will be drier with temperatures near to slightly below average.”
