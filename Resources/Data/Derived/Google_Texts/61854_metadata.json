The Broncos opened Day 19 of training camp Tuesday at their Dove Valley practice facility with \u201cRocky Top\u201d blaring from the speakers.\n\nMemories of last season\u2019s camp practice when Peyton Manning and fellow former Tennessee Volunteer Britton Colquitt danced in tune and put on a show that went viral came flooding back.\n\nA repeat showing? Not this year. Not for the thousands of fans sitting a few feet away.\n\nLuckily, the kickers provided an even better one.\n\nWATCH: Who will win the Broncos\u2019 starting kicking jobs?\n\nBrandon McManus and Connor Barth, both battling for one of two kicking spots on the final roster, engaged in a kick-off during Monday\u2019s practice, alternating as they worked their way back from the 30-yard line.\n\nMcManus booted a 70-yard field goal, a would-be record in a game, and was mobbed by teammates as he walked off. Barth followed with a 65-yarder, one yard farther than Matt Prater\u2019s record set in 2013.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good battle between those two,\u201d coach Gary Kubiak said. \u201cWe let them kick a lot today and obviously it\u2019s going to be a tough, tough decision for us down the road. But they\u2019re both doing they\u2019re job.\u201d\n\nVon Miller and DeMarcus Ware provided a sideshow of their own in making a mockery of the 11-on-11 drills. The two combined to make a beeline to the quarterback at least five times \u2014 sometimes at the fault of the offensive line, others just off their speed and technique.\n\n\u201cWhen you walk out on the field you\u2019re expected to play against players,\u201d Kubiak said of the offensive linemen. \u201cI know it\u2019s a tough thing, but they have to continue to push through it.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Is Peyton Manning getting comfortable with handing the ball off more?\n\nAfter sitting out Friday\u2019s opener at Seattle, Manning is scheduled to play Saturday at Houston, and Kubiak said he expects him to play a quarter-and-a-half to a full half. It\u2019ll be the first time he takes the field for game action since the Broncos\u2019 disappointing divisional playoff loss to his former team, the Indianapolis Colts. And it\u2019ll be Manning\u2019s first game in new coach Kubiak\u2019s zone-blocking offense.\n\nTuesday, he and the rest of the Broncos took the field in shells and helmets. Working with a trainer on the sideline was veteran receiver Emmanuel Sanders \u2014 whom Kubiak said would sit out a couple of days to rest his hamstring injury \u2014 and Marvin Austin, who has observed most of camp while dealing with a groin injury.\n\nAlso sidelined was Tony Carter (hamstring). Linebacker Lerentee McCray, whom Kubiak said has \u201ca couple of things going on,\u201d was not at practice.\n\nFootnote: Broncos Ring of Famers Shannon Sharpe and Rod Smith were at practice. \u2026 Rockies legend Todd Helton and his daughter Tierney also attended. As did current Rockies pitchers David Hale and Chris Rusin. \u2026 Aqib Talib picked off Manning for his fourth interception in training camp.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Peyton Manning, focused, will play for Broncos at Houston", "title": "Peyton Manning, focused, will play for Broncos at Houston", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/18/peyton-manning-focused-will-play-for-broncos-at-houston/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150818_124235_peyton-manning.jpg", "height": 507}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150818_124235_peyton-manning.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-18T10:18:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T08:20:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Peyton Manning"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd05a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe let them kick a lot today and obviously it\u2019s going to be a tough, tough decision for us down the road.\nThe Broncos opened Day 19 of training camp Tuesday at their Dove Valley practice facility with \u201cRocky Top\u201d blaring from the speakers.\nMemories of last season\u2019s camp practice when Peyton Manning and fellow former Tennessee Volunteer Britton Colquitt danced in tune and put on a show that went viral came flooding back.\n\u2026 Aqib Talib picked off Manning for his fourth interception in training camp.\nAfter sitting out Friday\u2019s opener at Seattle, Manning is scheduled to play Saturday at Houston, and Kubiak said he expects him to play a quarter-and-a-half to a full half."}
