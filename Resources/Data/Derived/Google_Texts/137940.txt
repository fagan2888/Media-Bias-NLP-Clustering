Why the right is wrong about affordable housing

On Wednesday, we discussed what's wrong with the notion that supply and demand don't apply to housing. But on the other end of the spectrum, a free-market approach isn't the whole answer to housing affordability, either.

Some people (on the left) oppose new market-rate housing development. They claim that new development only provides high-end housing, which doesn't do anything to help the supply of more affordable options.

Others with a more libertarian view (a more right-leaning view in our region) claim that if we get rid of all zoning regulations, the free market will take care of it and build housing for everyone.

Both arguments are wrong.

Yes, adding more housing must absolutely be a part of the strategy to make housing more affordable. And zoning changes to allow people to build taller and more usable space near transit, rent out carriage houses, and avoid expensive and often-unnecessary parking are all steps in the right direction. But some proponents go on to say relaxing zoning will solve the problem all on its own. It won't.

The free market will only build housing for higher incomes

Even if cities roll back many land use regulations, squeeze down construction costs, and leverage new financing tools, the cost of building new housing won't fall below a certain point.
