1. Iowa may no longer have a quarterback controversy, but it still lacks depth. Two active scholarship quarterbacks, C.J. Beathard and Tyler Wiegers, are on the roster.

2. Iowa’s first touchdown was the first-team offense against the third-team defense with the clock paused at 5:00 in the fourth quarter. Akrum Wadley scored on a 4-yard scamper.

3. The three-man race at punter continued Saturday, and no one differentiated himself from the pack. Kirk Ferentz said this will be an ongoing race through the summer and into fall.

4. Ferentz hopes that starting tight end Jake Duzey will be back to open the season. The redshirt senior is scheduled to have knee surgery Monday.

5. Marshall Koehn hit all three field-goal attempts and looked more confident than last season. Mick Ellis missed a 50-plus yarder into the wind, and freshman Miguel Recinos converted his lone opportunity.
