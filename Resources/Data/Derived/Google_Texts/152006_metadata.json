Insurance exchanges\n\n[See also: 2013 hot topics for healthcare financial administrators]\n\nDespite the abysmal start of HealthCare.gov, thousands of Americans selected new insurance plans, getting one of the major aspects of the Affordable Care Act under way. Now the healthcare industry is waiting to see if the exchanges will work, said Tom Carden, a senior managing director at New Jersey-based Martin Healthcare Advisors.\n\nThe industry will be looking for answers to questions such as:\n\nWhat are the real numbers in terms of people buying insurance?\n\nWhat will it really mean in terms of economics?\n\nWill it be more expensive/less expensive, more complicated/less complicated?\n\n\u201cIt will all boil down to supply and demand. If there is more competition prices could fall. If there is less competition, prices could rise,\u201d Carden said. \u201cNext year will be a very pivotal year for the future of healthcare.\u201d\n\n2. Mergers and acquisitions\n\nConsolidation is a perennial trend in healthcare and 2014 won\u2019t be any different. In 2013, the healthcare industry saw robust M&A activity, though the overall value of the mergers and acquisitions declined slightly. The robust pace of 2013 is expected to carry into 2014, Carden said, though the ACA could impact volume. Some organizations may be less inclined to take on others if it means they will become a \u201clarge employer\u201d under the ACA definition.\n\nHowever, the debt and equity capital markets are expected to be strong in 2014, Carden said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to foster new investments and allow companies to grow and continue to provide fuel for mergers and acquisitions.\u201d\n\nCost of entry is still steep, though, which may lead providers to carve out new arrangements, such as forming joint ventures.\n\n3. New payment models\n\nExpect to see sustained growth in reimbursement models, including accountable care, bundled payments and shared savings, wrote Catherine Sreckovick, Navigant Healthcare Managing Director, in a blog for Navigant\u2019s website.\n\n4. Technology\n\n\u201cThere is a push for the completion of the electronic patient record,\u201d said Frank Trembulek, chief operating officer at Geisinger Health System. Interactive patients records and personalized medicine will come more to the forefront in 2014.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/4-healthcare-hot-topics-2014", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/recruiting.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "With the closing of 2013 and arrival of 2014, it is a time to look ahead at a few of the industry trends we can expect in the upcoming 12 months.", "title": "4 healthcare hot topics in 2014"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/recruiting.jpg"}, "description": "With the closing of 2013 and arrival of 2014, it is a time to look ahead at a few of the industry trends we can expect in the upcoming 12 months.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "4 healthcare hot topics in 2014"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Editor's note: Since this post continues to receive search traffic we thought it would be better to link to the more recent list of healthcare issues.&#13; &#13; Here is the updated list: Top issues for healthcare in 2015&#13; Original story:&#13; With the closing of 2013 and arrival of 2014, it is a time to look ahead at a few of the industry trends we can expect in the upcoming 12 months.&#13; 1.
