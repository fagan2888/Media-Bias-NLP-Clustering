As you can see, job losses lasted much longer in the aftermath of the financial crises that hit, among others, Finland and Sweden in 1991 and Spain in 1977, as well as the United States during the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cThe current cycle actually compares pretty favorably,\u201d Mr. Lehner wrote. \u201cThis is likely due to the coordinated global response to the immediate crises in late 2008 and early 2009. While the initial path of both the global and U.S. economies in 2008 and 2009 effectively matched the early years of the Great Depression \u2013 or worse \u2013 the strong policy response employed by nearly all major economies \u2013 both monetary and fiscal \u2013 helped stop the economic free fall.\u201d\n\nThe United States Treasury posted a similar chart (Slide 8) last year.\n\nAs mentioned before, the Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have extensively studied how economies have bounced back (or not) after financial crises throughout history.
