(Photo: Evan Vucci / AP)\n\nThe time has come to insist that our state representatives truly represent us.\n\nOne year ago the Michigan Senate passed Senate Bill 2, defining scope of practice for nurse practitioners in Michigan. Most importantly, it removes barriers for individuals and families in Michigan to receive quality health care. And that\u2019s the key \u2013 SB2 is about the health of our families.\n\nNurse practitioners \u2014 there are more than 5,500 NPs across Michigan, and 192,000 nationwide \u2014 are certified, expert clinicians with advanced education and extensive clinical preparation. They provide primary, acute and specialty health care services for patients, assisting in alleviating the anticipated shortage of health care providers in this state.\n\nLast year, SB2 was referred to the House Health Policy Committee for review.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long year with little action.\n\nHouse Health Policy Committee Chairwoman Rep. Gail Haines has failed to respond to repeated requests to meet with her own constituents to discuss the importance of this bill. And now she also does not intend to schedule a committee meeting to bring SB2 up for a vote in the few remaining days of the Michigan's legislative session, which would make bill passage very unlikely this year.\n\nThis disinterest from Haines in representing constituents \u2014 at a time that important legislation is being discussed \u2014 can be detrimental. But we won\u2019t be deterred. The Michigan Council of Nurse Practitioners (MICNP) and the other members of the Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) Coalition are committed to advocating for SB2 until the last possible moment, but we need your help NOW.\n\nWhy? Because Michigan families need this legislation passed now.\n\nMore than 40 years of research that has proven that APRNs are high quality, cost effective health care providers. In the 19 states and D.C. where APRNs have autonomous practice regulations, outcomes are equal to or better than those of physicians. Further, it has been shown that states that provide an APRN scope of practice reflective of their education, experience and certifications have increased patient access to health care.\n\nThe bill, which allows for nurse practitioners to diagnose and treat patients without direct physician supervision, comes at a very \u2014 very \u2014 important time. The measure is needed to ensure that quality care is available to the citizens of our community. It is especially essential given Michigan\u2019s physician shortage and increased demand for care that comes with an aging population and additional people with insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPlease join the 5,500 APRNs in Michigan to call for a vote on SB2 in the House Health Policy Committee, and give it due process by sending it to the full House to consider \u2014 it is the right thing to do for Michigan patients.\n\nWhen representatives do not represent constituents we must not give up. Instead, we must try harder. We must be vocal, and insist that our representatives represent us.\n\nNancy George, president of the Michigan Council of Nurse Practitioners, is a professor at Wayne State.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1zY09Eg", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Senate Bill 2 allows nurse practitioners to treat patients without physician supervision", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Senate Bill 2 allows nurse practitioners to treat patients without physician supervision", "title": "George: Michigan, let nurse practitioners practice", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/2014/12/05/pass-michigan-senate-bill-nursing/19913183/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senate Bill 2 allows nurse practitioners to treat patients without physician supervision", "creator": "@detroitnews", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0dcaa31e3a8b9b8f70987d19730f277f494c6263/c=531-0-2969-2438&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DetroitNews/2014/12/04/B99222885Z.1_20141204173819_000_GL1D9OQ6.1-0.jpg", "title": "Pass Senate Bill 2, give Michigan nurses more autonomy", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "nursing, Nancy George, Michigan, nurse practitioners, Senate Bill 2, Michigan Council of Nurse Practitioners"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0d7\"", "article_summary": "One year ago the Michigan Senate passed Senate Bill 2, defining scope of practice for nurse practitioners in Michigan.\nThey provide primary, acute and specialty health care services for patients, assisting in alleviating the anticipated shortage of health care providers in this state.\nMost importantly, it removes barriers for individuals and families in Michigan to receive quality health care.\nMore than 40 years of research that has proven that APRNs are high quality, cost effective health care providers.\nNancy George, president of the Michigan Council of Nurse Practitioners, is a professor at Wayne State."}
