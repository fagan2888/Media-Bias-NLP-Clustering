Previous congressional attempts to axe the tax have failed.\n\n\u201cThe medical device tax is burdensome for our medical device sector and impacts innovation, competitiveness and economic growth in the state,\u201d said April Giles, CEO and president of the Colorado Bioscience Association, in a statement. \u201cWe applaud representatives (Ken) Buck, (Doug) Lamborn, (Scott) Tipton and (Mike) Coffman, who voted in favor of repeal.\u201d\n\nThe 2.3-percent revenue tax was first levied two years ago as a mechanism to fund the president\u2019s healthcare expansion program. Despite threat of veto, the tax next heads to the U.S. Senate, where it faces favorable odds in the Republican-controlled chamber. The Senate voted 79-20 to scrap the tax in 2013, though the outcome was non-binding.\n\nWhat the repeal could mean for Aurora and Colorado as a whole is more jobs, more companies and an enhanced ability to keep research dollars in the state, according to Giles.\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, the tax has caused a lot of companies here to decrease the number of job opportunities and it really hinders innovation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to keep that growth in Colorado and not move it to the international sector.\u201d\n\nColorado is now home to the sixth-largest medical device community in the nation, boasting nearly 600 bioscience companies that employee more than 28,500 people, many of whom are based at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, according to Giles. She added that last year alone, 302 medical devices were approved by the Food and Drug Administration and 126 devices were in the investigational phase in the state. Colorado companies have produced 630 FDA-approved medical devices since 2006, according to a recent Colorado Bioscience Association study on the state of the industry.\n\nSpectranetics Inc. in Colorado Springs was the state\u2019s top producer in terms of investigational and approved devices last year, according to the CBSA study. But the device tax means that lofty production numbers don\u2019t translate to financial health or immunity, according to Austin Byrd, vice president and chief compliance officer of Spectranetics.\n\nHendrik Schmidt, PhD, shows off a diagnostics device prototype that Beacon Biotechnology is working on Tuesday at Anschutz Medical Campus.

Really, the tax means fewer jobs in Colorado, less innovation and an inability to produce products that could help patients.\u201d\n\nWith more than 830 employees worldwide, Byrd said that Spectranetics exports thousands of devices to 65 countries with an emphasis on emerging markets such as South Korea, India and Brazil. He added that the tax has given device companies cause to reevaluate where they want to establish a headquarters.\n\n\u201cMost device companies do not expect to make a profit in the first phase of their existence because they\u2019re reinvesting in additional technologies or very expensive clinical trials to get FDA approval,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cSo this tax causes some companies to rethink where they\u2019re going to set up shop and manufacture. It\u2019s a significant burden on dollar one of revenue.\u201d\n\nGiles said that a lack of other facilities along the Front Range could set Aurora and the Anschutz Medical Campus up for absorbing additional companies, device ventures and resources, given a device tax repeal.\n\n\u201cIn Boulder there really is not a true incubator, but there\u2019s a huge need for incubator-type space up there,\u201d Giles said. \u201cSo the ability for Anschutz to bring other companies from there onto its campus I think is high.\u201d\n\nThe Senate is expected to vote on the device tax later this summer.\n\n\u2014 The Associated Press\n\ncontributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Aurora Sentinel", "description": "AURORA | One of Colorado\u2019s fastest-growing industries could see a major uptick over the next year due to the possible repeal of a tax on medical devices.
