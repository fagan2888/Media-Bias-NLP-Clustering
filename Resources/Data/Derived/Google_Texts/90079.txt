ORLANDO, Fla. - A beluga whale has died at SeaWorld Orlando after being treated for an infection associated with a fractured jaw.



Sea World officials said Friday that the beluga whale Nanuq died Thursday.



The cause of death won't be known until a post-mortem examination, but the beluga whale had been under treatment for an infection.



Nanuq's jaw was fractured during an encounter with two other whales that were part of a compatible social group.



Nanuq was estimated to be 31 or 32 years old and was on loan to SeaWorld from the Vancouver Aquarium.
