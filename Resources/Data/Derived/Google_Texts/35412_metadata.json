But it is not going to happen unless business accepts it has to be the catalyst. It has to lead.\u201d\n\nIn Colorado, middle-skill jobs comprise the largest part of the labor market, according to the National Skills Coalition, which advocates for workforce training.\n\nIn 2012, about half of new openings in Colorado were middle skill, but unlike for high- and low-skill jobs, there were too few workers to fill them. The coalition estimates that through 2022, 47 percent of new job openings will be middle skill.\n\nThese jobs include coders, financial service sales agents, insurance and real estate brokers and individuals in technical sales and sales management, as well as machinists and tool-and-die makers.\n\nMiddle-skills jobs that are hardest to fill in Colorado include network administrators (4,292 postings last year), registered nurses (22,225 postings), computer support specialists (7,706 postings) and service technicians (2,779 postings), according to Burning Glass.\n\nFriday morning, as the bitter cold began to lift, workers trained at community colleges and special schools were busy fixing broken furnaces for All Weather Heating and Cooling in Denver.\n\nGeneral manager Robert Piele said his service technicians are trained in basic and advanced refrigeration and electrical concepts, typically through specialized programs at Front Range, Denver and Red Rocks community colleges, or at Lincoln College of Technology.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be independent courses that isolate the components of the unit,\u201d he said, \u201cso that we understand what is going on.\u201d\n\nTo develop education that matches demand, like those programs All Weather technicians go through, business must take the lead, Fuller said.\n\n\u201cThey have to own the problem out of their own enlightened self-interest in order to grow their productivity and therefore grow their profitability,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they should have dictatorial power, or that they should be telling educators what to do, or that governors or mayors should kowtow to business leaders.\u201d\n\nBut they can bring the same rigor and discipline to sourcing middle-skills talent they historically applied to their materials supply chain.\n\nThis means cultivating talent by telling educators what they need \u2014 and asking for quality control on the classes that are taught and giving the educators a lot of feedback.\n\nEducators, on the other hand, have to accept the notion that business is a legitimate customer and must be attentive to the evolving needs of the market.\n\nAnd both educators and policymakers must drop the notion that students must go to college to be a success.\n\nInstead of touting \u201ccollege for all,\u201d which devalues the importance of middle-skills work, Fuller said, the new rallying cry should be \u201cpostsecondary education for all.\u201d\n\nHoward Pankratz: 303-954-1939, hpankratz@denverpost.com or twitter.com/howardpankratz", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Report: Business must take lead in filling thousands of middle skill jobs", "title": "Report: Business must take lead in filling thousands of middle skill jobs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/14/report-business-must-take-lead-in-filling-thousands-of-middle-skill-jobs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141114__20141115_A17_BZ15SKILLS1p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141114__20141115_A17_BZ15SKILLS1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-14T20:44:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T00:09:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfe9\"", "article_summary": "In 2012, about half of new openings in Colorado were middle skill, but unlike for high- and low-skill jobs, there were too few workers to fill them.\nGeneral manager Robert Piele said his service technicians are trained in basic and advanced refrigeration and electrical concepts, typically through specialized programs at Front Range, Denver and Red Rocks community colleges, or at Lincoln College of Technology.\nMiddle-skills jobs that are hardest to fill in Colorado include network administrators (4,292 postings last year), registered nurses (22,225 postings), computer support specialists (7,706 postings) and service technicians (2,779 postings), according to Burning Glass.\nBut it is not going to happen unless business accepts it has to be the catalyst.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t start fighting this battle, what we are going to get is further polarization of the income spectrum, we are going to get more people out of the workforce,\u201d Fuller said."}
