If you\u2019re in an HMO that doesn\u2019t have a POS (point of service) option, visits to your out-of-network doctor might not be covered at all.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, you could lose out on free preventive care. Even though the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, mandated that routine physicals and certain screening tests be 100% free, that rule applies only if you stay in network.\n\nElliott and other experts say you have a few options if your top doc pulls up stakes. Take a deep breath and make the following moves.\n\nIf you want to stay with your doctor\u2026\n\nAsk for a break if you\u2019re picking up the tab. \u201cIf your current doctor is someone that you absolutely can\u2019t do without, talk to that doctor directly about your situation and ask if they would consider providing you a discount if you paid out of pocket,\u201d says Ian Siegel, CEO and co-founder of recruiting and benefits technology company ZipRecruiter.\n\nPay with pre-tax dollars. \u201cCalculate how much you\u2019ve spent at your doctor\u2019s office over the last year and set up a flexible spending account to cover the out-of-network fees for the next year,\u201d Elliott advises. Even though you\u2019ll be paying out of pocket, you\u2019ll be able to pay the first $2,550 with pre-tax dollars if you set up an FSA ($2,550 is the annual maximum you\u2019re allowed to contribute for 2015; the IRS usually ticks it up according to inflation, so the current low inflation makes it likely that the amount will remain the same for next year.) \u201cYou\u2019ll be paying the fees with money that has not been taxed, saving you approximately 20% to 35% depending on your income tax bracket,\u201d he says.\n\nSwitch health plans. \u201cIf the doctor-patient relationship is important to the patient, they should choose a plan that includes that doctor in-network,\u201d says Hector De La Torre, executive director of Transamerica Center for Health Studies. But keep in mind that even though this will cut down on out-of-network paperwork and lower your out-of-pocket costs, this is a big change that is likely to affect your premiums, deductible, and your relationship with any other medical professionals your family visits.\n\nIf you decide to switch doctors\u2026\n\nAsk for a referral immediately. If you just can\u2019t afford to switch plans or pay out of network (a likely scenario for many families), ask your current provider for a referral as soon as possible. \u201cIf someone knows that their doctor will be leaving a network, sooner is always better than later,\u201d Elliott says. \u201cPractices with good reputations fill up quickly, especially in narrow networks.\u201d When you contact the new practice, make sure it accepts your insurance.\n\nMake sure both docs are on the same page. \u201cAsk your current provider to communicate with your new provider to help coordinate care during the transition,\u201d says Danielle Hartigan, assistant professor of natural and applied sciences at Bentley University. Continuity of care is important for the best medical outcomes, she says, so it will benefit you to be proactive about coordinating the transfer. \u201cAlso, make sure to transfer your medical records,\u201d Hartigan says. Since a growing number of practices use electronic records, your new doctor might be able to access your records with just a few clicks.\n\nCheck your coverage for the new doc\u2019s affiliations. \u201cBe sure to check not only that the doctor you find is in network for your new plan, but also that the hospital that doctor is affiliated with for any procedures or hospital stays is in network as well,\u201d Siegel advises.\n\nRead next: How to Pick a Health Plan in 15 Minutes or Less\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here's what experts say you can do if your doctor is leaving or planning to leave your health insurance network.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Don't hit the panic button.", "title": "What to Do If Your Doctor Bails on Your Health Plan", "url": "http://time.com/money/4078687/doctor-health-insurance-network-plan-left/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/151105_ff_doctorcutsplan.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "MONEY", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/151105_ff_doctorcutsplan.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Don't hit the panic button.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What to Do If Your Doctor Bails on Your Health Plan"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": ", doctor bills, doctor payments, health insurance, health premium, in-network, in-network charges, medical expenses, out of pocket expenses", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "health insurance, doctor, medical, prescriptions, open enrollment, health plan, physician"}, "article_summary": "Read next: How to Pick a Health Plan in 15 Minutes or Less\n\u201cIf someone knows that their doctor will be leaving a network, sooner is always better than later,\u201d Elliott says.\n\u201cBe sure to check not only that the doctor you find is in network for your new plan, but also that the hospital that doctor is affiliated with for any procedures or hospital stays is in network as well,\u201d Siegel advises.\nSince a growing number of practices use electronic records, your new doctor might be able to access your records with just a few clicks.\nIf you\u2019re in an HMO that doesn\u2019t have a POS (point of service) option, visits to your out-of-network doctor might not be covered at all."}
