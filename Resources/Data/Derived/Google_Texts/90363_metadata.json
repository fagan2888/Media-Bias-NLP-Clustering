(Cliff Grassmick)\n\nA 21-year-old Boulder man was being evaluated for a potential mental health hold late Saturday after police responded to an apartment complex on reports of someone who was possibly armed and suicidal.\n\nBoulder police were called to the GlenLakes apartments late Saturday morning, located at 2995 Glenwood Drive, and launched a search for the man who was threatening suicide and whom they said should only be approached with caution.\n\nThe situation was resolved about 2:35 p.m., according to Sgt. Dave Seper, after the man contacted his mother, who in turn got in touch with police.\n\nSeper said contact with the man was coordinated through his mother, and that he surrendered peacfully. Seper said a \"handgun was involved\" in the incident, but he did not elaborate.\n\nDespite the heavy presence of police with guns drawn at the Glenwood Drive address, residents were not evacuated, and Glenwood Drive was never closed down to traffic.\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Charlie Brennan at 303-473-1327 or brennanc@dailycamera.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26136583/boulder-police-seeking-man-who-is-possibly-armed", "sailthru.author": "By Charlie Brennan, Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26136583:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-12T12:34:24-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "A 21-year-old Boulder man was being evaluated for a potential mental health hold late Saturday after police responded to an apartment complex on reports of someone who was possibly armed and suicidal.", "title": "Boulder man held for evaluation after his mother brokers surrender", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26136583/boulder-police-seeking-man-who-is-possibly-armed", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0712/20140712_125107_33glenlake.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0712/20140712_125435_4glenlake_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2014-07-13T09:10:03-0600", "endDate": "2024-07-12T12:34:24-0600", "description": "A 21-year-old Boulder man was being evaluated for a potential mental health hold late Saturday after police responded to an apartment complex on reports of someone who was possibly armed and suicidal.", "byline": "By Charlie Brennan,", "pubDate": "2014-07-12T12:37:41-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-12T12:34:24-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder man held for evaluation after his mother brokers surrender", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26136583/boulder-police-seeking-man-who-is-possibly-armed", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "A 21-year-old Boulder man was being evaluated for a potential mental health hold late Saturday after police responded to an apartment complex on reports of someone who was possibly armed and suicidal.", "title": "Boulder man held for evaluation after his mother brokers surrender"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0712/20140712_125435_4glenlake.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb93\"", "article_summary": "Despite the heavy presence of police with guns drawn at the Glenwood Drive address, residents were not evacuated, and Glenwood Drive was never closed down to traffic.\n21-year-old man was possibly suicidalBoulder police outside 2995 Glenwood Drive during the search for a 21-year-old man who later surrendered and was being examined for a potential mental health hold.\nSeper said contact with the man was coordinated through his mother, and that he surrendered peacfully.\nDave Seper, after the man contacted his mother, who in turn got in touch with police.\nBoulder police were called to the GlenLakes apartments late Saturday morning, located at 2995 Glenwood Drive, and launched a search for the man who was threatening suicide and whom they said should only be approached with caution."}
