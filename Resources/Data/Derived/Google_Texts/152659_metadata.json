Susan Collins won an endorsement Friday from independent Sen. Angus King, support she warmly welcomed but did not request and may not need in her run for a fourth term.\n\nWith Collins holding a dominant lead in fundraising and polling over Democratic challenger Shenna Bellows, the focus shifted to King, who continues to brandish his independent credentials. The endorsement was his first as a member of Congress. It took just a few hours for the Brunswick resident to make his second.\n\nAdditional Photos Sens.

Jean Shaheen, a Democrat whose three terms as governor overlapped with King\u2019s two terms as Maine\u2019s governor.\n\nThe mini-endorsement tour is likely to spur scrutiny of King\u2019s political positioning as the congressional mid-term elections loom.\n\nEarly national tracking polls show that Republicans have a decent chance of taking control of the Senate. King, who caucuses with Democrats, touched off a wave of speculation in April when he suggested to the Washington-based publication The Hill that he might caucus with Republicans if they win the majority in November.\n\nAsked Friday about joining the Republicans, King repeated earlier statements that he would base his decision on the best interest of Mainers.\n\nBut his endorsement of Shaheen is likely to counter claims that King is poised to change caucuses.\n\nBellows would not say that King\u2019s endorsement of her opponent was a deliberate political calculation, but she repeatedly alluded to the prospect of a Republican takeover in the Senate.\n\n\u201cAngus called me (Thursday) night and told me it wasn\u2019t personal,\u201d Bellows said. \u201cI agree with him. These decisions about who to endorse, who to vote for aren\u2019t personal. \u2026 I think who to support in the U.S. Senate is about much more than either of us. It\u2019s about the party that will be in control in the Senate and the future of our country.\u201d\n\nKing said all the speculation is misguided.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re overthinking it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no deep personal motive here. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me.\u201d\n\nLarry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said King\u2019s endorsement of Collins made sense, given that the two Maine senators have a well-established working relationship. Sabato said both will benefit from Friday\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cCollins is bound to win, but I\u2019m sure she welcomed the endorsement because she is literally the only Republican (running for re-election) in a state President Obama won,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she has any problems at all anyway, but it\u2019s always nice to have that added security.\u201d\n\nCollins and King differ on a number of issues, particularly the Affordable Care Act, but they have forged a working relationship and their political offices often send joint statements. The senators created a \u201cGang of 14\u201d to address the government shutdown last year and worked together on a student loan bill. They also joined forces to ensure that the Navy agreed to build an extra destroyer at Bath Iron Works, one of Maine\u2019s largest employers.\n\nKing praised Collins on Friday for her work ethic, intelligence and integrity. \u201cShe always puts Maine and the country first and isn\u2019t afraid to cross party lines to get things done,\u201d he said.\n\nCollins said she was \u201cdelighted and honored\u201d to have King\u2019s backing, even though she didn\u2019t ask for it.\n\nShe said King recently came to her Senate office after a long day of hearings on the Senate Intelligence Committee, on which the two serve, to offer his endorsement.\n\nKing told the Portland Press Herald that he made similar offers to other members of Congress. He would not say whom. He also declined to say whether he would make an endorsement in Maine\u2019s gubernatorial race.\n\nSteve Mistler can be contacted at 791-6345 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @stevemistler", "article_metadata": {"description": "The two were political opponents when King beat Collins in the 1994 Maine governor\u2019s race.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The two were political opponents when King beat Collins in the 1994 Maine governor\u2019s race.", "title": "Republican Susan Collins earns independent Angus King\u2019s endorsement - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20140517_444896.xml-20140516+king+collins+003.jpg", "height": 983}, "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/05/16/republican_sen__collins_earns_independent_king_s_endorsement_/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The two were political opponents when King beat Collins in the 1994 Maine governor\u2019s race.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20140517_444896.xml-20140516+king+collins+003.jpg", "title": "Republican Susan Collins earns independent Angus King\u2019s endorsement - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2014-05-16T06:44:09-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Susan Collins and Angus King stand outside the Margaret Chase Smith Library, where King endorsed Collins for re-election.\nMaine\u2019s Republican U.S. Sen.
