In an exclusive interview, he explained why he picked the City Beautiful for his first stop.\n\n\"There's so many people who weren't born in Orlando that live there now. It has a national feel to it, and I can tap into a broad spectrum of people,\" Luntz said. \"Orlando's economy has seen success and challenges, and people are focused on Orlando, not just in the state but across the country.\"\n\nLuntz is actually part of a tour called \"The Bring Small Businesses Back Tour\" organized by a conservative advocacy group, Job Creators Network. JCN was established by Home Depot founder Bernie Marcus and is partly known for opposing the National Labor Relations Board on regulations regarding franchises.\n\nThe town-hall meeting is free and begins at 6 p.m. at the Hilton Orlando in Altamonte Springs. Nationally syndicated talk show host Mike Gallagher also will be there.\n\nAccording to the JCN group, the town hall Thursday will help to explain \"why government policies often hurt small business owners and more importantly, how America's entrepreneurs can talk to the public, their legislators, and their employees, to push for a pro-growth, pro-jobs, and pro-opportunity future.\"\n\nAlthough associated with the GOP, a flyer for the event takes aim at this year's election cycle in general: \"So far this election has been dominated by shouting, scandal, and sound bites\u2014come join your fellow business people to discuss real problems and real solutions\u2014without the politics and theater.\"\n\n\"Small business owners are not as vocal as union members, or teachers,\" Luntz said. \"But small business owners should be the focus. That's where dreams come true. I think that can be that America in 2016, that your innovation, hard work and commitment can make you successful.\"\n\nBut Luntz said business people and the general public needs to understand \"taxes, regulations and a lot of factors that Washington imposes on people.\"\n\nHe said the Affordable Care Act, or health-care reform, is just \"one of the regulations small biz owners are facing. It's definitely one of the top issues.\"\n\nHe said Bernie Sanders' popularity with young Democrats is bizarre to him.\n\n\"I'm less focused on the specific policy and much more focused on why so many young people believe socialism is a better system than capitalism,\" Luntz said. \"I want people to walk away understanding the mindset of the country, and the language of America.\"\n\nOrlando low cost?\n\nDon't tell anyone who's hunting for an apartment, but a major accounting firm just ranked Orlando second in the nation for being low-cost.\n\nFor whom, you may ask? It's for businesses seeking cheap labor.\n\nAccounting and advisory firm KPMG said Orlando was the second most cost-friendly city to do business among the 31 largest U.S. metro areas \u2014 those above 2 million population.\n\nOrlando was followed by Tampa, Cleveland, San Antonio and Atlanta.\n\nThe firm said its study is a valuable benchmark for business executives, economic developers and policymakers considering sites for their business operations.\n\nThe study measured 26 key cost components in each market \u2014 including costs associated with taxes, labor, facilities, transportation and utilities \u2014 as they apply to seven different business-to-business service sector operations and 12 different manufacturing sector operations. Scores were awarded, and the lowest score was ranked No. 1.\n\nOrlando, at 94.4, had the second-lowest labor costs, coupled with low salaries, statutory plans and benefits. According to KPMG, low office-lease costs were also an advantage, helping boost Orlando into second place overall.\n\nCincinnati ranked first, for leasing costs, low property taxes and second-lowest salary costs. Ohio tax credits for to video-game production also helped.\n\npbrinkmann@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5660", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Frank Luntz kicks off small biz tour here", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "Conservative pundit and national commentator Frank Luntz is kicking off a national tour about small business in the Orlando area Thursday.", "title": "Frank Luntz kicks off small biz tour here", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/brinkmann-on-business/os-cfb-brinkmann-040416-20160401-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-57028f3a/turbine/os-cfb-brinkmann-040416-20160401", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Frank Luntz, Job Creators Network, Hilton Orlando, Mike Gallagher, National Labor Relations Board", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/86412192", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-04-04", "Description": "Conservative pundit and national commentator Frank Luntz is kicking off a national tour about small business in the Orlando area this Thursday.
