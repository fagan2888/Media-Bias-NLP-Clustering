Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., is leading the House investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s handling of the 2012 U.S. consulate attack in Benghazi, Libya. Now, a liberal watchdog group says Gowdy\u2019s emails should be public fodder too.\n\nTo stay up-to-date on South Carolina politics, go to palmettopolitics.com or download the Palmetto Politics app for iOS or Android.\n\n\u201cCorrect the Record,\u201d which is defending Clinton this election season, again is asking Gowdy to turn over his personal and business emails, along with those from the members of his staff, to see who he is talking with.\n\nGroup founder David Brock outlined his demands in a letter shared with Politico last week, saying Gowdy should have to play by the same scrutiny.\n\n\u201cI asked earlier what it is you may have to hide by not releasing your own emails and I recognize that I am unlikely to receive a response,\u201d Brock wrote.\n\nNot surprisingly, the demand was not met with a positive response.\n\n\u201cThe Select Committee on Benghazi may have uncovered Hillary Clinton\u2019s unusual and unprecedented email arrangement, but it is the FBI that is investigating it,\u201d committee spokesman Jamal Ware said. \u201cAs such, it would be more appropriate for this group to direct its request to the FBI.\u201d\n\nIn his letter, Brock speculated Gowdy\u2019s refusal to disclose his contacts is because he is \u201chiding correspondence with GOP presidential candidates, the Republican National Committee or other political committees\u201d that would show a route of \u201ccharacter and political assassination against Hillary Clinton in an effort to win a political campaign.\u201d\n\nHaley on national stage this week\n\nGov. Nikki Haley will be a featured speaker in Washington, D.C., this week where she\u2019ll delve into the \u201cLessons from the New South.\u201d\n\nHaley will speak Wednesday at the National Press Club, the epicenter of journalism in Washington where its collection of meeting rooms attract figures from across the country.\n\nThe speech is expected to get heightened attention from the D.C. press corps in the wake of the June 17 mass shooting at Charleston\u2019s Emanuel AME Church and the subsequent removal of the Confederate flag from the Statehouse grounds.\n\n\u201cThe governor has always believed that when you have a story to tell, you tell it,\u201d Rob Godfrey, Haley\u2019s deputy chief of staff, said of the invite.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good that\u2019s come out of South Carolina over the last five years, and she\u2019s looking forward to talking to the state and the country about it.\u201d\n\nHaley\u2019s name has been mentioned in the vice presidential discussion among Republicans and the appearance will be a first for many in the political pack to see her speak in person.\n\nIt\u2019s documented: Trump gets more TV coverage\n\nIf you thought there was a TV news obsession with GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump, you\u2019re right.\n\nThe Media Research Center found that in the two weeks prior to the Republican field\u2019s first televised debate, Trump garnered 55 percent of all the coverage that was dedicated to Republican candidates by three network evening newscasts - ABC, CBS, NBC.\n\nBut after the debate, the Media Research Center found that Trump\u2019s share of coverage jumped to 72 percent, compared to 28 percent for all 16 of the other GOP candidates.\n\nThe center also found the networks covered Trump more than Democrat and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the two weeks after the debate. The margin was 69 minutes and 50 seconds to 40 minutes.\n\nObservers called the imbalance \u201cparticularly amazing\u201d since during this stretch of time in August is when the FBI took control of Clinton\u2019s controversial email server for review.\n\nMount Pleasant forums set\n\nFiling closed for Mount Pleasant Town Council elections last week, and 12 candidates are seeking the four seats up for grabs.\n\nTown voters will have at least three chances to hear from and compare the candidates in a public forum:\n\nOn Sept. 21, the East Cooper Republican Club will host a forum during its regular lunch meeting at the Mount Pleasant Holiday Inn, 250 Johnnie Dodds Blvd.\n\nOn Oct. 8, the League of Women Voters of the Charleston Area and Save Shem Creek Corp. will hold a forum at 6:30 p.m. at Moultrie Middle School.\n\nOn Oct. 15, the Mount Pleasant Business Association will host a candidate forum at noon at the Mount Pleasant Holiday Inn. Dr. Gibbs Knotts, chairman of the Political Science Department at the College of Charleston, will moderate.\n\nThe Town Council seats are all at-large races, meaning whichever four candidates get the most votes on Nov. 3 will be sworn in on Nov. 10.\n\nWanted: Poll managers\n\nCharleston County is looking for people interested in helping staff the polling places for the Nov. 3 municipal elections in Charleston, North Charleston and Mount Pleasant \u2013 a job that pays $120.\n\nAnyone interested must be at least 17, able to attend a poll manager training session of a few hours and pass a written test.
