But don\u2019t cheer just yet. While that is a significant number, the story of parity is better told through percentages: Women are still less than 20 percent of the 535 voting members of the U.S. Congress.\n\nAt this rate, it will take another 500 years for women to be evenly represented, one study shows. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019ve hit 100, but it\u2019s not a cheerful statistic,\u201d said Rep. Diana DeGette, the senior member of Colorado\u2019s nine-member congressional delegation, and its only woman. \u201cWe gain a few seats every term, but that does nothing to take us to full parity.\u201d\n\nFor the last two decades, Colorado has done little to change the national ratio. Despite being the first state in the nation to give women the vote by popular election, Colorado is one of only 11 states that\u2019s never elected a female senator or governor (or a female mayor of Denver). \u201cWe absolutely have a glass ceiling for higher office in Colorado,\u201d said DeGette.\n\nBut there\u2019s hope: Colorado\u2019s legislature tops the nation with 42 percent women, according to the Colorado Legislative Women\u2019s Caucus. And Democrats in the Colorado House just elected the first all-female leadership team: Speaker Dickey Lee Hullinghorst and Majority Leader Crisanta Duran. In the Senate, Democrat Morgan Carroll was elected minority leader, and Republican Cynthia Coffman is Colorado\u2019s new attorney general.\n\nBut breaking down the barriers between women\u2019s stellar participation at the state level and their conspicuous absence in national and executive level politics will require a collective effort by Colorado\u2019s political denizens, statewide media, and voters in every shade of purple.\n\nElecting more women to political office isn\u2019t just about having equality for equality\u2019s sake. \u201cIt\u2019s really about having that diversity of ideas and diversity of experience,\u201d said Faith Winter, newly elected state representative and executive Director of Emerge Colorado, a group that trains and encourages women to run for office. \u201cIf we really want to have a citizen legislature, then we should have a legislature that reflects our citizens.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also about getting things done. Although the midterms are barely over, congressional Republicans are already drawing battle lines with a Democratic president. But in the ongoing fight to be king of the hill, no one wins.\n\nIn contrast, studies show female politicians are more collaborative and willing to reach across the aisle to find solutions: It was a bipartisan group of Senate women who forged a budget compromise that ended the government shutdown in 2013.\n\nDeGette also tells the story of being approached on the House floor by Rep. Michele Bachmann. the \u201cTea Party queen.\u201d \u201cDiana, you know if women were in charge, this government would never be shut down,'\u201d she told DeGette.\n\n\u201cThis may be the first and only time I ever agreed with Michele, but I think she was right because women are used to working in a collaborative way,\u201d said DeGette. \u201cThey\u2019re used to looking at the issue and the goal rather than the personality and the ego.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just collaboration that sets women apart as leaders. Women scored higher than men in 12 of 16 leadership competencies, including more assertive traits like taking initiative, displaying integrity, and driving results, according to leadership consultants Zenger Folkman.\n\nWhether or not it\u2019s intentional, Colorado\u2019s male bias begins early in the political cycle. Conversations are already starting about candidates for races in 2016 and beyond, said DeGette. And women are notably absent from those discussions.\n\n\u201cI am already hearing this old adage \u2026 that there are no qualified women for these offices, but here\u2019s the list of men,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think people think of women in the same way as they do men in Colorado.\u201d\n\nLike the CEO suite, Congress \u201cwas made for men by men,\u201d which creates an inherent bias, said LaRae Orullian, the first president and CEO of the Women\u2019s Bank of Denver. But women are equally qualified to lead in both arenas, she said.\n\nOrullian helped form Velvet Hammer in the 1970s. The group of Denver women met with male CEOs to ask why there were no women on their boards. When the CEOs inevitably said there were no qualified women for the job, the group presented r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of qualified female candidates.\n\nToday, Orullian works with Electing Women, a Colorado group that promotes the political candidacies of women nationwide. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for us as women to show support for one another and get out on the front line and let our voices be heard,\u201d she said.\n\nBy the 1990s, it seemed that Colorado was finally moving toward political parity. Congress welcomed a record number of female representatives in 1992, dubbed \u201cYear of the Woman.\u201d In 1996, DeGette won the seat vacated by Patricia Schroeder, Colorado\u2019s first congresswoman. Republican Gale Norton and Democrats Josie Heath and Dottie Lamm all ran for U.S. Senate seats. And Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler lost a tight race for governor to Bill Owens in 1998.\n\nBut since then, Colorado women have barely made a splash in national politics. We\u2019ve sent only two other women to Congress: Republican Marilyn Musgrave and Democrat Betsy Markey. Republican State Rep. Amy Stephens ran for the U.S. Senate last year, but bowed out to Cory Gardner.\n\nYet it\u2019s easier today for women to get elected, and Colorado needs to recognize that change. Female candidates are just as likely as male candidates to raise funds, get positive media attention, and win elections, according to Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women & Politics Institute at American University. So why aren\u2019t more women running?\n\n\u201cWomen need to be willing to put themselves forward,\u201d said DeGette. And \u201cthe powers-that-be in the business community, the media, and political insiders need to examine their own beliefs and suppositions to see if they have a gender bias that they haven\u2019t thought about.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also think that we need to break down the barriers we have at those high levels of office in Colorado for people to think about women in these jobs.\u201d\n\nLisa Wirthman of Highlands Ranch is a monthly columnist.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wirthman: Want to get things done in U.S.?
