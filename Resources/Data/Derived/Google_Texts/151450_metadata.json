Across the street, the Supreme Court heard its latest challenge to the law.\n\nThis time it was a challenge to an \"accommodation\" for religious nonprofits regarding the health law's contraceptive mandate.\n\nSwing Justice Anthony Kennedy seemed to side with conservatives on important points, possibly setting up a 4-4 split.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKennedy seemed to accept the view of the challengers that they face a \"substantial burden\" in opting out of the mandate to provide contraception coverage in their health plans.\n\n\"The analysis has to be whether or not there are less restrictive alternatives,\" Kennedy said.\n\nSome of the conservative justices raised the possibility of a separate plan to cover only contraception that could be sold on the ObamaCare exchanges, giving employees at religious nonprofits the ability to get contraceptive coverage elsewhere.\n\n\"Why can't they get it through another plan?\" Kennedy said.\n\nThe four liberal justices warned against the precedent of opening up the floodgates to new religious objections to laws. \"How will we ever have a government that functions?\" asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

More than a dozen YMCA centers split up $12 million to offer prevention programs to people at high risk of developing diabetes. Four years later, federal health officials have completed \"rigorous evaluations\" of the program and found that patients lost about 5 percent of their body weight.\n\nThose improvements in personal health saved Medicare about $2,650 per person, compared to people with similar health outside the program, HHS said.
