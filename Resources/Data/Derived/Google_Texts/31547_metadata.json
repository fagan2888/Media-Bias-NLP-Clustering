After all, I\u2019ve received countless emails attacking me for being Jewish when I\u2019ve written articles criticizing the Republican frontrunner\u2026 even though none of those pieces actually identified my religion (for more on that, click here). Even though this didn\u2019t prove that Trump was himself an anti-Semite, it certainly reflected the inherent bigotry that he stirs up in his supporters.\n\nThen Trump decided to speak at the Republican Jewish Coalition earlier today and forced me to revise my earlier opinion. I don\u2019t care that Trump\u2019s daughter married a Jew and converted to his religion \u2013 the man is an anti-Semite and I\u2019m calling him out as such.\n\nHere are some choice quotes from his speech, courtesy of the good folks at Vox:\n\n\u201cStupidly, you want to give money. \u2026You\u2019re not going to support me because I don\u2019t want your money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a negotiator, like you folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there anyone in this room who doesn\u2019t negotiate deals? Probably more than any room I\u2019ve ever spoken.\u201d\n\nTrump was also booed by the audience for refusing to state that Jerusalem ought to remain the undivided capital of Israel, an offense that I don\u2019t particularly consider to be racist. On the other hand, check out this attack on the national character of the Jewish State:\n\n\u201cA lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal \u2014 whether or not Israel\u2019s willing to sacrifice certain things. They may not be, and I understand that, and I\u2019m OK with that. But then you\u2019re just not going to have a deal.\u201d\n\nIt is at this point that I must doff my hat to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who had the courage to call The Donald out on the intolerance embedded in that comment:\n\n\u201cSome in our own party actually question Israel\u2019s commitment to peace. Some in our own party actually call for more sacrifice from the Israeli people. They are dead wrong, and don\u2019t understand the enduring bond between Israel and America.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump has always appealed to bigots.
