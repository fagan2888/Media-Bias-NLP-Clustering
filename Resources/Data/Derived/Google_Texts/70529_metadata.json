The funding was led by top-tier healthcare angel investors and has appointed industry veteran Daniel Dean as chief technology officer, responsible for all engineering and product management. Dean will lead Conversa\u2019s talented team of Health IT engineers in building out a robust product roadmap for its expanding user base.\n\nConversa Digital Checkup Platform Overview\n\nConversa\u2019s Digital Checkup platform provides ACOs, physician practices & hospitals an automated way to improve the huge gap in care that occurs between visits. \u201cDigital Checkups\u201d use data-driven algorithms to generate clinical questions, patient education, reminders & alerts. The platform collects, manages and analyzes PGHD (Patient Generated Health Data), including biometric sensor data (i.e. wearables, glucometers). The patient-facing web application is secure, responsive and works on all devices.\n\nPGHD is filtered and entered into the EHR or population health management tool, triggering appropriate outreach and alerts for patients and providers. The Conversa Signal Control\u2122 dashboard displays patient responses for physicians and care coordinators to view. Key clinical metrics identify patients who are not on track with their medications, treatment plan or who are experiencing worsening or new symptoms. The platform uses cloud-based adaptive technology.\n\nThe capital will be used to expand Conversa\u2019s Digital Checkup service with leading distribution partners in care management, population health and customer relationship management.\n\n\u201cPatient relationship management is an exciting new category of health care solutions that addresses patient engagement and population health management,\u201d said West Shell III, Conversa\u2019s co-founder and CEO. \u201cWith this funding, the addition of Daniel Dean to our talented team and the formation of our Medical Advisory Board, we\u2019re on the way to leading the charge in this newly defined space.\u201d\n\nConversa\u2019s newly formed Medical Advisory Board, under the leadership of Chief Medical Officer Dr. Danny Sands, a practicing primary care physician at Beth Israel Deaconess, will create clinical content for the company\u2019s Digital Checkup platform. New advisory board members include Dr. Joseph P. Kannam, a cardiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess, and Dr. Lyle Mitzner, an endocrinology specialist at the Joslin Diabetes Center.
