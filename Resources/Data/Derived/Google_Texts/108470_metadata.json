And then, of course, the gym.\u201cThe gym was so much easier, because we learned from the lobby,\u201d explainedmember..For example, they learned to paint only at night, when it was cooler in the non-air-conditioned building and more parents were available to help. In all, about 75 adults helped complete the project, along with many high school volunteers...When I went to visit my alma mater last week to speak with Principaland some of the Hillside PTO members who spearheaded the effort, I was expecting to see the kind of paint job I would have done \u2014 not that bad looking, in a very dimly-lit room...But everything looked astonishingly professional. PTO Presidentsaid, in his charming Irish accent, \u201cWe wanted to do a proper job.\u201dStaff from Sherwin Williams came in to show them how to prep and clean the tile, and use bonding agents to make the paint stick properly...Sherwin Williams and Benjamin Moore/Queen City Paint donated thousands of dollars of paint for the projects.I have written about the very successful annual fundraising event the Hillside PTO has organized over the past three years...They have raised about $30,000 each year, and sunk most of the funds into technology. O\u2019Connell said this year the group wanted to invest in an aesthetic change that would be more visible to the students, faculty and parents, and make everyone feel good about the school...Principal McCafferty said teachers and students were blown away on their first days of school.\u201cThis has gone so far to make a stronger community,\u201d said McCafferty.The painting of the library was the first step in turning the room into a media center, with an inviting presentation area, a \u201cmakers space\u201d for students to collaborate on projects, and a seating area for students to use 30 new Chromebooks that were purchased by the PTO...\u201cI think the library will be visually exciting when it\u2019s finished,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cWe want it to be a place students want to be.\u201dThe PTO also purchased and installed two, 65-inch flat-screen televisions in the lobby and cafeteria that will be used to share information...A group of eighth graders \u2014 Aashaya Rajbhandari, Keegan Pepin, Katelyn Pepin, and Alexandra Topic \u2014 spent the summer preparing messages for the screen and learning how to use the software that displays them...\u201cIt was difficult at the beginning because we had to teach ourselves, but we got the hang of it,\u201d said Rajbhandari.The young women will spend their eighth-grade year posting information given to them by teachers, clubs, and teams...They will also be training younger students to take over when they graduate.As a three-year school, succession planning always has to be top-of-mind at Hillside.Many of the parents who have turned the school\u2019s PTO into a powerhouse will soon be moving on with their children...But, they have built a solid foundation for the next generation of Hillsiders, and I hope other parents around the city can see that they don\u2019t have to sit back and wait for someone else to make our schools great...A little time, and a lot of paint, can go a long way.The annual Religious Response to Hunger, a food drive organized by Temple Adath Yeshurun, is growing even larger, with the public invited to donate food to the cause next week...Organizer Judith Jolton said a truck will be parked outside City Hall to collect non-perishable food items on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.The food collected will be combined with food collected at, and at many other religious organizations and businesses around the city. The food will be delivered tosoup kitchen and food pantry on Thursday, Sept. 24...It\u2019s all about animals this weekend as fundraisers are being planned to support theand theOn Saturday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., the Manchester Animal Shelter on Dunbarton Road is hosting a giant yard sale to benefit the shelter...In addition to kitchen items, bikes, holiday items and pet supplies for sale, there will be a raffle, face painting for kids, and snacks and drinks for sale.Then head over to, for a, road race, and walk-a-thon to benefit the Animal Rescue Leage of NH...The event runs from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., and includes exhibitors, dog demonstrations, food and games.
