The year after a presidential election was certainly no letdown from a fact-checking perspective. In 2013, we uncovered falsehoods to fairy tales about immigration, gun control, the IRS, Benghazi and \u2014 no surprise here \u2014 the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s now legendary claim that \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan\u201d is actually an old whopper for us. But it smashed into reality this year as insurers canceled individual market plans.\n\nRepublicans claimed Congress was \u201cexempt\u201d from the health care law, when in fact lawmakers face an additional requirement that other Americans don\u2019t. A so-called \u201cspecial subsidy\u201d is nothing more than the standard employer contribution to premiums that the government has long made for its employees.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney falsely said the State Department had changed only one word of CIA talking points on the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nSen. David Vitter, among others, claimed the Senate immigration bill would cost taxpayers $6.3 trillion, citing a Heritage Foundation report. But the report wasn\u2019t on the bill itself, and it gave a 50-year cost estimate.\n\nThe IRS\u2019 Lois Lerner misled reporters about when she first learned of employees singling out conservative groups for scrutiny.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats made false claims about premium rates under the Affordable Care Act, while Rep. Michele Bachmann and Rep. Louie Gohmert gave bogus statements about how the law would \u201cliterally kill\u201d Americans or punish those earning $14,000 a year.\n\nThe National Rifle Association wrongly claimed that \u201c80% of police say background checks will have no effect\u201d on violent crime, and Democrats used an old, thin survey to claim 40 percent of guns were acquired without a background check.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. There were more falsehoods on guns, the health care law, the Sept. 11 hijackers, worker productivity and President Obama\u2019s court nominees. What follows is our compilation of the whoppers of the year, in no particular order.\n\nAnalysis\n\nFor more on each claim, follow the links to our original articles.\n\n\u2018If You Like Your Plan \u2026\u2019 Well, Not So Much\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s claim that \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan\u201d made a big splash this year. But a debunking of the president\u2019s years-old promise was old news to us. In fact, the claim is now a three-time whopper designee: It made our list of presidential campaign whoppers in 2012 and a 2010 list of health care whoppers. We said as far back as August 2009 that the president simply couldn\u2019t make this promise to everyone.\n\nThose stories were based on expert analysis of the impact of the law, and some common sense. The Congressional Budget Office has been estimating since 2009 that at least a few million workers wouldn\u2019t receive an offer of coverage through their employer due to the law, and clearly, Obama couldn\u2019t guarantee that employers wouldn\u2019t switch the plans they offered, whether the Affordable Care Act existed or not. Also, as we wrote in 2012 those who buy private coverage on their own \u201cmay have to get a new plan if theirs doesn\u2019t cover minimum benefit standards, which are yet to be determined. Plus, the insurance carriers offering these policies can change the plans without the policyholders\u2019 blessing.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, reality proved Obama\u2019s whopper wrong, as insurers canceled millions of individual market plans that didn\u2019t cover all the benefits the law required of those plans, and some employers did exactly what the CBO expected. The grocer Trader Joe\u2019s, for instance, sent its part-time employees to the exchanges, along with $500 each to help them get new insurance there.\n\nIn this business, it seems false claims never die, but perhaps this one finally has. Obama said he was \u201csorry\u201d for the whole affair in an interview with NBC News.\n\nReality Confronts Obama\u2019s False Promise, Oct. 29\n\nCongress Not \u2018Exempt,\u2019 No \u2018Special Subsidy\u2019\n\nSpeaking of immortal falsehoods, several Republicans, and a steady dose of viral emails, have claimed that members of Congress are \u201cexempt\u201d from the health care law. But no matter how this one is spun \u2014 and we\u2019ve seen several variations \u2014 it\u2019s not true. Lawmakers are required to have insurance, or pay a penalty, just like the vast majority of Americans. This \u201cexempt\u201d claim actually pertains to a special requirement for Congress and members\u2019 staffs: They have to get their insurance through the exchanges, and they\u2019re forbidden from continuing to get coverage through their employer, the federal government. That\u2019s thanks to a Republican amendment added to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhen the Office of Personnel Management ruled that Congress and staffers could continue to receive an employer contribution to their exchange plan premiums, some, including North Carolina Rep. Robert Pittenger and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, claimed Congress was getting a \u201cspecial subsidy.\u201d Huckabee said it was a \u201clittle break\u201d for Congress that \u201creally exempted them from some of the pain of Obamacare.\u201d But it\u2019s nothing more than the same level of premium contribution the government has long paid for employees\u2019 insurance, a contribution it also will continue to make for other federal workers.\n\nCongress and an Exemption from \u2018Obamacare\u2019? May 3\n\nNo \u2018Special Subsidy\u2019 for Congress, Aug. 30\n\nBenghazi Blunder\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney repeatedly, and wrongly, said that the White House and State Department had changed just one word of CIA-authored talking points on the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi. The talking points, used by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice on political talk shows, said the attack, which killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, started \u201cspontaneously\u201d as a protest. But that turned out to be false. The attack was premeditated and carried out by terrorists.\n\nCarney said the White House and State Department only changed the word \u201cconsulate\u201d to \u201cdiplomatic facility.\u201d But news reports from the Weekly Standard and ABC News, which published 12 drafts of the talking points, show that State Department comments prompted the CIA to make many alterations, including deleting references to CIA warnings of al Qaeda-linked threats and the possibility of the al Qaeda-linked Ansar al-Sharia being involved. We\u2019d note that Republicans asserted the changes amounted to an election-year cover-up, but there\u2019s no evidence of that. One thing that was not changed was the false claim that the attack was the result of a spontaneous protest. That was contained in the original draft, and survived into the final version.\n\nBenghazi Attack, Revisited, May 14\n\nHealth Care Hyperbole\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve seen some far-fetched claims about the Affordable Care Act over the years, and 2013 was no exception.\n\nIn a March floor speech, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann urged Congress to repeal Obamacare \u201cbefore it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens.\u201d That\u2019s an interesting claim, considering millions are expected to gain coverage under the law \u2014 25 million of the uninsured would gain insurance by 2016, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Some studies have shown that not having insurance leads to a higher risk of dying prematurely.\n\nTexas Rep. Louie Gohmert pushed the bogus bit that a \u201cpoor guy out there making $14,000\u2033 is \u201cgoing to pay extra income tax if he cannot afford to pay the several thousand dollars for an Obamacare policy.\u201d That \u201cpoor guy\u201d would be eligible for Medicaid or, in a state that isn\u2019t expanding Medicaid, like Texas, he would be eligible for heavily subsidized private insurance. And he can\u2019t be taxed or fined if he can\u2019t afford that private coverage or chooses not to buy it.\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul was wrong when he claimed \u201cyou will go to jail\u201d if you don\u2019t buy health insurance and refuse to pay the tax penalty. The law says that persons who do not pay the penalty \u201cshall not be subject to any criminal prosecution.\u201d In 2010, the IRS commissioner confirmed violators wouldn\u2019t face jail time. The IRS could dock future tax refunds to collect the penalty.\n\nOur sister site, FlackCheck.org, compiled a video on these whoppers and others on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBachmann\u2019s Killer Health Care Claims, March 22\n\nLouie Gohmert\u2019s Health Care Hooey, Aug. 14\n\nCruz-a-thon, Part II, Sept. 27\n\nA Whopper from the IRS\n\nA political firestorm erupted this year over IRS employees\u2019 extra scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Lois Lerner, director of the IRS\u2019 exempt organizations division, wrongly told reporters on May 10 that she first learned of employees targeting these groups in 2012 from media reports on conservative organizations that complained about delays. But a Treasury inspector general\u2019s report released four days later showed she knew about the flagging of conservative groups nearly a year earlier, and that she tried to correct it.\n\nLerner, the IG report said, was briefed in late June 2011 about employees singling out groups applying for 501(c)(4) status with \u201ctea party\u201d or \u201cpatriot\u201d descriptors. The status is for \u201csocial welfare\u201d organizations that can be involved in politics as long as it is not their \u201cprimary activity.\u201d Lerner raised concerns and \u201cinstructed that the criteria be immediately revised,\u201d the report said. She also learned in early 2012 that the IRS had sent the groups letters asking \u201cunnecessary\u201d questions \u2014 as determined by her office \u2014 such as the identity of donors. But when questioned by reporters just days before that report was released, Lerner said that \u201cwe started seeing information in the press that raised questions for us and we went back and took a look.\u201d Lerner retired from the IRS in September.\n\nIRS Officials Misled Congress, Public, May 21\n\nSlanted Price Tag on Immigration\n\nAfter a bipartisan group of senators \u2014 the so-called Gang of Eight \u2014 released immigration legislation that included a path to citizenship, the conservative Heritage Foundation, an opponent of the bill, countered with a report claiming the cost of such an overhaul would total $6.3 trillion. Republican Sens. David Vitter and Jeff Sessions used the study as ammunition to criticize the bill, with Vitter claiming that \u201c[a] $6.3 trillion price tag should completely disqualify the Gang of 8 proposal.\u201d But the study wasn\u2019t on this particular legislation \u2014 it was begun months before the bill was released \u2014 and the cost figure is over 50 years, a length of time that makes such projections highly speculative. Not to mention not as large as the figure seems: $6.3 trillion over half a century would be about 1 percent of government spending.\n\nThe $6.3 trillion figure also relied on a less optimistic estimate of offsetting economic benefits than the Congressional Budget Office did. The nonpartisan CBO later estimated that the Senate bill, which would provide a 13-year path to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally and increase border security funding, would reduce the deficit by $158 billion over 10 years, and by another $685 billion in the decade after that. Heritage\u2019s eye-popping $6.3 trillion figure also does not take into account the net cost \u2014 compared with the cost of doing nothing. The author of the report acknowledged the net cost would be $5.3 trillion, but he said \u201ca loophole in existing law\u201d could make the net cost \u201ctrillions\u201d less than that. The bill passed the Senate in late June; the House could take action on immigration legislation in 2014.\n\nThe Immigration Bill\u2019s \u2018$6.3 Trillion Price Tag,\u2019 June 4\n\n9/11 Hijackers and Student Visas\n\nOnly one of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers was in the U.S. on a student visa, despite claims to the contrary made by several lawmakers. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham, who helped draft the Senate immigration bill, and Chuck Grassley, who opposed it, both claimed at a Senate committee hearing that the hijackers were on student visas. Graham said \u201cthe 19 hijackers on 9/11 were all students here on visas\u201d that had expired. Then Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano even agreed with that assessment.\n\nBut they\u2019re all wrong. Eighteen of the 19 hijackers entered the U.S. on tourist or business visas, according to the 9/11 Commission Report.\n\n9/11 Hijackers and Student Visa, May 10\n\nBoth Sides Spin Gun Stats\n\nThe early months of 2013 were dominated by a debate on gun control, as politicians and advocates reacted to the December 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. Both sides of the debate used false and misleading statistics in an attempt to bolster their cases.\n\nIn online ads opposing Senate legislation to expand background checks, the National Rifle Association fabricated a statistic: that \u201c80% of police say background checks will have no effect\u201d on violent crime. The cited survey in question didn\u2019t say that. At all. The self-selected online poll didn\u2019t contain a single question asking whether \u201cbackground checks\u201d would impact \u201cviolent crime.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, adopted a favorite talking point based on thin evidence: As President Obama said in a Jan. 16 speech, \u201cas many as 40 percent of all gun purchases are conducted without a background check.\u201d That\u2019s based on a nearly 20-year-old survey of fewer than 300 people who were asked whether they thought guns they had acquired came from federally licensed dealers.\n\nVice President Joe Biden acknowledged the questionable nature of that statistic when he once used it, cautioning that \u201cwe can\u2019t say with absolute certainty what I\u2019m about to say is correct.\u201d Biden wasn\u2019t nearly as careful when he claimed that \u201cthere were fewer police being murdered \u2026 when the assault weapons ban, in fact, was in existence.\u201d FBI statistics on the killings of law enforcement officers don\u2019t support that. In fact, there\u2019s no discernible pattern before, during or after the assault weapons ban was in effect, from 1994 to 2004.\n\nNew York Democratic Rep. Charlie Rangel added his own false claim to the debate over a new ban on assault weapons. Rangel claimed there are \u201cmillions of kids dying, being shot down by assault weapons.\u201d Thankfully, that\u2019s not even close. Over a 30-year period, there were about 65,000 homicides with any firearm \u2014 not just \u201cassault weapons\u201d \u2014 among those 19 years old or younger. That\u2019s according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control database, which shows there were nearly 1 million violence-related firearm deaths (not only homicides) in the U.S. for all ages from 1981 to 2010.\n\nNRA Misrepresents Police Survey, Legislation, April 18\n\nGuns Acquired Without Background Checks, March 21\n\nBiden Wrong on Police Deaths, Jan. 30\n\nRangel\u2019s Assault Weapons Whopper, March 22\n\nAnd Both Sides Spin Insurance Premiums\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s impact on insurance premiums has been a hot topic, with Republicans and Democrats cherry-picking statistics and anecdotes, and giving false comparisons on rates going up or down. President Obama falsely said in August that all of the currently uninsured would be able to get coverage on the exchanges \u201cat a significantly cheaper rate than what they can get right now on the individual market\u201d even without federal tax credits. Not true. Experts have long predicted that some will pay more and some will pay less. Even Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said so.\n\nObama also said that the average premiums for the Illinois exchange were 25 percent lower than individual market rates. Not so. Illinois officials said rates were 25 percent lower than federal officials had predicted, not 25 percent lower than current rates.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz, meanwhile, greatly exaggerated when he said the Ohio Department of Insurance had announced that individual market premiums would increase by 88 percent because of the law. Instead, the department said estimated rates would be 41 percent higher on average in 2014, compared with 2013. That was in a press release that called for the law\u2019s repeal.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said many times, those buying their own insurance could see their premiums go up or down \u2014 or largely stay the same \u2014 due to any number of individual factors, including age, health status, where they live and whether they smoke. And what kind of insurance they had before. Exhibit A: The drastically different experiences of House Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Joaquin Castro in choosing plans on the exchange. Boehner, age 64, said his premiums will double. But Castro, age 39, said he will pay about half of what he is paying now.\n\nObama Overpromises on Premiums, Aug. 13\n\nSpinning Premium Rates, Sept. 27\n\nNot-So-Judicial Facts\n\nObama claimed that \u201cmy judicial nominees have waited three times longer to receive confirmation votes than those of my Republican predecessor.\u201d Wrong. In Obama\u2019s first term, he made out better than President George W. Bush with nominees to federal appeals courts. Obama\u2019s were confirmed more quickly on average than Bush\u2019s first-term nominees. Obama\u2019s federal trial courts nominees took an average of 42 percent longer than Bush\u2019s to confirm, but not \u201cthree times\u201d longer. Obama didn\u2019t say this, but he was talking about the time nominees waited for a vote after first being approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 not the total wait time.\n\nObama\u2019s Judicial Juggling, June 5\n\nWe\u2019re Not That Productive\n\nIn a commencement address, Vice President Biden falsely boasted that U.S. workers \u201care three times as productive as any worker in the world.\u201d We may work hard, but not that much harder than the rest of the globe. By the standard measure of productivity \u2014 gross domestic product per hour worked \u2014 Americans came in third, trailing Norway and Ireland, according to a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even using a different measure \u2014 GDP per employed person \u2014 the U.S. came in second, still behind the hard-working people of Norway.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s Productivity Piffle, May 15\n\nA note to our readers: This isn\u2019t an exhaustive list, and we likely missed some of your personal favorites.
