If you\u2019re living in an apartment, your neighbors will probably tell you about the building, its tenants, and the neighborhood. Chances are you\u2019ll even partake in the gossip, telling them about something you had fixed in your apartment or how playful another neighbor\u2019s dog is. Or, maybe you\u2019ll explain what the loud couple across the hallway argued about last night or how the people upstairs won\u2019t stop stomping on their floor. As a key component to human social connections, everyone gossips. But if you want to live longer, you\u2019ll have to gossip the right way.\n\nDone right, gossip can improve wellbeing and lengthen a person\u2019s life. But it has to be positive gossip; the friendly, \u201cover-the-garden\u201d fence kind, Dr. Robin Dunbar, a professor of evolutionary psychology at Oxford University, told The Daily Beast after speaking about two studies on gossip at the Cheltenham Science Festival this past weekend. \u201cThe most important thing that will prevent you from dying is the size of [your] social network,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has a bigger effect than anything, except giving up cigarettes. Your social network has a huge effect on happiness and wellbeing.\u201d\n\nOver-the-fence gossip, like telling a neighbor about another neighbor\u2019s new job, has been shown in studies to evoke self-reflection and inspire people to work harder for themselves. At the same time, these social connections trigger the release of feel good chemicals, such as endorphins, which can help relieve stress and strengthen the immune system. What\u2019s more, the bonds that develop between people who speak this positivity helps to diffuse future conflicts faster. In an apartment building, neighbors become friends \u2014 and likewise everywhere else, such as in the workplace.\n\nBoth Dunbar and Dr. Jennifer Cole, a senior lecturer in the Department of Manchester, spoke about these benefits at the science festival \u2014 Cole\u2019s own work has looked into the effects of gossip on self-esteem. Specifically, they spoke about two studies; one of them was a meta-analysis of 148 other studies looking into the outcomes of heart attack patients a year after their surgeries. That study found \u201cthe best predictor of good health was the quality of the social contact they had with others,\u201d Dunbar said. The other study, meanwhile, found mothers of toddlers were less likely to become sick if they kept up with friends and family.\n\n\u201cThe more they contacted friends and family, the less illness mother and child had,\u201d Dunbar said. \u201cThe question then becomes how to maintain and service your social networks, and the answer is by talking to people a lot.\u201d\n\nGossip, when it\u2019s being spread positively, can benefit people by helping us give up on our own interests \u201cto gain more in what is a collaborative exercise.\u201d The gossiper then becomes the center of these social networks, spreading information throughout. An example, members who spread news about other family members, such as engagements or illnesses, tend to be known as the \u201ckin-keepers,\u201d Dunbar told The Daily Beast.\n\nIt\u2019s when gossip causes conflict that its effects take a turn for the worse. \u201cPeople are not attracted to gossips in a negative sense,\u201d Dunbar said. \u201cGossiping provides a level of power, but it\u2019s very fragile. If you get the reputation of someone who gossips negatively, you become someone who cannot be trusted to tell things.\u201d Ultimately, this can end with the gossiper being excluded from the social circle \u2014 and thus all the positive effects of gossiping are reversed.\n\nKnowing what others don\u2019t, and spreading that information can certainly have a positive effect, Dunbar said. But \u201cif pushed too far, the reputation of the gossiper can be in danger.\u201d He suggested gossipers \u201caim to balance, reinforce, and service, like you service your car. Pass on delicious tidbits, but don\u2019t overdo it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "gossipping, strengthens, social, networks, and, lengthens, lives, only, when, its, done, right", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People who spread the right information through gossip benefit from it.", "title": "Gossiping (The Right Way) Can Help You Live Longer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/gossipping-strengthens-social-networks-and-lengthens-lives-only-when-its-done-right-337366", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/09/gossip.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People who spread the right information through gossip benefit from it.", "title": "Gossiping (The Right Way) Can Help You Live Longer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/gossipping-strengthens-social-networks-and-lengthens-lives-only-when-its-done-right-337366", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/09/gossip.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/09/gossip.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-09T18:21:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-09T18:23:57-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People who spread the right information through gossip benefit from it."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1072\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe most important thing that will prevent you from dying is the size of [your] social network,\u201d he said.\nBut if you want to live longer, you\u2019ll have to gossip the right way.\nThat study found \u201cthe best predictor of good health was the quality of the social contact they had with others,\u201d Dunbar said.\nKnowing what others don\u2019t, and spreading that information can certainly have a positive effect, Dunbar said.\nAs a key component to human social connections, everyone gossips."}
