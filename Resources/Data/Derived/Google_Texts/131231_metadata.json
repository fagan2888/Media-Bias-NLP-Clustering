Born in Jackson, she moved through the city\u2019s school system, graduating high school and then Jackson State University. Now in her mid-30s, she has lived in the city her entire life. Williams admits, though, she may not be familiar with all of the Magnolia State\u2019s small towns -- their heroes and heroines.\n\n\n\nLaughing, she faintly recalled Duck Hill, a one square mile spit of land in Montgomery County in the northeast quadrant of the Magnolia State. But she well knows the legacy of the county\u2019s Fannie Lou Hamer, the civil rights activist who was born there. \u201cFannie Lou Hamer\u2019s famous quote was \u2018sick and tired of being sick and tired,\u2019\u201d Williams said, \u201clike me, sick and tired of being sick.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of hopping around here all the time,\u201d Williams explained, referring to the chronic pain in her right leg and the cane she uses for assistance. \u201cI\u2019m tired of dealing with this pain. I\u2019m tired of being irritable. I\u2019m tired of taking all these medicines that make me dizzy. I\u2019m tired of being sluggish.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe pain permeates her daily life, compounding her struggle as a single mom to raise Jasmine, her 15-year-old daughter; making sure that the needs of her aging parents are met; and working a full-time job while finding time to study so she can a get her master\u2019s degree from Strayer University so she can \u201cbetter myself.\u201d Williams is hopeful that October 1 will be a game changer. She\u2019ll be able to sign on to the state\u2019s insurance exchange to compare plans and benefits, and after getting answers about rates, deductibles, and co-pays, decide which is best for her.\n\n\n\n\u201cI may be happy one day, and I may look like I\u2019m happy, but I\u2019m stressing every day,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe cost of insurance is so outrageous here, especially with the pre-existing condition that I have, I can\u2019t afford it; it\u2019s been very stressful.\u201d Should all go well, because insurance companies will no longer be able to use pre-existing conditions to exclude consumers, the policy she selects next month will kick in beginning January, 2014.\n\n\n\nSome states have opted to build their own exchange but Mississippi is one of 19 states that have chosen to consign implementation of their exchanges to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\n\nThough the Supreme Court ruled the ACA legal, it also held that expanding Medicaid was subject to each state\u2019s approval. The Mississippi legislature\u2019s and its governor\u2019s antipathy toward the ACA was on display this past legislative session in their decision not to raise the ceiling of the state\u2019s Medicaid guidelines. An estimated additional 300,000 residents could have been brought under coverage. One side effect of the political battles is a public often left confused as to which parts of the ACA are in force, particularly when the Obama administration itself has delayed implementation of some aspects of the law.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult when people live in a state where there is a daily declaration \u2013 we will not participate in the law \u2013 for them to figure out whether or not whether there are any benefits they will have a right to access,\u201d said DHHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a recent forum.\n\n\n\nCalculations vary on how many adults have pre-existing conditions. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that as many as 49 percent of adults under age 65 fall into that category, with 25 percent of those reporting they have been denied coverage in the past. Still, as Sebelius contends, confusion reigns. Many adults who will be eligible for insurance on October 1 may still end up not applying and some parents who have children with pre-existing conditions may have yet to realize their children have been eligible, under the ACA, since 2010.\n\n\n\nWilliams said her daughter Jasmine is in good health and is up to date on checkups. \u201cShe\u2019s under the CHIP program and that helps me out a lot,\u201d Williams said of the financial assistance from Mississippi\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. \u201cShe\u2019s a real good girl,\u201d though Williams added, after citing typical parental complaints about Jasmine\u2019s occasional petulant teenage ways, \u201cshe knows when not to bother me.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen Williams is in pain, dark mood swings sometime set in. The pain or the effects of the medicine become too much for her to manage. Her physical limitation adds to her frustration of not being able to fully participate with Jasmine in activities when those opportunities arise. \u201cI can\u2019t do the stuff I want the majority of the time. I can only walk so far.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer condition also brings other challenges. She is concerned about having to explain to a potential employer about why she might have tested positive on a drug test. She\u2019s worried about being able to fight through the fog of medication to be mentally alert enough to complete her master\u2019s in good standing. And, right now after 10 years, the cause of her pain is still undiagnosed.\n\n\n\nFibromyalgia, sciatica and a few other possibilities have been ruled out, but without an insurance plan, Williams can\u2019t afford any more medical tests. As an independent contractor on her current job, she is offered no insurance. Williams pays for her doctor\u2019s pain management regimen and the prescribed drugs from her own pocket. Her current physician, as a favor, gives a discount for her office visits.\n\n\n\nChronic pain patients face a higher level of scrutiny from insurers and the medical community than those with many other disease states. \u201cThey are an insurance company\u2019s nightmare,\u201d said one health policy analyst speaking off the record, referring to the cost of treatments that never seem to end. And a physician added that he has had \u201cpatients who tried to the game the system by claiming chronic pain in order gain access to the opiates or narcotics used for treatment.\u201d Williams, in fact, fears becoming addicted. \u201cIt scares me taking all this medicine.\u201d\n\n\n\nUntil now, she has been told by insurance companies \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield, United Health Care and Humana, one of the companies participating in the Mississippi exchange \u2013 that she cannot be insured if she\u2019s on a pain management program or that she would have to cease taking her prescribed medications for 12 months before she could qualify. That\u2019s a catch-22 she said she couldn\u2019t live with. \u201cI\u2019m in too much pain to do that,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\n\nSeveral observers, including a spokesperson from Mississippi Insurance Commissioner\u2019s office, said, come October 1, Williams will be vetted as to the type of policy for which she qualifies by the same initial criteria as other applicants: age, family size, geography, and tobacco use. She may be assigned to a higher risk pool; she certainly will have to pay and her income will be a factor as well, though she may qualify for a subsidy.\n\n\n\nStill, Williams is determined to find a way to use the ACA to forge a new, pain-free life for herself and Jasmine. She has a dollar figure in mind she thinks she can afford, but even if it\u2019s a little higher \u201cat this point I\u2019ll take it. I just want to make sure it covers my pain management,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m excited. I can\u2019t wait for October 1.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "obamacare, health care, aca, enactment, mississippi, health insurance", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
