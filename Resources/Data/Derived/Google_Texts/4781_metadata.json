From its performances to its cinematography and music direction, Steve McQueen\u2019s story of Solomon Northup\u2014and his journey through the antebellum South\u2014is a tremendous accomplishment. By any measure, it deserves its award.\n\nUnless, that is, you\u2019re a little critic named Rush Limbaugh. Then, the success of the film is just further evidence for your resentment and paranoia. To wit, here\u2019s what he had to say about it on his radio show: \u201cIf it was the only thing that movie won, it was gonna win Best Picture. There was no way. It didn\u2019t matter if it was good or bad. I haven\u2019t seen it. It was going to win. It had the magic word in the title, \u2018slave.\u2019\u201d\n\nLimbaugh believes 12 Years won because of the power of liberal guilt. But if there\u2019s anything to take away from Hollywood\u2019s history with race, it\u2019s that the industry is far more likely to award films that highlight liberal virtue. As Adam Serwer notes for MSNBC, \u201cThe film industry is a place where the stories of people of color are still rarely told through narratives they themselves create.\u201d Indeed, if 12 Years had fit the mold of films like The Help, Crash, and Driving Ms. Daisy\u2014that is, if it were about the redemption of a sympathetic white protaganist\u2014then Limbaugh would have a point.\n\nLimbaugh, it should be said, isn\u2019t alone. His resentment is echoed by a small group of right-wing writers who see white guilt as one reason for the film\u2019s success. There was Breitbart\u2019s Christian Toto who, before the Oscars, wondered if white guilt weren\u2019t a key part of the film\u2019s campaign for Best Picture. Likewise, on Monday, Debbie Schlussel disparaged the event as \u201cPC\u201d and complained that 12 Years fit the \u201cusual Hollywood victimization narratives.\u201d For her, the film represents \u201cthe never-ending cries of racism that justify Obamaphones, Obamacare, welfare, minority set-asides, affirmative action, and every other form of reparations now plaguing America.\u201d \u201cRace merchantry,\u201d she asserts, \u201clives on at Oscar.\u201d\n\nOf all of these, my favorite complaint comes from James Bowman of theAmerican Spectator who attacks Steve McQueen\u2014the director\u2014as an anti-slavery propagandist, as if this were a bad thing:\n\n\u201cIf ever in slavery\u2019s 250-year history in North America there were a kind master or a contented slave, as in the nature of things there must have been, here and there, we may be sure that Mr McQueen does not want us to hear about it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201403041840, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "Steve McQueen's acclaimed film is the new target of right-wingers who hate \"white guilt\" and love racial resentment.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Right-Wing Backlash to '12 Years a Slave'", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Right-Wing Backlash to \\\\u002712 Years a Slave\\\\u0027\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/04/the-right-wing-backlash-to-12-years-a-slave.html\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/04/the-right-wing-backlash-to-12-years-a-slave\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-04T18:40:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "tags": "u_s_politics0", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-04T18:40:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/04/the-right-wing-backlash-to-12-years-a-slave", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Steve McQueen's acclaimed film is the new target of right-wingers who hate \"white guilt\" and love racial resentment.", "title": "The Right-Wing Backlash to '12 Years a Slave'", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/04/the-right-wing-backlash-to-12-years-a-slave.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/etc/clientlibs/dailybeast/img/logo/tdb_shareicon-16x9.jpg.dimg.jpg/67dd826.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9722\"", "article_summary": "If \u201cBest Picture\u201d is supposed to award the film that excels in all categories, then 12 Years a Slave was a worthy choice.\nHis resentment is echoed by a small group of right-wing writers who see white guilt as one reason for the film\u2019s success.\nIt had the magic word in the title, \u2018slave.\u2019\u201dLimbaugh believes 12 Years won because of the power of liberal guilt.\nThere was Breitbart\u2019s Christian Toto who, before the Oscars, wondered if white guilt weren\u2019t a key part of the film\u2019s campaign for Best Picture.\nSteve McQueen's acclaimed film is the new target of right-wingers who hate \"white guilt\" and love racial resentment."}
