John McCain was playing poker on his iPhone.\n\nThe Arizona Republican, who has pushed hard for the United States to take military action, appeared more interested in making straights than listening to Secretary of State Kerry make the case for punishing Syrian despot Bashar Assad.\n\nThis screengrab shows the Washington Post LiveBlog during the Senate hearing on Tuesday, when a photographer caught Sen. John McCain red-handed playing poker on his smartphone. Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for armchair isolationism,\u201d an impassioned Kerry told the committee Tuesday. \u201cThis is not the time to be spectators to a slaughter . . . We have spoken up against unspeakable horror. Now we must stand up and act.\u201d\n\nBut Kerry\u2019s strong words may have been lost on McCain, who was so engrossed in his game he failed to notice the Washington Post photographer who caught him in the act.\n\nSen. John McCain acknowledges playing a game on his phone during a Senate hearing Sept. 3. @SenJohnMcCain via Twitter)\n\nThat may also explain why McCain, a Vietnam War hero and one of the most respected members of the committee, barely questioned Kerry when it was his turn to grill the committee\u2019s main witness. Perhaps he was more focused on five-card stud than Syria\u2019s stash of Scud missiles.\n\nMcCain, when alerted that his poker playing had gone viral, tried to joke it off.\n\nAs the U.S. moves closer to launching a limited attack on Syria, each side is likely counting their bullets. (New York Daily News; AP Photos)\n\n\u201cScandal!\u201d he tweeted. \u201cCaught playing iPhone game at 3+ hour Senate hearing \u2014 worst of all I lost!\u201d\n\nLater, McCain made another cringeworthy admission, saying \u201cthat as much as I like to listen in rapt attention, occasionally I get a wee bit bored.\u201d\n\nThe Arrow 3 may serve a critical purpose if Syria intends to retaliate after a probable U.S. strike. (New York Daily News; Photo by Israeli Aerospace Industries/EPA)\n\nMcCain, the GOP\u2019s presidential candidate in 2008, then repeated his earlier joke, saying \u201cthe worst thing is I lost thousands of dollars,\u201d albeit fake dollars.\n\nMcCain\u2019s off-hand remarks came after a three-hour hearing in which Senate colleagues like Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, said the decision to attack Syria \u201cwill be one of the most difficult any of us will be asked to make,\u201d adding: \u201cIt is a moment for a profile in courage and to do what one knows is right.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama talks with bipartisan congressional leaders in the Cabinet Room at the White House on Tuesday. Obama said there\u2019d be no \u2018boots on the ground.\u2019 (LARRY DOWNING/REUTERS)\n\n\u201cI know that everybody is going to be taking that decision very, very seriously,\u201d said Sen. Robert Corker (R-Tenn.).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Corker and Menendez hammered out a draft resolution that would authorize Obama to use military force against the Assad regime but with strict caveats. The proposal would prohibit American boots on the ground in Syria and limit military action to 60 days. The full Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to approve the resolution Wednesday following a closed-door meeting to hear classified intelligence on the Assad regime\u2019s alleged use of chemical weapons.\n\nAn Arrow missile is launched at an undisclosed location in Israel. Israel and the U.S. conducted a joint missile test over the Mediterranean on Tuesday that was said to be unrelated to Syria. (Israel Aircraft Industries/AP)\n\nTwo new polls were released Tuesday showing that Obama has his work cut out to sell the American people on attacking Assad for gassing his own people.\n\nObama says Assad is responsible for killing 1,400 people, including more than 400 children, in the deadliest chemical weapons attack in the world in 25 years.\n\nSecretary of State Kerry (left) and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel put their heads together at Senate hearing on probable Syria attack.

(JOSHUA ROBERTS/REUTERS)\n\nObama tried to reassure war-weary Americans that any action on Syria \u201cdoes not involve boots on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not Iraq, and this is not Afghanistan,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThis is a limited, proportional step that will send a clear message not only to the Assad regime but also to other countries that may be interested in testing some of these international norms that there are consequences.\u201d\n\nSyrian Ministers attend a cabinet meeting on Tuesday in Damascus. More than 1,400 people died in an apparent gas attack on Aug. 21 on the outskirts of Damascus. (SANA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDuring a Senate hearing interrupted several times by anti-war protesters, Kerry told lawmakers to ignore the polls. \u201cPresident Obama is not asking America to go to war,\u201d he said, but is seeking \u201cauthorization to degrade and deter Assad\u2019s ability to use chemical weapons.\u201d\n\nWhile there were some pointed questions from skeptical senators, even strident opponents like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) conceded that Obama would likely get the green light from lawmakers. \u201cYou\u2019re probably going to win,\u201d Paul said.\n\nPresident Obama has been gaining support top congressional leaders, including Speaker John Boehner. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nObama also got a nod of approval from Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state, who had not weighed in until Tuesday. \u201cSecretary Clinton supports the President\u2019s effort to enlist the Congress in pursuing a strong and targeted response to the Assad regime\u2019s horrific use of chemical weapons,\u201d a Clinton aide told Politico.\n\nEarlier, Obama won the backing of House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, two Republican leaders who have opposed the President on everything from Obamacare to gun control.\n\nFree Syrian Army fighters in Aleppo investigate a bombed-out building Tuesday. (Hamid Khatib/REUTERS)\n\nBut the New York delegation is not marching in lockstep with the President.\n\nWhile Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Pete King (R-L.I.) are ready to authorize military action, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has not made up her mind, and Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) is opposed.\n\nObama made his pitch as the U.S. and Israel gave the Syrians something to ponder by conducting a joint missile test over the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nNeither the Pentagon nor Jerusalem gave any warning that it would be testing the Arrow 3.\n\nUzi Rubin, former head of the Arrow system, said the test was \u201ccompletely technical. Nothing connected to Syria.\u201d\n\nWith James Warren and News Wire Services\n\ncsiemaszko@nydailynews.com\n\nOn a mobile device?
