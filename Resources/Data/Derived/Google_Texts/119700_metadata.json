Wade ruling\u2014which many of them view as legalizing abortion on demand across the nation.\n\nBundled in mittens and scarves, children, teenagers and adults united under clusters of yellow balloons displaying a single word: life.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to celebrate life,\u201d Smith, director of St. Michael\u2019s Woodshop, told The Daily Signal. \u201cIt\u2019s an 8- or 9-hour trip, but we wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. It\u2019s a great opportunity to teach our students the meaning of life and how to celebrate it.\u201d\n\nA woman named Mary, who identified herself as a member of the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Connecticut, said she felt compelled to attend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because I believe it isn\u2019t enough to say that I believe in something, and then sit on my armchair at home,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to stand up.\u201d\n\nIn a similar vein, Patrick Kelly, chairman of the March for Life, told the crowd at one point:\n\nEach of you has a key role to play today. We must stand up for truth, the truth that to be pro-life is to be pro-woman.\n\nThe 2016 theme for the March for Life, \u201cPro-Life Is Pro-Woman,\u201d also was reflected in the comments of Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, former Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk, and Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., among others.\n\n\u201cSome say there is a war on women,\u201d Ernst said, addressing the crowd. \u201cI reject that. I am a woman. I have been to war. This is no war on women.\u201d\n\nRather, the Army National Guard veteran said, \u201cTo be pro-life is to have deep respect for life, and for women\u2019s unique ability to bring it into the world.\u201d\n\nJewels Green, a former abortion worker who had an abortion at 17 and now is part of the pro-life Silent No More Awareness Campaign, had her own story. Green told the crowd:\n\nWhen I was a pregnant teen, there was no one. No one was pro-life. No one supported my choice to parent. I was alone, so I surrendered. \u2026 I tried to believe what everyone was insisting\u2014that it was no big deal, that I should just get over it. But I missed my baby.\n\nBirk, a Super Bowl champion with the Ravens, joked: \u201cI\u2019m a football player so I have to keep things simple.\u201d He added:\n\nI march because I\u2019ve never heard a woman give birth to a baby and say, \u2018I wish I\u2019d had an abortion.\u2019 I\u2019ve never heard a woman say, \u2018I wish I had fewer kids,\u2019 and I\u2019ve never heard a worker at a life clinic say that they wished they worked in an abortion clinic.\n\n\u201cTo see a baby born is a miracle, pure joy,\u201d Birk added. \u201cIn this world, don\u2019t we need more miracles, more joy, and more love?\u201d\n\nSmith said he hopes to see more miracles realized with the help of more pro-life legislation. The New Jersey Republican encouraged the crowd to look forward to this week\u2019s potential congressional override of President Barack Obama\u2019s veto of a measure defunding Planned Parenthood for a year.\n\nObama, in a formal statement released Friday by the White House, said the Roe v. Wade ruling \u201caffirmed a woman\u2019s freedom to make her own choices about her body and her health.\u201d\n\nThe president also promised that his administration will \u201credouble\u201d its commitment to \u201cprotecting a woman\u2019s access to safe, affordable health care and her right to reproductive freedom.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bundled in mittens and scarves, students and adults united under clusters of yellow balloons displaying a single word: life.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Bundled in mittens and scarves, students and adults united under clusters of yellow balloons displaying a single word: life.", "title": "'Celebrate Life': March for Life Strikes Pro-Woman Theme", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/1601122_MarchLife_Mork.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-25T15:29:35+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1nGqEOy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Bundled in mittens and scarves, students and adults united under clusters of yellow balloons displaying a single word: life.", "title": "'Celebrate Life': March for Life Strikes Pro-Woman Theme", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/1601122_MarchLife_Mork.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2016-01-25T15:03:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-25T15:29:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "March for Life, Matt Birk, Roe v.
