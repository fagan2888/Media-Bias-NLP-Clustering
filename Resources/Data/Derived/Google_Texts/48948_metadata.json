Matt Stone, The Courier-Journal\n\nBuy Photo Matt Bevin (Photo: CJ file photo)Buy Photo\n\nKentuckians should have a clearer picture about where their state is headed this Tuesday night.\n\nThat\u2019s the day that the filing deadline for Republicans and Democrats seeking office in 2016 passes, and it\u2019s also the day that Gov. Matt Bevin will deliver his first budget address \u2013 the most important speech of his political career.\n\nWith the filing deadline, we\u2019ll learn a little bit about the quality of candidates as the Republicans try to take control of the Kentucky House of Representatives for the first time since 1921.\n\nWe\u2019ll see if there are any districts where Democratic incumbents have decided not to seek another term \u2013 a key fact that could make the GOP\u2019s job much easier.\n\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK\n\nAnd we\u2019ll also learn about any Democratic challenger to Sen. Rand Paul. After others, including former Auditor Adam Edelen and Louisville lawyer Andrew Horne, have taken passes on the race, it appears that the most likely to jump into the fray is Lexington\u2019s mayor, Jim Gray, who made a fortune running his family\u2019s construction business.\n\nIf that comes to pass, we\u2019ll learn if Kentucky\u2019s voters are as progressive as those in Lexington who chose Gray as their mayor in 2010 knowing that he is gay.\n\nAnd while that electoral stuff is important, clearly the biggest thing will be Bevin\u2019s budget address in which he\u2019ll lay out his spending priorities for the next two years \u2013 and more clearly define his thinking about the role of government.\n\nDemocrats are hopeful that he follows the model of Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, who was about as popular as a pet skunk last fall when a couple of pollsters found that only between 18 and 26 percent of Jayhawks approved of the job he is doing.\n\nThink about that. In a red state like Kansas \u2013 which brought us people like Bob Dole, Alf Landon and Dwight Eisenhower - President Barack Obama is more popular than its Republican Governor.\n\nBrownback accomplished that amazing feat by pushing through a tax cut while slashing government programs. He cut education programs as well as the state\u2019s road fund \u2013 which in turn forced some local communities to raise taxes to pay for services that Kansas would no longer fund.\n\nHe slashed healthcare for children and people with low incomes, reduced funding for veterans affairs, delayed the implementation of a computer system that would have helped state workers determine who was eligible for family services. He instituted education cuts as well as tourism cuts.\n\nHe did away with the Kansas Arts Commission and laid off its staff and caused the state to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal grants \u2013 before public uproar forced him to create a new arts agency and restore some funding.\n\nThe social media rumor mill in Kentucky cranked up last week with allegations that Bevin plans to zero-out funding for the Kentucky Arts Council.\n\nThe Council provides grants for artistic endeavors across Kentucky. It funds gems like the Paramount Arts Center in Ashland, the Mountain Arts Center in Prestonsburg, Appalshop in Whitesburg and the Carson Center in Paducah.\n\nIt funds public school arts programs and helps artists to pursue their crafts.\n\nCloser to home, it gives grants to the Louisville Orchestra, the Louisville Ballet, the Kentucky Opera Association, the Speed Museum, the StageOne Family Theatre and Actors Theatre of Louisville, among others.\n\nThe Bevin administration has refused to comment on the cuts, which leads one to believe there is, at least, a sliver of truth to it.\n\nIf the rest of the cuts are as painful, Democrats may have found the issues on which to run their 2016 campaigns.\n\nMORE NEWS AND COMMENTARY ABOUT GOV.
