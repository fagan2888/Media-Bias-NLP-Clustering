Federal officials extended the original Feb. 15 deadline to enroll in an Obamacare health plan for some consumers in Illinois and other states who experienced technical problems enrolling last weekend.\n\nGet Covered Illinois originally won $115 million in funding through the Affordable Care Act in 2013. It applied and won an additional $10 million in December through the health law, but funding to keep operating in the future will have to come from other sources.\n\nKoehler has been in the government sector for 16 years, she said.\n\n\"I do love public service,\" she said. \"I assume at some point I'll come back to it.\"\n\nThe announcement comes after the Department of Health and Human Services Wednesday released much higher health insurance enrollment figures for the state compared with last year.\n\nMore than 347,000 Illinoisans signed up for coverage in 2015, compared with 217,000 for 2014 coverage.\n\n\"I set the marketplace up starting in January of 2013 and led them through two successful open enrollments,\" Koehler said. \"It's good to leave on a high note. I'm really pleased with the numbers. I'm really pleased with the number of people we've been able to help.\"\n\nehirst@tribpub.com\n\nTwitter @ellenjeanhirst", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Get Covered Illinois director resigns: 'It's good to leave on a high note'", "date": "2015-02-19", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Jennifer Koehler, the head of Get Covered Illinois \u2014 the state's enrollment arm for the Affordable Care Act \u2014 has resigned.", "title": "Get Covered Illinois director resigns: 'It's good to leave on a high note'", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-obamacare-state-official-0219-biz-20150218-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54e60acb/turbine/ct-obamacare-state-official-0219-biz-20150218", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp07.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/82857877", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "Get Covered Illinois, Jennifer Koehler, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare", "news_keywords": "Get Covered Illinois, Jennifer Koehler, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Jennifer Koehler, the head of Get Covered Illinois, the state's enrollment arm for the Affordable Care Act, has resigned."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5b5\"", "article_summary": "Jennifer Koehler, the head of Get Covered Illinois \u2014 the state's enrollment arm for the Affordable Care Act \u2014 has resigned.\nGet Covered Illinois originally won $115 million in funding through the Affordable Care Act in 2013.\nKoehler said she will continue to volunteer her services to Get Covered Illinois, a federally funded program run out of the governor's office, through Sunday.\nI'm really pleased with the number of people we've been able to help.\"\nI'm really pleased with the numbers."}
