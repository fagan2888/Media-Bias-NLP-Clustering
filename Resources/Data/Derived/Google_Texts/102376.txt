Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) says she is ecstatic that a bipartisan majority of the House voted on Thursday for her provision to restrict transfers of detainees from the Guantánamo Bay detention center in Cuba.

Walorski's measure was included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that was approved by the House on Friday in a vote of 269-151. While only nine Democrats crossed the aisle to vote with 234 Republicans for the Guantánamo amendment, Walorski said she considers that tally a victory.

"That bipartisan vote on the floor last night sends a clear message I think, not only to the president, but to all the people around him who are advising him that the American people have made up their mind," Walorski said in an on-camera interview with The Hill's Molly K. Hooper.

Even thought President Obama vowed to veto the NDAA over her amendment, the Indiana Republican — a member of the Armed Services Committee — is focused on keeping the provision in the final defense bill that Congress sends to the White House.

"I'm going to work hard to be at the table to make sure [it is in the final product]”, Walorski said.
