The analysis uncovers a shift toward a more versatile set of skills than were required for these types of positions in the past, specifically those in technical communication and information technology fluency.\n\nThe 12 page report is available from College for America at: www.collegeforamerica.org/healthcarejobsreport.\n\nAbout College for America's Workforce Strategy reports: College for America at Southern New Hampshire University is an innovative college degree program designed to solve the growing workforce skills gap plaguing American employers by pioneering a radically affordable and accessible college degree program designed specifically for adult, working students. Established in 2012 with support from an EDUCAUSE Next Generation Learning Challenge grant funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the national non-profit school developed the first \"competency-based\" degree to be approved by the United States Department of Education for federal student financial aid. The new program \u2013 available to students only through their employers \u2013 is already in place with many employers across the country, including Anthem Blue Cross, ConAgra, McDonald's, Delta Dental, and FedEx.\n\nThis research report is the work of Julian L. Alssid and Melissa Goldberg, who lead the school's workforce strategy team in matching curriculum developments with employer's workforce skill needs. Alssid and Goldberg previously managed the nonprofit Workforce Strategy Center, which merged with College for America earlier this year.\n\nSOURCE College for America at Southern New Hampshire University", "article_metadata": {"contentUrl": "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prn/20131119/CL20151LOGO-b", "geo.region": "new hampshire", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "MANCHESTER, N.H., Nov. 19", "description": "MANCHESTER, N.H., Nov. 19, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- New Report: Frontline & Nonclinical Healthcare Jobs Growing in Number and Complexity.
