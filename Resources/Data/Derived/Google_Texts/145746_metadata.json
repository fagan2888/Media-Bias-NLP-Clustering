The American College of Surgeons in collaboration with the Task Force for Children\u2019s Surgical Care released its updated standards for 2016, Optimal Resources for Children\u2019s Surgical Care to do just that. The document is central to providing improved surgical care and customized attention children patients need. And with more than five million infants and children to undergo a surgical procedure in the U.S. annually, according to the same report, developing adequate surgical standards for children is a crucial goal.\n\n\u201cThe vision is to see that every child receiving surgical care receives quality care in an environment with resources matched to his or her individualized needs,\u201d said Keith Oldham, M.D., chair of the Children\u2019s Surgery Verification Program, in a press release.\n\nThe new document is revised from 2014, and includes knowledge gained from the pilot phase of the ACS' new verification program that launched in April 2015. This includes a need for alternative training pathways for anesthesiology, emergency medicine and radiology. Also noted are the safety data elements required for all level designations.\n\nFor those hospitals looking to receive designation through the Children\u2019s Surgery Verification Quality Improvement Program, a pre-review questionnaire application is expected to launch online later in the year. Designation will require the American College of Surgeons to periodically visit centers and ensure relevant standards are being met and quality improvement mechanisms in place.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As new technology dominates the headlines in the personalization of health care, allocating hospital resources and providing hospital standards are also an important part of moving health care into the future. \u00a0 The American College of Surgeons in collaboration with the Task Force for Children\u2019s Surgical Care released its updated standards for 2016, Optimal Resources for Children\u2019s Surgical Care to do just that.\u00a0 As the country\u2019s first and only multispecialty standards for children\u2019s surgical care, this document is central to providing improved surgical care and . . .", "csrf-token": "+lhDmDhSOECQv1s2yoCjawjgNlrRGAhI8Kw+yL8Bz7I=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/Operations7_190x127.jpg?1448315758", "description": "American College of Surgeons program takes a multispecialty approach.", "card": "summary", "title": "New Standards Seek to Improve Children's Surgical Care"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/Operations7_190x127.jpg?1448315758", "type": "Article", "description": "American College of Surgeons program takes a multispecialty approach.", "title": "New Standards Seek to Improve Children's Surgical Care"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "children's health,surgery,pediatric,American College of Surgeons,standards", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The American College of Surgeons in collaboration with the Task Force for Children\u2019s Surgical Care released its updated standards for 2016, Optimal Resources for Children\u2019s Surgical Care to do just that.\nThe document is central to providing improved surgical care and customized attention children patients need.\nAnd with more than five million infants and children to undergo a surgical procedure in the U.S. annually, according to the same report, developing adequate surgical standards for children is a crucial goal.\nFor those hospitals looking to receive designation through the Children\u2019s Surgery Verification Quality Improvement Program, a pre-review questionnaire application is expected to launch online later in the year.\n\u201cThe vision is to see that every child receiving surgical care receives quality care in an environment with resources matched to his or her individualized needs,\u201d said Keith Oldham, M.D., chair of the Children\u2019s Surgery Verification Program, in a press release."}
