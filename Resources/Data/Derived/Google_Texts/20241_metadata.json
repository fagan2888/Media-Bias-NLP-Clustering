This week, the U.S. Senate will take up legislation addressing the Supreme Court\u2019s male-majority decision in the Hobby Lobby case, which reflects pretty much the same belief about women.\n\nThe five male justices who sided with Hobby Lobby basically said that a boss\u2019s opinion about birth control overrides our own, and women are incapable of independent moral judgment. The Protect Women\u2019s Health from Corporate Interference Act, sponsored by Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Mark Udall, D-Colo., reverses that and says that for-profit corporations like Hobby Lobby can\u2019t limit any legal health care service for religious reasons.\n\nBut the problem these companies and institutions have isn\u2019t with the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s that women get to use birth control all, and thus have sex on their own terms, have control over their own bodies, and determine their own economic future by deciding when, or if, they want to have children.\n\n\n\n[MORE: Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nAs legal expert Dahlia Lithwick has pointed out, at the core of Hobby Lobby and McCullen (another case involving \u201cbuffer zones\u201d around abortion clinics) is the increasing infantilizing of American women by the right wing.\n\nAs Lithwick puts it, \u201cWhat is missing from the Hobby Lobby decision altogether \u2026 is the very notion of the woman herself as moral circuit breaker, as an agent of her own ethical choices and preferences, whose decision to obtain an IUD, or a condom, or a morning-after pill is a fully autonomous moral choice that supplants the spiritual choices of her employer. Again, it\u2019s almost impossible to escape the conclusion that Hobby Lobby (and) McCullen \u2026rest on the idea that women are in effect children.. and that their choices are to be second-guessed and gently redirected.\u201d\n\nThanks to the majority opinion, every woman in the country just got mansplained by Alito, Scalia, Roberts, Thomas and Kennedy. Even more infuriating, Alito admits that Hobby Lobby\u2019s facts about contraception, as has been pointed out by no less authority than the American College of Obstetrician-Gynecologists, are scientifically wrong. If you take emergency contraception while you\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re still pregnant. But that doesn\u2019t matter to the Boys on the Bench, because the beliefs are \u201csincerely held.\u201d\n\n\n\n[MORE: Cartoons about Congress]\n\nWord to Justice Alito: Sincerely held bigotry is still bigotry. Would he find Hobby Lobby\u2019s sincerely held beliefs acceptable if they dictated not hiring people of a different race or requiring all their male employees be circumcised?\n\nNeedless to say, the women justices are not amused. Justice Ginsburg\u2019s 49-page dissent is a wealth of zingers, among them, \"Would the exemption \u2026 extend to employers with religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions (Jehovah's Witnesses); antidepressants (Scientologists); medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin (certain Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations? \u2026 The court, I fear, has ventured into a minefield.\"\n\nThat minefield has already started exploding, as companies like Denver\u2019s own Hercules Industries are asking to be exempted from the contraceptive coverage requirement altogether. And the battles that my grandmother fought to secure autonomy for herself and other women are being fought again in the United States Congress 50 years later.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Hobby Lobby Contraception Decision Isn't Just Wrong, It's Insulting", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Here is where the Hobby Lobby decision went wrong.", "title": "A Supreme Insult to Women", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/laura-chapin/2014/07/14/hobby-lobby-contraception-decision-isnt-just-wrong-its-insulting", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/9c/af/2953d89d47558ffbf5b168502050/20140630edloc-a.tif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Hobby Lobby Contraception Decision Isn't Just Wrong, It's Insulting", "description": "Here is where the Hobby Lobby decision went wrong.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "July 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Laura Chapin,Supreme Court,contraception,birth control,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Here is where the Hobby Lobby decision went wrong."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9218\"", "article_summary": "Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Mark Udall, D-Colo., reverses that and says that for-profit corporations like Hobby Lobby can\u2019t limit any legal health care service for religious reasons.\nThis week, the U.S. Senate will take up legislation addressing the Supreme Court\u2019s male-majority decision in the Hobby Lobby case, which reflects pretty much the same belief about women.\nThe five male justices who sided with Hobby Lobby basically said that a boss\u2019s opinion about birth control overrides our own, and women are incapable of independent moral judgment.\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter to the Boys on the Bench, because the beliefs are \u201csincerely held.\u201d[MORE: Cartoons about Congress]Word to Justice Alito: Sincerely held bigotry is still bigotry.\nIf you take emergency contraception while you\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re still pregnant."}
