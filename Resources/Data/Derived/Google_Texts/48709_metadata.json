\u2014McIntyre Street, one of the main thoroughfares connecting Golden and western Arvada, will be widened and improved between West 44th and West 60th avenues.\n\nThe project\u2019s schedule indicates the county will complete design for the project by September 2014 and begin construction in May 2015.\n\nSee project plans and documents at dpo.st/mcintyreproject.\n\nMcIntyre Street is one of the busiest thoroughfares in unincorporated Jeffco, according to Kevin French, director of transportation and engineering for the county.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s needed safety and operational improvements for some time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe improvements will include widening all sections of the road within the project to four lanes, adding a concrete median, making sure major intersections have left and right turn lanes, and adding bicycle lanes and sidewalks on both sides of the street.\n\nThere are two stoplights at Table Mountain Parkway and 52nd Avenue in the proposed design.\n\nFrench said there are funds to complete the first phase of the project \u2014 West 44th to West 54th \u2014 but not yet for the second phase.\n\nWhat survives the design process for the first phase depends on what will fit into the approximately $3 million budget.\n\n\u201cWe may need to do some tweaking,\u201d French said.\n\nThe county hosted public meetings earlier this year and public comments show varying support for aspects of the project, with some opposed to a concrete median or to the project altogether.\n\nA conceptual map showed that of the 74 written comments received, 54 percent supported, 28 percent were impartial and 18 percent were unsupportive.\n\nLined primarily with horse properties, residential subdivisions and some office-based businesses, McIntyre is the only major north-south through street between Colorado 93 to the west and Ward Road to the east that connects communities in western Arvada to Colorado 58.\n\nIt also provides key access to the Fairmont community.\n\nIt is currently two lanes in each direction from Colorado 58 north to Table Mountain Parkway, then narrows to one lane in each direction until just north of West 60th Avenue, where it becomes the four-lane McIntyre Parkway.\n\nThis project leaves out the stretch of two-lane road north of West 54th Avenue to McIntyre Parkway, but French said the county does not have the funds to deal with the three bridge structures on that section of the road.\n\nHowever, he said, the intersections with the most turning vehicles are at 50th, 52nd and 54th avenues.\n\n\u201cThrough traffic analysis, the 54th intersection is really key,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d document presented at a public open house June 11, the county said that it classifies McIntyre as a principal arterial \u2014 which is typically four to six lanes \u2014 between Highway 58 and West 48th Avenue, and a minor arterial \u2014 typically four lanes \u2014 between West 48th and West 64th avenues.\n\nIt states the current traffic north of West 44th is approximately 22,000 vehicles per day and 13,600 north of West 54th, numbers that are projected to grow.\n\nJosie Klemaier: 303-954-2465, jklemaier@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver
