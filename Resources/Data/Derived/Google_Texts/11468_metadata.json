The man who once hailed himself and his fellow travelers as the \u201cones we\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d and who was hailed by others as a transformational figure, is now the incredible shrinking president. But that\u2019s image, too: As many of us knew all along, he was always small.\n\nOnce fancied a paragon of competence, Obama has now spawned perhaps the most poorly crafted bill in American history, ObamaCare. Once considered an honest, outside-the-beltway figure who transcends politics, we now know he employed one of the biggest lies in American history to push that death-care mistake through. Why, even the mainstream media \u2014 which has long bowed before the \u2018Bama the way he bowed before the Saudi king \u2014 has now soured, complaining that the administration meant to be the most \u201ctransparent\u201d in history is history\u2019s most insular and \u201chostile.\u201d And now a little more history may be made or, should I say, revealed \u2014 because the long-standing suspicion that \u201cObama\u2019s\u201d Magnum opus, Dreams From My Father, was actually ghostwritten by another, may soon be confirmed.\n\nThat ghost would be ex-Weathermen terrorist, Marxist, and erstwhile Obama ally Bill Ayers.\n\nAyers himself recently admitted, while speaking at Montclair State University, that he wrote Dreams. But that\u2019s not the biggest news here; after all, Ayers has made this claim before, only to later say he was joking. What\u2019s different now is that with Obama in the twilight of his political career and Ayers in the twilight of his life \u2014 and having written a new book, Public Enemy, that\u2019s selling about as well as ObamaCare \u2014 he may be less interested in protecting the president\u2019s waning popularity than in seeking a bit more for himself. R. Emmett Tyrrell at American Spectator advances this thesis:\n\nAt the end of a misspent life, Ayers suddenly anticipates yet another act. He will serve as a Saul Alinsky for the Millennials. He will write an updated Rules for Radicals with diagrams on how to disable mother\u2019s smart phone or how to hack into her bank account.\n\nFirst, however, he needs to attract attention. My guess is that he will admit to having written Obama\u2019s bestselling Dreams From My Father. He has suggested as much to the curious public.\n\n\u2026 Time is running out for Bill Ayers. He is showing himself to be desperate for his last act. If he is going to identify himself as the real writer of Dreams From My Father it is going to have to come pretty soon.\n\nAmerican Thinker\u2019s Thomas Lifson weighs in, pointing out that Ayers\u2019s pride may goeth before Obama\u2019s next fall, writing:\n\nAyers is obviously an ego-driven man. Only someone [with] a pathological ego could embrace murderous violence in the certitude that he would inspire the masses to overthrow and restructure society. Having sponsored Obama's political career, ghostwritten he [sic] book that more than anything else certified Obama's intellectual status to a gullible commentariat, and seen Obama take office and fail to follow through on Ayers's radical goals, Ayers must feel betrayed. Terrell's insight that there is not much time left, and that the failure of his book must rankle, makes sense.\n\nLifson\u2019s reference to certifying \u201cObama\u2019s intellectual status\u201d gets at why this matters. Time magazine called Dreams \u201cthe best-written memoir ever produced by an American politician,\u201d while the New York Times praised Obama as \u201cthat rare politician who can write \u2026 and write movingly and genuinely about himself.\u201d So debunking the Dreams myth would perhaps officially decertify Obama, constituting the last nail in the coffin of the narrative of Obama as honest intellectual. Why, he not only didn\u2019t write his claim to scholar fame, but as with ObamaCare, he lied to make people buy what he was selling.\n\nOf course, though, unrepentant terrorist Ayers isn\u2019t exactly an unimpeachable source. Yet we don\u2019t have to take his word on Dreams\u2019 authorship. You see, literary style isn\u2019t exactly a fingerprint, but it does approximate one. It isn\u2019t the easiest thing to completely disguise your distinctive writing style, and a poor writer cannot fake Shakespearian sublimity any more than a weekend duffer could suddenly channel Tiger Woods to win a $500 Nassau bet. And while Dreams is professionally written, Obama\u2019s writing prior to \u201chis\u201d pair of books ranged, frankly, from average to awful. Ayers, on the other hand, is reputed to be an excellent writer \u2014 Dreams level, in fact.\n\nAuthor Jack Cashill has long analyzed these two men\u2019s literary fingerprints. He wrote in 2008, \u201cIn my career in advertising and publishing, I have reviewed the portfolios of a thousand professional writers, all of them crowded with writing samples, but only a handful of these writers would have been capable of having a written a book as stylish as Dreams.\u201d Cashill then illustrates how relatively poor Obama\u2019s few confirmed pieces of writing are and mentions how \u2014 despite receiving a $125,000 advance for his memoir and a $40,000 second advance \u2014 Obama simply could not finish the work within the allotted time (one year).\n\nThen, magically, Dreams appeared.\n\nAs Cashill put it, \u201cSuddenly, somehow, the muse descended on Obama and transformed him from a struggling, unschooled amateur, with no paper trail beyond an unremarkable legal note and a poem about fig-stomping apes, into a literary superstar.\u201d\n\nBut this just accords with truths that were hiding in plain sight. Obama is a great orator who can\u2019t speak without a teleprompter. He\u2019s an intellectual who pronounced \u201ccorpsman\u201d \u201ccorpse-man\u201d and supposed that \u201cAustrian\u201d was spoken in Austria. He\u2019s a racial healer who fomented racial hatred by falsely claiming before a black audience that white politicians denied black Hurricane Katrina victims federal aid. He\u2019s a natural-born American who, apparently, claimed in a publishing-company bio that he was born in Kenya. He\u2019s a humanitarian who, a former aide tells us, \u201cdoesn\u2019t like people.\u201d He\u2019s a Millennial-awing, cool guy with basketball skills who, when the camera was on, made 2 of 22 baskets. The man whose presidential success was supposed to be a slam dunk has turned out to be a walking, talking air ball.\n\nBut this is because of another way in which Obama made history: as the first affirmative-action president. Really, though, the American people made that history. They wrote, with hopes and the vote, the book that is Obama. And it has turned out to be pure fiction.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Weathermen terrorist, Obma, Bill Ayers, memoir, Dreams From My Father, fiction, president", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/reviews/opinion/item/17104-obama-s-dreams-from-his-ideological-father-bill-ayers", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/48f22765a5d949a660157d6b3f3d6c98_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "If ex-Weathermen terrorist and former Obama ally Bill Ayers finally confirms that he wrote Obama\u2019s memoir, Dreams From My Father, it will be further evidence that we have a folderol-and-fiction president. by Selwyn Duke", "title": "Obama\u2019s Dreams From His Ideological Father, Bill Ayers"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/48f22765a5d949a660157d6b3f3d6c98_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8585\"", "article_summary": "And while Dreams is professionally written, Obama\u2019s writing prior to \u201chis\u201d pair of books ranged, frankly, from average to awful.\nMy guess is that he will admit to having written Obama\u2019s bestselling Dreams From My Father.\nOnce fancied a paragon of competence, Obama has now spawned perhaps the most poorly crafted bill in American history, ObamaCare.\nOnce considered an honest, outside-the-beltway figure who transcends politics, we now know he employed one of the biggest lies in American history to push that death-care mistake through.\nThat ghost would be ex-Weathermen terrorist, Marxist, and erstwhile Obama ally Bill Ayers."}
