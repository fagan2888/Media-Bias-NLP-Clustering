Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is designed to protect investors from conflicts of interest of brokers and advisers. President Obama initiated the rule when he directed on February 23, 2015 \u2013 in what is difficult to see as anything but a reasonable set of expectations:\n\n\u201cToday, I\u2019m calling on the Department of Labor to update the rules and requirements that retirement advisors put the best interests of their clients above their own financial interests. It\u2019s a very simple principle: You want to give financial advice, you\u2019ve got to put your client\u2019s interests first.\u201d (White House Fact Sheet here)\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal explained on Friday,\n\nThe rule, originating from the U.S. Department of Labor, has drawn stiff opposition from Wall Street because it could reshape how brokers earn commissions and restrict their ability to sell some higher-fee products. It requires brokers to act as \u201cfiduciaries,\u201d offering financial advice in their clients\u2019 \u201cbest interest.\u201d That contrasts with current rules requiring they only offer \u201csuitable\u201d advice, which critics say allows for biased guidance and conflicts of interest.\n\nEven Speaker Paul Ryan admitted that, \u201cThe intent of making sure people get sound advice and conflicts of interest (disclosures) is a good idea,\u201d but actually doing something about a real problem is beyond the pale for congressional Republicans since 2008, despite the fact that as the DOL reports,\n\nA White House Council of Economic Advisers analysis found that these conflicts of interest result in annual losses of about 1 percentage point for affected investors\u2014or about $17 billion per year in total.\n\nNaturally, Paul Ryan was very hostile to the idea of fixing actual, rather than imagined, problems, and tweeted back on March 8,\n\nThe new fiduciary rule has a new definition: It\u2019s Obamacare for financial planning. https://t.co/lNx3RF7aPK \u2014 Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) March 8, 2016\n\nOn Friday Ryan called the rule \u201can April Fools-worthy joke\u201d and announced that,\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration has argued that this rule will help people trying to save for retirement, but that\u2019s an April Fools-worthy joke. In reality, it\u2019s going to make it harder for families and businesses\u2014especially those with smaller bank accounts\u2014get financial advice.\u201d\n\nRyan put together a packet of misinformation about the new rule and presents it as things \u201cyou need to know\u201d:\n\n1. It\u2019s another one-size-fits-all regulation. What\u2019s the result? It creates more paperwork and costly recordkeeping requirements for financial planners, restricting access to quality investment advice for upwards of 7 million Americans with IRAs. It results in higher costs for people seeking financial advice, disproportionately hurting families with smaller bank accounts.\n\n\n\n2. The bureaucrats bullied it through. A report released in February showed the DOL\u2019s utter\u2014and seemingly willful\u2014neglect of the consequences of this rule. It\u2019s a story we\u2019ve heard before: Nonpartisan, professional experts raise concerns, ask for deliberation in the rulemaking process, while politically-appointed bureaucrats bully their way through the process with one thing in mind: a finalized regulation to finish while the president is still in office.\n\n\n\n3. It\u2019s Obamacare for financial planning. The fiduciary rule is \u201can example of massive overkill by the federal government,\u201d Speaker Ryan said. \u201cThe intent of making sure people get sound advice and conflicts of interest (disclosures) is a good idea,\u201d Speaker Ryan continued. \u201cThis rule, however, is such overkill it is destined to put people out of business and making it harder for middle-class investors to get sound financial advice.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ryan, \u201cHouse Republicans, led by Reps. Ann Wagner (R-MO), Phil Roe (R-TN), and Peter Roskam (R-IL), are working to protect families from the harmful fiduciary rule. Stay tuned for more Congressional action.\u201d\n\nThis is a bit of an April Fool\u2019s Day joke itself, as the only time Congress springs to action since Bush left office is to stop President Obama from doing something \u2013 like running the country. Republican champions of Wall Street won\u2019t be alone, as sadly, even some House Democrats have joined Republicans by signing a letter to Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez, opposing the rule, claiming it \u201ccould have a disproportionate impact on lower or middle-income consumers.\u201d\n\nWall Street never lacks for champions in either part, which is part of the fuel that drives the Sanders revolution, though it must be noted in this case that both Sanders and Clinton support the new DOL rule. On the other hand, the WSJ reported Friday that the American Council of Life Insurers \u201chas retained a law firm\u201d and expects a court battle. Because, don\u2019t come between rich corporations and their profits.\n\nIt\u2019s a Republican credo, and Republicans like Paul Ryan will always be there to protect the rich by pretending it makes things better for the middle class. It\u2019s sleight of hand that fools nobody, but it\u2019s the GOP\u2019s story and they\u2019re sticking to it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ryan called the rule, designed to protect investors from conflicts of interest and hidden fees, \"an April Fools-worthy joke\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Ryan called the rule, designed to protect investors from conflicts of interest and hidden fees, \"an April Fools-worthy joke\"", "title": "GOP Champions of Wall Street in a Tizzy Over Obama's New 'Fiduciary Rule'", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/04/01/gop-champions-wall-street-tizzy-obamas-fiduciary-rule.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ryan-on-anti-poverty-plan.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-01T18:25:31+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2016-04-01T18:25:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-01T18:25:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb0ee\"", "article_summary": "It results in higher costs for people seeking financial advice, disproportionately hurting families with smaller bank accounts.\nIt\u2019s a Republican credo, and Republicans like Paul Ryan will always be there to protect the rich by pretending it makes things better for the middle class.\nThe fiduciary rule is \u201can example of massive overkill by the federal government,\u201d Speaker Ryan said.\n\u201cThe intent of making sure people get sound advice and conflicts of interest (disclosures) is a good idea,\u201d Speaker Ryan continued.\nNaturally, Paul Ryan was very hostile to the idea of fixing actual, rather than imagined, problems, and tweeted back on March 8,The new fiduciary rule has a new definition: It\u2019s Obamacare for financial planning."}
