 Statement on the Passing of Vermont Democrat State Sen. Sally Fox from President Pro Tempore Senator John Campbell—

“It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Sen. Sally Fox. Sally’s courageous battle against cancer came to an end in the early hours of Friday, Jan. 10, 2014.

It would be difficult to find a more passionate advocate and champion for our most vulnerable citizens­—the young, the elderly, and the disabled. As a Chittenden County state senator, she fought tirelessly to ensure that all Vermonters have access to quality health care, that those who suffered from mental illness are not forgotten, and that our children are provided with every opportunity to succeed.

While Sally’s physical presence may be absent from the Vermont State Senate, her spirit will live on and provide us with guidance, compassion, and support.”



Sen. Sally Fox's biography:

Fox was elected to the Vermont Senate in 2010. Her past experience in the House of Representatives won her appointments to key Senate committees.

She was appointed to the Health and Welfare Committee, tackled the controversial task of writing the statute to implement the federal Affordable Care Act, as well as the governor’s push for single payer health care. Her role in this effort, both in 2011 and 2012 won her a place on the conference committees which worked out the final versions of the bills.

She also served on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the tax and fee legislation as well as regulation of utilities , insurance, and banking.

Fox’s experience in the 2012 session was marked by a personal health care experience. What began as a cough that she couldn’t shake, became a diagnosis of a tumor situated atop her lung.

After six weeks of seeing various doctors to determine the best course of treatment for this very rare condition, she finally found a nationally acclaimed surgeon, Dr. David Sugarbaker, who was able to remove the tumor as well as her left lung. The surgery was in late March in Boston. She was on medical leave for over a month. When listening to the Senate debates on radio became frustrating to her, she convinced her doctors to let her return to the Vermont Statehouse. She finished the session and managed to get some key language into the Democrat-led health care bills.
