Security measures were reinforced for the parliamentary session dealing with the burqa. the ATS news agency reported.

A metal detection device was temporarily installed to screen people coming into the parliament, the agency said.

The Ticino government had wanted the ban on burqas and niqabs (face veil) to also apply to other forms of head covering that hide the face, such as masks, worn by demonstrators and balaclavas.

But MPs voted for a law that applies only to the wearing of Muslim veils to avoid putting that on the same level as hooligans and masked demonstrators.
