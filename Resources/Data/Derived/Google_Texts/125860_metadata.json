Each of the prominent party members are picking sides, throwing their weight behind what many believe is the lesser of two evils. However, there\u2019s occasionally whole-hearted support from one figure to another, rare as it is. One such outcropping of support came from Elizabeth Warren\u2013 to candidate Bernie Sanders.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say Warren endorses Sanders, per se. She has been hesitant to endorse anyone, though that could soon change. It\u2019s possible Warren does not outright endorse Sanders because she does not want to anger the Clinton supporting establishment Democrats, an unwise move if she chose to run in the future. Warren has, however, praised Sanders exclusively at several points, recently and in the past.\n\nI\u2019m glad @BernieSanders is out there fighting to hold big banks accountable, make our economy safer, & stop the GOP from rigging the system. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) January 6, 2016\n\nShortly after, Warren made this tweet, making sure to include every Democratic candidate this time:\n\nI\u2019m glad that ALL the Dem candidates for president \u2013 @HillaryClinton, @BernieSanders & @MartinOMalley \u2013 are fighting for Wall St reform. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) January 6, 2016\n\nMore recently, when asked if Sanders should drop out of the race, Warren wasn\u2019t dismissive of the Senator from Vermont. Instead, she was enthused that Sanders is still running against Clinton. From The Boston Globe:\n\n\u2018\u2018He\u2019s out there. He fights from the heart. This is who Bernie is\u2026 He has put the right issues on the table both for the Democratic Party and for the country in general so I\u2019m still cheering Bernie on.\u2019\u2019\n\nWarren did say both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders would make better presidents than any Republican candidates.\n\nFollow Chris on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Warren said, \"He has put the right issues on the table both for the Democratic Party and for the country in general so I\u2019m still cheering Bernie on.\u2019\u2019", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "Warren said, \"He has put the right issues on the table both for the Democratic Party and for the country in general so I\u2019m still cheering Bernie on.\u2019\u2019", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Cheers on Bernie Sanders - The Libertarian Republic", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/warrensanders.jpeg", "updated_time": "2016-03-26T11:01:40+00:00", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/elizabeth-warren-cheers-on-bernie-sanders/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Warren said,", "creator": "@ChrisJohncox", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/warrensanders.jpeg", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Cheers on Bernie Sanders", "site": "@thelibrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "published_time": "2016-03-26T11:00:13+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ChrisJohncoxTheWriter?ref=tn_tnmn", "section": "Headline News", "modified_time": "2016-03-26T11:01:40+00:00", "tag": "Twitter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "One such outcropping of support came from Elizabeth Warren\u2013 to candidate Bernie Sanders.\n\u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) January 6, 2016More recently, when asked if Sanders should drop out of the race, Warren wasn\u2019t dismissive of the Senator from Vermont.\nThis isn\u2019t to say Warren endorses Sanders, per se.\nElizabeth Warren Cheers on Bernie SandersElizabeth Warren is Rooting for BernieBy CHRIS JOHNCOXWith only three Republicans and two Democrats in the race to the party\u2019s nomination for President of the United States, the fighting is getting even more ugly and even more polarized.\n\u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) January 6, 2016Shortly after, Warren made this tweet, making sure to include every Democratic candidate this time:I\u2019m glad that ALL the Dem candidates for president \u2013 @HillaryClinton, @BernieSanders & @MartinOMalley \u2013 are fighting for Wall St reform."}
