(AP) - When considering the millions of men who fought in the American Civil War, one local group highlights the fact that some of them were not men at all \u2014 but women, in disguise.\n\nOn May 15, Steve Killings, board president of the Academy for Veteran Education and Training \u2014 an educational nonprofit group located at Historic Jordan Springs \u2014 said that the organization is trying to erect a monument to honor the more than 500 women who posed as men so they could fight.\n\nAccording to the Civil War Trust, more than 3 million soldiers fought in the war (about 620,000 lost their lives, nearly as many as all other American conflicts combined).\n\nMr. Killings said that there is no memorial anywhere dedicated to the little-known group of women who fought as valiantly as their male counterparts, and not as nurses or seamstresses, but as combat soldiers.\n\n\u201cThere have been 513 positively identified women who fought in the war,\u201d Mr. Killings said. \u201cIt\u2019s a field that\u2019s not very well documented because women had to hide their identities.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr. Killings, Tonie Wallace and Greig Aitken \u2014 the owners of Historic Jordan Springs \u2014 are donating a portion of their land to the public trust for construction of the monument.\n\nHe said that Jordan Springs is an ideal spot, as it is close to battlefield sites in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia and a scenic drive from Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cThis area is Civil War history-central,\u201d Mr. Killings said. \u201cIt really is a perfect place for (the monument).\u201d\n\nApart from being one of a kind, Mr. Killings said the monument \u2014 titled Glory Honor\u2019s Stone \u2014 will also stand out in that it will house a data depository where academics and historians can preserve collections of related documents and artifacts.\n\nAn online funding campaign has been launched in support of the monument. A stated goal of the fundraising is to \u201cinspire and validate all American female soldiers now and in the future for their brave service and sacrifices.\u201d\n\nThe fundraising is being done through razoo.com \u2014 a crowdfunding website \u2014 and the goal to be reached is $75,000 in three months.\n\nMr. Killings said that the project got underway at Jordan Springs on May 8, when representatives of Rep. Barbara Comstock, Virginia Republican, and Virginia State Sen. Jill Vogel attended a meeting for the project.\n\nBrig Gen. Wilma Vaught, founder of the female veterans memorial in Arlington, was also present at the meeting, Mr. Killings said.\n\nHe said the monument will be accessible to the public and is meant to be a Virginia State Park, though he believes there is the potential for it to be a national monument.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to make this a state park, but we\u2019re seeing interest on the national level as well.\u201d\n\nAnyone wishing to donate to the project can visit razoo.com/story/Glory-Honor-S-Stone-A-Monument-For-Women-Soldiers-Of-The-American-Civil-War.\n\nAdditional information can be found on the monument\u2019s Facebook page at facebook.com/womenscivilwarmemorial.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When considering the millions of men who fought in the American Civil War, one local group highlights the fact that some of them were not men at all - but women, in disguise.", "Author": "ONOFRIO CASTIGLIA", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "When considering the millions of men who fought in the American Civil War, one local group highlights the fact that some of them were not men at all - but women, in disguise.", "title": "Group looks to honor Female Civil War soldiers with monument", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/24/group-looks-to-honor-female-civil-war-soldiers-wit/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/24/ed65f067b43a1e16770f6a7067002e9d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/24/ed65f067b43a1e16770f6a7067002e9d.jpg", "title": "Group looks to honor Female Civil War soldiers with monument", "description": "When considering the millions of men who fought in the American Civil War, one local group highlights the fact that some of them were not men at all - but women, in disguise.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Steve Killings, Jordan Springs"}, "article_summary": "Brig Gen.
