WKSU\u2019s M.L. Schultze spoke with Ohio\u2019s Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown about the aftermath of the Ohio primary and of President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee.\n\nSherrod Brown on the big political week\n\nAfter Hillary Clinton convincingly won the Democratic primary in Ohio Tuesday, soft talk of Sen. Brown as her running mate got louder. But Brown says the speculation should end.\n\n\u201cI have no interest. I\u2019m flattered that anybody would talk about me as holding what I guess is the second highest job in the land. But I love this job. I want to continue to fight for manufacturing and help students deal with their oppressive student debt and I want to keep doing this job, so I have no interest.\u201d\n\nSo would that be a \u201cno\u201d if offered?\n\n\u201cThat would be a \u2018no.\u201d :26\n\nThe other winner Tuesday \u2013 in Ohio\u2019s Republican primary \u2013 was Gov. John Kasich. But Donald Trump won all four of the other states \u2013 pending a potential recount in Missouri.\n\nBrown maintains that overall, the Republican Party is heading in a different direction than the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cI wish John Kasich well. I appreciate that John Kasich implemented the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. But I also think this far-right politics that we see in the state legislature in Columbus and that we see from Donald Trump and Ted Cruz is not even close to carrying the rest of the country.\u201d :18\n\nBrown\u2019s words were harsher for the GOP senators who are refusing to consider President Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court. Senate Republicans have repeatedly invoked what they call the Biden rule, referring to a speech now Vice President Biden gave as a U.S. senator in 1992. Biden maintained then that different standards should apply to Supreme Court vacancies \u201cin the full throes of an election year.\u201d\n\nBrown argues that\u2019s out of context.\n\n\u201cBiden talks a lot. Biden made all kinds of statements but the difference is Biden was saying to the Supreme Court: \u2018Don\u2019t have somebody quit just so President Bush can nominate somebody as he goes out the door.\u201d :13\n\nAmong those who oppose confirmation hearings is Ohio\u2019s other Sen. Rob Portman. He was not available for an interview. But in a statement, he repeated Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s insistence that \u2013 quote \u2013 \u201cThis is about the principle, not the person\u201d and that the Senate should not take up any nomination until after the election.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Government & Politics", "description": "Politics and governing aren\u2019t always the same thing, but they certainly were this week.
