The only question now is which party will lay claim to that achievement.\n\nDemocrat Natalie Tennant and Republican Shelley Moore Capito both easily captured their party\u2019s nominations Tuesday night -- setting up a general election contest that will pit Capito\u2019s significant fundraising and polling leads against a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage that favors Tennant and her fellow Democrats.\n\nCapito won 87 percent of the GOP primary vote. Tennant received 78 percent on the Democratic side. So lopsided were the results that the Associated Press called each race -- first Capito\u2019s, then Tennant\u2019s -- just minutes after returns began trickling in.\n\nAs a thunderstorm raged outside of Tennant\u2019s victory party -- where a few dozen party activists and supporters gathered to watch the anti-climactic results -- the candidate challenged her Republican opponent to participate in five televised debates.\n\n\u201cThe people of West Virginia certainly deserve to have candidates who will stand up and debate issues openly and publicly,\u201d she said. Capito later told RCP that the two campaigns would need to discuss exact arrangements, but \u201cof course we\u2019re going to debate. I\u2019ve always debated in competitive races.\u201d (A Capito spokesperson later labeled the challenge as proof that \u201cNatalie Tennant\u2019s campaign continues to be scripted by President Obama's Washington liberals.\u201d)\n\nWhile Democrats have dominated West Virginia politics for decades, Obama\u2019s unpopularity in the state -- as well as the seat being open for the first time since the 1980s -- puts the GOP in a strong position. And national Republicans, hoping to take control of the Senate, consider the contest a must-win.\n\nThe general election race begins with Capito, who has represented West Virginia\u2019s 2nd Congressional District since 2001, heavily favored over the secretary of state. Like most other electoral analyses, RealClearPolitics\u2019 categorizes the race as \u201clikely GOP.\u201d\n\nThe Capito campaign has focused on highlighting Tennant\u2019s ties with Obama, whose approval rating in West Virginia has hovered below 40 percent for years. After first lady Michelle Obama said it was \u201ccritical\u201d for Democrats to elect Tennant, the Capito campaign has been regularly referencing the implicit endorsement. (Tennant\u2019s campaign said it wasn\u2019t an endorsement.)\n\nThe Capito team has also asserted that Tennant was recruited to run by \u201cWashington liberals\u201d and that she supports \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s war on coal\u201d -- touching upon a major industry and job provider in the state.\n\n\u201cI think [Obama is] a big factor in the race,\u201d argued Capito. \u201cAnd she has spoken positively about his policies. And those policies are a direct hit on our state in a negative way. So she has to defend that.\u201d\n\nAsked about her ties to Obama, Tennant responded, \u201cThis race is about West Virginia.\u201d\n\nHowever, Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, is a significant issue in the state. Asked if she would have voted for Obamacare when it passed in 2010, Tennant told RCP, \u201cThe fact is, I didn\u2019t vote for it.\u201d She then reiterated her position that \u201cthere are changes that need to be made\u201d and lamented that she wasn\u2019t able to discuss and debate the legislation at the time of passage. She also delivered a passionate defense of the law\u2019s pre-existing coverage provision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to get fully repealed. We know that,\u201d Capito conceded. \u201cI think that now the position has got to be, 'We\u2019ve got to reform it and make it work for children, families, and businesses.'\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what [Tennant\u2019s] position is. \u2026 Not until she\u2019s found out that it\u2019s become very unpopular has she decided that maybe she\u2019s not so sure.\u201d\n\nTennant hardly mentioned the president on the campaign trail Monday, and it\u2019s unlikely that she\u2019ll trumpet her support for him during election season. Obama lost every West Virginia county in 2012, something no other presidential candidate has ever done.\n\nMaj. General Allen Tackett, the retired leader of the West Virginia National Guard, serves as Tennant\u2019s campaign chairman. Although he predicted that the polls will narrow (and Tennant will win), he acknowledged that sharing a party affiliation with Obama \u201churts every Democrat in the state of West Virginia because [Republicans] have demonized\u201d the president.\n\nBut Tackett asserted that Capito\u2019s decade-plus in Washington will hurt her: \u201cNinety-five to 98 percent of the people in the state of West Virginia can relate to Natalie Tennant. About 3 to 5 percent relate to Shelley Moore Capito.\u201d\n\nThe seven-term congresswoman dismissed the criticism as \u201cgrasping at straws.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have to defend being a West Virginian. I was born and raised here. My children have gone to public schools here, and I have a long and storied history in this state with my family.\u201d\n\nThe Capito campaign has challenged Tennant\u2019s competency as a manager. A Capito spokesperson said that the candidate has ignored her basic duties as secretary of state, botching the rollout of a campaign finance reporting website and not complying with a federal law that sets standards for the state\u2019s voter registration rolls. (Tennant blamed a vendor for the website\u2019s complications. The voter registration issue led to local officials and Tennant sparring over culpability.)\n\nWest Virginia is a small state, with less than 2 million residents. Its political circles are even smaller. Capito recalled crossing paths with Tennant recently, and the candidates\u2019 relationship goes back years. Tennant\u2019s husband, Erik Wells, mounted an unsuccessful challenge to the congresswoman in 2004, losing by double digits. He was later elected to the state Senate.\n\nCapito holds a significant fundraising lead. Her campaign has $4.3 million cash on hand, compared to $1.2 million for her opponent, according to Open Secrets. Capito has already taken advantage of her enviable financial position, outspending Tennant by more than $1 million.\n\nThe Democrat hopes to overcome the current polling and fundraising deficits through retail politics. She points out that Capito has never run a statewide race -- something the secretary of state has done several times. Tennant has also launched a 55-county tour of West Virginia and has already visited 38 of them. (Capito, who announced her candidacy in November 2012, estimated that she\u2019s been to each county at least twice.) Tackett predicted that because Tennant \u201crepresents Main Street,\u201d the polls will begin to narrow as she spends more time on the trail speaking to voters.\n\nTennant has said that the tour has made one thing clear to her: The top issue in the campaign is jobs. \u201cThat\u2019s the focus. When you boil down to it, what do we want? We want opportunities.\u201d On this, Capito agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s really, really been difficult for us.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin won re-election with more than 60 percent of the vote in 2012, despite appearing on the ballot with Obama. Manchin, a popular former governor, has earned a reputation as one of the Senate\u2019s most conservative Democrats by frequently criticizing the administration and expressing a willingness to work across the aisle.\n\nManchin has endorsed Tennant and said Tuesday night in a statement that she \u201cis a proven statewide leader whose passion and dedication to public service will resonate well in Washington.\u201d\n\nTennant is hoping to establish a similar image as a Democrat willing to take her party to task over its positions that are unpopular in the state. However, that may prove difficult for her, as she was previously a more vocal supporter of the president than Manchin. (For example, while she attended the 2012 Democratic National Convention as a delegate; Manchin skipped the event.)\n\nWhile control of the upper chamber could hinge on the race, it also has local implications. The election may provide a preview of how well the West Virginia Democratic Party can fare in federal elections when Obama isn\u2019t on the ballot.\n\nState party Chairman Larry Puccio sees things more simply, however: \u201cI play to the fact that the candidate that earns the respect and the trust from more citizens of West Virginia will be elected.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Capito echoes this. \u201cIt used to be you only voted the party,\u201d she said. \u201cNow people are really wanting a message and a messenger that understands the way they feel.\u201d\n\nThe challenge for the next generation of West Virginia Democratic leaders who want to earn trust from their constituents -- who don\u2019t have the same name recognition in-state as Manchin -- may be to differentiate themselves from national members of their party before Republicans can lump them together. This contest, and other federal elections in the future, could very well be decided by that factor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CHARLESTON, W.Va -- It's official: West Virginia's next U.S. senator will be the first woman to represent the Mountain State in the upper chamber.
