Depression alone gnaws away three times more work hours than diabetes, 20 times more than cancer.\n\nAlthough mental illness is treatable, and millions recover, the stigma often forces its victims to turn inward. Only 40 percent of Americans living with mental illness ever get treatment.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t accept it if only 40 percent of Americans with cancers got treatment,\u201d President Obama asked last year. \u201cWhy should we accept it when it comes to mental health?\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has enormous potential to reverse those grim statistics and bring mental-illness treatment into daylight. Lost in the politics is the fact that it is already making a difference.\n\nAbout 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage that, finally, ensures mental-health coverage is on par with physical care.\n\nWashington state is already realizing some benefits. April appointments for new patients at mental-health clinics statewide quadrupled from levels in January, when the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility. Clinics, especially in urban areas, open most mornings to find overflowing waiting rooms. In other parts of the state, the law has had little effect.\n\nThe act is a work in progress, requiring tweaks to control costs and modernize how care is delivered. But congressional gridlock renders change a remote possibility. Instead, states are left to use the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tools.\n\nWashington should seize the opportunity. Here are three ways the state can deliver on the law\u2019s promise to improve mental health care. Also, read editorial page editor Kate Riley\u2019s column explaining the series.\n\nPain caused by funding cuts\n\nGabriel Campanario / The Seattle Times Gabriel Campanario / The Seattle Times\n\nTHE Affordable Care Act leaves a funding gap in a vital part of the mental-health system: crisis response.\n\nMedicaid does not pay for evaluations of people suspected of needing involuntary commitment, nor for their hospitalization. This is due to an odd technical rule eliminating payment for facilities with more than 16 beds.\n\nWashington has filled in the gap with \u201cstate-only\u201d money to pay for crisis response, and recently added dozens of beds at smaller facilities.\n\nPrescription: The Legislature must respond to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling by funding at least 100 more psychiatric beds, and more robust outpatient treatment, to prevent hospitalization.\n\nStill, the state ranks near the bottom in psychiatric beds per capita. That led to the recent Supreme Court ruling prohibiting patients from being \u201cboarded\u201d in emergency rooms while awaiting care.\n\nNonetheless, the Legislature recently slashed state-only funding by 20 percent. Lawmakers gambled the cut wouldn\u2019t hurt as much with broader Medicaid eligibility. A bad bet.\n\nWith newly covered patients filling clinics, the crisis mental-health system is on life support. \u201cWe\u2019ll come out of this broke,\u201d said Ken Roughton, director of Greater Columbia Behavioral Health in Kennewick.\n\nOther states, such as New York, faced a similar inpatient shortage and launched a new program, called Assisted Outpatient Treatment, which allows a court to require outpatient care for chronically ill patients who have resisted preventive care.\n\nStory: \u2018My kid could\u2019ve died\u2019\n\nTREZ Buckland cries at the thought of the day she wouldn\u2019t let her son, who has paranoid schizophrenia, come home unless he promised to take his medications. Jon Buckland wouldn\u2019t, so when he left Harborview Medical Center\u2019s psychiatric ward that day in 2012, he was discharged to a homeless shelter.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a mother would do that?\u201d she said. \u201cMy kid, my lovely wonderful young man, could\u2019ve died. But if he didn\u2019t take his meds, he\u2019d be dead.\u201d\n\nIt was a gamble on tough love \u2014 and it worked.\n\nJon, now 32, had four hospitalizations in rapid succession in 2011-12. A 3 a.m. encounter with Seattle\u2019s self-proclaimed crime fighter Phoenix Jones led to the last one, as Jon tried to explain to Jones how to \u201ccreate a dragon\u2019s brain.\u201d \u201cMy brain wasn\u2019t conducive to thinking,\u201d Jon said.\n\nAfter a few hours at the homeless shelter, Jon called home, ready to take medications. He has been there since. Sober for three years, he leads Narcotics and Alcoholics Anonymous groups. As a hobby, he grows coral in a 75-gallon saltwater tank, his hermit crabs hiding amid bursts of purple, green and orange.\n\nTrez Buckland went back to school, earning a Ph.D. in nursing to understand her son\u2019s illness. Her prescription for reform is shared by many other families: loosen restrictive psychiatric commitment laws, and give parents a greater role in their adult children\u2019s treatment.\n\n\u201cParents can play a vital role in keeping their kids alive, and the system doesn\u2019t allow it. It\u2019s very frustrating.\u201d\n\nNot enough care to meet demand\n\nGabriel Campanario / The Seattle Times Gabriel Campanario / The Seattle Times\n\nMORE than 525,000 Washingtonians signed up for insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act, dropping the uninsured rate to 10.7 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s good news, but it also presents a problem. In this state and nationally, years of wavering commitment to building up the health-care workforce leaves the cupboard mostly bare, especially for specialties like psychiatry.\n\nThe U.S. needs about 30,000 more psychiatrists, with the need growing further away from cities. Washington\u2019s urban areas have about 11 psychiatrists per 1,000 people; rural areas, 2.4, the University of Washington\u2019s Center for Health Workforce Studies found.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hire people fast enough,\u201d said Rick Weaver of Central Washington Comprehensive Mental Health. He has hired 170 mental-health staffers since January.\n\nPrescription: Washington\u2019s congressional delegation should encourage the Obama administration to approve the state\u2019s integration grant request. The Legislature should refocus on enticing more people to go into the mental-health-care field. Additionally, it should pass a bill allowing mental-health professionals to treat patients remotely via video link.\n\nThe state Legislature, under budget pressure in recent years, severely cut a student-loan-repayment fund intended to entice health workers to work in underserved areas. A task force to address state health-care personnel shortages recommends restoring $3.5 million in annual funding.\n\nFor a longer-term solution, the state has an ambitious plan to fully integrate its separate, Balkanized mental and physical health-care programs by 2020. If fully realized, this plan is estimated to save the state more than $1 billion. Gov. Jay Inslee submitted a $92 million federal grant proposal last month.\n\nStory: Separate silos of care\n\nWHEN it comes to the shortage of psychiatrists, J\u00fcrgen Un\u00fctzer has diagnosed the problem. Doctors can take \u201ca bag of cash\u201d to do cataract surgery, or \u201ctake less money, less prestige, to work with severely disabled, poor patients \u2026 There will never be enough specialists.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an unusual concession, coming from the guy whose job is to produce psychiatrists at the University of Washington. But Un\u00fctzer, the psychiatry department chairman, has a solution, and it is entering the mainstream thanks in part to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHe advocates for integration, based on a simple idea. Historical \u201csilos\u201d separating mental- and physical-health care often miss connections, such as diabetes and anxiety or severe weight gain associated with some drugs.\n\nUn\u00fctzer has the research to prove integration works. A multistate study of 1,801 elderly patients with depression found that integrating mental-health specialists into primary-care clinics saved $3,363 per patient, and the patients stayed healthier. That model has since been rolled out to about 200 clinics statewide.\n\nWashington\u2019s Medicaid program is now proposing complete integration, with Un\u00fctzer in on the planning. Making it work, he said, requires a shift in health-care financing to \u201cpay for performance,\u201d which rewards doctors not for just providing a service, but for getting patients healthier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple concept that makes sense to people,\u201d said Un\u00fctzer. \u201cThe reality is that it\u2019s a huge challenge because we\u2019re 30 years into these separate silos.\u201d\n\nThe empty promise of mental-health parity\n\nGabriel Campanario / The Seattle Times Gabriel Campanario / The Seattle Times\n\nMENTAL-health parity sounds great on paper. Passed by the state Legislature in 2005 and U.S. Congress in 2008, laws require health-insurance companies to cover mental-health care on par with physical-health care. The Affordable Care Act further stiffened that mandate.\n\nBut parity has too often been an empty promise.\n\nInsurers have continued to impose restrictions on therapy visits, to deny types of evidence-based interventions and to gum up claims with extensive demands for prior authorization.\n\nNew York\u2019s attorney general settled three parity cases in the past year against insurers, including a $31 million settlement against EmblemHealth for denying mental-health claims at a rate two-thirds higher than physical-health claims. In California, denials for mental-health claims were overtuned at the appeals level at a significantly higher rate than for physical-health claims.\n\nPrescription: Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler should push insurers to live up to the mental health parity law, and pursue enforcement against companies who fail. He should also use the existing law to compile and release insurance appeals.\n\nThere is no data available in Washington because Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler hasn\u2019t compiled it. Nor has his office pursued a single mental-health parity case in the nine years since the state law took effect. Kreidler, who finally issued clarifying rules on the state parity law last month, acknowledges that \u201cnot all insurers treat it like other carriers.\u201d\n\nMental-health providers such as Lauren Harris, a Shoreline therapist, already know that. She recently complained to Kreidler\u2019s office about an insurer\u2019s restrictions on visits for a client who has severe anxiety and depression. \u201cI thought parity is what it meant. But it isn\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\nStory: Insurers in denial\n\nTHE 11-year-old girl was intellectually gifted and able to play the piano by ear. She made fantastical drawings. She loved playing Pok\u00e9mon with her younger sister.\n\nBut this spring, the girl, J.F. , was gripped by severe mental illness. She could hear animals speak, believed she had a real Pok\u00e9mon family, tried to drown her younger sister and threatened to stab herself, according to medical notes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gut-wrenching, horrendous experience,\u201d said her mother, Amy Bushlach of Issaquah. \u201cThe closest thing I can compare it to is the death of a child, because of the severity of her illness.\u201d\n\nDiagnosed with a major mental illness, J.F. spent three months in inpatient mental-health treatment at Ryther Child Center. Bushlach saw her daughter \u201cre-emerge.\u201d\n\nIn June, Bushlach\u2019s insurance, Moda Health, denied further coverage. The daughter\u2019s doctors recommended a longer stay. Moda said it was not medically necessary because J.F. made only modest improvement.\n\nThe Bushlachs lost an appeal, and due to pay Ryther\u2019s $13,600-a-month cost, they sent J.F. to live with grandparents, desperate to keep her away from younger siblings, including a 9-month-old.\n\nJ.F. continues to struggle, but is reducing antipsychotic medications because of severe, possibly irreversable side effects. \u201cWe\u2019re right back to where we were before Ryther, after all that work,\u201d Bushlach said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating.\u201d\n\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
