The AFL-CIO, though, on Wednesday approved a resolution anyway calling the law \"highly disruptive\" to union plans.\n\nBut reports have surfaced on a plan that would give union workers -- and only union workers -- subsidies to help pay for health insurance even if they're covered through their job. The purported \"carve-out\" could soothe the simmering discontent within Big Labor. The loyal Democratic supporters and early champions of ObamaCare say they have been slighted by the act\u2019s final regulations, which they say is pushing some employees into part-time work and threatens their health insurance plans.\n\nAt least three congressional Republicans are trying to stop any effort to give the unions special treatment, which could cost $200 billion over 10 years.\n\nSen. John Thune, R-S.D., on Monday introduced the \"Union Bailout Prevention Act,\" which would stop the granting of subsidies to offset premium costs for the multi-employer plans held by many union members. Separately, the House voted on Thursday to stop all subsidies until the administration launches a system to verify recipients are eligible.\n\nBig Labor argues that workers without additional subsidies will switch to less-expensive, major-insurer plans, creating a withering effect on the so-called Taft-Hartley plans.\n\nThune and others argue the plans are already government-subsidized and the workers\u2019 contributions are already tax-exempt.\n\n\u201cA deal such as this by the administration for the union would be illegal,\u201d Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch and Michigan Rep. Dave Camp said in a letter Tuesday to the Treasury Department. \u201cGiving union workers exchange subsidies in addition to the income-tax exclusion would be double dipping.\u201d\n\nNews reports about the plan have been circulating for days, including an early one by the Inside Washington news service. The Health and Human Services Department did not return calls or emails from FoxNews.com asking about the veracity of those reports.\n\nLabor unions launched a multi-targeted attack this summer to force changes to ObamaCare, including one on the mandate for employers to offer insurance to full-time employees, which they say has resulted in more part-time jobs. Though that provision has been delayed, the concern is that employers are shaving the number of full-time employees in order to stay under the law's threshold for when they have to start offering coverage.\n\n\u201cUnless you and the Obama administration enact an equitable fix, the (Affordable Care Act) will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour work week,\u201d union leaders wrote in a letter this summer to congressional Democratic leaders.\n\nThe letter, co-signed by the Teamsters union, was sent to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada, and followed a resolution by a Nevada chapter of the AFL-CIO hammering on the same issues.\n\n\u201cThe unintended consequences of the ACA will lead to the destruction of the 40-hour work week \u2026 and force union members onto more costly plans,\u201d the resolution stated.\n\nLabor unions also feel slighted because low-income Americans are eligible for subsidies to help them purchase insurance through exchanges or marketplaces created by ObamaCare, when enrollment begins Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cOther stakeholders have repeatedly received successful interpretations for their respective grievances,\u201d the unions told Pelosi and Reid in the July letter.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "executive",
