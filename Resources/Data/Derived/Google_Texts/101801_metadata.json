This is dealing with national security,\u201d Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., told reporters Tuesday. \u201cThis dialogue about immigration and all the people that are coming across the border, it doesn\u2019t do justice to the fact that it is a serious security breach, and if we\u2019re going to take seriously dealing with ISIS and other terrorist groups across the globe, then we have to secure the border.\u201d\n\nRep. Dave Brat, R-Va., criticized Immigration and Customs Enforcement, specifically, for failing to enforce the laws on the books, particularly when it comes to illegal immigrants who appear in court, are released, and don\u2019t show up again.\n\n\u201cIf we would follow the law for starters, that would go a long way toward solving a lot of the problems,\u201d Brat said.\n\nWhile Brat and Salmon voiced concern over the security of the nation\u2019s southern border, Rep. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., told reporters that the country needs to focus on collecting intelligence on the ground in order to prevent terror attacks from occurring on U.S. soil.\n\n\u201cWith regard to ISIS, I think around the world we do need to embed more into the communities that are hotbeds or breeding grounds of these radicals and try to nip it in the bud as early as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cI think on the ground, intelligence that\u2019s gathered nationwide is going to have to be an ongoing source of information, and it\u2019s not going to be inexpensive, and it\u2019s not going to happen overnight.\u201d\n\nFears surrounding U.S. security risks mounted further Tuesday after deadly bombings occurred in Brussels, killing at least 30 people and injuring more than 200. The terror attacks took place at the city\u2019s international airport and a subway station, and ISIS later claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\nThe bombings in Brussels came four days after Belgian authorities captured Salah Abdeslam, a suspect in November\u2019s terror attacks, in the capital city. Abdeslam was one of 10 men police believe were directly involved in terror attacks carried out by ISIS in Paris late last year, which left 130 dead.\n\nThe terror attacks in Paris sparked a debate among lawmakers about how the U.S. should address Syrian refugees entering the country, as well as whether Congress should alter the visa waiver program.\n\nThe House of Representatives passed a bill in November toughening the screenings of Syrians looking to come to the U.S. through the refugee program. The legislation failed in the Senate.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress, though, ultimately passed a measure through an omnibus spending bill, signed into law by President Barack Obama, that tightened the program\u2019s requirements and required anyone who visited Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria after March 1, 2011, to apply for a visa.\n\nFollowing Tuesday\u2019s terror attacks in Brussels, GOP lawmakers once again called into question the process by which people come to the U.S.\n\nSens. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., Tim Scott, R-S.C., and David Vitter, R-La., separately called on their colleagues and the Obama administration to reexamine both the refugee program and visa system.\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., meanwhile, said it\u2019s inevitable that terrorists will try to enter the country through the refugee program.\n\n\u201cYou have to take ISIS at their word,\u201d Huelskamp told The Daily Signal. \u201cThey are going to infiltrate [the refugee program], and if we had anybody else as president, even some Democrats have said we need to take a time out to understand what\u2019s going on here. They have made it very clear they\u2019re going to misuse our immigrant refugee system in order to infiltrate.\u201d\n\nThe Kansas Republican, though, said it\u2019s unlikely the president would sign legislation halting the program or lessening the number of Syrian refugees coming into the U.S. this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a situation where he would actually want to do something,\u201d Huelskamp said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reps.
