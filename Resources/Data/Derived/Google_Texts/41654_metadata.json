However, employment practices liability price increases continue to drop, as do commercial property prices, which continue to show small but stable price decreases. Survey results indicated large account prices increasing at a lower rate than small and mid-market accounts.\n\nCarriers reported an improvement of 2% in loss ratios in accident-year-to-date 2015 relative to the same period in 2014, as earned price increases continue to offset reported claim cost inflation for many lines. This builds on the estimated improvement of nearly 2% between 2013 and 2014.\n\n\u201cCommercial insurers still report favorable loss ratio trends in aggregate, even after many quarters of slowing price increases,\u201d said Alejandra Nolibos, a director with Towers Watson\u2019s Property & Casualty Insurance practice. \u201cHowever, price increases are barely offsetting loss cost inflation in some lines; we may start to see pressure on the bottom line as reserve redundancies dry up,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to Towers Watson, CLIPS data are based on both new and renewal business figures obtained directly from carriers underwriting the business, and represent a cross section of U.S. property & casualty insurers that includes many of the top 10 commercial lines companies and the top 25 insurance groups in the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Commercial insurance prices increased in aggregate at a modest pace during the first quarter of 2015, according to Towers Watson.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "Commercial insurance prices increased in aggregate at a modest pace during the first quarter of 2015, according to Towers Watson.", "title": "Commercial insurance prices increase 2% in first quarter", "url": "http://ifawebnews.com/2015/06/15/commercial-insurance-prices-increase-2-in-first-quarter/", "image": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Alejandra-Nolibos.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-15T14:58:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-18T00:03:44+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "Fve8IDDdj94aX4Ar18+v33qGgAesGnY2YiqbnR5P17I="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8f9\"", "article_summary": "Commercial insurance prices increased in aggregate at a modest pace during the first quarter of 2015, according to the latest Commercial Lines Insurance Pricing Survey (CLIPS) conducted by global professional services company Towers Watson.\nHowever, employment practices liability price increases continue to drop, as do commercial property prices, which continue to show small but stable price decreases.\nPrice increases for most insurance lines were in the low single digits, with commercial auto and employment practices liability reporting the largest increases.\nThe survey compared prices charged on policies underwritten during the first quarter of 2015 to those charged for the same coverage during the same quarter in 2014, and found prices for the first quarter of this year to be 2% higher than for the same period last year.\n\u201cCommercial insurers still report favorable loss ratio trends in aggregate, even after many quarters of slowing price increases,\u201d said Alejandra Nolibos, a director with Towers Watson\u2019s Property & Casualty Insurance practice."}
