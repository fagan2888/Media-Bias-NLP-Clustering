Pete Crossland, D-Copley Township, in Summit County.\n\nRenacci, 55, first was elected to the 16th District House seat in 2010 after serving a term as mayor of Wadsworth.\n\nThe district, which was redrawn in 2012 following the 2000 Census, covers eastern Medina County \u2014 including the cities of Brunswick, Medina and Wadsworth \u2014 western and southern suburbs of Cleveland, western Summit County, portions of western Portage and Stark counties and Wayne County.\n\nRenacci has made reining in spending and repealing the Affordable Care Act top priorities during his time in office and the centerpiece of his re-election campaign.\n\nCrossland, 76, said Renacci\u2019s voting record is the reason he entered the race.\n\n\u201cI was shocked when I saw how my congressman voted,\u201d Crossland said. \u201cHe\u2019s a tea party extremist.\u201d\n\nRenacci acknowledged he receives backing from a range of supporters, including some tea party members. But he said his voting record was not extreme. He pointed to endorsements from five building-trade unions this year as proof he has appeal outside traditional Republican circles.\n\n\u201cMy opponent likes to use Democratic talking points to stay away from the issues,\u201d Renacci said. \u201cI have a bipartisan working group that gets things done.\u201d\n\nThe bipartisan group Renacci refers to is one he formed with U.S. Rep. John Carney, D-Delaware.\n\nRenacci said the group has about 20 members and has made an impact on legislation. The group introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at exempting Americans who reside in other countries, including some businessmen and members of the armed forces.\n\nThose groups typically have different health care coverage more suited to their needs. Some aspects of the bill have been included in reforms approved by the Senate and signed into law.\n\nHe said the bipartisan committee also has introduced other reforms to the ACA that he hopes can be approved when Congress returns from recess. The group Renacci meets with grew to include nearly 60 members of Congress during the government shutdown, and though it\u2019s returned to lower levels, he hopes they can continue to find common ground.\n\n\u201cWe get together three times a month and we try to find things we can work together on,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Crossland said Renacci\u2019s voting record is anything but bipartisan.\n\n\u201cRenacci votes 97 percent of the time with Republicans,\u201d Crossland said.\n\nCrossland argued that real bipartisanship means collaborating with leaders on both sides of the aisle on major political reforms \u2014 reforming immigration laws, passing energy reform and other major legislation.\n\n\u201cI was in the Ohio Legislature for a little over 10 years and I understand the climate of a legislative body,\u201d Crossland said.\n\nCrossland said Renacci is most known for voting against the ACA numerous times.\n\n\u201cAbout 16,000 people in this district now have health care thanks to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Crossland said. \u201cObamacare is clearly a mixed bag, but they have nothing to replace it with.\u201d\n\nRenacci said that wasn\u2019t true.\n\n\u201cWhen people say we\u2019ve voted to repeal it, we\u2019ve also voted to replace it in some way,\u201d Renacci said. \u201cThe bills aren\u2019t even taken up in the Senate.\u201d\n\nCrossland also criticized Renacci for not working to develop reforms for immigration and energy policies.\n\n\u201cHis whole idea is to get the government out of the way and let the free market solve the problems,\u201d Crossland said. \u201cBut we need some government to protect the environment and to govern.\u201d\n\nRenacci said he\u2019s opposed to some proposals on energy reform because of the impact stronger emissions limits would have on Ohio coal production.\n\n\u201cWe should not be bankrupting coal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go to our coal plants in Ohio, you can see they\u2019re already complying with our emissions standards.\u201d\n\nRenacci said he supports new legislation that would require the Environmental Protection Agency to get approval from Congress when making changes that would have a major impact on industries.\n\n\u201cWe said if it affects the economy by more than $100 million, you need to come to Congress and talk about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re the elected body. They need to come and tell us why these (regulations) need to be done.\u201d\n\nCrossland has taken aim at Renacci for more than just his policy stances. On Sept. 10, Crossland filed an ethics complaint with the House Ethics Committee against Renacci. Crossland took issue with the lobbying Renacci\u2019s office did for Akron businessman Ben Suarez in 2011.\n\nRenacci\u2019s campaign accepted $90,000 from Suarez and his employees in 2011. His congressional office also wrote a letter to Gov. John Kasich on Suarez\u2019s behalf, asking him to intervene in a legal case in California where Suarez faced charges against his corporation.\n\nSuarez was found not guilty of campaign fraud but was found guilty of witness tampering in June.\n\nRenacci returned the money his campaign received.\n\nCrossland said Renacci made a mistake by accepting the donation in the first place.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wrong to take that much money from one person,\u201d Crossland said. \u201cAnd one person doesn\u2019t give you that much money unless they want something.\u201d\n\nRenacci said the courts have never charged him or his office and he doesn\u2019t think he should be tied to Suarez now that the case has been settled.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing has been debated in the press for three years now, and it was debated during the last election,\u201d he said. \u201cOur office was never a part of this issue and the courts have made their decision and I leave it at that.\u201d\n\nCrossland also filed an ethics complaint against Renacci about his use of federal mailings to send a flyer in June to seniors describing a \u201c60-plus\u201d program.\n\n\u201cThe mailing was indistinguishable from an election campaign brochure,\u201d Crossland claimed in his ethics complaint.\n\nBut Renacci said the mailing met standards set by the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards Regulations.\n\n\u201cWe have spent some of the least amount of dollars,\u201d for the mailing, Renacci said. He said a recent report found his office has only spent $1,600 compared to $40,000 spent in other districts. The $1,600 amount was calculated in June before his most recent mailing was sent.\n\nCrossland and Renacci agreed that in January Congress must work with President Barack Obama to address the terror threat faced by the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, also called ISIS.\n\nRenacci said he authorized the president to mobilize air strikes and some forces in Syria but said he expects an update on Dec. 12. He did take issue with Obama\u2019s warning that the United States would not put troops on the ground.\n\n\u201cYou cannot tell the enemy what you won\u2019t do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot have a strategy where we say we won\u2019t do this or we won\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nCrossland said he agrees that special operations should be mobilized and gathering intelligence in the region, but said he doesn\u2019t believe in a full-scale war operation.\n\n\u201cI think the president is handling it well,\u201d Crossland said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to criticize the president for saying we won\u2019t put boots on the ground. I know the American people don\u2019t want to get involved in a land war, and he\u2019s made it clear that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nContact reporter Loren Genson at (330) 721-4063 or lgenson@medina-gazette.com.
