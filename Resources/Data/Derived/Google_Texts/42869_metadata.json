HNE announced at the end of November that it would no longer participate in MassHealth CarePlus as of February 2016.\n\nHNE, which insured some 16,000 individuals through CarePlus, will continue to insure some 64,000 other consumers through its participation in other MassHealth plans. In dropping CarePlus, the Springfield based not-for-profit insurer, whose parent company is Baystate Health, said costs exceeded reimbursement rates for the health insurance.\n\nCarePlus, which is based on a more managed care approach to wellness and a value-based payment model, was introduced (pdf) as Medicaid was expanded in the state under the Affordable Care Act in 2014. It is for adults 21 to 64 years old whose income is at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level, and who do not qualify for MassHealth Standard.\n\n\"As of now, only a small number of Health New England CarePlus members have transitioned out of HNE. However, we expect many more members will move between now and the end of January,\" MassHealth officials said last week.\n\n\"To avoid any gaps in coverage, for HNE CarePlus members who don't proactively select a new plan before Feb. 1, MassHealth will assign them to a new plan effective Feb. 1.\"\n\nAccording to those officials, HNE CarePlus members can select a new plan up until Jan. 29 by phone or online.\n\nCoverage options available in Western Massachusetts include MassHealth's Primary Care Clinician Plan (MassHealth's in-house managed care program) and several other CarePlus managed care organizations including Boston Medical Center HealthNet Plan, CeltiCare, Neighborhood Health Plan and Tufts Health Plan.\n\n\"MassHealth is working with HNE and the other plans to ensure a smooth transition for affected members, that is, outreach to affected members and ensuring transfer of information to support continuity of care,\" one MassHealth official said.\n\n\"Baystate is in the Primary Care Clinician Plan network, so CarePlus members who want to get their care at Baystate can transition to the PCC Plan\"\n\nThe official added that all \"CarePlus plans are required to meet contract standards for access to services, including hospitals, in their networks in the geographic regions they serve.\"\n\n\"The MCOs are each contracted with other hospitals in the area and meet MassHealth's standards,\" said the official, in reference to other hospitals, like Holyoke Medical Center and Berkshire Medical Center, in Western Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nFor enrollment help, consumers may call the MassHealth Customer Service Center Monday through Friday at (1-800) 841-2900 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. (TTY: (1-800) 497-4648 for people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech disabled.)\n\nConsumers may also visit the website www.mass.gov/masshealth, where they can select \"Enroll in a Health Plan,\" then click the \"Enroll Now\" button to pick a new plan.\n\nThere is also a walk-in MassHealth Enrollment Center in downtown Springfield at 333 Bridge St. Hours are Monday through Friday from 8:45 a.m. to 5 p.m. It is one of six walk-in centers around the state.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health New England, MassHealth, Elaine Mann, MassHealth Enrollment Center, CarePlus, HNE, Primary Care Clinician Plan, careplus, health, health-new-england, masshealth, news", "title": "Health New England CarePlus members reminded of deadline to select new coverage", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Health New England CarePlus members reminded of deadline to select new coverage\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/12/health_new_england_careplus_members_reminded_of_deadline_to_select_new_coverage.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/breakingnews/photo/2015/11/30/19297026-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17657600\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-21T15:34:25Z\", \"author\": \"Anne-Gerard Flynn | aflynn@repub.com\", \"tags\": [\"@homepage\",\"@mobile\",\"careplus\",\"health\",\"health-new-england\",\"masshealth\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/breakingnews/photo/2015/11/30/19297026-standard.jpg", "creator": "@aflynn2", "site": "@masslivenews", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "HNE CarePlus members can select a new plan up until Jan. 29 by phone or online.
