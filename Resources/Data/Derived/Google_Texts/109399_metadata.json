When I called I was told that only new were done and the tone was go do it online and don't bother us.\n\nPerhaps you can find out just what their policy is. \u2014 WP\n\nDear WP: The Longmont Post Office processes new and renewed passport applications.\n\nHowever, according to Postal Service spokesman David Rupert, \"we do tell everyone that renewals can be done through the mail and they don't need to come in.\"\n\n\"The customers can obtain applications at the post office or through the State Department website. We tell everyone who asks for a renewal to check out the website.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that you will need an appointment \u2014 per State Department policy \u2014 to obtain or renew a passport at the post office. Of course, you knew that already because the Longmont P.O. website says so. Also, a renewal will cost you an extra $25 if a postal clerk verifies and processes your forms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll that said, you still should expect to be able to get your passport renewal done at the post office. It's part of their job.\n\n\"We have many customers say they would like us to help them anyway and we schedule them in and process their application,\" Rupert said via email. \"Pictures can be done here as well with no appointment necessary.\"\n\nI checked: They don't do photos over the lunch hour.\n\nOne more thing, WP. Rupert said the management will remind employees who answer the phones to be more courteous.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_29423771/johnnie-st-vrain-post-office-will-handle-your", "modificationDate": "2016-01-25T08:52:54-0700", "sailthru.section": "Johnnie St. Vrain", "endDate": "2026-01-23T15:46:10-0700", "description": "Dear Johnnie: The  Longmont Post Office website says passports \u2014 new and renewal \u2014 are available at their office.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:29423771:view"}, "startDate": "2016-01-24T16:00:00-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_29423771/johnnie-st-vrain-post-office-will-handle-your", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "Dear Johnnie: The  Longmont Post Office website says passports \u2014 new and renewal \u2014 are available at their office.", "title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: The post office will handle your passport renewal, too"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Dear Johnnie: The  Longmont Post Office website says passports \u2014 new and renewal \u2014 are available at their office.", "title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: The post office will handle your passport renewal, too", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_29423771/johnnie-st-vrain-post-office-will-handle-your", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-24T16:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: The post office will handle your passport renewal, too", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2016-01-23T15:50:35-0700"}, "article_summary": "Dear Johnnie: The Longmont Post Office website says passports \u2014 new and renewal \u2014 are available at their office.\nAdvertisementAll that said, you still should expect to be able to get your passport renewal done at the post office.\n\u2014 WPDear WP: The Longmont Post Office processes new and renewed passport applications.\nThe reason for this is that you will need an appointment \u2014 per State Department policy \u2014 to obtain or renew a passport at the post office.\n\"The customers can obtain applications at the post office or through the State Department website."}
