Barely in her teens, Sheridan\u2019s sister died of uterine cancer at the age of 13 in 1951. Two of her brothers died of cancer \u2013 lung and pancreatic. And, she herself has been breast cancer free for 17 years.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until her sister, her dearest friend and confidant died from the disease that Sheridan became incensed.\n\n\u201cCancer didn\u2019t make me angry until my older sister was diagnosed with leukemia in 2010. That\u2019s when I got mad,\u201d said the New Orleans woman. \u201cA lot of people around me have died from cancer \u2013 friends, cousins, family \u2013 but it was just something about my sister getting it that I just didn\u2019t think was fair, and I\u2019ve been angry ever since.\u201d\n\nSheridan plans to bring her emotions \u2014 rage, love, grief and whatever else that bubbles up \u2014 to the five-week long, creative-writing workshop, Poems & Pink Ribbons. The third annual series, scheduled to start on September 14 at the Rosa Keller Library, is for breast cancer patients, breast cancer survivors as well as their loved ones.\n\nLast year, Sheridan wrote \u201cCravings;\u201d in which she describes a hankering for fried chicken during the program. Writing verse about food may come off as trivial or amateurish. Yet, in the crafting of this piece there was a point of self-discovery.\n\n\u201cI mentioned that one of my chemo cravings was McKenzie\u2019s Chicken in a Box because it tasted like mama\u2019s,\u201d Sheridan, 64, said. \u201cI was really \u2026 craving my mother, and that really struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nMoments like these are what make Poems & Pink Ribbons a therapeutic literary voyage, a one-of-a-kind support group that encourages honest dialogue on such a sensitive subject while providing participants the safe space to process the range of grief through creative writing and poetry.\n\n\u201cI truly believe we don\u2019t know how we feel until we write it down,\u201d said P&PR founder, poet Kelly Harris.\n\nNote: Kelly Harris and jewel bush will both be appearing on a panel discussing the MelaNated Writers Collective at Rising Tide on Saturday at Xavier University.\n\nWhen Harris\u2019 mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004, she was so distraught that she couldn\u2019t even utter \u201cbreast cancer\u201d out loud. Instead, she referred to it as the \u201cBig C.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer calling it the \u2018Big C\u2019 made it even bigger for me,\u201d Harris explained.\n\nOctober is National Breast Cancer Awareness month and to commemorate there\u2019s the merchandising, the fundraising walks, the NFL players wearing pink-accented uniforms, pink spatulas, pink batteries; and, of course, pink ribbons.\n\nBut sometimes, despite the heightened awareness, the meaning is drowned in a sea of pink \u2014 pink fatigue.\n\n\u201cUnderneath all the pink, there\u2019s unresolved emotional issues: How do you resolve that mom is gone? How do you redefine family if mom is gone or how do you see yourself after you\u2019ve had breast reconstruction?\u201d Harris said. \u201cPeople are really not aware what it feels like to have lost a loved one. You\u2019re not going to get that conversation at a walk or wearing pink socks.\u201d\n\nP&PR is the outlet that allows for deeper discourse around breast cancer \u2013 and healing. Participants don\u2019t have to be published authors or experts in writing to enroll in the free program to receive instruction from top-notch local and regional writers like Melissa Dickey, Gina Ferrara, Maurice Ruffin, Alison Pelegrin and Jarvis DeBerry, Harris\u2019 husband, who lost his mother to breast cancer in 2011.\n\nHarris served as the primary caregiver for her mother who was diagnosed at Stage 3. Her mother\u2019s care became priority No. 1. Then in her 20s and living in her native, Ohio, Harris postponed graduate school and got a full-time job. Her life became nonstop doctor\u2019s appointments, emergency room visits and trips to the pharmacy. Near-always at her mother\u2019s bedside, Harris allowed herself one act of literary self-preservation during this period: a week at the writer\u2019s retreat, Cave Canem. It was there she met DeBerry in 2005.\n\n\u201cI felt guilty being gone the whole time. I was a grouch. Everyone seemed so intellectually poetic, and I felt it was a mistake me being there,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSo when it was time for me to introduce myself, I said, \u2018My name is Kelly. My mom has breast cancer, and I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter, Harris\u2019 ornery, yet endearing introduction, DeBerry walked up to her and said, \u201cIt takes a lot of courage to want to be a poet.\u201d\n\nThere is a similar sentiment behind P&PR, bringing survivors, patients and family members together to audaciously write through the hurt.\n\nLast year, a woman in the session had one breast and struggled with body image issues. One was quiet, but did the work. It wasn\u2019t until the end of the course, at the public reading, she summoned the courage to share her creative work in front of an audience. At 67, it was her first time reading a poem aloud. Another participant lost her daughter to violence while undergoing treatment.\n\nJo Thompson, a 12-year breast cancer survivor, said the expertise of each of the artists was amazing, \u201cThey all had a unique approach in sharing their gifts with us and supporting us to feel empowered in sharing our written words. I have never considered myself a poet nor had I ever thought my writings/journaling/poems were ever anything more than just fun for me.\u201d\n\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. It is estimated that 234,580 people will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the United State during 2013, according to National Cancer Institute. A little more than 40,000 people will die from the disease this year.\n\nA woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer basically doubles if she has a first-degree relative \u2013mother, sister, daughter \u2014 who has been diagnosed. Breast cancer is rare in men, but not all together impossible. In 2013, it is estimated. there will be 2,240 new cases of invasive breast cancer in men and 410 breast cancer deaths in the nation.\n\nBreast cancer is a costly illness bearing a financial strain due to frequent hospital stays, expensive drug prescriptions, procedures, co-pays and out-of-pocket costs that quickly add up. Approximately 386,000 women, more than 27.4% of women in Louisiana, are uninsured, according to figures from the National Women\u2019s Law Center. The numbers are higher for women of color. In Louisiana, 34.8% of Black women and 54.8% of Hispanic women are uninsured compared to 22.8% of White women.\n\nLouisiana is on the list of 21 total states in the U.S. that refused to expand Medicaid eligibility through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act dubbed Obamacare for short \u2013 and to be insulting. This means that more than 5 million low-income, struggling folks across the country will not have their health care needs met, a large percentage women. The need for women, forward-thinking women, who will truly represent the best interests of all women regardless of class, educational background and socio-economic status, to serve in elected positions on all levels of government is tremendous.\n\n\u201cWe need more women in the legislature. These men have no clue. You would think they do because they have wives, mothers and daughters, but it has got to come from the female perspective,\u201d said Sheridan, a longtime American Cancer Society volunteer.\n\n\u201cIf women don\u2019t feel comfortable running for office, it is incumbent upon us to be advocates for women\u2019s issues. If it weren\u2019t for the women in our State Legislature, Sen. Karen Carter Peterson and Rep. Helena Moreno, we might have lost breast and cervical cancer funding.\u201d\n\nP&PR is a form of emotional, spiritual advocacy, which manages grief while celebrating the triumph of the human condition. Laughter is mixed in with the tears. Some are for joy. Some are to mourn. All are a release.\n\nHarris\u2019 mother survived breast cancer, but her mother-in-law didn\u2019t, both of which motivated Harris to launch P&PR, a labor of love and healing.\n\n\u201cSometimes we grieve alone or in silence. P&PR comes out of pain. It comes out of knowing women who have died of breast cancer. They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to participate in something like this,\u201d said Harris, who holds a MFA in poetry with a concentration in art therapy from Lesley University in Cambridge, Mass.\n\n\u201cWhat we do is a small dent in the work that needs to be done around breast cancer. I\u2019m not a physician, but I believe in the power of words and that they can heal.\u201d\n\nThe workshop, funded in part by a grant by the Poets & Writers Inc., meets every Saturday from September 14 through October 19.
