Many voters who hoped to make up their minds before voting day attended the event and Trump made sure to try to get as many votes as possible.\n\nBefore his appearance at 5:00PM, there were several speakers who attacked President Obama\u2019s policies and Trump\u2019s current opponent, Marco Rubio, to whom the crowd yelled, \u201cMarco Whobio!\u201d The speakers decimated Rubio\u2019s proposals and Gang of Eight immigration bill, claiming it provided more leeway for sex offenders and criminals than it did for hard working American people. They made sure that the crowd remembered that voting Rubio was out of the question, employing the chant, \u201cWe want Donald Trump!\u201d and \u201cWhen do we want him?\u201d \u201cNow!!\u201d One speaker specifically pleaded, \u201cDo not vote for Marco Rubio!\u201d\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump\u2019s notorious policies made an appearance at the rally, such as his tax plan to improve economic growth, the infamous wall to be paid for by the Mexican government, his intents to repeal Obamacare, his intent to improve the state of veteran affairs protecting police officers, and of course, making America great again. In addition to these, Trump also promises to protect the right to keep and bear arms, as well as other freedoms provided in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nHis politicking was not exclusive to inside the stadium. There were several vendors outside the event selling \u201cBomb the s\u2014t outta ISIS\u201d t-shirts available in all sizes and also \u201ctrump that b\u2014h\u201d shirts in reference to Hillary Clinton.\n\nNon-supporters and protesters had a space to rally outside the event, in which they advertised statements such as, \u201cMake America great, spread love, not hate.\u201d Although the protesters were given a place to complain outside, there were several attendees who did not share Trump\u2019s values and when they began to protest, were escorted out of Trump\u2019s private event by security.\n\nWhen Trump finally arrived on stage, he was vigorously hoorayed and welcomed by the crowd. He went on to discuss crowd pleaser topics, such as his plan to build the wall between Mexico and the U.S. Trump noted that the Mexican president exhibited stiff skepticism and anger towards paying for the wall. Trump replied saying that he would raise the wall ten feet higher.\n\nThe biggest event at the rally, which Trump referred to as his \u201csurprise\u201d for the night, was the endorsement he received from Alabama Senator, Jeff Sessions. Sessions and Trump share similar, idealistic views. Sessions promotes Trump as the best candidate for President and Commander-in-Chief.\n\nVoting opened in Alabama on March 1, 2016. Trump was in the lead with 43% of the votes. His victory on Super Tuesday showed that his visit to Madison was successful. To learn more about Donald J.
