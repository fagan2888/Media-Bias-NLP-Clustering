Colorado\u2019s climate, with its sprinkling of 70-degree days in December and cool summer evenings \u2014 make these outdoor areas near-year-round living rooms.\n\nAnd when a porch or patio is all you have for outdoor space, it can be an extra challenge to make those rooms garden spaces.\n\n\u201cMore and more, we\u2019re seeing new homes being built with front porches to help neighbors create a stronger sense of community,\u201d said Annie Huston, an owner of Birdsall & Co. and Columbine Design.\n\nPorches are covered, walled and often partially enclosed. Old-fashioned porches once brought to mind senior citizens in rocking chairs, but anyone can enjoy a porch.\n\nWhether soothing a baby to sleep in a porch swing, reading on a chaise lounge, or entertaining guests, a porch offers a sheltered experience of the outdoors.\n\nCeilings and walls make a porch an enclosed space. On a patio, you have the option of walls if you want \u2014 and not if you don\u2019t. Some patios create walls with hedges or vine-clad fences, or get shelter from an overhanging roof.\n\nPatios, on the other hand, are often open to the capricious sky. If yours is, and you crave a sense of enclosure, let a tree provide a leafy canopy. Market umbrellas, pergolas or awnings can also grant protection from the elements.\n\n\u201cThe patio can become a second living room,\u201d said Laurie Jekel, owner of The Last Detail design shop. \u201cThe patio should be an extension of the house, very homey, decorated much as you would an interior.\u201d\n\nAnd whether it\u2019s a porch or a patio, gardening in containers will add color and life.\n\nFor a sequestered patio that she designed for a historic house in central Denver, Jekel planted large ceramic containers with plants that can cope with spring cold, even snow.\n\n\u201cThe containers are woodsy and natural to go with the storybook style of the house,\u201d Jekel said. \u201cThe house doesn\u2019t have a back yard, so the patio is their outdoor living space.\u201d\n\nThe homeowners enjoy their stately terrace for coffee in the morning, wine in the evening, family dinners and parties for friends. Complete with flagstone underfoot, a large stone fireplace and plenty of comfortable furniture, the patio is a tranquil courtyard.\n\nGardens, including those confined to containers, should engage the five senses, Jekel said: \u201cYou want to see it, feel it, smell it, taste it and hear it. I like water features on a porch or patio. They\u2019re soothing, and that\u2019s what we all need.\u201d\n\nIn her outdoor-room designs for porches, Huston considers two primary factors: traffic \u2014 whether it\u2019s foot or cars \u2014 and orientation to the sun.\n\n\u201cEastern exposure is perfect for morning coffee,\u201d she said. \u201cWestern exposure is great for sundowner cocktails.\u201d\n\nA beautiful porch can promote community \u2014 or provide privacy.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re designing a space for privacy, think about using planted containers to create a green room,\u201d said Huston. \u201cIf you plan on chatting with passers-by and people-watching, keep the space open,\u201d she advised, and use the planted containers on the path that leads up to the porch.\n\nGardening on a porch can lengthen Colorado\u2019s short growing season.\n\n\u201cA microclimate is created because of the protection afforded by the walls and roof,\u201d said Huston. \u201cPlants will be able to withstand cold temperatures on a porch longer than those planted in your garden.\u201d\n\nColleen Smith is a regular contributor to Grow and reviews concerts for heyreverb.com.\n\nPlanning a porch or patio garden\n\n\u2022 Consider how you use it. Outdoor kitchen/dining? A place to sit and read? Do you crave privacy, or community?\n\n\u2022 Measure. Using the dimensions of an outdoor space, draw a plan. \u201cThis will prevent the mistake of buying outsized furniture or cluttering your porch,\u201d said Annie Huston.\n\n\u2022 Furnish. Both Huston and Laurie Jekel add furniture first. \u201cWork with the style of your house,\u201d Jekel said. Huston recommends teak as an option that can stay outside all year.\n\n\u201cInvest in timeless furniture as the backbone of your porch,\u201d Huston said. \u201cComplement the style and color of your home\u2019s facade and the closest door to avoid clashing colors.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Accessorize. In addition to cushions and pillows, add confort with seasonal accessories. \u201cConsider an outdoor heater, mosquito screens and WiFi to make your space as functional as your living room or den,\u201d Huston said.\n\nJekel adds bowls of seashells, coasters, a mirror and architectural pieces. \u201cPlaques are wonderful, anything iron, anything antique,\u201d she said. \u201cAntique iron gates mounted on a wall give another dimension.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Light. Illuminate your patio with solar lights, candles, lanterns and chandeliers. \u201cI love those faux candles on timers,\u201d Jekel said. \u201cThey look real, but there\u2019s no fire hazard.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Container plants. \u201cPorch garden plants are seen, touched and smelled up-close,\u201d Huston said. \u201cConsider veined, bicolor and double blooms, variegated leaves, fragrant plants, herbs and edible flowers.\u201d\n\nJekel is big on dwarf trees in large pots. \u201cThey add interest, even in winter,\u201d she said. Jekel pots dwarf Japanese maples, evergreens and hydrangea, as well as Meyer lemons, noting that citrus trees must overwinter inside.\n\n\u2022 View. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to have something beautiful or interesting to look at from the porch,\u201d Huston said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Outdoor serenity: Add life to your yard", "title": "Outdoor serenity: Add life to your yard", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/13/outdoor-serenity-add-life-to-your-yard/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140513__20140516_L11_L11-FE16GRPORCHEp1.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140513__20140516_L11_L11-FE16GRPORCHEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-13T16:56:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:09:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7e9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to have something beautiful or interesting to look at from the porch,\u201d Huston said.\n\u201cInvest in timeless furniture as the backbone of your porch,\u201d Huston said.\n\u201cThe containers are woodsy and natural to go with the storybook style of the house,\u201d Jekel said.\nUsing the dimensions of an outdoor space, draw a plan.\n\u201cWork with the style of your house,\u201d Jekel said."}
