And not only have they grown, but according to Marketing and Sales VP Rick Gibson, that growth allowed them to add 18 employees\n\n(about a 60 percent increase in the work force) in the last decade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney\u2019s been put back into our company\u2013into our men. We invest a lot into our man power. We think the world of these guys and their families. We always want to provide them with a place of employment.\u201d\n\nGibson said most employees stay for years\u2013decades even (Gibson has worked for ATS since 1994). Older employees who could collect Social Security and want to work have chosen to stay with Appalachian Timber because of the company\u2019s loyalty to it\u2019s employees. According to Gibson, that loyalty to it\u2019s employees hasn\u2019t always been rewarded.\n\n\u201cIn recent times there\u2019s issues with insurance\u2013you know with Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, you get to a certain point with your company where you grow larger\u2013there is risk involved in growing larger. [But] we\u2019re looking to grow.\u201d\n\nThe company has fewer than 50 employees, and Gibson said they fear growing any further at the moment. Exceeding that threshold would change their status under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Gibson believes further growth could be on the way, but much of it depends on the renewal of a tax credit in 2017. It was last renewed in 2015, and carried over to 2016. The tax credit provides increased flexibility for railroad operators to maintain and upgrade their rail lines.\n\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen, we are concerned that short-line railroads might revert back to the 2005 practices where they only put the money into the maintenance as they needed,\u201d he said.\n\nCongressman Alex Mooney (R-WV) said that\u2019s where he feels government can actually play a role. Keep the tax credit alive, and that allows for further expansion for companies like Appalachian Timber. Mooney toured ATS on Wednesday\u2013receiving a closer look at what they do on a day-to-day basis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud that they\u2019re here,\u201d Mooney said. \u201cFrom my discussions [with them], they intend to stay here. Frankly, they even have opportunities to expand.\u201d\n\nATS is one of two companies of it\u2019s kind in West Virginia. They\u2019ve provided cross-ties to railroads in much of the New York transit area, but also provided materials for the Ben Franklin bridge that connects Camden, New Jersey and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the seven independent companies that\u2019s left,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cWest Virginia has two independent treating companies; we happen to be one of them. We\u2019re not the largest, but we average 250,000 cross-ties per year\u2013purchased and sold.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a big fan of the railroad system, and those railroads need upkeep and expansion,\u201d Mooney said. \u201cAnd I think there is a lot of opportunity here.\u201d\n\nATS operates in a very rural part of West Virginia, and Mooney said that the needs of rural communities is one of the times when members of both parties\u2013usually the ones serving rural communities\u2013are able to come together.\n\n\u201cWe have unique needs in rural areas, and sometimes it\u2019s overlooked,\u201d Mooney said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter for us in Congress to get together\u2013Congressman from lots of rural areas. We\u2019re not all condensed into one town or city like the big city ones are\u2013like New York City. We have to work across party lines.\u201d\n\nGibson said ATS employees come from all throughout the counties of Central West Virginia\u2013Webster, Clay, Calhoun, Lewis, and Braxton to name a few.\n\nHe\u2019s hopeful, despite the economic downturn, that they\u2019ll be able to add an additional six employees in the future. For now, he\u2019s just hopeful Congress renews the tax credit next year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mooney toured ATS on Wednesday", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Mooney toured ATS on Wednesday", "title": "Amidst Congressman\u2019s visit, Braxton County business sees potential for expansion", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2016/02/18/amidst-congressmans-visit-braxton-county-business-sees-potential-for-expansion/", "image": {"width": 4231, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160218_111834.jpg", "height": 2543}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160218_111834.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-18T16:22:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-18T16:22:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The tax credit provides increased flexibility for railroad operators to maintain and upgrade their rail lines.\nFor now, he\u2019s just hopeful Congress renews the tax credit next year.\nKeep the tax credit alive, and that allows for further expansion for companies like Appalachian Timber.\nFrankly, they even have opportunities to expand.\u201dATS is one of two companies of it\u2019s kind in West Virginia.\nBy Alex Wiederspiel in News | February 18, 2016 at 11:22AMSUTTON, W.Va. \u2014 In a period of economic turmoil in West Virginia, it\u2019s easy to forget that not every company is suffering."}
