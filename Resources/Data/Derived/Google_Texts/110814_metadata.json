But what are they and what do they mean to you?\n\nWilliam Lazonick is a leading expert on the history of the American business corporation. A professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, where he directs the Center for Industrial Competitiveness, he has long been watching a trend that has only recently been attracting media attention and forcing many to reassess the nasty form of capitalisim that has been unleashed on us in recent decades.\n\nIn an email interview with Lazonick, I asked him about how the widespread and little-understood obsession with stock buybacks among American executives is driving inequality and pushing prosperity further away from everyone except those at the very top. (Lazonick\u2019s in-depth exploration of this topic is available in the current issue of the Harvard Business Review.)\n\nHis answers are a clarion call for changing the way America does business.\n\nLynn Parramore: You\u2019ve been studying stock buybacks over the last 30 years. What exactly are they and why are you so interested in them?\n\nWilliam Lazonick: Let me start by answering the second part of your question first (in part because if I had just been studying stock buybacks over the past 30 years, I would be bored out of my mind by now).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, I was at Harvard Business School (HBS), working with the Business History Group led by the preeminent business historian Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. Previously I had spent 14 years as a graduate student and faculty member in the Harvard Economics Department where the main focus of my work was, as it remains, the role of business enterprise in the development of the economy. In working closely with Chandler, who in 1977 had published his pathbreaking book The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business, I learned five crucial lessons about my subject.\n\n1) From the last decades of the 19th century, the growth of major business corporations drove the development of the U.S. economy.\n\n2) Professional salaried managers controlled resource allocation in these business corporations, and hence their decisions determined the direction and intensity of corporate investment strategies.\n\n3) The key investments that these executives made were in organizational structures made up of employees who had the abilities and incentives to engage in collective and cumulative learning.\n\n4) The financial foundation for making these long-lived investments in organizational capabilities was after-tax earnings retained out of profits.\n\n5) Public shareholders who received a portion of after-tax profits in the form of dividends were rentiers who had nothing to do with the investment strategies and organizational structures that would determine the success, or possibly the failure, of these companies.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, I was already a longstanding critic of the conventional theory that argues the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of markets will allocate resources to their most efficient uses in the economy. Rather, in line with Chandler\u2019s notion of the \u201cvisible hand,\u201d employment opportunities and standards of living depend on the resource-allocation decisions of executives who run large business corporations.\n\nBased on 2007 data (the most recently collected), 1,925 companies in the United States that employed 5,000 or more people represented just 32-thousandths of one percent of all companies, but had 33 percent of all business employees, 37 percent of all business payrolls, and 43 percent of all business revenues. How the executives in control of these very large corporations allocate resources has a profound impact on how the economy performs.\n\nIn 1991, based largely on papers I presented at the HBS Business History Seminar over a six-year period, I published a book, Business Organization and the Myth of the Market Economy, in which I drew out the implications of the Chandlerian perspective (informed also by economists such as Marx, Marshall, Schumpeter, and Penrose) for a theory of how managerial capitalism can support stable and equitable economic growth.\n\nMeanwhile, at HBS in the last half of the 1980s, I witnessed first-hand how free-market ideology became dominant in the teaching of MBAs. Legitimized by a new ideology that for the sake of economic efficiency corporations should be run to \u201cmaximize shareholder value\u201d (MSV), a breed of Chicago-trained economists known as agency theorists argued that U.S. corporations should disgorge their cash flow to shareholders, not only in the traditional form of dividends, which reward shareholders for continuing to hold their stock, but also in the form of stock buybacks, which, by manipulating the company\u2019s stock price, reward \u201cshareholders\u201d for selling their stock. Agency theorists argued that incumbent managers could be induced to disgorge corporate cash to shareholders either by the stick of a hostile takeover or the carrot of stock-based executive compensation.\n\nI was one of the first academic critics of MSV. It is an ideology that argues for the allocation of corporate cash to those economic actors, public shareholders, who matter least to economic performance. I realized that MSV was not actually an ideology of public shareholders, either as individuals or institutional investors (for example, pension funds). Rather it quite quickly became an ideology of top corporate executives. If, as has certainly been the case since the 1980s, the companies that they control face new competitive challenges, they can just lay off thousands of long-serving employees, use corporate cash to manipulate their companies\u2019 stock prices through stock buybacks, and join the top 0.1% of the richest households with their ample stock-based pay. It is a corporate allocation regime I call \u201cdownsize-and-distribute.\u201d\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is what my article in the current issue of Harvard Business Review is all about.\n\nWhat exactly are stock buybacks? As I explain in the HBR article, some stock buybacks, done as tender offers, can actually reinforce the control over resource allocation of executives who want to \u201cretain-and-reinvest.\u201d They retain corporate earnings, and reinvest in the productive capabilities of the companies that they control. Warren Buffet used tender offers in this way in the 1980s to take complete control of the insurance company Geico, which has been a key business for financing the growth of Buffett\u2019s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (of which Geico became a wholly owned subsidiary in 1996). \u201cRetain-and-reinvest\u201d is what enabled large numbers of Americans (especially white males) who had secure career employment with corporations in the post-World War II decades to enjoy higher standards of living.\n\nBut that era of relatively stable and equitable economic growth is now gone, and the trillions of dollars that corporations have spent over the last three decades on open-market repurchases, which constitute at least 90 percent of stock buybacks, reflect the dominance of a \u201cdownsize-and-distribute\u201d corporate allocation regime that is largely responsible for the concentration of income at the top and the disappearance of middle-class employment opportunities. Open-market repurchases have one, and only one, purpose: to manipulate a company\u2019s stock price. And, with ample stock-based pay through which they can realize gains from a volatile stock market, prime beneficiaries of this mode of corporate resource allocation are the top executives who make the decisions to buybacks, often on the scale of hundreds of millions of dollars per day when it suits their purpose to give their company\u2019s stock price a manipulative boost.\n\nLP: How do stock buybacks enrich CEOs at the expense of workers?\n\nWL: On its Executive Paywatch website, the AFL-CIO charts the average pay of CEOs of major U.S. corporations to the average American worker, and for recent years has come up with a ratio of about 350:1. Actually, if executive pay is measured properly, the ratio is around 900:1. Even at 100:1, however, it would be way out of whack in cross-national and historical comparison. But a focus on the CEO:worker pay ratio misses the point. It is not the amount of pay CEOs rake in that causes untold harm to workers. It is how they get that high pay that is the major problem.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An expert explains our growing obsession with stock buybacks -- and how they're driving U.S. income inequality", "author": "Lynn Stuart Parramore", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "An expert explains our growing obsession with stock buybacks -- and how they're driving U.S. income inequality", "title": "The 1 percent\u2019s devious new scheme: How CEOs are getting rich at your expense", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/23/the_1_percents_most_devious_scheme_yet_how_ceos_are_getting_rich_at_your_expense_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/wall_street_bull.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An expert explains our growing obsession with stock buybacks -- and how they're driving U.S. income inequality", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/wall_street_bull.jpg", "title": "The 1 percent\u2019s devious new scheme: How CEOs are getting rich at your expense", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The 1 percent\u2019s devious new scheme: How CEOs are getting rich at your expense", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1 percent, AlterNet, Mac, Steve Jobs, Wall Street, warren buffet", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29ca\"", "article_summary": "LP: How do stock buybacks enrich CEOs at the expense of workers?\n1) From the last decades of the 19th century, the growth of major business corporations drove the development of the U.S. economy.\nLynn Parramore: You\u2019ve been studying stock buybacks over the last 30 years.\nWhat exactly are stock buybacks?\nRather it quite quickly became an ideology of top corporate executives."}
