It said that award would be paid out for information that helps detain persons who blew up the Russian plane in Egypt.\n\n\n\nPutin responded by saying the incident was one of the bloodiest acts in modern Russian history and ordered the Russian air force to intensify its air strikes in Syria in response.\n\n\"It (our campaign) must be intensified in such a way that the criminals understand that retribution is inevitable,\" said Putin.\n\nOrdering the country's secret service to hunt down those responsible for blowing up the plane, he said the effort to bring them to justice should be exhaustive.\n\n\"We will search for them everywhere wherever they are hiding. We will find them anywhere on the planet and punish them,\" Putin said.\n\nThis story is developing.
