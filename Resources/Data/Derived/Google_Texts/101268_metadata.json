These challenges could lead more of them to turn over operations to the federal government or join forces with other states.\n\nHawaii\u2019s marketplace, the latest cautionary tale, was awarded $205 million in federal startup grants. It has spent about $139 million and enrolled 8,200 customers for individual coverage in 2015. Unable to sustain itself, the state marketplace is turning over sign-ups to the federal HealthCare.gov for 2016.\n\nTwelve states and the District of Columbia fully control their markets. Experts estimate about half face financial difficulties. Federal taxpayers invested nearly $5 billion in startup grants to the states, expecting that state markets would become self-sustaining. Most of the federal money has been spent, and states have to face the consequences.\n\n\u201cThe viability of state health insurance exchanges has been a challenge across the country, particularly in small states, due to insufficient numbers of uninsured residents,\u201d said a statement from the office of Hawaii Democratic Gov. David Ige, announcing last month that his state\u2019s sign-ups were being turned over to the federal government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that the Supreme Court has ruled the Obama administration can keep subsidizing premiums in all 50 states through HealthCare.gov, no longer is there a downside for states turning to Washington. If the decision had gone the opposite way, state exchanges would have been a leaky lifeboat for preserving a major expansion of taxpayer-subsidized coverage under the law.\n\nWith the pressure gone, \u201cI think you are going to see much more of a hybrid across the nation,\u201d said Peter Lee, who heads California\u2019s state-run marketplace. Covered California fell short of its sign-up projections this year by nearly 20 percent, but Lee says it remains \u201ca solid business proposition.\u201d\n\nStates are \u201ctalking a lot about shared services,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s how you get economies of scale.\u201d\n\nStates could pool resources on functions such as labor-intensive call centers or use HealthCare.gov\u2019s technology for online enrollment. They generally want to keep control over marketing, consumer education and oversight of insurance plans.\n\nSustainability is the focus of the administration\u2019s annual meeting with state exchange directors, scheduled for the end of the month in the Washington area. The two-day meeting is closed to the media.\n\n\u201cEach state has a different set of circumstances that informs their approach, and we will continue to support their efforts,\u201d said Mayra Alvarez, the federal liaison to state marketplaces.\n\nThe pendulum probably will swing toward a greater federal role in the next couple of years, said Jim Wadleigh, director of Connecticut\u2019s Access Health CT. Eventually, more states will want to take the lead, he said, because it gives them greater control over health care, particularly modernizing Medicaid programs for low-income people.\n\nIn New England, there\u2019s talk of a regional exchange.\n\nThe insurance industry would welcome consolidation.\n\n\u201cOur biggest concern is that you may see many states looking to enact taxes and fees, and that makes health care less affordable,\u201d said Justine Handelman, policy chief at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.\n\nHawaii is the third state exchange going to the federal sign-up system, following Nevada and Oregon, which made the switch last year.\n\nAmong the problems confronting states:\n\n\u2022 Minnesota\u2019s MNsure faces a murky financial future. Its budget is balanced as a result of repeated cuts when enrollment has come in below projections, a tactic that cannot work forever. Despite a slew of proposals, no concrete changes came out of the state\u2019s most recent legislative session. Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton has signaled that MNsure\u2019s fate is on the table, including the option of shifting operations to HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u2022 The U.S. attorney in Boston has subpoenaed records dealing with the troubled rollout of the Massachusetts Health Connector, dating to 2010.\n\n\u2022 Colorado officials are considering big changes to the state\u2019s marketplace, from pooling call centers with other states to dismantling the exchange and relying on HealthCare.gov instead. Although the market is on solid financial footing, it has fallen short of best-case enrollment goals.\n\n\u2022 A federal audit concluded that Maryland used exchange establishment grants from Washington to pay for $28.4 million in costs that should have been allocated to the state\u2019s Medicaid program. State officials dispute that, but federal officials say Maryland should pay the money back. Separately, the original lead contractor for the state website has agreed to repay $45 million to avoid legal action over rollout problems last year.\n\n\u2022 In Vermont, a debate has been raging about whether to abandon the state exchange. Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin originally wanted a single state-run system for all residents, along the lines of Canada. Shumlin backed off because it would have meant prohibitively high taxes. He wants to fix the state exchange, still grappling with technology problems that plagued it from launch.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Cathy Bussewitz in Honolulu; Kyle Potter in St. Paul, Minnesota; Steve LeBlanc in Boston; Kristen Wyatt in Denver; Brian Witte in Annapolis, Maryland; Dave Gram in Montpelier, Vermont; and Judy Lin in Sacramento, California, contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Business, Business news, New Haven Business news, CT Business news, US Business news, world Business news.", "title": "State-based health insurance markets struggle with cost challenges", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150726/NEWS/150729611", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150726/NEWS/150729611/AR/0/AR-150729611.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1000px"}, "type": "article", "title": "State-based health insurance markets struggle with cost challenges"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "State-run health insurance markets that offer coverage under President Barack Obama\u2019s health law are struggling with high costs and disappointing enrollment.
