Steve Beshear did two big things: He expanded the Medicaid program for the poor to Kentuckians in households earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level; and be created Kynect, an online insurance exchange where Kentuckians above that level can buy private insurance with federal subsidies.\n\nAbout 500,000 Kentuckians have coverage through Kynect, 400,000 of them on Medicaid, and Kentucky\u2019s uninsured rate has dropped from 20.4 percent to 9 percent, the largest decrease of any state.\n\nAs a candidate, Bevin said Kentucky simply can\u2019t afford to have so many people on the Medicaid rolls and that he plans to apply for federal waivers to create a revised program that is affordable and requires its clients to have some \u201cskin in the game\u201d thorough premiums, co-payments, deductibles or health savings accounts.\n\nHe has also said he would dismantle Kynect, which has been cited as a national model, saying it is unnecessary because a federal exchange is available. He can do that because the exchange was established by executive order and can be removed by executive order, but it won\u2019t be immediate.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services expects at least one year\u2019s notice for states that want to terminate their health insurance exchanges and transfer those duties to the federal exchange,\u201d John Cheves reports for the Lexington Herald-Leader. Also, repealing or modifying the Medicaid program \u201ccould take months of negotiations with the federal government,\u201d Cheves writes. Here\u2019s a look at each issue:\n\nIt is a redundancy that we as taxpayers in this state are paying for twice,\u201d Bevin said in his first post-election press conference Friday.\n\nKynect is not funded by taxes but by a 1 percent assessment on all health-insurance policies sold in the state; presumably, most if not all of the purchasers are also taxpayers. The legislature enacted the fee more than 20 years ago to create a pool to insure high-risk people, a pool that the reform law made unnecessary.\n\nThe federal exchange is financed by a 3.5 percent fee on policies sold through it. So, the fee for policies now sold on Kynect would go up, but it would no longer be charged on other policies.\n\nKentucky established Kynect with $283 million in federal funding. Vendors have estimated the cost to dismantle Kynect\u2019s information technology alone is $23 million, and Kynect Director Carrie Banahan told Kentucky Health News in August that they expect the total cost of decommissioning it to \u201cbe significantly higher.\u201d She also said some insurers might not migrate to the federal exchange.\n\nJennifer Tolbert, director of state health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told Cheves that \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense\u201d to dismatle Kynect, which is \u201cconsidered something of a model,\u201d not only because it would be disruptive, but because it would mean \u201ca significant amount of tax dollars invested here that essentially would just be scrapped,\u201d\n\nGreg Stumbo, the speaker of the Democratic-controlled state House, told reporters Tuesday night that he foresaw a \u201cbig battle\u201d over Kynect in the next legislative session, The Courier-Journal reported.\n\nThe next day, state Senate President Robert Stivers tried to connect the cost of Kynect to the failed Kentucky Health Cooperative, a non-profit insurer created and financed under the reform law. Its 51,000 policyholders will have to find new insurance for 2016.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have people buying those policies then you can\u2019t fund the mechanism to get the policy,\u201d Stivers said. Reminded that the former co-op clients have other insurers available on Kynect, he said, \u201cWe are hearing some of those are getting ready to pull out . . . because we understand they are owed millions of dollars that haven\u2019t been paid.\u201d\n\nThat is incorrect, state Cabinet for Health and Family Services spokeswoman Jill Midkiff told Kentucky Health News: \u201cNo insurer offering insurance products on kynect plans to withdraw. To the contrary, they are actively participating in open enrollment,\u201d which began Nov. 1.\n\nWhen Associated Press Correspondent Adam Beam started to pose a question by referring to \u201cthe popularity of Kynect,\u201d which has been seen in polls, Stivers became combative. \u201cWho told you that it was great? The doctors? The hospitals? No, they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHowever, during a panel discussion on these topics at the Friedell Committee for Health annual meeting Oct. 25, Bill Wagner, executive director of the Family Health Centers of Louisville, said that Kynectors, federally paid employees who help those who are unfamiliar with health insurance navigate Kynect, often \u201cend up becoming case managers\u201d for their patients even after they have chosen their insurance, helping them with things like finding providers who accept Medicaid, helping them with their health literacy, and helping them understand how to maintain eligibility.\n\nA shift to the federal exchange would cause Kentucky to lose 75 percent of its funding for Kynectors, who are now in every county, Wagner said, He said this should be an important consideration when deciding whether to abandon Kynect, which is officially the Kentucky Health Benefit Exchange.\n\n\u201cHaving the boots on the ground from the Kynectors, having the close working relationship with the Kentucky Health Benefit Exchange, I think has really helped us provide more ongoing care and coordinated case management around insurance, so I worry about that if that were to change,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nA pre-election Bluegrass Poll found that 54 percent of registered voters in Kentucky wanted to keep the Medicaid expansion, while 24 percent said they wanted the next governor to reverse it. The rest were undecided. Among those who they would vote for Bevin, 27 percent supported the expansion.\n\nThe federal government is paying the full cost of the expansion through next year. In 2017, the state would pay 5 percent, rising in annual steps to the law\u2019s limit of 10 percent in 2020.\n\nBevin said during his primary campaign that he would abolish the Medicaid expansion immediately, but in July he began saying that he would seek federal waivers to revise it, looking to states like Indiana as an example. The day before, Stivers said the legislature would decide the fate of the expansion and mentioned Indiana as a model.\n\nStivers said he and Bevin had \u201chigh level talks\u201d about the impact of Medicaid expansion on the state budget, saying it is widely understood that Kentucky will have to come up with $250 million to pay for it in the next two-year budget and $400 million in the one after that.\n\nA state-funded study by Deloitte Consulting says the expansion will pay for itself through 2020 by generating health care jobs and tax revenue. Bevin has called the study \u201cnonsense,\u201d and Stivers said likewise Wednesday: \u201cThat and my roll of toilet paper could be used for the same thing.\u201d\n\nStivers Sen. Ralph Alvarado, R-Winchester, had talked to staffers for Indiana\u2019s Republican legislative leaders about the state\u2019s plan.\n\nIndiana offers four plans based on income, frailty and premium payments. It requires most people to pay a varying premium and co-pay amount, has wellness and preventive-care incentives, and has provisions to remove those who fall behind on their premiums, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nStivers called the Indiana plan \u201ca framework to work from,\u201d and noted several things that could be included in Kentucky\u2019s plan, such allowing providers to help develop a system to set reimbursement rates, graduated premiums, penalties for bad conduct, incentive to modify bad habits, and graduated co-pays to assure benefciaries have \u201cskin in the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think we can develop a plan that will not expose us to $400 million of cost, but still provide health insurance and health care for those individuals.\u201d Stivers said, when asked if those currently covered by the Medicaid expansion would continue to have coverage. \u201cIt is a different mechanism, but it still covers the same group of people.\u201d\n\nCurrently six states have obtained waivers for varied types of Medicaid expansion, but Diane Rowland, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told The Courier-Journal that none have been allowed to change eligibility from 138 percent of the poverty level, something Bevin has said he would do.\n\nRowland also said the process takes time, noting that Utah has been seeking a waiver for two years. She suggested that Bevin\u2019s incoming administration should consider the value of federal funds that cover 100 percent of the expansion until 2017.\n\nUnder a 1966 law, the state\u2019s policy is to maximize federal funding for Medicaid, and the Democratic-controlled state House might not go along with legislation to repeal that law. If the law remains in place, \u201cAdvocates say any move to leave federal dollars untapped would likely lead to a lawsuit,\u201d Paul Demko reports for Politico.\n\nGenerally, health-reform advocates say waiver programs discourage people from using their beneifts, meaning they may not get the care they need. \u201cThe main concern is that whatever is proposed would include more barriers to access,\u201d Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, told The Courier-Journal. \u201cNone of us really understand what Bevin is proposing or how that\u2019s going to look. That\u2019s where we\u2019re all holding our breath.\u201d\n\nMelissa Patrick is a writer for Kentucky Health News, an independent news service of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues, based in the School of Journalism and Telecommunications at the University of Kentucky, with support from the Foundation for a Healthy Kentuck", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe main concern is that whatever is proposed would include more barriers to access,\u201d Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, told The Courier-Journal.\nAlso, repealing or modifying the Medicaid program \u201ccould take months of negotiations with the federal government,\u201d Cheves writes.\nKentucky established Kynect with $283 million in federal funding.\nHe has also said he would dismantle Kynect, which has been cited as a national model, saying it is unnecessary because a federal exchange is available.\nSo, the fee for policies now sold on Kynect would go up, but it would no longer be charged on other policies."}
