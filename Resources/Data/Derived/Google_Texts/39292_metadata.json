According to History.com, it is said to be named after the Christian priest, Valentine, who was notorious for marrying young couples even when it was outlawed by the Emperor at the time, Claudius. The Emperor believed that when men were not attached to loves, they were able to be better soldiers. Valentines\u2019 Day also has links to the Roman Pagan festival, Lupercalia, and at the end of the fifth century, in an effort to make it more of a Christian holiday, Pope Gelasius named Feb. 14 a day to celebrate this day officially. Now modern day Valentine\u2019s Day celebrations have steered away from its Pagan roots \u2014 it\u2019s become a day filled with chocolate, flowers, and romanance. Here is a list of some aphrodisiac foods to enhance your Valentine\u2019s Day celebrations.\n\n1. Oysters\n\nMany people know of this one, but not many know of the reason why, and some have been previously skeptical about its effectiveness. However, in 2005 scientists in San Diego, Calif., decided to test out the theory of using it to boost the libido, which proved to be true. Oysters make a great aphrodisiac because they are found to have a rare amino acid, which increases the levels of sex hormones.\n\n2. Chocolate\n\nThis delicacy has been synonymous with love and romance, but there is actually some scientific relevance behind this. According to The New York Times, two chemicals found in chocolate are linked to love and sex: tryptophan, which is a main component of serotonin \u2014 the feel good hormone \u2014 and the other is phenylethylamine, a stimulant related to amphetamine and released from the brain when people fall in love.\n\n3. Cucumbers\n\nDespite their phallic shape, they are said to increase the blood flow to the vagina because of their scent.\n\n4. Chili Peppers\n\nThese spicy peppers are red, which does symbol the color of love. However, according to The New York Times, they also stimulate endorphins, speed up your heart rate, and make you sweat \u2014 thus imitating how a person feels when they are aroused.\n\n5. Pomegranate Juice\n\nNot only does this juice help to raise mood and memory, but it also increased sexual desire in both men and women who drank a glass daily. According to a 2012 study, testosterone levels increased between 16 percent and 30 percent among the subjects, while blood pressure plummeted,\u201d the Daily Mail reported, \u201cpositive emotions rose and negative feelings fell.\u201d\n\n6. Arugula\n\nAccording to Dr. Joseph Mercola, arugula contains trace minerals and antioxidants, which block the contaminants that can impact your libido negatively.\n\n7. Cinnamon\n\nEating cinnamon increases your body temperature, thus increasing your libido. It also contains manganese, which is a mineral known for its aphrodisiac effects.\n\n8. Avocado\n\nYes, they might look like a male body part, but they also contain high levels of folic acid \u2014 helping to metabolize protein and, in turn, giving you more energy. According to AskMen.com, \u201cthey also contain vitamin B6, which increases the male hormone production and potassium, which helps regulate a woman's thyroid gland, two elements that help increase libido in both men and women.\u201d\n\n9. Dates\n\nThe amino acids in dates increases a person\u2019s stamina and sexual desire because of an overload on hormone production.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed some of these helpful tips, and as always, please make sure to check with your health care provider before trying any food that you are unsure of in regard to its effects.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "aphrodisiac, valentine's day", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In keeping with the Valentine's Day spirit, here is a list of nine foods that can not only increase your libido, but they're actually good for you.", "title": "Aphrodisiac Foods To Spice Up Your Valentine's Day...
