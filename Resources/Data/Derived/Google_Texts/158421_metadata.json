The move widely signaled the beginning of the end to a decades-long tension between the U.S. and Cuba, and it got people talking about whether Obama would also lift the trade embargo preventing goods from changing hands. Vaccines, thankfully, do not fall into that category.\n\n\u201cThere are exceptions when it relates to science and medicine,\u201d Dr. Candace Johnson, president and CEO of Roswell Park and oncology professor at SUNY Buffalo, told Medical Daily. \u201cThis is really between us and the FDA.\u201d\n\nThe vaccine, known as CIMAVAX, has already undergone rigorous testing in Cuba. It has shown success in reducing antibody responses in lung cancer patients and reducing future tumor growth. Without FDA approval, however, the drug won\u2019t see a U.S. rollout. Scientists still need the authorization to perform clinical trials demonstrating the vaccine\u2019s safety and effectiveness. Johnson says the plan is to get testing underway within eight months to a year, provided they can put together the more than 1,000-page investigational new drug (IND) application for the FDA\u2019s review.\n\nThe team is hopeful, she says. \u201cI don\u2019t disagree this is unique, because it\u2019s Cuba, and perhaps there may be more paperwork involved. But we don\u2019t anticipate any difficulties. It\u2019s just a matter of filing the right papers and doing the right things ahead of time before bringing it into the States.\u201d\n\nIn Cuba, cancer is the second leading cause of death, behind only cardiovascular disease. The Ministry of Health, in recognizing the country\u2019s efforts to ramp up its biotechnology capabilities, approved CIMAVAX in 2008 for the treatment of advanced lung cancer. Johnson, who recently returned from a two-day state foreign trade mission to Havana, alongside Gov. Andrew Cuomo, says the federal health agencies from Europe and Asia have already vetted the research; America is simply next in line.\n\nMost of the time, lung cancer deaths are preventable. Data from the American Cancer Society, for example, reveal 87 percent of deaths in males and 70 percent of deaths in females are due to tobacco use. The rest come from some mixture of genetics, occupational hazards, and other unknown causes.\n\nFor people who already suffer from lung cancer, the survival rate is a little bleaker. Just over half of all patients make it past the five-year mark if their case is diagnosed while the tumors are still localized to the lungs. If the tumors branch out, the rate drops to just four percent. CIMAVAX may be able to get those rates back on the uptick, assuming the same advances made in Cuba can touch down on U.S. soil.\n\n\u201cBecause of its lack of its toxicity, you could think of using this vaccine in more of a preventive manner,\u201d Johnson said. That would happen in two possible ways. The first is preventing early-stage cancer from recurring after treatment, as these patients face a greater risk. The other is preventing high-risk people, who have not received a diagnosis, from ever developing it. Smokers, Johnson says, top the list.\n\nThese forecasts are years from real-world application, but their implications are worth considering. One such challenge is how to resolve the tension between creating a lung cancer vaccine and keeping the smoking rates low. The U.S. has made tremendous strides since the mid-1960s in eradicating cigarettes, but fears of cancer and disease serve as driving forces of that change. If scientists take them off the table, Johnson admits, there may be less incentive to quit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fine line,\u201d she said of the public health dilemma. In conquering one major form of burden \u2014 lung cancer \u2014 researchers could unintentionally spark a new one. More important to her is keeping the rest of the world in mind. \u201cGlobally, there\u2019s going to be a need even if we have great results here in this country in smoking cessation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "roswell, park, cancer, institute, joins, cuba, developing, lung, cancer, vaccine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Cuba's Center for Molecular Immunology are collaborating to bring a lung cancer vaccine stateside.", "title": "US And Cuba Join Forces To Find Vaccine For Lung Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/roswell-park-cancer-institute-joins-cuba-developing-lung-cancer-vaccine-330508", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/23/cuba-us.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Cuba's Center for Molecular Immunology are collaborating to bring a lung cancer vaccine stateside.", "title": "US And Cuba Join Forces To Find Vaccine For Lung Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/roswell-park-cancer-institute-joins-cuba-developing-lung-cancer-vaccine-330508", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/23/cuba-us.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/23/cuba-us.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-04-23T16:25:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-23T16:25:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Cuba's Center for Molecular Immunology are collaborating to bring a lung cancer vaccine stateside."}, "article_summary": "One such challenge is how to resolve the tension between creating a lung cancer vaccine and keeping the smoking rates low.\nIt has shown success in reducing antibody responses in lung cancer patients and reducing future tumor growth.\nDespite longstanding political freezes between the United States and Cuba, scientists at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, in Buffalo, N.Y., have announced a partnership with Havana\u2019s Center for Molecular Immunology in the search for a lung cancer vaccine.\nIn conquering one major form of burden \u2014 lung cancer \u2014 researchers could unintentionally spark a new one.\nMost of the time, lung cancer deaths are preventable."}
