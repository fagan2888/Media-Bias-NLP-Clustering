But what if you\u2019re healthy? What\u2019s the incentive?\n\nThat\u2019s the challenge facing researchers in a groundbreaking double-blind trial of an experimental drug meant to ward off Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It is the Anti-Amyloid Treatment and Asymptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s Disease trial, better known as \u201cA4.\u201d\n\nThousands more volunteers \u2013 including Floridians - are needed in the test population: people ages 65 to 85 who appear to have normal memories. They can be tough to recruit, said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\n\u201dThey\u2019re looking for people who are very high-risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease but who don\u2019t yet have any symptoms, such as memory problems or difficulty thinking,\u201d he said.\n\nThe trial involves the drug solanezumab by Eli Lilly & Co., one of several drugs aimed at beta amyloid, the pieces of protein that clump together and destroy nerve cells in the brain in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nEarlier trials of solanezumab as a treatment showed little or no benefit for those who already had advanced Alzheimer\u2019s. But it appeared to show promise for those in the earliest stages. That led to the A4 trial, co-sponsored by the company and the National Institute on Aging, as well as private philanthropies.\n\nThe A4 trial started in spring of 2014. The goal was to have 1,000 active participants by this month, so that there would be three-year results by December 2018.\n\nBut as of this month, fewer than 400 people have been \u201crandomized\u201d to receive either the drug or placebo, trial coordinators said.\n\n\u201cWe really need people to participate because this is truly the first step to a cure,\u201d said Dr. Amanda Smith, medical director for an A4 research site in Tampa at the University of South Florida.\n\nHer team at the USF Health Byrd Alzheimer\u2019s Institute had only two A4 patients receiving treatments as of early December after screening more than 40. Byrd staff members have been scrambling to find volunteers -- particularly from minority populations, which tend to be under-represented in clinical trials.\n\nIf the drug works, \u201cthis could be the last generation of people with dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and that\u2019s a really exciting thing,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut we need the people to come in and participate in order to show that.\u201d\n\nHarvard neurologist Reisa Sperling, principal investigator, says it took longer than expected to get some sites ready and certified for the trial because of the expertise and equipment required. She said sites need to have PET (positron emission tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and specialized software.\n\nWhen the trial was launched in spring 2014, publicity piqued interest, especially among those who have a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But some sites weren\u2019t ready to begin screening at the time, Sperling said.\n\n\u201cNow I think most sites have caught up,\u201d she said. \u201cI am hopeful that we can finish up recruitment by this time next year.\u201d\n\nAccording to the A4 website (A4Study.org), the trial has 60 sites in the United States, Canada and Australia. Florida, which Sperling said is an important region for recruitment, has six sites:\n\n\u00b7 Tampa, USF Health Byrd Alzheimer Institute\n\n\u00b7 Miami Beach, Wien Center for Clinical Research\n\n\u00b7 West Palm Beach, Premiere Research Institute\n\n\u00b7 Orlando, Compass Research\n\n\u00b7 Leesburg, Compass Research North\n\n\u00b7 Jacksonville, Mayo Clinic\n\nThe Mayo Clinic had nine patients receiving either treatment or placebo as of early December, said trial coordinator Dana Haley.\n\n\u201cWe had been collecting names of interested participants since we first heard about the study in late 2013, so we had a large pool to recruit from,\u201d Haley said.\n\nVolunteers for A4 who meet the entry criteria on age and other matters go through two levels of screening. The first level, as the Byrd Institute in Tampa conducts it, is an in-person conversation with a psychologist trained to use questions to elicit the level of functional memory.\n\nThose who score in the normal range move on to a PET scan of their brain, which shows any abnormal protein deposits and other problems in vivid color. Those who have a positive screen for amyloid plaque are asked to join the A4 trial.\n\n'This could be the last generation of people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and that's a really exciting thing. But we need the people to come in and participate in order to show that.' - Dr. Amanda Smith, USF Health Byrd Alzheimer's Institute\n\nIf they agree, they then begin the monthly IV treatments, receiving either the saline solution or the drug, solanezumab. The IV infusion takes about half an hour once a month.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt, says Ed Hancock, one of the participants in the A4 trial at the Byrd Institute. He lives in Ocala but drives to Tampa for the treatments because he likes the team, including trial coordinator Kelly Rodrigo and nurse Beth Major.\n\n\u201cBeth is a pro,\u201d Hancock said during a recent treatment. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt going in, doesn\u2019t hurt coming out, and we have a lot of fun in between.\u201d\n\nAs in other randomized, double-blind trials, neither the patients nor the staff know whether they\u2019re receiving the experimental drug or the placebo, a saline solution.\n\nIf the drug works as intended, it will clear protein clumps called amyloid plaques out of the brain before they cause permanent damage. Tau, another protein thought by some to be the main culprit in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, would be removed, as well.\n\nIn August 2104, when the USF team told Hancock that his PET scan was positive for amyloid plaque, he wasn\u2019t surprised, he said. Both his parents died of Alzheimer\u2019s, and his sister was diagnosed around 2007, he said.\n\n\u201cI try to stay pragmatic about it because the more you look for it, the more you\u2019re going to see it, and the more worried about it you get, the bigger deal it becomes,\u201d Hancock said.\n\nHancock, 66, serves as a director on the board of the Central-North Florida chapter of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. His educational and fundraising work is extensive, and he is still able to make all the required travel arrangements himself, said his wife Diana.\n\nShe said she doesn\u2019t know whether that is a sign that he is getting solanezumab and it\u2019s working, or whether he is getting the placebo and his brain is not yet damaged enough to cause symptoms.\n\nDr. Smith at the Byrd Institute says it is hard to know in such cases. \u201cThe thing is, we know that plaque starts to build up 10 to 15 years before people ever have the symptoms of forgetfulness,\u201d she said.\n\nA4 researchers had been warned that it might take 10 screenings to find one positive scan, but the rate of negatives at Byrd has been even higher than that. Of the first 43 people who have undergone screening in Tampa, just two qualified to undergo treatment.\n\nDr. Smith said even though the delay is frustrating, she\u2019s happy for the many people who have undergone the PET scan and found out they are negative for amyloid.\n\n\u201cThere are people who wake up worried every day (that they have Alzheimer\u2019s disease in their future) and then have this PET scan and find out they don\u2019t, and they are almost not sure what to do with themselves because they were so sure that they did,\u201d she said.\n\nSome who should be getting tested shy away. Participant Hancock, who has tried to recruit people for the A4 trial, says they claim to be too busy. He thinks they\u2019re in denial.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not really concerned enough yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they will be.\u201d\n\nOne benefit of volunteering for clinical trials is that the medical care is free, and often it\u2019s at a sophisticated research center. A particular advantage of this A4 trial is that people who pass the first level of screening get a free PET scan. Otherwise, an asymptomatic patient would have to pay $4,000 out-of-pocket.\n\nEven if the news from the scan isn\u2019t good, it is worthwhile finding out early, said Gloria Smith, president of the Florida Gulf Coast Chapter of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. (She is no relation to Dr. Amanda Smith.)\n\n\u201cThere's a lot you can do,\u201d Gloria Smith said. \u201cYou want to make decisions about your own life. You don't want your family to make those decisions for you.\u201d\n\nFinding a way to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s would be of enormous benefit in Florida, she said. With the bulk of the Baby Boom still to hit age 65, she says, close to 500,000 Floridians already are living with Alzheimer's.\n\n\u201cThe numbers are unbelievable,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd those aren't snowbirds I'm talking about. These are full-time residents.\u201d\n\nPeople interested in learning more about the Florida A4 trials can contact:\n\n\u00b7 Jacksonville, Mayo Clinic: Dana Haley - (904) 953-9680\n\n\u00b7 Tampa, USF Health Byrd Alzheimer Institute: Kelly Rodrigo - (813) 974-4904\n\n\u00b7 Orlando, Compass Research: Heather King - (407) 210-9838\n\n\u00b7 Leesburg, Compass Research North: (352) 314-0801\n\n\u00b7 Miami Beach, Wien Center for Clinical Research: Maria Greig-Custo - (305) 674-2121 Ext. 54480\n\n\u00b7 West Palm Beach, Premiere Research Institute: Linda Ormejuste - (561) 845-0500 Ext. 124\n\nCarol Gentry is a special correspondent for WUSF in Tampa.
