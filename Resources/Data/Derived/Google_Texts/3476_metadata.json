As part of a new strategy, kids are now coached through play at recess.\n\nNonprofit Playworks has partnered with the Edina schools this fall for a test run of a program designed to reduce injuries and bullying on the playground.\n\n\u201cIt is designed to give students a chance to have an inclusive experience during recess and not an exclusive one and to use adults to help students work through conflict resolution issues,\u201d Edina School District spokesperson Susan Brott told KSTP TV5.\n\nOver 900 schools in 23 cities have implemented a Playworks program.\n\nIn Minnesota, Playworks started to train \u201crecess coaches\u201d five years ago and currently has them in 10 Minnesota school districts.\n\n\u201c[The kids] might not have the skills, they might not have the ability, they might not feel welcome,\u201d Playworks Minnesota Program Manager Todd Wallace told CBS Minnesota. \u201cSo we try to make sure every kid feels like they belong out at recess by providing them with those choices to get involved.\u201d\n\nChris Holden, principal at Normandale Elementary in Edina, noted to the Minneapolis Star Tribune that fewer students have made trips to the principal\u2019s and nurse\u2019s offices after recess this school year.\n\n\u201cOur experience is that diminishing opportunities for unsupervised play in our society have left kids with a very thin understanding of how to manage their own play and that it is important to have grown-ups introduce some basic rules to make play work,\u201d the Playworks website states.\n\nThe children at recess may have a different opinion.\n\nFourth-grade Liam has been part of the pilot program in Edina at Concord Elementary.\n\n\u201cHe feels like that\u2019s not playing anymore,\u201d his mother Caroline Correia told the Star Tribune.\n\nThe kids are given the option to play in organized games with the recess coach or to create their own inclusive game on the playground. The recess coaches also try to get kids to settle down at the end of recess, for a \u201csmooth transition\u201d back into the classroom.\n\n\u201cWhat it\u2019s leaving these kids without is an opportunity to have time to grow into a problem solver, to deal with conflict, and to really have an opportunity to go out, bust out of those doors and be free,\u201d Edina parent Lee Blum told KARE11. \u201cMy son should have time to just go out and play, climb a tree if he wants to, play soccer, play hockey.\n\nAt Concord Elementary, 177 parents signed a petition in opposition to the new recess program.\n\n\u201cHas there ever been a better illustration of bloated school bureaucracy?\u201d Lindsey Burke, a fellow in education at The Heritage Foundation, asked The Daily Signal. \u201cPublic schools lament what they claim is a lack of financial resources, yet are directing taxpayer dollars to \u2018recess consultants.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe two elementary schools in Edina spent $30,000 over the summer to have staff trained in new techniques to be used at recess. Schools hiring Playworks use school district tax dollars or grant money to fund the program.\n\n\u201cWhat ails American education isn\u2019t about money; it\u2019s about who gets to control dollars,\u201d Burke continued. \u201cUntil parents can direct dollars to options that work well for their children\u2014until they can vote with their feet\u2014the public education system will continue to receive dollars and students no matter how poorly it performs, or how inefficiently it spends.\u201d\n\nThe school board in Edina, along with parent input, will evaluate the program at the end of the year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two elementary schools in the Minneapolis area have gone from the per usual \u201con duty\u201d recess supervisor to hiring a recess consultant.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Two elementary schools in the Minneapolis area have gone from the per usual \u201con duty\u201d recess supervisor to hiring a recess consultant.", "title": "Minnesota Schools Hire Recess Consultant", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151006_RecessConsultant_Jessen1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-07T00:19:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GuUEjp"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Two elementary schools in the Minneapolis area have gone from the per usual \u201con duty\u201d recess supervisor to hiring a recess consultant.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151006_RecessConsultant_Jessen1.jpg"}, "title": "Minnesota Schools Hire Recess Consultant", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2015-10-06T19:05:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-07T00:19:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Playworks, recess, education, K-12, recess consultant"}, "article_summary": "In Minnesota, Playworks started to train \u201crecess coaches\u201d five years ago and currently has them in 10 Minnesota school districts.\nNonprofit Playworks has partnered with the Edina schools this fall for a test run of a program designed to reduce injuries and bullying on the playground.\nSchools hiring Playworks use school district tax dollars or grant money to fund the program.\nThe recess coaches also try to get kids to settle down at the end of recess, for a \u201csmooth transition\u201d back into the classroom.\nAs part of a new strategy, kids are now coached through play at recess."}
