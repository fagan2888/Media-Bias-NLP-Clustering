One person died after an 18-wheeler crashed into a guardrail on Loop 820 and burst into flames on Sunday morning, officials said.

Medstar responded to the crash, which happened at southbound Loop 820 at Highway 287, at around 10 a.m. The sole person found inside the truck was declared dead at the scene, said Medstar spokesman Matt Zavadsky. Officials have not yet been able to identify the person because of burns from the fire, he added.

Zavadsky said the 18-wheeler was a U.S. Postal Service truck, according to the person who called about the incident. He said the truck crashed into a barrier but he does not know yet what caused the crash. No other vehicles were involved in the accident.

The crash closed the 820 in both directions. The northbound side of 820 reopened about 3 p.m. The southbound side reopened around 7:15 p.m.

Fort Worth police are investigating the incident.
