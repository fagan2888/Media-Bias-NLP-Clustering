Given the serial missteps in her campaign (the limp announcement video and lassoing reporters spring to mind), one wonders. The latest blooper snuck into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s economic policy speech \u2013 a mish-mash of platitudes geared to pleasing various core constituencies. She gave a nod to working mothers, small business owners, minimum-wage workers, unions and other voter blocks. But, she goofed big time when she skittered off-clich\u00e9 and attacked \u201cthe so-called gig economy.\u201d It was a glancing blow, to be sure, but damaging nonetheless.\n\nHere\u2019s why: Hillary Clinton absolutely needs the millennial vote. And millennials, the largest generation in U.S. history, are absolutely besotted with the \u201cshared\u201d economy. Mess with Uber, or Airbnb, and you\u2019ll find yourself on the wrong end of a selfie stick, or worse.\n\nRelated: Do You Trust Her? For Clinton, More People Say No\n\nIn her speech, the former First Lady acknowledged, \u201cMany Americans are making extra money renting out a small room, designing websites, selling products they design themselves at home, or even driving their own car.\u201d She describes the \u201con-demand\u201d economy as \u201ccreating exciting economies and unleashing innovation.\u201d She then cautions that such activities \u201care raising hard questions about work-place protections and what a good job will look like in the future.\u201d\n\nIn other words, these jobs are under-regulated and worse -- it is unlikely these jobs will be unionized, and in fact they may further undermine unionization. What\u2019s a Democrat to do? Check the math: there are some 75.3 million voting age millennials (age 18 to 34) and only about 14 million union members. Easy choice.\n\nMoreover, while the union vote is firmly blue, the millennial vote is up for grabs. Of the various groups that coalesced to elect President Obama, this one is perhaps the most skittish, and the most necessary for Mrs. Clinton. A study from Tufts University indicates that Obama captured 67 percent of the youth vote in 2012, compared to 30 percent for Mitt Romney. Moreover, Obama took 61 percent of the youth vote in four critical states: Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. As reported by Politico, \u201cIf Romney had achieved a 50-50 split, he could have flipped those states to his column.\u201d\n\nSome 22 to 23 million people between the ages of 18 and 29 voted in the 2012 election, accounting for about 19 percent of the electorate. About half those eligible turned out \u2013 roughly the same as in 2008 and 2004. That\u2019s an uptick from the 1990s, when turnout from Generation X was routinely below 40 percent. Electing the first black president \u2013 and a young, hip one at that \u2013 excited young voters. Can Hillary Clinton do that too?\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Pledges Bigger Rewards for Corporate Whistleblowers\n\nMaybe, but it won\u2019t be easy, especially if she attacks their worldview. Millennials\u2019 affection for President Obama, and for Democrats, wavered last fall, according to a poll conducted by Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics. The president\u2019s approval rating had tumbled, and especially on economic policy and on Obamacare. Millennials don\u2019t much like Obamacare; they know that as healthy youngsters they are being asked to shoulder the cost of providing free medical care to older, sicker Americans.\n\nThe Harvard poll showed millennials disenchanted with government dysfunction and unlikely to attach to either party. The souring might stem from disappointment; young voters believed President Obama\u2019s promises to bring the country together, reform immigration and create green jobs \u2013 promises that were broken. IOP survey director John Della Volpe was quoted at the time saying, \"Young people are returning back to pre-Obama roots of being a swing-vote constituency.\"\n\nIn last November\u2019s election, the youth vote plummeted to 13 percent of the total (some decline would be expected in a non-presidential election) and Democrat\u2019s share of millennials\u2019 vote fell to 54 percent, compared to 43 percent for the GOP.\n\nHillary has to woo this group. For sure, she has a head start. The most recent Harvard poll conducted early this spring showed that 55 percent of millennials would prefer to see a Democrat elected in 2016, compared to 40 percent who favor a GOP victory. Still, that survey preceded the roll out of most GOP campaigns as well as damaging revelations about the Clinton Foundation and how Hillary Clinton handled her emails.\n\nRelated: Clinton Talks Pantsuits, Ignores Syria in Facebook Q and A\n\nTo keep young voters in her column, Hillary Clinton needs to understand that this is an impatient generation that spurns corporate hierarchy, likes its freedom and worships entrepreneurship. Their idols are Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs, and they are not into working nine to five. According to one report, \u201cTurnover figures for millennials are already twice as high as for other generations, with millennials rarely staying on the job for more than three years. Millennials are also more likely to work for themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Internet has fueled this opportunity. Check out the latest \u201cThirty Under Thirty\u201d from Forbes, and you\u2019ll find dozens of successful young people launching apps that \u201cturn your smartphone into life\u2019s remote control\u201d, as the magazine puts it. Apps that speed food delivery, enable simpler photo sharing, time management \u2013 all kinds of innovations. It\u2019s not just about apps; many other start-ups involve popular blogs, online retailing, and on and on.\n\nSuch endeavors are enormously positive for the U.S., where entrepreneurship has been on the decline. They provide jobs for people who want part-time work, who are busy working on the next start-up. Uber alone has created 300,000 jobs around the world. Take TaskRabbit \u2013 an online provider of help for those too busy to run errands or assemble their IKEA furniture, available now in 19 cities. The service employs and vets the \u201crabbits\u201d through background checks and in-person interviews. In many ways, it is the archetypal twenty-first century start-up. As Bloomberg Business Week wrote, \u201cTaskRabbit is betting on a future where employment will seem much more like a series of small-scale agreements between businesses and labor than jobs in the traditional sense.\u201d\n\nRelated: Clinton\u2014I Don\u2019t Trust the Iranians\n\nSuch businesses can be disruptive. When Uber clashes with entrenched taxi interests, it faces a political headwind. Airbnb upsets hotel owners and, as important, unionized hotel workers. That\u2019s what alarms Hillary Clinton. That -- and a tendency for these upstart operations to elude regulation. She is going to have to make a choice: back the economy of the future, or double down on propping up the politics and policies of the past. Only one path will take her to the White House.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Is there a saboteur in Hillary\u2019s camp?", "title": "Hillary Needs a New \u2018Gig\u2019 If She Wants the Millennial Vote", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/07/22/Hillary-Needs-New-Gig-If-She-Wants-Millennial-Vote", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06152015_Hillary_Clinton_Announcement.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/07/22/Hillary-Needs-New-Gig-If-She-Wants-Millennial-Vote", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06152015_Hillary_Clinton_Announcement.jpg", "creator": "@lizpeek", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Is there a saboteur in Hillary\u2019s camp?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Here\u2019s why: Hillary Clinton absolutely needs the millennial vote.\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Pledges Bigger Rewards for Corporate WhistleblowersMaybe, but it won\u2019t be easy, especially if she attacks their worldview.\nStill, that survey preceded the roll out of most GOP campaigns as well as damaging revelations about the Clinton Foundation and how Hillary Clinton handled her emails.\nMoreover, Obama took 61 percent of the youth vote in four critical states: Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio.\nThat\u2019s what alarms Hillary Clinton."}
