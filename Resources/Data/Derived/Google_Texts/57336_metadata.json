But Republican supermajorities in the Ohio General Assembly have union bosses hedging their bets.\n\nThe top House Republican recipient of union money in 2014 was Majority Floor Leader Barbara Sears. Sears received a total of $27,350 from 13 different unions.\n\nState Rep. Anthony DeVitis received $25,700 from 12 unions. State Rep. Mike Dovilla received $24,450 from 10 unions and state Rep. Dave Hall received $23,700 from 13 unions.\n\nState Rep. Cliff Rosenberger, who is now the speaker of the House, received a total of $17,000 from seven different unions and was among 12 House Republicans paid between $10,000 and $20,000 by unions last year.\n\nHouse leaders, who did not respond to an Ohio Watchdog inquiry about their 2015 priorities, have indicated labor reform isn\u2019t on the radar.\n\nThe top union donor to Ohio House Republicans in 2014 was also one of the state\u2019s most vocal opponents of union reform. In addition to putting up highway billboards calling right-to-work poisonous and communist, the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 18 donated a total of $96,350 to House Republicans.\n\nThe IUOE chapter operates its campaign against right-to-work through Keep Ohio\u2019s Heritage, a nonprofit funded with $1 million from IUOE\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters. Right-to-work laws let workers opt out of paying union bosses.\n\n\u201cWhether Republicans utilize \u2018Paycheck Protection,\u2019 \u2018Workplace Freedom,\u2019 or other Right to Work tactics, opponents remain dedicated to ensuring the voting public knows the underlying nature behind the GOP\u2019s divisive agenda,\u201d Keep Ohio\u2019s Heritage said in a Jan. 8 media release.\n\nIUOE Local 18 last year gave campaign contributions to 21 Ohio House Republicans and to term-limited Ohio House Speaker Bill Batchelder.\n\nOther construction unions also donated large sums to Republican members of the Ohio House, who work with the governor and the Ohio Senate to set state infrastructure spending and labor policies.\n\nAffiliated Construction Trades Ohio, funded and led by affiliates of union coalition AFL-CIO, gave $50,900 to House Republican campaign committees last year. ACT Ohio donated to Batchelder and all 31 House Republicans who received union money.\n\nSheet Metal Workers International Association Local 33 gave House Republicans a total of $29,500 in 2014, while Ohio State Association of Plumbers & Pipefitters donated $25,500.\n\nOhio Nurses Association, the state affiliate of the American Nurses Association, donated a total of $30,000 to 16 Ohio House Republicans. Additional labor unions donating to Ohio House Republicans in 2014 and the total amount contributed by each included:\n\nBricklayers and Allied Craftworkers: $19,000\n\nUnited Food & Commercial Workers Local 880: $14,000\n\nLaborers International Union District Council of Ohio: $13,000\n\nOhio Iron Workers Association: $13,000\n\nIndiana-Kentucky-Ohio Regional Council of Carpenters: $11,000\n\nSheet Metal Workers Local 24: $8,500\n\nIn 2011, both houses of the General Assembly \u2014 including many current House members \u2014 passed Senate Bill 5, a package of public-sector union reforms prompting a labor uproar. It ultimately was repealed by voters after a $40-million union smear campaign.\n\nPublic-sector unions such as the Ohio Education Association and Ohio Civil Service Employees Association contributed nothing to Ohio House Republicans last year.\n\nHere is a complete list of current Ohio House Republicans receiving union donations in 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Labor unions donated money to 31 current Republican members of the Ohio House last year, dimming prospects for labor reform this session.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Labor unions donated money to 31 current Republican members of the Ohio House last year, dimming prospects for labor reform this session.", "title": "Labor unions share the love with 31 Ohio House Republicans - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/barbara-sears-ohio-house.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-18T09:50:59+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/199148/unions-ohio-house/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Labor unions donated money to 31 current Republican members of the Ohio House last year, dimming prospects for labor reform this session.", "title": "Labor unions share the love with 31 Ohio House Republicans - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/barbara-sears-ohio-house.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-02-17T04:00:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-18T09:50:59+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "Ohio House, Ohio House Republicans, forced unionism, forced unionization, IUOE Local 18, International Union of Operating Engineers, Barbara Sears, Anthony DeVitis, Mike Dovilla"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaab7\"", "article_summary": "IUOE Local 18 last year gave campaign contributions to 21 Ohio House Republicans and to term-limited Ohio House Speaker Bill Batchelder.\nPublic-sector unions such as the Ohio Education Association and Ohio Civil Service Employees Association contributed nothing to Ohio House Republicans last year.\nBy Jason Hart | Ohio WatchdogLabor unions donated money to 31 current Republican members of the Ohio House last year, dimming prospects for labor reform this session.\nOhio Nurses Association, the state affiliate of the American Nurses Association, donated a total of $30,000 to 16 Ohio House Republicans.\nHere is a complete list of current Ohio House Republicans receiving union donations in 2014."}
