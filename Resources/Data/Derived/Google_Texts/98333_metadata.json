Kennedy Jr. joined \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d Friday night. He was likely there to get some new eyeballs on his book \u201cLet the Science Speak\u201d but left with more than that: a new BFF, Bill Maher. The two kindred spirits took turns tearing into the \u201cliberal hypocrisy\u201d over vaccinations.\n\nFirst, though, something weird happened: Kennedy Jr. confessed to being \u201cvery pro-vaccine.\u201d \u201cI had all my kids vaccinated and want to see government policies promoting full-coverage vaccines,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way to do that is to have safe vaccines, and to have a credible regulatory process with regulators with integrity, and we don\u2019t have that today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we have a kind of grand bargain on this?\u201d Maher chimed in. \u201cIt just seems like we\u2019re calling each other kooks and liars. It seems like common sense that vaccines, even thimerosal, probably don\u2019t hurt most people \u2014 if they did, we\u2019d all be dead, because they\u2019re in a lot of vaccines that we all took \u2014 but some do. Obviously some minority gets hurt by this stuff. I don\u2019t understand why this is controversial? Why we have this emotional debate about something that\u2013 there is science there. It astounds me that liberals, who are always suspicious of corporations\u2026 and defending minorities, somehow when it comes to this minority that\u2019s hurt, it\u2019s like, \u2018You know what? Shut the fuck up and let me take every vaccine that Merck wants to shove down my throat.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Maher sided with noted anti-vaxxer Robert F.
