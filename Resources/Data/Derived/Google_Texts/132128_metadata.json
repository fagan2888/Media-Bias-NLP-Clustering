(Nigel Carse/iStock)\n\nIn early summer, a small, nonprofit HMO in Birmingham, Ala., got a surprise from the federal government: a bill for $1.7 million.\n\nThe charge, which amounted to a startling two-fifths of the premium money that Viva Health had collected from 1,100 customers, stemmed from an obscure part of the Affordable Care Act designed to support health plans with lots of sick, expensive customers by giving them money from plans with healthier customers.\n\nThe goal is to help keep insurance markets stable by sharing the \u201crisk\u201d of sicker people and removing any incentive for plans to avoid individuals who need more medical care. Such stability is likely to encourage competition and keep overall prices lower for consumers, while its absence can undermine both and limit coverage choices \u2014 the basic principles of the law.\n\nYet the way the Obama administration has carried out this strategy shows another unexpected consequence of the 2010 health-care law. The administration defends its approach, but critics say the \u201crisk adjustment\u201d program is having a reverse Robin Hood effect \u2014 taking money from some plans that are small, innovative or fast-growing, while handing windfalls to some of the industry\u2019s most entrenched players.\n\nIndeed, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, which dominates the market in which Viva sells, is getting more than $2.5 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely backwards,\u201d said New Mexico Insurance Superintendent John Franchini, one of several state insurance regulators concerned about the way this aspect of the ACA has been handled and the impact it is having on competition.\n\nSome insurers hit with big bills have already raised rates; others intend to limit what or where they sell. New health plans have been particularly vulnerable: For 2014, 27 of 35 such plans were told to write checks to the program, according to an analysis by a fledgling coalition of small insurers in the ACA insurance exchanges.\n\nUnless the government changes the way it figures out risk, more plans \u201cof all kinds\u201d are certain to depart, Richard Foster, the retired chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, warned in a critique commissioned by the coalition and sent to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.\n\nFoster emphasized in an interview that now is a particularly bad time to do anything that might hurt competition. Large insurers \u201care merging right and left, so you want to have new plans coming in and have a fighting chance of succeeding,\u201d he said.\n\nThe concerns were compounded last fall by another wrinkle in the law. The government was able to pay just 12.6 percent of the $2.9 billion it owes under a separate \u201crisk corridor\u201d program to plans facing unexpectedly large expenses.\n\nTogether, these challenges have buffeted insurers at a time when the long-term future of the exchanges, and insurance markets in general, are unclear. Though consumer interest in 2016 coverage has been robust, the administration\u2019s expectations for ACA enrollment growth remain modest, and premiums are increasing.\n\nHHS officials say the risk-adjustment program, though new and complex, is working well.\n\n\u201cIs this the be-all and end-all? Absolutely not, but it\u2019s a good formula,\u201d said Kevin Counihan, director of HHS\u2019s Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight. He said insurers had plenty of opportunities to make suggestions before the formula was put into use. \u201cThe tires of this thing were kicked . . . for a couple of years.\u201d\n\nHHS is planning a conference in March to discuss possible changes, but Counihan maintains that \u201cthere is no evidence that this formula is biased against small issuers.\u201d Some unexpected results, he said, may reflect \u201ca bunch of new issuers . . . getting their sea legs on for managing their business.\u201d\n\n\u2018A knife to a gunfight\u2019\n\nViva Health was created two decades ago as an offshoot of Alabama\u2019s largest academic medical center. It is not part of the federal marketplace, but the ACA requires that the plans it sells to small businesses match the benefits and coverage levels of small-group plans on the exchange. Viva did that in 2014 with lower premiums than policies sold by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, which accounts for more than 95 percent of that market.\n\nThe HMO saw a business opportunity. \u201cWe were really poised for great growth,\u201d said Anna Velasco, an executive vice president.\n\nThen, on June 30, HHS published its first risk-adjustment list, and Viva learned that it owed the $1.7 million payment based on its 1,100 small-group customers during the previous year. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, by contrast, would get a $1.55 million check for its small-group insurance and nearly $1 million more for individual health plans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to swallow,\u201d Velasco said. Alabama\u2019s insurance commissioner wrote to Burwell, questioning the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the data and calling for program improvements.\n\nTo determine an insurer\u2019s degree of risk, the government relies on records of medical diagnoses by doctors. But when a plan is new or has many new members, for example, not everyone sees a doctor right away, potentially making its customers appear healthier than they are. Wellness programs that help cut down on treatment also can skew a risk level. The formula does not include prescription-drug records, which might give clues to customers\u2019 health problems.\n\nViva and other plans encountered other issues, including in submitting data to HHS because of problems with the federal server. Officials \u201cwould give us reports back that basically looked like hieroglyphics,\u201d Velasco said. With no advance warning about low risk, the HMO did not scramble to fill in diagnostic records more thoroughly \u2014 as some large insurers did with help from consultants.\n\n\u201cRisk adjustment is dark art,\u201d said Michael Adelberg, a former HHS official who worked with nonprofit health plans created under the ACA, many of which have been hit hard. Adelberg believes few insurers understood how much things would shift. \u201cSome carriers brought only a knife to a gunfight,\u201d he said.\n\nViva lodged an appeal in August to protest its bill; the government has not yet made a decision. Under the rules, a health plan can win such an appeal only if federal officials did the math wrong \u2014 not if the program is unfair.\n\n\u2018You have to scratch your head\u2019\n\nCounihan declined to say how many plans have filed appeals. But Viva is not the only one.\n\nA provider-owned health plan in the Midwest has appealed, according to an administrator who asked that the plan not be identified so as not to antagonize federal officials. Its staff sent in diagnoses data with the understanding that it\u2019d be told if the submission had any mistakes. It did not hear of any. Instead, it got a big bill.\n\nBelatedly, the administrator said, the plan hired an outside consultant who discovered what HHS had not pointed out: When a patient had more than one diagnosis, the plan had listed them vertically, in a way the federal computer server could not read. The glitch made the plan\u2019s customers appear healthier than they actually were. Given the costs, the plan now expects to stop selling coverage in one area.\n\nDepartures have already begun. A decades-old South Florida HMO, Preferred Medical Plan, had the lowest premiums in Dade County for 2014 and received a risk-adjustment bill of $97 million. \u201cYou have to scratch your head,\u201d said its president, Albert Arca.\n\nLast spring, Preferred Medical stopped selling health plans on the federal exchange after administrators realized its finances were in worse shape than they had understood. Florida\u2019s insurance commissioner approved its premiums for 2016 ACA plans on one condition: that federal officials promise to pay everything owed Preferred Medical under the other ACA risk program. They did not promise, and the HMO is not allowed on the exchange this year. It is preparing to close down, unless it can negotiate a rescue plan with HHS.\n\nAs for Viva Health, Velasco said, \u201cWe are trying our best to stay in the game.\u201d It raised rates 7 percent, though that won\u2019t make up for the check it has written to the government.\n\nAnd reversing its intentions, it has stopped trying to get more small-business customers.\n\nRead more:\n\nHealth insurers to receive a fraction of what they\u2019re owed under ACA program\n\nMore than half of ACA co-ops now out of insurance marketplaces", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "New and fast-growing health plans say they\u2019re getting hurt by a part of the law meant to cushion insurers.", "title": "Critics say ACA \u2018risk\u2019 strategies are having reverse Robin Hood effect", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/critics-say-aca-risk-strategies-are-having-reverse-robinhood-effect/2016/01/13/e41cf574-b48f-11e5-a842-0feb51d1d124_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/12/29/Health-Environment-Science/Images/iStock_000018361156_Double.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@goldsteinamy"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/critics-say-aca-risk-strategies-are-having-reverse-robinhood-effect/2016/01/13/e41cf574-b48f-11e5-a842-0feb51d1d124_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "e41cf574-b48f-11e5-a842-0feb51d1d124", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "New and fast-growing health plans say they\u2019re getting hurt by a part of the law meant to cushion insurers."}, "article_summary": "Florida\u2019s insurance commissioner approved its premiums for 2016 ACA plans on one condition: that federal officials promise to pay everything owed Preferred Medical under the other ACA risk program.\nLast spring, Preferred Medical stopped selling health plans on the federal exchange after administrators realized its finances were in worse shape than they had understood.\nThe administration defends its approach, but critics say the \u201crisk adjustment\u201d program is having a reverse Robin Hood effect \u2014 taking money from some plans that are small, innovative or fast-growing, while handing windfalls to some of the industry\u2019s most entrenched players.\nRead more:Health insurers to receive a fraction of what they\u2019re owed under ACA programMore than half of ACA co-ops now out of insurance marketplaces\n\u201cRisk adjustment is dark art,\u201d said Michael Adelberg, a former HHS official who worked with nonprofit health plans created under the ACA, many of which have been hit hard."}
