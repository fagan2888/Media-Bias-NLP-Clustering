Most of the cases \u2014 except for one \u2014 occurred at the St. Clair Correctional Facility, which was originally designed to only hold about 984 men but squeezed in 1,292 prisoners at the end of May. \u201cThis is a very serious outbreak,\u201d Barrett told The Associated Press.\n\nSince TB's features are similar to the symptoms of other respiratory illnesses like pneumonia or bronchitis, the disease is \u201ceasy to miss,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate doctors are not thinking about TB, but we only had 108 cases in the state last year. Most doctors have never seen TB.\u201d\n\nAn airborne disease that attacks the respiratory system, tuberculosis was once the leading cause of death in the U.S. It\u2019s caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is spread through the air from one person to another. Symptoms include a terrible cough, chest pain, coughing up blood, fatigue, weight loss, and fever. Treatment for the disease involves taking several drugs for six to nine months. TB is not an issue that has only occurred in Alabama prisons; overall, TB is far more common in prisons than in the general population.\n\nBut Alabama\u2019s prison system in particular is overcrowded \u2014 and it\u2019s currently facing a lawsuit over medical treatment of inmates. In June 2014, the Southern Poverty Law Center released a report \u2014 Curel Confinement: Abuse, Discrimination and Death Within Alabama\u2019s Prisons \u2014 which concluded that the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) was neglecting medical care of inmates, and that this was in fact breaking federal law. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Plata in 2011 that not providing prisoners with proper medical care \u201cis incompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society,\u201d and neglecting these basic human needs becomes \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\u201d\n\nThe report described its private contractors as \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to the medical and mental health needs of the prisoners. \u201cAlabama\u2019s overcrowded prison system is breaking federal law by failing to provide a humane level of medical and psychiatric care, and by subjecting prisoners with disabilities to discriminatory conditions,\u201d SPLC wrote on its website. As a result, both the SPLC and the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Center filed suit against Alabama prisons, but the Department of Corrections has denied the allegations.\n\nIn the meantime, Barrett believes the worst of the TB outbreak might be over. \u201cI think we\u2019re at the end of it,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cThe Department of Corrections is a hotbed of TB because of the living arrangements.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tuberculosis, alabama prison system, tb", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Nine inmates in the Alabama prison system have fallen ill with tuberculosis during the worst outbreak to occur in five years.", "title": "Alabama Inmates Faced With Worst TB Outbreak In 5 Years", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/alabama-inmates-faced-worst-tb-outbreak-5-years-overcrowded-prisons-accused-neglecting-298216", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/prisoner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nine inmates in the Alabama prison system have fallen ill with tuberculosis during the worst outbreak to occur in five years.", "title": "Alabama Inmates Faced With Worst TB Outbreak In 5 Years", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/alabama-inmates-faced-worst-tb-outbreak-5-years-overcrowded-prisons-accused-neglecting-298216", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/prisoner.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/prisoner.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-15T10:28:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-15T10:28:42-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Nine inmates in the Alabama prison system have fallen ill with tuberculosis during the worst outbreak to occur in five years."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca434\"", "article_summary": "TB is not an issue that has only occurred in Alabama prisons; overall, TB is far more common in prisons than in the general population.\nAlabama's overcrowded prison system is facing a lawsuit for neglecting proper medical care of inmates, and now is also dealing with the worst tuberculosis outbreak to occur in five years.\nBut Alabama\u2019s prison system in particular is overcrowded \u2014 and it\u2019s currently facing a lawsuit over medical treatment of inmates.\nThere have been about nine cases of tuberculosis (TB) in the Alabama prison system so far, according to Pam Barrett, the director of tuberculosis control for the Alabama Department of Public Health.\nAs a result, both the SPLC and the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Center filed suit against Alabama prisons, but the Department of Corrections has denied the allegations."}
