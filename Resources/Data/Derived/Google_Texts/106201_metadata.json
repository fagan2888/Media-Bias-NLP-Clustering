Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks during a town hall meeting in Dallas in August. Brandon Wade/Getty Images\n\nJOHNSON CITY, Texas \u2014 Blanco County, in the rolling heart of the Texas Hill Country, is deep red; 73 percent of its citizens favored Mitt Romney for president, and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz took 69 percent of the vote here in the 2012 election. Kenneth Bowker, 47, owner of Kenny\u2019s Cantina in Johnson City, considered the federal government's shutdown from behind his beer-stained counter Tuesday, and said government spending \u201chas been unsustainable for a long time.\u201d \u201cBut they\u2019re just going to get the government credit card and swipe it one more time,\u201d said Bowker, a tall man with waist-length hair and long, expressive fingers. \u201cThey\u2019ll stick it to the American public. And who\u2019s going to pick up the tab for reopening the government? The American public.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s partial government shutdown \u2014 the nation\u2019s first in 17 years \u2014 saw 800,000 federal workers stay home as House Republicans refused to approve a budget that did not include a delay in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. In Texas, a state where only 26 of the 254 counties voted for President Obama in the 2012 election, those opinions leaned predictably to the right. Cruz, a tea party firebrand who tried to delay progress of health reform with a 21-hour speech to Congress last week, argued the health care reform law inflicts \u201cenormous harm on the American people.\u201d Texas Gov. Rick Perry, long an opponent of the federal government, blamed the Democratic leadership in Congress for using a \u201cmy-way-or-the-highway mentality\u201d to ignore Republican concerns about health reform. But Tuesday, so-called Obamacare didn\u2019t seem to be a key concern in some of the deepest red areas of Texas. Many small business owners in rural central Texas approved of a shutdown that would limit government spending but said they were exasperated by the political process that led to it. \u201cThe government spends way more money than we can afford. I can\u2019t live beyond my means,\u201d said Bowker. \u201cWhy do they get to live beyond their means?\u201d\n\n'Grown men whining'\n\nHe produced a $10 bill, which bore a red stamp that read, \u201cVote the Bastards Out.\u201d Many similar notes circulate in Johnson City, Bowker said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to overthrow the government, now would be a good time to do it. They\u2019re closed!\u201d he said with a smile. One patron, Jim Edwards, 63, a mechanic with a greasy shirt and mutton-chop facial hair, was less amused. \u201cI think it\u2019s a joke, but so is the government,\u201d he said. Johnson City is home to the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, which is operated by the National Park Service. As a federally funded entity, the park is closed. Edwards was concerned about his friend who works for the National Park Service, as well as for the \u201cguys on the border,\u201d who he said wouldn\u2019t be paid until the impasse is resolved. Beads of condensation formed on his bottle of Bud Light as he stared bleakly ahead. \u201cBunch of grown men whining that they want to be in charge. It\u2019s a joke,\u201d said Edwards, without levity. At C&M Automotive in Johnson City, where a bucket of American flags stands out front, 35-year-old owner Chance Kinsey rolled out from beneath a vehicle to share his thoughts. \u201cWhenever we have Democrats in office, we have a shutdown,\u201d Kinsey said, laughing nervously as he wiped a ratchet with a grease rag. \u201cThey\u2019re always trying to take away our guns, too.\u201d Travus Clark, a 17-year-old sheetrocker and friend of the family, was also in the shop. \u201cI don\u2019t like how they\u2019re not paying Border Patrol agents for working when the United States is shut down,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen without those agents? Gonna have a lot more Mexicans in Texas!\u201d Cheryl Pratt, 47, co-owner of Johnson City Sign Shop and Print, had a different concern. The National Park Service is a client, and it has frozen its orders until further notice. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good for tourism, either,\u201d said Pratt, who wore a red T-shirt showing the U.S. states in the shape of a heart culminating in an oversize Texas at the base. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to get up and work and do our thing and keep pushing forward. We\u2019re a mom-and-pop shop. We better get up and work, because no one\u2019s going to support us.\u201d\n\nBlaming Obama", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite efforts to tie impasse to 'Obamacare,' many Texans say they are fed up with political games, overspending", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/2/shutdown-frustrationmountingintedcruzstexas.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/2/shutdown-frustrationmountingintedcruzstexas/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.CruzCountry.1380743002676.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "Despite efforts to tie impasse to 'Obamacare,' many Texans say they are fed up with political games, overspending", "title": "Frustration over shutdown mounting in Ted Cruz's Texas"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/2/shutdown-frustrationmountingintedcruzstexas/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.CruzCountry.1380743002676.jpg", "description": "Despite efforts to tie impasse to 'Obamacare,' many Texans say they are fed up with political games, overspending", "card": "summary", "title": "Frustration over shutdown mounting in Ted Cruz's Texas"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Shutdown, Texas, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21b7\"", "article_summary": "Johnson City is home to the Lyndon B.
