But the proper term for that combination isn\u2019t Social Darwinism; it\u2019s classical liberalism. The central component of Douglass\u2019 worldview was the principle of self-ownership, which he understood to include both racial equality and the right to enjoy the fruits of one\u2019s labor. Consider the remarkable 1848 letter Doug\u00adlass wrote to his old master, the slaveholder Thomas Auld.
