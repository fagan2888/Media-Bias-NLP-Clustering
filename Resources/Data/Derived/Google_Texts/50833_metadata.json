In fact, it\u2019s increasingly clear that this clown show is, if anything, a huge gift to liberals. Every day that these yahoos are out there, they expose how empty and stupid the myth of the \u201crugged individual\u201d that the right so romanticizes really is. Instead, we get to see that these supposedly rugged individuals are, in reality, extremely silly people who are mostly there to play dress-up, engage in fantasies of self-importance, and beg the government to give them free money so they can get rich.\n\nAll liberals need to do to make the cause of Western \u201clibertarianism\u201d look stupid is to sit back and let these Oregon militiamen keep making fools of themselves.\n\nThe only big action that the militia has taken, besides doing a bunch of news conferences where they play at a being tough guys, is tearing down a fence put up to keep privately owned cattle from grazing on public lands. This action was meant to drive home their main demand, which is for the federal government to give ranchers across the West free land to graze cattle with.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how ridiculous and incoherent this demand is. These men are, to the last one, pretty hard-line conservatives, with ringleader Ammon Bundy being a registered Republican and Tea Party sympathizer. In other words, these are people who want to dismantle the social safety net and resent the federal government providing basic life necessities to people in need, such as food, shelter and healthcare.\n\nBut while they resent every bite of food going into a poor child\u2019s mouth, they are threatening a violent standoff on the grounds that the taxpayers should be feeding their cows for free. And let\u2019s be clear, this isn\u2019t a \u201ccow rights\u201d issue. They want the taxpayers to feed their cows, but rest assured, they plan to keep all the profits off selling the cows we fattened up for them. It\u2019s the equivalent of a car company asking the government to simply give them the steel for free to make cars.\n\nTheir ability to make themselves look bad isn\u2019t just limited to exposing the naked greed and entitlement underlying their demands. They\u2019re also reminding the public that they live in a fantasy world and their stunt is little more than an opportunity for a big game of Let\u2019s Play Pretend.\n\nThe game may have started by playing at being soldiers, but now it\u2019s morphed, as these childhood games often do. Now they\u2019re play-acting being a court of law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Oregon militia is a gift to liberals, because every day they stay, the more absurd and embarrassing they become", "title": "Thank you, Oregon militiamen: The longer you stay, the more ridiculous you and the conservative movement look", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Oregon militia is a gift to liberals, because every day they stay, the more absurd and embarrassing they become", "title": "Thank you, Oregon militiamen: The longer you stay, the more ridiculous you and the conservative movement look", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/14/thank_you_oregon_militiamen_the_longer_you_stay_the_more_ridiculous_you_and_the_conservative_movement_look/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/oregon_standoff7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Oregon militia is a gift to liberals, because every day they stay, the more absurd and embarrassing they become", "title": "Thank you, Oregon militiamen: The longer you stay, the more ridiculous you and the conservative movement look", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/oregon_standoff7.jpg", "creator": "@AmandaMarcotte", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Marcotte", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ammon Bundy, aol_on, oregon militia, Oregon standoff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "All liberals need to do to make the cause of Western \u201clibertarianism\u201d look stupid is to sit back and let these Oregon militiamen keep making fools of themselves.\nTheir ability to make themselves look bad isn\u2019t just limited to exposing the naked greed and entitlement underlying their demands.\nThe game may have started by playing at being soldiers, but now it\u2019s morphed, as these childhood games often do.\nIn fact, it\u2019s increasingly clear that this clown show is, if anything, a huge gift to liberals.\nIt turns out that this is the best possible decision federal authorities could have made."}
