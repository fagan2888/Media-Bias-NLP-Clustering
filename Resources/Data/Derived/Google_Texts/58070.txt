A 55-year-old Fond du Lac man has been ordered to stand trial in charges he molested a child 18 years ago, according to Action Reporter Media.

William Thomas is charged with sexual assault of a child under 13 years of age. If convicted, he faces up to 40 years in prison.

According to the news report, a Fond du Lac woman told police that Thomas sexually assaulted her in 1996 when she was 10. She said Thomas was living with her family at the time of the alleged assaults and that he acted as her "stepfather" in the wake of her own father's death.

Thomas is also charged with exposing his genitals to four girls on three separate occasions last summer.

Thomas is being held in the Fond du Lac County Jail. He is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in the case Friday.
