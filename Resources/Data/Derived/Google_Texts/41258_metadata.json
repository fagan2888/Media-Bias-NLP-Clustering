Small businesses often go this route because they have too few employees to justify purchasing a group plan.\n\nCompanies providing reimbursement can be fined $100 per day, per employee under the rule, which is not part of the Affordable Care Act. The penalty can be $36,500 per employee, and up to a total of $500,000, per year.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, the penalty on businesses for failing to comply with the employer mandate is only $2,000 per year,\u201d Michael Cohn wrote for Accounting Today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest penalty that no one is talking about,\u201d National Federation of Independent Business policy director Kevin Kuhlman said in a statement. \u201cThe penalty for compensating employees for healthcare-related expenses is enough to destroy most small businesses.\u201d\n\nAnother group, the National Association for the Self-Employed, has asked the Department of the Treasury, which oversees the IRS, to delay the rule until the end of the year so Congress can pass legislation to remedy the situation. Bipartisan legislation was introduced late last month in both houses of Congress that would repeal the law.\n\n-Noel Brinkerhoff\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nNew Tax Penalty Starts Today on Small Business Health Insurance (by Michael Cohn, Accounting Today)\n\nHealthcare Reimbursement Penalty (NFIB)\n\nNew Small Business Health Insurance Program Put on Hold (by Matt Bewig, AllGov)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Companies providing reimbursement can be fined $100 per day, per employee under the rule.
