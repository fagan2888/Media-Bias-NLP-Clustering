BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - A South Carolina man has been sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to human trafficking charges.

AL.com (http://bit.ly/1JeZIZq ) reports that authorities say 34-year-old Jermaine Omar Williams, of Greenville, pleaded guilty to two human trafficking charges last week after authorities say he brought teen girls to Birmingham and forced them into sexual servitude.

Williams was also charged with two counts of first-degree promoting prostitution, which were dismissed as part of the plea agreement.

Hoover Police Capt. Gregg Rector say Williams brought girls, ages 15 and 17, from South Carolina, and forced them to negotiate themselves for sex through online ads.

In July 2013, Williams was arrested in Hoover as part of the FBIâ€™s nationwide crackdown on child sex trafficking.
