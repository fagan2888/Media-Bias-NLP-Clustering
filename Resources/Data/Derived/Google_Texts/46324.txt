FORT FISHER, NC (WWAY) — This weekend is the 150th Anniversary of the 2nd Battle of Fort Fisher. Organizers say no other Fort Fisher program compares to what visitors can expect to see at the fort over the next few days.

150 years ago, Confederate troops fought to maintain control of the fort, but the Union Army launched a massive attack by water, and the mighty Fort Fisher fell.

"The more people who know about it, the more people who visit will come to understand its importance, its significance in the formation of our country," Friends of Fort Fisher Executive Director Paul Laird said

Historians, speakers, authors, high-ranking military members, Gov. Pat McCrory and about 700 reenactors are all be a part of this historic event.

A representative with the US Marine Corps Historical Company, Bob Burns, said his favorite part is "being able to communicate with the public and be able to explain the importance of the military in our history. A lot of people don’t recognize that, they don't understand it but here at Fort Fisher they have an opportunity to see it."

Louisa Whalen is in the 6th grade.

"This event is very interesting, because we are studying this in school, and now we actually get it see it in person," she said.

"The big attraction for kids is always the booming artillery, so we have a lot cannon fire, and they will really enjoy that," Laird said, but to Whalen she said basically seeing the whole thing was her favorite part.

No matter what age you are, this event is a fun way to learn the history that makes our region so special.

"I thought that the rifle they were using were very interesting," said Whalen.

"We saw a blacksmith and saw how they had tools back then," Whalen's sister Susanna said. "We also talked to a solider who was in the reenactment, and he showed us the toothbrush they use, which were made out of horse hair."

Admission is free. Activities continue on Sunday beginning at 9 a.m. Visitors are encouraged to arrive early.
