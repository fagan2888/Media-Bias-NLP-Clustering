Production is halted, right? The factory floor is empty, machines stand silent, robust pickets keep scabs out. The boss, caught off guard and losing money by the day\u2014or the hour\u2014relents and agrees to the workers\u2019 demands.\n\nBut when you\u2019re striking at a hospital, most of that goes out the window. Leaving patients with no one to care for them is the last thing your union\u2019s caregiver members would do. Besides, the law says you have to give the employer 10 days\u2019 warning so they can arrange for scabs to replace you.\n\nAnd most often health care strikes aren\u2019t open-ended: the union announces in advance the strike will last one day, or two.\n\nSo, how do you make a health care strike strong? What\u2019s the point in striking at all when the boss has substitutes lined up, and knows the crisis will end by Thursday? I talked with longtime strategists from several unions.\n\nA COSTLY DAY\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the money. Even a one-day strike costs the employer. That\u2019s part of what makes it work as a pressure tactic, though it\u2019s not the whole picture.\n\nHealth care workers are expensive to replace. Many jobs require certification or licenses, so finding enough qualified scabs means bringing people from out of town, maybe even out of state.\n\nHospitals commonly contract with agencies to recruit and supply replacement workers. When you add up the hourly rate scabs get, the agency\u2019s cut, and travel and hotel expenses, this day is going to cost the employer a lot more than a regular day.\n\nOn top of these expenses there\u2019s loss of revenue. Doctors don\u2019t want to work with scabs, and they\u2019ll often postpone non-urgent procedures. In a recent three-day strike at Oregon\u2019s McKenzie-Willamette Medical Center, \u201call the doctors except for one canceled all their surgeries,\u201d said Service Employees Local 49 Political Director Felisa Hagins.\n\nHospitals also sometimes transfer away what patients they can\u2014even as they publicly claim everything\u2019s fine. They want to minimize the risks while the hospital is full of newbies. That means lost revenue, too.\n\nSo, to avoid the strike\u2019s big price tag, the employer may blink and settle. There\u2019s typically a forced decision point a few days after you give your 10-day notice, when the scab agency requires a commitment, said Bill Cruice, executive director of the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals.\n\nIn his experience, \u201cthat\u2019s the most common way it plays out,\u201d Cruice said. \u201cSettlement occurs between when you give the notice and day six, when they have to write a check to the scab agency.\u201d\n\nLIMITED LEVERAGE\n\nBut your economic leverage may be limited, especially when the employer is big and rich. An extreme case is the Kaiser Permanente system of hospitals and clinics, where California nurses held a two-day strike in November.\n\nKaiser earns $12 million a day in excess revenue, California Nurses Association Co-President Zenei Cortez told me. (That\u2019s essentially profit, but Kaiser, like many health care corporations, is set up as a not-for-profit.) So the cost of a strike, even by 18,000 nurses, isn\u2019t going to bring it to its knees.\n\nUNITE HERE Local 5 represents Kaiser workers in Hawaii, and finds the health care giant even \u201cmore recalcitrant than the biggest corporations we deal with, hotels and banks,\u201d said Secretary-Treasurer Eric Gill.\n\nHe points to Kaiser\u2019s $30 billion in reserves. \u201cIn any normal corporation there would be stockholders who would agitate to have some of that distributed as dividends and so on,\u201d Gill says. \u201cIn the nonprofit environment, Kaiser leadership exists in a bubble, accountable to no one except themselves.\u201d\n\nKaiser is also unusual in that it\u2019s a prepaid insurance plan\u2014so its revenue depends on how many people are enrolled, not how many services are provided. That means canceling elective surgeries helps its bottom line for the day, by reducing expenses.\n\n\u201cSo in fact this strike will make them earn more money, because patients will not be in the hospital,\u201d Cortez explains.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the company is untouchable. \u201cStriking is effective at Kaiser not because of the money, but because of the ability to move public perception,\u201d Gill said. \u201cKaiser cares about membership enrolled.\u201d\n\nIMAGE-CONSCIOUS\n\nThat\u2019s something health care companies have in common, nonprofits especially: they\u2019re image-conscious. A strike is one of the strongest ways to get your message out to the public.\n\n\u201cIf you have a rally or a picket, sometimes the media attention is spotty,\u201d said Colleen Fewer, a Local 5 organizer, \u201cbut workers on strike, people pay attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cInevitably when there\u2019s a strike, the attention focuses on executives\u2026 They generally are loathe to have that light shined on them,\u201d Cruice said. \u201cYou find out the CEO of my local hospital is making literally $1.7 million a year\u2014what\u2019s going on there? That doesn\u2019t seem right.\u201d\n\nAnd in an industry where determined caregivers are always battling management over short staffing, \u201cstrikes allow us to bring great public attention to the problem,\u201d said Sal Rosselli, president of the National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW).\n\nHe can\u2019t remember a single health care strike that didn\u2019t have the staffing issue at its center.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of worker. Almost all go into this work to care for patients,\u201d Rosselli said. \u201cOrganized health care workers really are the last line of defense to employers thinking about the bottom line instead of quality care.\u201d\n\nNUHW, locked in a contract battle with Kaiser now for four years and counting, is preparing to strike again. Legions of new enrollments under Obamacare are producing quarter after quarter of record profits\u2014and making the staffing problems more acute, says Clement Papazian, rank-and-file president of the union\u2019s Northern California Kaiser psychiatric workers\u2019 chapter.\n\n\u201cMany of these people signed onto the rolls of Kaiser are formerly uninsured, and especially from a mental health standpoint, have multiple problematic health concerns,\u201d Papazian said, \u201cissues that don\u2019t require less staffing, but more.\u201d\n\nMORE THAN ONCE\n\nIn any industry these days, turning a strike to workers\u2019 advantage takes creativity, since bosses hold so many of the cards legally and financially. A long, open-ended strike \u201cis frequently the battle the employer wants,\u201d Cruice said.\n\nLegally, there\u2019s the risk the boss will lock you out and, unless the strike is based on unresolved unfair labor practice charges, permanently replace you.\n\nAnd practically, working people are pretty broke\u2014so the boss may be able to outlast you, unless you have a big strike fund, your state lets strikers get unemployment compensation, or there\u2019s a way strikers can get some temporary work, such as in a non-struck hospital.\n\nSo a short strike\u2014or more than one\u2014can show your power and draw community attention, without being as punishing as an open-ended strike can be.\n\nIf you do multiple short strikes, be careful how you frame them. A campaign of intermittent strikes is yet another item on the long list of tactics labor law doesn\u2019t allow. But you can strike over specific issues.\n\nFour Kaiser strikes in Hawaii last year offer a good example. The first was against the closing of the urgent care clinic. It was small, a minority strike.\n\n\u201cWe actually did not want everyone to come out,\u201d said Local 5 Organizer Marsha Bruhn. \u201cWe only wanted a handful of people, because we wanted to engage with the patients, and the only way that would happen is if Kaiser remained open.\u201d\n\nTeams of strikers leafleted patients on their way in and out of clinics, talked about how the layoffs would worsen care, and gathered signatures on a petition. \u201cIt kind of drove Kaiser crazy,\u201d Bruhn said. \u201cAt first they thought we couldn\u2019t be there, then they found out we legally could.\u201d\n\nFollowing the same model, the union tackled other issues with small strikes. The third was to protest an unfair labor practice: the company had disciplined two workers for participating in the second strike. Three hundred people joined this time.\n\nSome workers volunteered for each strike, and others chose to work. \u201cBoth the people outside and the people inside had assignments,\u201d Gill said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t stigmatize the group who stayed in.\u201d\n\nBut momentum built. The group choosing to strike doubled each time. \u201cBy the time the fourth one came around, everyone wanted to participate and we couldn\u2019t stop it,\u201d Bruhn said.\n\nWHO\u2019S GOT THE POWER?\n\n\u201cWhat made it harder for Kaiser was they couldn\u2019t predict who was coming to work or not,\u201d says Bruhn. The 10-day notice doesn\u2019t have to name which workers will go out\u2014though management, flustered, did try to get the union to produce a list.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t till the day before that the food service people said \u2018uh uh, we\u2019re not going,\u2019\u201d Bruhn said. \u201cKaiser had no idea, so they couldn\u2019t serve food in the hospital that day. They had to truck it in.\n\n\u201cIt was the unknown, I think, that really got to Kaiser.\u201d\n\nNow the union is preparing for a bigger strike, using a petition to gauge strong and weak spots as it builds toward a formal strike vote.\n\nEven a short strike is a vivid demonstration\u2014both for management, and for workers\u2014of who really runs the hospital.\n\n\u201cIn health care, there is no stockpiling. There\u2019s no \u2018we can still send orders out,\u2019\u201d Hagins said. A strike \u201cfundamentally changes their business model for the day\u2026 Upper management has to spend an inordinate amount of time and energy shifting everything, even for a short strike.\u201d\n\nIf the strike is wall-to-wall, all the more so. It\u2019s hard enough to run a hospital when, for instance, the nurses are scabs. But if it\u2019s just nurses, at least the unit secretaries, nursing assistants, phlebotomists, respiratory therapists, billing clerks, and housekeepers they\u2019re interacting with know what they\u2019re doing. If everyone can strike at once, you\u2019ve got a lot of power.\n\nHagins said she\u2019s seen bosses \u201ccome to the table the night before and work into the wee hours of the morning to avoid a strike.\u201d\n\nIf the strike goes forward, and goes well, don\u2019t expect the boss to settle the next day. In fact, that\u2019s unlikely: \u201cyou\u2019ve caused enough chaos at that point,\u201d Hagins said, that they\u2019re scrambling to get back in control of the schedule and hospital operations. But you may see the strike\u2019s impact in the boss\u2019s behavior days or weeks later, when you get back to the bargaining table.\n\nSTRONGER AFTER\n\nA common boss weakness: they underestimate what employees can pull off. Workers underestimate themselves, too.\n\nSo strikes also change the participants, individually and as a union. \u201cWhen the employer throws down the gauntlet and says they want to take certain things away from you,\u201d Cruice said, \u201cthere\u2019s a very fast educational process that happens, where that union member is never going to be the same again.\n\n\u201cSmart management lawyers understand that dynamic, and don\u2019t necessarily want to create a smart, educated union for the long-run.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s this core moment of struggle, where you make a decision collectively to withhold your labor,\u201d Hagins said. \u201cI have never seen workers take that decision lightly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the union in probably its purest form. A large group of people making a decision all at once, together, to do something brave\u2014that builds the union. They can see their power in that moment.\u201d\n\nLabor Notes co-editor Alexandra Bradbury previously worked for Service Employees Local 49.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "https://labornotes.org/sites/dc.lndev.opa.labornotes.org/files/logo_with_slogan.png"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf921\"", "article_summary": "And most often health care strikes aren\u2019t open-ended: the union announces in advance the strike will last one day, or two.\nHe can\u2019t remember a single health care strike that didn\u2019t have the staffing issue at its center.\nHealth care workers are expensive to replace.\nFour Kaiser strikes in Hawaii last year offer a good example.\nSo, how do you make a health care strike strong?"}
