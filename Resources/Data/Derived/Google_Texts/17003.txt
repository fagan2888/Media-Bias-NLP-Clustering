New Orleans might be considered the Mardi Gras capital of the world, but on Saturday Panama City gave Louisiana some serious competition for the title.

Thousands of people packed 11th street on Saturday for the 18th Annual Krewe of St. Andrews Mardi Gras Parade.

"The candy and the beads, it's a challenge and its just a good family event," said Panama City resident, Ryan Cox.

This year the parade saw a record high attendance.

"This thing has grown from a simple parade of maybe 2,000 people to today of 50,000 people because people want to come out and catch beads see the pretty floats," said St. Andrews Krewe King, Ed Strickland.

Krewe members say the reason behind their success, is the range of their audience.

"You can bring your kids, you can bring your pets, you can bring your entire family and enjoy and not worry that it's something inappropriate. Its just a good time and fun for the whole family," said St. Andrews Krewe Queen, Darlene Tate.

And the parade has even started to attract people from several neighboring states.

"This thing has got people from Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana has come down this year look at the traffic around town the last 3 or 4 days. Its an abundance of people coming out for this event," said Strickland.

And although the parade has attracted more and more outsiders every year, it's an event that's close to locals hearts. One family has five generations in attendance.

"We bring the grandchildren and everybody just really enjoys it and the kids love getting the beads," said Lee Costello.

"And those grandchildren are my great great grand children," said Eleanor Grammer.

And it's a family tradition they hope to continue for generations.

"I just think anything that promotes all this togetherness is a good thing," said Grammer.

St. Andrews Krewe members say they spent six months planning the Mardi Gras Parade.They say it takes a lot of work from choosing the theme to building and designing their floats.
