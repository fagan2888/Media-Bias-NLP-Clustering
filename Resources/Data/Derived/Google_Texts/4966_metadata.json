Melissa CC BY 2.0\n\nThink about your daily schedule. You probably come in around 9, then go out to eat around noon, and then go home at 5 and eat sometime between your arrival home and, say, 8 p.m.? But what if you ate lunch late? Maybe you skipped breakfast or had a late meeting, so dinner was pushed back until 9? And then, in your rush to find sustenance, you got fast food or some other form of grub that wasn\u2019t made by your own two hands? You\u2019re probably eating a lot less healthy than you co-worker who eats at regularly scheduled times and brings her lunch to work.\n\nResearchers found that college students who made their meals at home and regularly ate breakfast and dinner had better overall diets than their peers. In a new study published in the journal Public Health Nutrition, the students consumed less fast food and sugary drinks and ate more fruits and vegetables. Those who ate on the run or watched TV, played with their phone or used some other form of media to occupy their attention while they ate, or ordered food were less likely to eat healthy.\n\nWe all have busy lives, though, and most of us aren\u2019t college students, so what do we do when we want to eat healthy but don\u2019t have time to prepare, pack, and eat our own food at regularly scheduled times?\n\nMeal Prep\n\nThis involves a little forward thinking/preparing. First, you need a list of all the foods you want to cook and the ingredients you need to make them. Head to your grocery store, buy your ingredients, and take them home. Then, cook the next two days\u2019 worth of food and either refrigerate it or freeze it. That way, you won\u2019t have to worry about preparing a meal during your down time, since it\u2019ll already be prepared.\n\nSet Alarms\n\nJust like using an alarm to get yourself out of bed, use it to get yourself to eat as well. If you know when you start to get hungry during the day, set your alarm around that time, so you\u2019ll pull away from your work and find time to eat.\n\nTurn Off The TV\n\nNo matter what, you should always have the TV off during meal time. This allows you to communicate with your family or whomever you share meals with, and it also makes you more conscious of what and how much you\u2019re eating.\n\nSnack\n\nMany experts harp over the fact that we should always be eating: It helps with our metabolism and digestion. Being constantly satiated is good for you and keeps your cravings down. Now, snacking doesn\u2019t mean eating a bag of chips or six cookies every so often. Snack wisely; grab an apple or a handful of nuts or a protein bar instead.\n\nSource: Melissa N Laskaa, Mary O Hearst.
