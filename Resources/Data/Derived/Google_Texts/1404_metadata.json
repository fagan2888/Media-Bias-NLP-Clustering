Altman, the founder & executive chairman of the investment bank Evercore, Aaron Klein, the director of the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s Financial Regulatory Reform Initiative, and Alan B. Krueger, the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University.\n\nIn addition to a number of near-term changes intended to modernize the federal gasoline tax and improve how the government funds infrastructure projects and allocates the resources of, for instance, the Army Corps of Engineers, the authors also look toward a future where much of the revenue needed to improve and maintain the country\u2019s transportation infrastructure is raised almost automatically by charging users of that infrastructure.\n\n\u201cUser fees are an efficient way to fund infrastructure investment,\u201d they write, \u201cand the means of collecting fees from users and beneficiaries will change with the evolution of transportation technology.\u201d\n\nIn some areas, the case for a user fee is clear. Users of a high-speed toll road pay for the benefit of faster travel. Passengers on high-speed rail support the system through ticket purchases.\n\nThe authors propose federal funding for research into new ways of collecting user fees, including systems that would make existing transponder-based wireless toll collection systems, such as the EZ Pass in the Northeast and Midwest, and Florida\u2019s SunPass, interoperable nationwide. They also call for research into different methods of collecting user fees from drivers, including smartphone app-based systems that could work in ways similar to the current transponders.\n\nThe authors note, though, that not everyone who benefits from new infrastructure investment pays for it. A store owner, for example, whose supplies are delivered more efficiently, and who sees customer traffic increase when roads are improved, does not directly pay for that benefit.\n\nThey suggest a system under which the estimated property tax revenue increases expected to be generated by infrastructure improvements gets dedicated, in advance, to servicing the debt incurred while building those projects.\n\nIt\u2019s true, the authors note, that most user fees, including tolls and the gas tax, have a regressive element to them. A wealthy person pays a smaller portion of his or her income to drive on a toll road than a poor person does to make the same trip. However, they also argue that the benefits of improved infrastructure are progressively distributed, assuming individuals all benefit by the same amount. Additionally, the jobs created by infrastructure projects tend to be middle-income jobs.\n\nGiven that there\u2019s widespread agreement on the benefits of infrastructure investment, the authors also propose a national platform for pooled procurement to lower costs and a National Infrastructure Strategy Commission that would help plan and coordinate projects and maximize the country\u2019s returns on its investments.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new study suggests that over the long term, one of the best ways to solve the increasing problem of underinvestment in transportation infrastructure in the United States might be to take much of the funding out of the hands of government officials altogether.", "title": "A Better Way to Pay for Our Infrastructure Fixes?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/21/Better-Way-Pay-Our-Infrastructure-Fixes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02172011_highway_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/21/Better-Way-Pay-Our-Infrastructure-Fixes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02172011_highway_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A new study suggests that over the long term, one of the best ways to solve the increasing problem of underinvestment in transportation infrastructure in the United States might be to take much of the funding out of the hands of government officials altogether.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The authors note, though, that not everyone who benefits from new infrastructure investment pays for it.\nIt\u2019s true, the authors note, that most user fees, including tolls and the gas tax, have a regressive element to them.\n\u201cUser fees are an efficient way to fund infrastructure investment,\u201d they write, \u201cand the means of collecting fees from users and beneficiaries will change with the evolution of transportation technology.\u201dIn some areas, the case for a user fee is clear.\nHowever, they also argue that the benefits of improved infrastructure are progressively distributed, assuming individuals all benefit by the same amount.\nThey also call for research into different methods of collecting user fees from drivers, including smartphone app-based systems that could work in ways similar to the current transponders."}
