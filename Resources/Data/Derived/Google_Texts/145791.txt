Shoppers at the Toys “R” Us in Times Square in New York on Thanksgiving Day.

Toys “R” Us Inc. chief executive Dave Brandon said the toy industry isn’t putting up the kind of growth numbers that some predicted this holiday season.

“My preliminary view is we’re not seeing 6 percent to 7 percent category growth,” Brandon said in an interview. “Now maybe it’s still out there. We’ll see.”

Brandon took the helm at Toys “R” Us earlier this year, aiming to turn around the world’s largest retail chain devoted to toys. The company was taken private by Bain Capital Partners, KKR & Co., and Vornado Realty Trust in a $6.6 billion deal in 2005. Since then, the rise of Web competitors like Amazon.com Inc. hampered its performance, leading it to cancel plans for an initial public offering two years ago.

Revenue has dropped in each of the past three years, including during the holidays. So this Christmas is an important test for the retailer under Brandon. He’s also stepping up investments in e-commerce, aiming to better cope with Amazon and other online rivals.

The company has been stocking more inventory of the industry’s biggest brands, like Star Wars, than in past years. Games like Hasbro Inc.’s Pie Face helped fuel sales during Thanksgiving, Brandon said on Friday.
