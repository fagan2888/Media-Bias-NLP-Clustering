Scot Turner (R \u2013 Holly Springs) would prevent any \u201cstate authority, agency, board, bureau, commission, department, office, public corporation, or other entity of state government,\u201d from receiving federal funds without approval from the General Assembly.\n\nThe City of Atlanta and cities and counties in the Metro Atlanta area routinely receive federal funds, especially in the areas of affordable housing and social services.\n\nFederal funds made up twelve billion dollars of state agency spending in 2012, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper. Local governments expend millions more.\n\nOn his website, Turner promises he is \u201cfighting federal encroachment\u201d by trying to \u201ckeep the Federal Government from spending money they do not have on programs our citizens don\u2019t want within our state.\u201d\n\nWhat are some of these awful programs Turner assumes Georgians don\u2019t want?\n\nLast year, 71 Georgia counties and municipalities received federal community development grants to cover projects like fixing sewer lines and building new facilities for the local Boys and Girls Club.\n\nThree cities in Georgia received grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help promote local farmers\u2019 markets.\n\nAnd The National Park Service awarded a grant to The University of West Georgia to catalogue the archives of the poet Carl Sandburg.\n\nTurner probably didn\u2019t have Carl Sandburg in mind when he said he wants the General Assembly to, \u201cat least have a debate on whether these programs are appropriate.\u201d\n\nHe was more likely referring to federal programs that benefit low-income Georgians with support for food security, housing assistance, education, and basic health care.\n\n\u201cThe dictate of this bill would require huge amounts of time, energy, and expertise at the General Assembly level, rather than in our state agencies. Our agencies are manned by professionals in their fields,\u201d Pat Willis, executive director of Voices for Georgia\u2019s Children, told APN.\n\n\u201cWe put our trust in them to decide who they partner with, how they allocate resources, and so forth. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to set aside the professionalism of these state agencies and delegate their jobs to state legislators who certainly care, but don\u2019t have the expertise and staffing necessary to provide timely, effective decisions for our state goals and our economy,\u201d Willis said.\n\nThe Financial Accountability Act probably does not stand much of a chance of becoming law. Turner proposed the same legislation last year to no avail.\n\nSo far this year, Turner has sponsored 27 bills, including a measure to eliminate the state income tax. One of the bills was to increase government transparency; however, he withdrew the latter just two weeks after introducing it.\n\n(END/2015)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26e6\"", "article_summary": "Federal funds made up twelve billion dollars of state agency spending in 2012, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper.\nThe City of Atlanta and cities and counties in the Metro Atlanta area routinely receive federal funds, especially in the areas of affordable housing and social services.\nThe Fiscal Accountability Act, introduced by State Rep.
