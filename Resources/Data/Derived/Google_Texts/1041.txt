Doree (DuMont) and Jerry Hickman were married Sept. 7, 1964, on Labor Day in Mount Morris, Illinois.

They met at the University of Colorado-Boulder in a scientific terminology class. Before they were married Jerry had been accepted to the CU Medical School in Denver. Doree joined the Neurosurgery Research Department at the medical school.

In 1965, Jerry interned at Philadelphia General Hospital. Doree worked in research at Philadelphia Children's Hospital. The next year they moved to Newport, Rhode Island, where Jerry fulfilled his military duties in the Navy Medical Corps. During this time, their son, Grant, was born.

Jerry returned to the CU Medical School and completed residency in general practice. He joined Table Mesa Family Medicine in Boulder, where he practiced for 43 years. Doree has been a kitchen designer with her own company, Creative Cabinetry, for the past 30 years.

Cycling has been their favorite way to travel, and they have made 14 international trips.

The Colorado Music Festival & Center for Musical Arts is another passion, and Doree and Jerry have served on the organization's board and volunteered over the past 25 years. In addition, both have been involved on CU boards.

Grant and Holly have given Doree and Jerry three grandchildren, Garrett, Avery and Brielle, who live in the area. A family celebratory trip is planned to Africa in December.
