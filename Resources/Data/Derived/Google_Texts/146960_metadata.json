With the tide of arriving migrants slowing to a trickle, angst over Europe's long-suffering currency bloc has returned - with a vengeance.\n\n\"A storm is brewing,\" warned an editorial in the left-leaning daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung this week.\n\n\"Sometimes the fate of a people is decided in moments where there is not so much drama. That is what is happening now with Europe's currency union.\"\n\nThe renewed focus on the euro zone is tied to a series of distinct yet interconnected developments that have deepened the sense of anxiety in Germany's political and media establishment.\n\nThese include the shift away from austerity in southern Europe, the loose money polices of the European Central Bank and recent changes in the German political landscape.\n\nOne month ago, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a right-wing populist party that had railed against Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door refugee policies, surged into three state parliaments, stunning the established parties and forcing them into a strategic rethink.\n\nMerkel's conservatives emerged from this discussion convinced that they must do everything in their power to shift the domestic debate away from refugees, officials told Reuters.\n\nSince then, party leaders, led by Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, have stepped up their verbal attacks on the ECB's low interest rate policies.\n\nTheir fear is that the AfD, founded three years ago as an anti-euro party, could seize on this theme too in the run-up to the next federal election in 2017.\n\nOne senior coalition leader described the rates debate as \"the next big theme for the AfD\".\n\nLow rates are an especially sensitive topic in Germany because they are seen as eroding the savings of millions of people who have squirreled away cash in banks for their retirement. The AfD was quick to jump on ECB President Mario Draghi's comment last month that \"helicopter money\" - whereby a central bank hands cash directly to euro zone citizens to bolster inflation - was a \"very interesting\" concept.\n\n\"It is an opportune time to complain about the ECB right now,\" a senior official close to Merkel acknowledged this week.\n\nREFORM FATIGUE\n\nThe ECB is also coming under fire for another reason: the sense in Germany that its loose policies have diminished the pressure on southern European countries to reform their economies and reduce still-swollen debt piles and deficits.\n\nBerlin has watched on in horror this year as one euro zone country after another has signaled a departure from the consolidation path that Merkel and Schaeuble insisted upon at the height of the euro crisis.\n\nIn Portugal, a new Socialist government backed by far-left allies in parliament announced plans last month to lift the minimum wage by 20 percent, cut value-added tax for restaurants by a whopping 10 percentage points and reintroduce four public holidays.\n\nFurther afield, attempts by the French government to reform the labor market have stalled in the face of protests. And both Italy and Spain have signaled that they have little interest in listening to the European Union about lowering their deficits.\n\nMeanwhile, German frustration with Greece is bubbling over again as reform talks between Athens and its creditors drag on. This week the normally reserved German head of the euro zone's rescue fund, Klaus Regling, complained that Greek reform implementation was the worst in all of Europe.\n\nGerman newspapers have been full of charts showing rising debt levels across the euro zone's southern periphery.\n\nGermany and its euro zone partners still hold sway over Greece, which needs funds from its third bailout to pay its bills and avoid bankruptcy.\n\nBut Berlin is realizing that its influence in other countries, which never received a bailout in the first place or have already exited their programs, is limited.\n\nAlthough still strong at home, Merkel has emerged weakened in Europe from the refugee crisis. And in the eyes of many of her partners, Germany no longer enjoys the moral high ground on economic issues.\n\nAt a time when the euro zone is putting pressure on Greece to save on pensions, Merkel's coalition is considering reforms that would funnel more money to the elderly - another measure, it seems, which is designed to thwart the rise of the AfD.\n\nStill, the hand-wringing continues over southern Europe and an ECB with few if any arrows left in its quiver.\n\n\"If southern Europe continues like this the euro will slip into a new crisis,\" the Sueddeutsche editorial warned. \"And this time the coffers will be so empty and the defense mechanisms so weak that the currency could be completely swept away.\"\n\n(Reporting by Noah Barkin, editing by Peter Millership)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The euro zone crisis is back - at least in the minds of many German", "title": "'A storm is brewing' - Germans worry about return of euro crisis", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/14/storm-brewing-Germans-worry-about-return-euro-crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ecb-draghi_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/14/storm-brewing-Germans-worry-about-return-euro-crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ecb-draghi_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The euro zone crisis is back - at least in the minds of many German", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The euro zone crisis is back - at least in the minds of many Germans.\n\"If southern Europe continues like this the euro will slip into a new crisis,\" the Sueddeutsche editorial warned.\nBerlin has watched on in horror this year as one euro zone country after another has signaled a departure from the consolidation path that Merkel and Schaeuble insisted upon at the height of the euro crisis.\nStill, the hand-wringing continues over southern Europe and an ECB with few if any arrows left in its quiver.\nGermany and its euro zone partners still hold sway over Greece, which needs funds from its third bailout to pay its bills and avoid bankruptcy."}
