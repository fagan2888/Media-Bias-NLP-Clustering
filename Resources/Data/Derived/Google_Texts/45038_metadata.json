According to PolitiFact\u2019s analysis, Cruz was literally correct \u2014 but its rating claimed that his statement was half-wrong, anyway (emphasis added):\n\nCruz said that \u201cLorne Michaels could be put in jail under this amendment for making fun of any politician.\u201d Most experts we talked to agreed that the proposed amendment\u2019s language left open the door to that possibility. But many of those same experts emphasized that prosecuting, much less imprisoning, a comedian for purely political speech would run counter to centuries of American tradition, and would face many obstacles at a variety of government levels and run headlong into popular sentiment. In the big picture, Cruz makes a persuasive case that it\u2019s not a good idea to mess with the First Amendment. Still, his SNL scenario is far-fetched. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.\n\nAccording to Dictionary.com, the word \u201ccould\u201d means \u201cto express possibility\u201d and \u201cconditional possibility or ability.\u201d In other words, Cruz was literally correct \u2014 and should have been given a rating of \u201cTrue,\u201d which is something PolitiFact admitted even as it gave a different rating.\n\nMore recently, PolitiFact looked at a statement by Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), who is in a tightening race with former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. In an ad, Shaheen said that Brown \u2014 when he was a politician in Massachusetts \u2014 \u201cpushed for a law to force women considering abortion \u2014 force them \u2014 to look at color photographs of developing fetuses.\u201d\n\nPolitiFact ranked this statement as \u201caccurate but [needing] clarification,\u201d and gave it a \u201cMostly True\u201d rating.\n\nHowever, like its Cruz rating, PolitiFact ignored its own analysis and a basic dictionary definition in giving this ranking. From its so-called \u201cfact-check,\u201d with emphasis added:\n\nThe measure backed by Brown nine years ago made sure that women were provided photos of developing fetuses, along with a lot more information. It certainly forced doctors and their representatives to provide this information to women seeking abortions \u2014 except in cases of emergency \u2014 and it ensured women received the information both through verbal questions and a signed consent form. Brown has a point that the bill wouldn\u2019t have \u201cforced\u201d them to look at color photographs \u2014 but it did just about everything else it could possibly do up to that line. This statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.\n\nBack to our trusty Dictionary.com, we see that the word \u201cforced\u201d means \u201cenforced or compulsory.\u201d As its analysis shows, PolitiFact found that the failed measure backed by Brown would have forced women to receive information, and forced medical professionals to give the information, and would have forced women to affirm they received the information. But nowhere was it compulsory for women to look at what they were given, as PolitiFact noted in the bolded section of its analysis.\n\nTo be clear: This is not a defense of Brown\u2019s reprehensible position on abortion. But as it has done many times before, PolitiFact\u2019s rating shows that its biases lie not with reality, but with the promotion of liberal narratives to the public.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "That depends\u2026", "title": "It\u2019s time to ask PolitiFact: What is the meaning of \u201cis\u201d?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/10/12/its-time-to-ask-politifact-what-is-the-meaning-of-is/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-12T21:01:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-12T15:59:53+00:00"}, "keywords": "media bias, Politifact, Ted Cruz,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb714\"", "article_summary": "However, like its Cruz rating, PolitiFact ignored its own analysis and a basic dictionary definition in giving this ranking.\nIt\u2019s time to ask PolitiFact: What is the meaning of \u201cis\u201d?\nMore recently, PolitiFact looked at a statement by Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), who is in a tightening race with former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown.\nIn the big picture, Cruz makes a persuasive case that it\u2019s not a good idea to mess with the First Amendment.\nBut nowhere was it compulsory for women to look at what they were given, as PolitiFact noted in the bolded section of its analysis."}
