Trump criticizes companies like Apple and Ford for making their products overseas, but his own signature line of dress clothes are produced in low-wage countries like China, Mexico and Bangladesh.\n\nNobody is more confused by this candidate's say one-thing-do-another approach than the 500 hotel workers at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas who voted last December to join the Culinary Workers Union. Trump refuses to bargain with them, even after more than a dozen objections that were filed with the NLRB were either withdrawn or dismissed, and the union was certified as a bargaining agent.\n\nNot surprising, Trump has supported laws to weaken unions and has worked at every turn to divide Americans along lines of race, ethnicity and gender.\n\nWhile the USW is not making an endorsement in the Democratic race, the union is comfortable with both candidates. Besides better wages and collective bargaining rights for workers, the USW believes the Democrats are on the right side of working-family issues such as taxes, health care and trade.\n\nThe USW sees Trump's tax plan as one benefiting millionaires and billionaires at the expense of the middle class where the top tenth of one percent would get more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of American taxpayers combined.\n\nAlso, the USW is troubled by Trump's promise to end the Affordable Care Act when his plans for a replacement are either vague or nonexistent, and the ideas he has proposed would increase costs and reduce the number of people who are covered.\n\nSocial Security is another issue on which Trump cannot be trusted. He has referred to the program as a Ponzi scheme and has in the past called for it to be privatized.\n\nEven issues such as trade where it could appear that Trump's positions might align with working people, there is solid reason for skepticism. He may have the right talking points, but his actions don't back up his words.\n\nThe USW has been in the forefront of the fight on trade. We have witnessed the various trade agreements that have been put forward over the past decades and the harm these agreements have inflicted on the American work force and our economy. We have learned how to seek allies and build coalitions in this struggle, and we know who our friends are.\n\nToo much is at stake in the upcoming election to allow issues most important to working American families to become vehicles of deceit. That is why the USW cannot consider endorsing Donald Trump as President of the United States.\n\nThe USW represents 850,000 workers in North America employed in a wide range of industries that include metals, rubber, chemicals, paper, oil refining and the service and public sectors.
