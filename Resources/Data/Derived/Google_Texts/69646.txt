One in four Americans have either lost their health insurance because of Obamacare or know someone who has, according to a new poll shared first with The Daily Caller.

The YG Network Congressional District Poll of 1,652 likely voters in 11 competitive U.S. House districts indicates Obamacare will be a powerful issue that motivates voters in important races in 2014.

Twenty-seven percent of respondents claimed knowing someone or personally receiving a health-insurance cancellation notice. Seventy-three percent said they didn’t have that experience.

In the same poll, 57 percent said these cancellation notices would be one of the most important issues in the 2014 election cycle. More than eight in 10 of those polled blamed both congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama for the cancellations.

The YG Network — a conservative group — commissioned the poll in House districts in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire and New Jersey.

The poll comes after PolitiFact named Obama’s repeated promise that “If you like your health plan, you can keep it” the “Lie of the Year.”

The poll also takes a look at economic issues, indicating that four in 10 people are spending less during the holiday season this year. Asked to compare their spending on gifts, meals and travel this holiday season to last year, 40 percent said they are spending less. Only 12 percent said more, while 48 percent said they are spending about the same.

Retailers have already seen a decline in sales this holiday season. According to the National Retail Foundation, Americans spent 4 percent this Thanksgiving than last year.
