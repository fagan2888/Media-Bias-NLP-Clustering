MOCH CEO Tim Shryack told the Times Monday the new building will be built in the parking lot just east of the current modular building on Elm Street next to the Gainesville post office. Officials are working with architects now and hope to break ground on the new 5,000-square-foot building sometime this fall.\n\n\u201cThe building will be on the same site, but we will position the new building so the front faces south,\u201d Shryack said. \u201cWe want to build a really nice building that serves the community well. We hope to include some form of a community room where businesses or local folks can congregation or use for meetings.\u201d\n\nThe estimated cost of the new structure will be around $1.2 million, \u201cbut we just don\u2019t know right now exactly what the total will be,\u201d Shryack said.\n\nMOCH has provided medical, dental and mental health services to children and adults in Gainesville since 2003, he said. Other MOCH offices operate in Ava, Mansfield, Cabool and Mountain Home. Local providers include physician Holli Ruby, D.O., and Jenna Cravens, DNP (doctorate-level nurse practitioner) as well as dentists Elizabeth Barrett and Sybil Fortner. The clinic serves Medicare and Medicaid patients as well as those who are self-paying or have insurance. During calendar year 2015, the Gainesville office served 1,956 medical and dental patients who made 5,800 patient visits.\n\nShryack said he hopes construction can be completed by late 2017 without any interruption in service. Once the new building is finished, the modular structure will be removed from the site to provide parking space.\n\nThe office is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Friday.
