But if he is to remain healthy throughout the 2013 season, it will be thanks in part to a state-of-the-art, custom-fit knee brace known as the Defiance.\n\nSEE ALSO: REDSKINS 2013: Special section\n\nMade by DJO Global, a company whose subsidiary, DonJoy, has produced orthopedic devices for 35 years, Griffin\u2019s brace uses a four-points-of-leverage system to keep the repaired ACL stable and prevent the twisting motion that ripped apart his LCL late in that postseason loss to Seattle.\n\nDuring that game, Griffin was wearing a DonJoy Playmaker, a soft knee brace meant for mild to moderate ligament instabilities. That came after a hit late in the Dec. 9 contest against Baltimore that kept Griffin out of the following week\u2019s game and left him hobbled for the rest of the season. The key question: Will the new brace limit Griffin in any way?\n\n\u201cLast year, it was a concern because I didn\u2019t play with a brace or have to rehab with a brace all year,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cSo when you put it on, it does kind of restrict you a little bit more because you\u2019re not used to it. Now that I\u2019ve rehabbed with it and everything you get used to it. Your leg gets stronger and you can carry that extra weight.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Opener vs. Eagles has an air of mystery for the Redskins\n\nGriffin considers himself a passing quarterback who can run when needed, but the Redskins used that skill to maximum effect last year with the amount of read-option plays they called. Griffin said last week that there would be \u201ctweaks\u201d to the offense this year and acknowledged that he must continue to be smarter about sliding to the ground or stepping out of bounds when he sees trouble coming.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of keeping him on the field for 16 games and giving Washington a chance to repeat as NFC East champion. But at more than 1 pound, the brace will play a role, too. With a cuff on the back of the calf and another on the front thigh, pressure is put on the tibia, the lower leg bone, and the femur, the thigh bone, to lock the knee into place.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like it to be 4 ounces,\u201d said Brian Moore, DJO\u2019s director of athletic business and team sports. \u201cBut that brace is as light as it can get to be as strong as it can be.\u201d\n\nThe company does its homework. A representative measured Griffin\u2019s thigh and his knee, among eight different spots on his right leg, to ensure a custom fit. Once the angles of his bones and joints are noted, the brace is manufactured to specifics.\n\nAn ACL\u2019s job is to prevent the tibia from moving forward. The brace uses pressure to keep the tibia in place and reduces stress on the ACL by about 50 percent, according to a study cited by Mr. Moore. So far this summer, it seems to be working.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the brace affect [Griffin] at all. He runs the same to me,\u201d Redskins offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cHe looks as good as he always has. He\u2019s been cleared since the beginning of training camp so it\u2019s not like this has just happened. We\u2019ve seen him for a month fully 100 percent.\u201d\n\nWashington offensive lineman Kory Lichtensteiger tore his ACL, MCL and meniscus during a game on Oct. 16, 2011, against the Eagles. He has worn a Defiance brace ever since, though it took some adjusting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cumbersome at times. I think once you\u2019re playing, it\u2019s fine and it shouldn\u2019t slow you down.\u201d Lichtensteiger said. \u201cInitially, it restricts your movement. You have to break it in, too. But once you get a little sweat on it and get it lubed up, it\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nGriffin wore a Defiance brace during his redshirt sophomore season at Baylor after an ACL tear in 2009. The cuffs are what keep the knee in normal extension front and back. It\u2019s the rigidity of the 1-inch-wide hollow carbon fiber frame running down the leg that lets Griffin cut hard side-to-side and remain protected.\n\nPatented in 1992, Defiance braces have advanced leaps and bounds thanks to technological increases. Griffin\u2019s brace also now has a force-point hinge in the center that acts as a shock absorber.\n\nWhen Griffin\u2019s knee closes to within 25 degrees of full extension \u2014 the point where serious injury is more likely to occur \u2014 the hinge helps slow the knee. Moore compared it to the spring on a diving board that can be tightened to reduce bounce. The hinge also \u201cteaches\u201d the knee how to flex when running, jumping or cutting, which also limits injury risk.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a beautiful brace leg, he\u2019s very muscular,\u201d Moore said. \u201cNot all of our patients are Robert Griffin III. We might have 5-foot, 300-pound people with knee problems. Here you\u2019re putting it on muscle, not loose tissue. His leg is ideal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robert Griffin III is set to start the opener against the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday night at FedEx Field.
