The most recent jobs report is looking as positive as ever, and the numbers speak for themselves:\n\n1. 72 Months of Consecutive Job Gains\n\nFor as long as the U.S. has tracked these sorts of statistics (since 1939), never has there been an unbroken streak of job growth that\u2019s lasted this long. Seeing the steady increase in employment not wavering for six straight years shows that Obama\u2019s economic efforts are not only successful, but leaving the country on the right track for continued improvement.\n\n2. The Unemployment Rate Sits at 4.9%\n\nSince the economy crashed back in 2008, experts have told us that recovery would be a gradual process. It\u2019s panned out that way, too, and now eight years later, we\u2019re currently at the lowest rate of unemployment yet. While we still have a disproportionate rate of Africa American unemployment (8.8%) that needs to be addressed, the good news is that number is down by 50% since the country hit 16.7% black unemployment back in the summer of 2011.\n\n3. 242,000 New Jobs Were Created in February\n\nWhile the rest of the world is somewhat stalling on job creation at the moment, the U.S. recorded over 242,000 jobs last month \u2013 that\u2019s 50,000 more than economists had anticipated. Most of the jobs came from a few specific industries doing particularly well at the moment: retail, restaurants and bars and \u2013 yes \u2013 health care. Obama took the opportunity to joke about all the criticism he faced for the Affordable Care Act. \u201cOur businesses have created jobs every single month since I signed that job-killing [law,]\u201d he said.\n\n4. 2.2% Wage Increase\n\nIn the past year, Americans started earning 2.2% more at work. While the number isn\u2019t large enough to change a lot of people\u2019s lives or make them feel more optimistic about income equality, and least it\u2019s going up rather than down. It\u2019s going to take some action by Congress to better address the wealth gap and devise rules that might ensure that wage increases are in lockstep with the rate of inflation.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s greater wage increases that Obama wants to address in his final months in the White House. \u201cThat\u2019s what we should be debating,\u201d said the president. \u201cThat\u2019s the debate that is worthy of the American people. Not fantasy, not name calling, not trying to talk down the American economy. There\u2019s a huge gap between the rhetoric that\u2019s going on out there and the reality of success that we\u2019re seeing in America\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s no wonder that Republicans are resorting to painting a negative picture of the economy and blaming Obama for these fabricated problems. If Americans were to take an honest look at the job and unemployment figures, they\u2019d probably be impressed with the work Obama has done thus far, and that\u2019s not going to help Republicans at all at the polls this November.\n\nPhoto credit: Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans are dismissing Obama's economic accomplishments as part of their campaigns, but the numbers don't lie.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3171/3170102.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "barack obama,president,jobs,unemployment,economy,economic growth", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Not fantasy, not name calling, not trying to talk down the American economy.\nThe Unemployment Rate Sits at 4.9%Since the economy crashed back in 2008, experts have told us that recovery would be a gradual process.\nIn fact, it\u2019s greater wage increases that Obama wants to address in his final months in the White House.\nIt\u2019s panned out that way, too, and now eight years later, we\u2019re currently at the lowest rate of unemployment yet.\nObama took the opportunity to joke about all the criticism he faced for the Affordable Care Act."}
