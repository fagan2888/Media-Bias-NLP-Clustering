When I read the recent New York Times piece about the current culture there, my heart sank a little; looking back, I still feel some nostalgia for the place. I started in 1999 in a department that no longer exists, so the Amazon I knew then is not the one we know today.\n\nAlthough the job market was good in the late 1990s, I left college with a liberal arts degree and a lot of uncertainty about my future. After an internship at a newspaper in college, I wasn\u2019t sure I was cut out to be a reporter: I had a near panic attack any time I cold-called someone for an interview. I also spent some time in the career center reading their handout for English majors. It told me I was a generalist. I had good writing skills. I could do anything! But studies have shown that too many choices can be paralyzing and the stakes felt high.\n\nI moved to Seattle and began my job search. I was offered a job writing for a Native American gaming magazine that was somewhat tempting \u2013it was a legit writing job and I have been known to kill time at a craps table. But it involved a hellish commute and I didn\u2019t see much of a future in it. Next, I went on two interviews for a job as an assistant at a distribution company. But it was located next to an industrial shipyard and I couldn\u2019t imagine spending a gray Seattle winter staring out at cranes and rusting metal while repeatedly saying, \u201cMs. Martin is on another call, can I take a message?\u201d\n\nThe recruiter did a good job selling me on Amazon when we met in her office in a high-rise in downtown Seattle. \u201cThere is no dress code \u2013they don\u2019t expect you to spend a lot of money on work clothing,\u201d she said, looking knowingly at my khakis and chunky black loafers.\n\n\u201cAnd you get stock options,\u201d she continued. This was the golden ticket in the late \u201990s \u2013 get in at the right time and place, and you could be enjoying your retirement home in the Greek Isles by the time you turned 40. Of course, there were no guarantees that Amazon would make it at that time \u2013 dot-coms everywhere were erupting and then fading like fireworks in the night sky.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s in the customer service department?\u201dI asked.\n\n\u201cYes \u2013 you\u2019ll be answering phone calls and emails, but they require everyone to have a college degree. They use a Unix-based system, so it takes some thought to operate,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ve placed lots of interesting people there \u2013 history majors, art majors, philosophy majors\u2026\u201d This had some appeal. I enjoyed the company of like-minded liberal arts majors, no matter how impractical our degrees might be. Perhaps the job would provide an island for us to gather and put our degrees to use by memorizing Unix commands and assuaging customer fears about their missing copy of Memoirs of a Geisha.\n\n\u201cIs it possible to move on to other departments?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nThat settled it. I would do a short stint in customer service just as a stepping stone I told myself. How bad could it be?\n\nAfter a month of training I sat down at my desk for my first phone shift. As I put on my headset, my hands were shaking slightly \u2013 I was worried the next few hours would be filled with irate callers. Then the phone rang and the voice on the line said, \u201cGood morning, I can\u2019t get into my account. Can you help me?\u201d I could. It was an easy password change. As the day continued I found that most of the calls were straightforward. People were nice if I was, and they were often appreciative of the help.\n\nI answered phone and email questions ranging from the basic (\u201cWhen will my order arrive?\u201d) to the semi-crazy (\u201cI couldn\u2019t use my gift certificate because I was attacked by wild animals\u201d). The Internet was also still a new phenomenon for many people, and I spent a lot of time explaining what email addresses were or that we had no physical catalog or stores to send them to. I heard a story about one rep who got a call from a man asking him to find a restaurant for him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, we aren\u2019t really supposed to do that,\u201d the rep told him.\n\n\u201cBut someone did it for me last time,\u201d the caller said. So the rep just opened up an AltaVista search window and looked up the info.\n\nI never personally found a restaurant for anyone, but I did have an awful lot of days that went like this.\n\nI get to my cubicle at 5:45 a.m. to prepare for a 6 a.m. phone shift and see some of the night crew mulling around in their pajamas. When I put on my headset the phone doesn\u2019t ring immediately, so I read through the emails that have accumulated overnight. The most recent status report says: \u201cAll is quiet for now, but the angry New Yorkers are about to wake up, so get ready.\u201d The phone rings and I jump.\n\n\u201cThank you for calling Amazon.com, how can I help you?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you order a book for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, but I can walk you through the process. Do you have an email address?\u201d\n\n\u201cbob1945\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, and what\u2019s the rest of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is usually more \u2013 something after an \u201ca\u201d with a circle around it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy address doesn\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey all should. Do you have an Internet provider?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes \u2013 AOL.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, that\u2019s your email address then: bob1945@aol.com. You\u2019ll need that to place your order. Now let\u2019s find the book you want. You can just search for the title in the box at the top of your page.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I get to that box?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust click on it with your mouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a mouse. I have Web TV.\u201d I sigh audibly. I\u2019ve heard of the program but never actually seen or used it myself and only know it operates differently than a typical computer.\n\n\u201cOK, can you describe what you do have?\u201d I ask, settling in for a long call.\n\nWhen I started working at Amazon the company was spread out among a couple of different buildings in downtown Seattle. My department was housed in the rented-out first floor of an ageing office building. I worked in a sea of cubicles lit with dimmed fluorescent bulbs, computer screens and a hodgepodge of Christmas lights. The customer service department was divided into different teams, which they called quads. Handmade signs announcing the quad names hung over different cubicle groups. Desks were decorated with action figure collections, wrapping-papered walls, or mosquito netting. My first company badge was just a simple laminated piece of green paper that had the company name and my login on it. No picture. No bar code. A fourth grader could have made a very good counterfeit replica. Most of us in the office called each other by our logins rather than our first names.\n\nThere were only three tabs on the website when I started \u2013 Books, Music and a recently launched DVD/video store. A couple months after working there a group of reps were pulled into a \u201cmystery\u201d quad. They were sectioned off from us and couldn\u2019t talk about what they were doing. Later that year we found out \u2013 auctions. Then toys. Then tools. I remember someone sending around a joke mock-up of a future Amazon homepage that had 30 tabs cluttering the top \u2013 one of the tabs said \u201cBiscuits.\u201d They solved the tab design issue, but otherwise it wasn\u2019t that far off from what they became. As we moved further away from a books focus, I debated whether I really wanted to be working for the Wal-Mart of the Web. I would sit through PowerPoint presentations at all-hands meetings and realize that the quirky dot-com I had signed up for was becoming like a big corporation that I always thought I would avoid.\n\nWhen I began in January the department was still recovering from the biggest challenge of the year \u2013 the holiday shopping season. The reps who had been through it seemed exhausted, and I quietly aspired to get a job in the editorial department before the end of the year. That first year the days were constantly counted down; as early as March emails would announce \u201cOnly 300 more days until Christmas!\u201d\n\nIn October I was hired into a Quality Assurance group (the people who \u201cmay be recording the phone call for quality assurance purposes) and narrowly escaped a regular phone shift during the holidays. But when the red lights on the boards above our cubicles flashed long hold times I would jump back on the phones to help out, and still spent good portions of my day responding to customer emails.\n\nAs we crept nearer to Christmas, the company authorized unlimited overtime and many of us started pulling 10+ hour days. The Seattle department was the only branch of customer service the company had at the time, so people had to staff it 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I had heard rumors of them putting some sort of \u201cwe are closed for Christmas day\u201d voice mail on the phones during the really early years, but those days were gone.\n\nThe week after Thanksgiving I was responding to emails as quickly as possible. I had music playing on my headphones to block out distracting co-workers and the riot on the street below. It was 1999, and Seattle was trying to host a World Trade Organization meeting. Protesters dressed in turtle costumes had been squaring off with police in riot gear on the streets around our building most of the morning. Normal offices probably would have closed earlier, but we were a 24-hour customer service center heading into the busiest time of year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As a liberal arts grad in the late '90s, I was prepared for many things.
