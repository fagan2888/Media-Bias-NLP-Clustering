C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter in the May 2014 Republican primary.\n\nSenate GOP Caucus Chairman Russ Fulcher cites Otter\u2019s decision to establish a state-run health insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act as a motivating factor. The 51-year-old Fulcher tells the Idaho Statesman in a written statement that he\u2019s concerned Otter has lost touch with the will of the people of Idaho.\n\nFulcher opposed the state exchange, contending it meant Idaho surrendered its sovereignty. He says he hasn\u2019t decided to run but is exploring the possibility due to the support he\u2019s received. Fulcher is a former Micron executive now in the commercial real estate business. He\u2019s married with three children.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/newsradio1310.com/files/2013/10/Butch-Otter-Head-shot.jpg", "sailthru.author": "aptwinfalls", "description": "A conservative lawmaker from Meridian says he filed paperwork Saturday to begin raising money for a possible challenge against Gov.
