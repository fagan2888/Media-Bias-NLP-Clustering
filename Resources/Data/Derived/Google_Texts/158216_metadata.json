Party leaders reportedly worry whether his antics could derail the primary; some suggest he should be seen as more than just an underdog.\n\nThe latter is a reasonable fear for Republicans: The unending media attention Trump has received for calling some Mexican immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ckillers\u201d hasn\u2019t actually hurt him in the polls. In fact, it\u2019s been the opposite: Local Republican leaders everywhere have been quoted as appreciating Trump\u2019s honesty and how he\u2019s put all other candidates on the spot for their immigration policy ideas.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t just a soundbite-hungry media\u2019s creation; he\u2019s a shrewd businessman who will shake up the 2016 election in a way we haven\u2019t seen since perhaps Ross Perot\u2018s kooky independent run in 1992. But as a GOP candidate with actual media skills (read: the ability to confidently steamroll any reporter who comes his way, and turn any questions about his bizarre statements into media criticism), Trump could present a much more serious threat than Perot ever was.\n\nTrump will most assuredly be on-stage for Fox\u2019s first primary debate next month, and CNN\u2019s the month after. He will predictably put every other candidate under his thumb on issues like securing the border, fighting ISIS, and trade policy. And you can bet he will also turn any hostile questions from the moderators into a rallying cry against unfair media bias.\n\nSo, at this point, what could take Trump down a peg?\n\nNBC\u2019s Meet the Press host Chuck Todd thinks Trump \u201chas nowhere to go but down\u201d because of several remarks the mogul made to Tim Russert and Larry King way back in 1999:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very pro-choice,\u201d Trump told Russert when asked if he would ban partial-birth abortions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived in New York City and Manhattan all of my life,\u201d he said in the same interview. \u201cSo my views are a little different than had I lived in Iowa.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very liberal when it comes to health care,\u201d he told King. \u201cI believe in universal health care.\u201d\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, GOP rivals and outside groups will make Iowa and New Hampshire voters know about those lines if Trump is still riding high in the polls by November or December,\u201d Todd asserted of the above quotes.\n\nDon\u2019t be so certain.\n\nThose late-term abortion comments were previously trotted out in 2011 when non-candidate Donald Trump surged in the 2012 Republican primary polls. Did they expose Trump as an opportunistic flip-flopper? Au contraire: Trump ascribed his Mitt Romney-esque change of heart to an experience with a friend\u2019s pregnancy.\n\nAnd earlier this year, Trump seemingly got ahead of the story by giving multiple interviews in which he openly declared himself anti-abortion. \u201cAs I\u2019ve grown older, as I\u2019ve seen things happen in life, I\u2019ve changed my views \u2014 and others have also,\u201d he told the Des Moines Register. Indeed, as HotAir\u2019s Ed Morrissey noted, such a stance could actually win over staunchly conservative voters because the centerpiece of Roe v. Wade herself has converted on the issue.\n\nAs for having once been to the left of President Barack Obama on health care? Voters have already heard Trump beat his chest and call the Affordable Care Act a \u201ctotal disaster\u201d full of \u201clies\u201d that must be repealed and replaced. They certainly won\u2019t have trouble buying the idea that he underwent a genuine conversion on that issue as well.\n\nThink of it this way: Over the past few years, Trump has weathered being the nation\u2019s foremost \u201cbirther,\u201d the target of insults from pretty much every comedian alive, and now his brutish and incendiary comments on Mexican immigrants. If you think a few easily-dismissed changes in view are going to take him down, don\u2019t count on it.\n\nAfter all, as Trump would likely tell you: When Donald Trump changes views, he does it bigger and better than anyone else. No one can change views like Donald Trump. No one. And the crowd goes wild.\n\n[Image via Gage Skidmore]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Andrew Kirell (@AndrewKirell) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you've been paying attention to the 2016 primary race at all, you may have noticed that Donald Trump has become a seemingly unstoppable force.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5440390625_feab8a9520_z-e1436460060914.jpg", "title": "Could These Be the Issues to Take Down Donald Trump?"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you've been paying attention to the 2016 primary race at all, you may have noticed that Donald Trump has become a seemingly unstoppable force.", "title": "Could These Be the Issues to Take Down Donald Trump?", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5440390625_feab8a9520_z-e1436460060914.jpg", "creator": "@andrewkirell", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-07-09T12:59:30+00:00", "keywords": "columnists,online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "After all, as Trump would likely tell you: When Donald Trump changes views, he does it bigger and better than anyone else.\nThose late-term abortion comments were previously trotted out in 2011 when non-candidate Donald Trump surged in the 2012 Republican primary polls.\nNo one can change views like Donald Trump.\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to the 2016 primary race at all, you may have noticed that Donald Trump has become a seemingly unstoppable force.\nTrump will most assuredly be on-stage for Fox\u2019s first primary debate next month, and CNN\u2019s the month after."}
