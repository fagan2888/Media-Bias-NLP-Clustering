(AP) \u2014 The snaking, nearly 2-mile trail of saltwater that an underground pipeline spewed in the rugged hills of western North Dakota\u2019s badlands left a 200-yard-long stretch of dead vegetation, a company official said, though she added there is no evidence yet that the spill has contaminated a nearby bay.\n\nOn Friday, officials were expected to continue investigating the extent of the damage and cause of the pipeline leak that spilled nearly 1 million gallons of saltwater, an unwanted byproduct of oil and gas production. Also called brine, saltwater is considered an environmental hazard by the state.\n\nThe path the saltwater took into a ravine left a patch of dead vegetation as wide as 100 feet in some points, said Miranda Jones, vice president of environmental safety and regulatory at Houston-based Crestwood Midstream Partners LP. The pipeline belonged to Crestwood subsidiary Arrow Pipeline LLC.\n\nThat ravine flows into Bear Den Bay, a tributary of Lake Sakakawea. Sakakawea, one of the nation\u2019s largest man-made lakes, is a drinking water source for the Fort Berthold Indian reservation.\n\nOn a boat trip to the bay Thursday, The Associated Press saw no visible signs of contamination. Waterfowl were present in the area \u2014 some sitting close to the bright yellow booms placed at the point where the ravine meets the bay. Booms had also been placed around a nearby water-intake system used by the reservation.\n\nThe company believes the spill began over the Fourth of July weekend. In the first public statement in the two days since the spill was detected, the Environmental Protection Agency said it had no confirmed reports that the saltwater had reached Bear Den Bay. The agency said most of the spill was pooled on the ground, soaked into the soil or held behind beaver dams.\n\nJones also said Thursday that there is no evidence the bay had been contaminated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Officials: No evidence brine in bay after ND spill", "author": "Josh Wood and JAMES MacPHERSON", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Officials: No evidence brine in bay after ND spill", "title": "Officials: No evidence brine in bay after ND spill", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/11/officials_no_evidence_brine_in_bay_after_nd_spill/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/north-dakota-saltwater-spill.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Officials: No evidence brine in bay after ND spill", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/north-dakota-saltwater-spill.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Officials: No evidence brine in bay after ND spill", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Officials: No evidence brine in bay after ND spill", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcccb6\"", "article_summary": "Jones also said Thursday that there is no evidence the bay had been contaminated.\nThe agency said most of the spill was pooled on the ground, soaked into the soil or held behind beaver dams.\nWaterfowl were present in the area \u2014 some sitting close to the bright yellow booms placed at the point where the ravine meets the bay.\nAlso called brine, saltwater is considered an environmental hazard by the state.\nOn a boat trip to the bay Thursday, The Associated Press saw no visible signs of contamination."}
