The position\u2019s duties are as follows:\n\nAs a City Manager, you will play the lead role in supporting and advising your local Google Fiber team. Your job will be to support our local outreach to city and state government, utilities, businesses, and organizations. Since our go-to-market strategy is grassroots focused and dependent on joint programs and events with local partners, your role is integral to the overall business of Google Fiber in this market. The role requires a strategic perspective on the business, the ability to identify, build and cultivate working partnerships with local organizations, and a focus on execution while maintaining deep community relationships.\n\nWhile the tech giant is sure to hire someone for the position, it stipulates that Phoenix may not necessarily become a Google Fiber city. Google said that even if someone gets selected for the job and the broadband service doesn\u2019t come to Arizona\u2019s capital, the new hire will still play a role either from Phoenix or at Google\u2019s headquarters. The company added that it\u2019s looking for \u201cflexible, senior leaders.\u201d\n\nIn late April, KTAR\u2019s Christina Estes reported that Phoenix city council members were being asked to move forward with some of the city\u2019s infrastructure needs in order to have the ability to install Google Fiber.\n\nScottsdale and Tempe are also under consideration to be Google Fiber cities, but there\u2019s no sign yet if those suburbs would be under the direction of the Phoenix city manager or if the company will hire separate managers for each.\n\nGoogle Fiber is a broadband service that gets installed throughout a city in order to bring dramatically faster Internet and television speeds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Google Fiber is already installed in Kansas City, but a job description posted on the tech firm's site indicates that the broadband service could be coming soon to Phoenix.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=719630055", "og": {"site_name": "KTAR.com", "description": "Google Fiber is already installed in Kansas City, but a job description posted on the tech firm's site indicates that the broadband service could be coming soon to Phoenix.", "title": "Is Google Fiber coming soon to Phoenix? - KTAR.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/34/3484/348429.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-19T13:02:51+00:00", "url": "http://ktar.com/story/89685/is-google-fiber-coming-soon-to-phoenix/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "KTAR.com", "description": "Google Fiber is already installed in Kansas City, but a job description posted on the tech firm's site indicates that the broadband service could be coming soon to Phoenix.", "creator": "@ktar923", "image": "http://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/34/3484/348429.jpg", "title": "Is Google Fiber coming soon to Phoenix? - KTAR.com", "site": "@ktar923", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.jacobsmedia.KTAR", "fb": {"pages": 42794977621, "app_id": 291385034204941}, "keywords": "Phoenix and Arizona Breaking News And News Headlines - Home, Home,92.3 KTAR", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KTARNews", "section": "Local News", "published_time": "2014-07-19T13:02:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-19T13:02:51+00:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "verify-v1": "XrJiQDsWmPaoqGKN0EHKs7ult0rBB0W9zj4cWkAPRVI=", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8081\"", "article_summary": "Google is looking for a full-time Google Fiber city manager in Phoenix.\nWhile the tech giant is sure to hire someone for the position, it stipulates that Phoenix may not necessarily become a Google Fiber city.\nGoogle Fiber is already installed in Kansas City and Provo, Utah, but a job description posted on the tech firm\u2019s site indicates that the broadband service could be coming soon to Phoenix.\nThe position\u2019s duties are as follows:As a City Manager, you will play the lead role in supporting and advising your local Google Fiber team.\nGoogle Fiber is a broadband service that gets installed throughout a city in order to bring dramatically faster Internet and television speeds."}
