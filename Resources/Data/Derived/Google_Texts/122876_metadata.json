The jobs include baggage-handing ramp workers and inside customer-service agents, among others, depending on the airport.\n\nThis is the latest in a series of maneuvers by the airline to control costs by cutting labor expenses. United outsourced nearly 500 jobs to outside vendors in 2013 and more than 600 jobs at 12 other U.S. airports in the fall of 2014.\n\nThe airline also reported third-quarter 2014 net income of $1.1 billion \u2014 an increase of 99 percent over third quarter 2013, and its highest-ever quarterly profit.\n\nAfter United\u2019s baggage-handling issues began affecting DIA\u2019s reputation, airport CEO Kim Day and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock both reached out to offer assistance and make sure something like this doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\n\u201cThe mayor has been in constant contact with (United CEO Jeff) Smisek and the airline leadership,\u201d said Hancock spokeswoman Amber Miller. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s the same customers we are serving.\u201d\n\nHobart said the baggage situation at DIA has improved considerably.\n\n\u201cWait times are well within standard and within what customers expect,\u201d he said.\n\nMonday\u2019s passenger traffic at DIA was light \u2014 137,000 passengers compared to an average day of 145,000 \u2014 and baggage operations in the United baggage claim area appeared to be running more smoothly.\n\nGone were the piles of unclaimed bags, replaced by a neat row of about 20 suitcases awaiting their owners, and bags were emerging on carousels soon after passengers arrived in the claim area.\n\nUnited passenger Eric Jones flew into Denver with an eight-person party. They checked three bags and carried six other suitcases onto the plane. He was blissfully unaware that previously there were any issues.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t heard anything at all, but we had no real problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have all our bags.\u201d\n\nLaura Keeney: 303-954-1337, lkeeney@denverpost.com or twitter.com/LauraKeeney", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "United recalls 40 furloughed workers at DIA", "title": "United recalls 40 furloughed workers at DIA", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/19/united-recalls-40-furloughed-workers-at-dia/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150106_063150_United-Baggage-at-DIA-2.jpg", "height": 368}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150106_063150_United-Baggage-at-DIA-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-19T18:27:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:45:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e9d\"", "article_summary": "In the wake of its massive baggage-handling issues at Denver International Airport, United Airlines is reinstating 40 previously furloughed ramp employees.\nThe 40 recalled workers are among 159 United employees placed on furlough as part of budgetary cutbacks, most of them in 2008, Hobart said.\nHowever, according to an internal e-mail to SkyWest employees dated Oct. 15, United ramp workers assumed many of SkyWest\u2019s bag transfer responsibilities Oct. 19.\nThis issue was central to bringing back the furloughed employees, said Richard Delaney, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge 141, the union representing United ramp workers.\nThe jobs include baggage-handing ramp workers and inside customer-service agents, among others, depending on the airport."}
