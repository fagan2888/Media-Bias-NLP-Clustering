A sophomore was nearly at the head of the class.

University of Wisconsin runner Sarah Disanza capped off a tremendous campaign with a runner-up finish at the NCAA Cross Country Championships on Saturday in Terre Haute, Ind.

Disanza ran the 6,000-meter race of her life, clocking in at 19 minutes, 39.9 seconds and finishing behind only Iona's Kate Avery, who won the title in 19:31.6.

It was a huge improvement for Disanza from her first NCAA meet a year ago, where she placed 104th. Her second-place finish marked the best finish by a Badger since 1999 when Erica Palmer won the individual crown.

Disanza was among the leaders early in the race, and moved up from seventh through the first four kilometers to second. Avery build an early lead and maintained a five-second gap on her competition for a majority of the race.

"I was really just hoping to be getting top 20 overall, but I didn't really expect anything else higher than that," Disanza said. "I was just hoping that if I did, then so be it, it would be a great day. I definitely did not expect that coming in. Placing as high as I did, I'm ecstatic."

Disanza's showing enabled the Badgers to finish 10th overall with 382 points. Michigan State won with a score of 85.

In the men's competition, UW earned its 19th-straight top ten finish. The Badgers finished 10th with a score of 335. Colorado took home the trophy with a total of 65 points.

Sophomore Malachy Schrobilgen led the way for the Badgers, finishing 10th in the 10,000-meter race in 30:32.6 seconds. He took 32nd last year.

"I definitely wanted to improve on last year's finish," Schrobilgen said. "I think last year, I just really didn't know what I was doing out there. I kind of got into the middle of the race and moved up.

"This year I had the goal of wanting to be top ten, at least top 15. I'm just glad I was able to go out there and accomplish my goal."
