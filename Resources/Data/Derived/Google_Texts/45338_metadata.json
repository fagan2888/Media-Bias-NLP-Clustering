After their effort thwarted was last week, House Republicans and the White House are seeking to move TAA before the summer, to get the backing that would grant Obama the authority to speed consideration of trade deals through Congress.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAccording to reports, the rule would allow a re-do vote on the TAA to take place as late as July 30, granting the White House and establishment Republicans time to move more members to yes on the TAA. The vote would otherwise need to take place Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to getting TPA done, and this will give the president more time to communicate the consequences of not moving forward with his party,\u201d Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith said, according to The Hill.\n\nConservativeHQ argues that the effort to move Obama\u2019s trade agenda is as much about House Speaker John Boehner as it is about the Democratic divide on trade.\n\nWhile Speaker Boehner would like to keep the heat on the Democrats to come up with the votes to pass the trade package, and ultimately pass Obama\u2019s secret Trans-Pacific Partnership treaty, this is as much about saving Boehner\u2019s tenuous hold on his own restive House Republican Conference as it is about passing Obamatrade. Populist conservative Republicans came within a couple of votes of defeating \u201cfast track\u201d and, allied with labor-oriented Democrats, did defeat the TAA bill, which included a sizable tax increase that would hit small businesses especially hard.\n\nThe conservative news site further quoted a Breitbart interview with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) in which he called on Republicans to oppose the effort to bring back the TAA, which he and others are calling a tax increase. Paul says:\n\nYou know typically to pass these kinds of things, the establishment will try to buy off Democrats by sprinkling money so they have some money in there. To get the money, under our budget rules, we have to pay for it\u2014so they want to pay for it with a fine on small businesses,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut I thought a point that was made in the article which was pretty good is this is similar to the fines they wanted to do in Obamacare with 1099s and there was such an outcry it\u2019s the only part of Obamacare we ever repealed. So I think when people discover they\u2019re sticking a tax increase in there I think people will be even more unhappy.\n\nAccording to ConservativeHQ, there is an effort to vote down the rule and people should call their representatives to urge them to vote against the rule.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ConservativeHQ Warns Vote Tuesday Could Revive TAA, Urges Members To Vote \u2018No\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "ConservativeHQ Warns Vote Tuesday Could Revive TAA, Urges Members To Vote \u2018No\u2019", "title": "ConservativeHQ Warns Vote Tuesday Could Revive TAA, Urges Members To Vote \u2018No\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/McCarthy-AP.png", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/16/conservativehq-warns-vote-tuesday-could-revive-taa-urges-members-to-vote-no/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ConservativeHQ Warns Vote Tuesday Could Revive TAA, Urges Members To Vote \u2018No\u2019", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/McCarthy-AP.png", "title": "ConservativeHQ Warns Vote Tuesday Could Revive TAA, Urges Members To Vote \u2018No\u2019 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "TAA, TPA, TPP,Big Government,TPA", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "TPP", "published_time": "2015-06-16T07:00:50-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb783\"", "article_summary": "According to ConservativeHQ, there is an effort to vote down the rule and people should call their representatives to urge them to vote against the rule.\nPassage of TAA is necessarily in order to get the controversial Trade Promotion Authority, or \u201cfast-track,\u201d to the president\u2019s desk.\nSo I think when people discover they\u2019re sticking a tax increase in there I think people will be even more unhappy.\nConservativeHQ argues that the effort to move Obama\u2019s trade agenda is as much about House Speaker John Boehner as it is about the Democratic divide on trade.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAccording to reports, the rule would allow a re-do vote on the TAA to take place as late as July 30, granting the White House and establishment Republicans time to move more members to yes on the TAA."}
