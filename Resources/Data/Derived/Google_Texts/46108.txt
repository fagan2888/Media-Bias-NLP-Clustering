THIAROYE, Senegal (AP) — Nearly a decade ago, Senegalese fisherman Mor Mar embarked on an illegal sea voyage to Spain, hoping a better life awaited him in Europe.

Along with 80 other would-be migrants, each of whom paid smugglers at least $500, he left in a large wooden pirogue from neighboring Mauritania, surviving on rice, biscuits and water until coming within 200 kilometers (125 miles) of the Spanish coast.

High, violent waves turned the boat back, and Mar, 39, never tried to make the crossing again.

Now following news reports of the more than 1,800 migrants who died this year trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea, Mar says he learned long ago to resist Europe’s pull, having been turned off by stories of limited opportunity and high unemployment.

“A lot of young men who managed to get to Europe didn’t succeed in building something for themselves back in Senegal,” he said. “They say the situation is very difficult there.”

Mar’s views on migration are shared widely in his native Thiaroye, a fishing town on the outskirts of Senegal’s capital Dakar that 10 years ago was one of the first in the area to record large-scale migration to Europe.

Pape Omar Diouf, a town elder, remembers how the initial trickle of migrants soon turned into a rush. “Nearly every day, we were recording departures. Young people were distraught because the fishing industry was nearly dead,” he said. “The dream of going to Europe animated everyone until the deaths started to multiply.”

The sheer number of people presumed to have died en route played a big role in dampening the fishermen’s enthusiasm. They now focus on trying to support themselves at home, difficult though it might be.
