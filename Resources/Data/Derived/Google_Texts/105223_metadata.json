That\u2019s because income fluctuations during 2014 resulted in overpayment of subsidies to those households.\n\nOn the flip side, the report says about 45 percent of households could get refunds because their income was lower than expected when they applied for coverage.\n\nThe impact could be muted in Minnesota, however, because \u00adrelatively few people in the state qualified for tax credits in the first place, said Cynthia Cox, a researcher who contributed to the Kaiser Family Foundation report.\n\nMeanwhile, Minnesota\u2019s MNsure exchange said Tuesday that health insurance counselors will be teaming up with tax professionals over the next several weeks to connect people to coverage for 2015.\n\nPeople who lacked health insurance last year are now calculating their tax penalty under the federal Affordable Care Act and have a \u00adspecial chance to buy coverage for this year.\n\n\u201cOnce they found out that they were paying a penalty because they didn\u2019t have any insurance, they\u2019d say: \u2018What can I do?\u2019 \u201d said Cecelia Benimon with the Minneapolis-based nonprofit Bii Gii Wiin Community Development Loan Fund, one of the tax assistance groups that\u2019s partnering with MNsure.\n\nBii Gii Wiin\u2019s tax assistance program has worked with more than 300 people so far this year, and only two people have learned that they must pay the tax penalty for lacking insurance, Benimon said. Both were very interested in learning about an insurance option, Benimon said, including one woman who \u201cwas pretty upset\u201d learning she owed $94 per month for several months of going without coverage.\n\nStarting in 2014, the vast majority of Americans were required to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. In addition to the coverage mandate, the health law offers income-based tax credits available to people who buy coverage through a government-run health insurance exchange.\n\nIn Minnesota, MNsure officials have said that about 16,000 people are splitting roughly $30.9 million in tax credit subsidies for coverage purchased last year.\n\nIn 2014, insurance shoppers had the option of receiving tax \u00adcredits in advance, so the subsidies could discount premium costs. Advance tax credits were awarded based on an estimate of income, with the understanding that people would have to reconcile expected vs. actual income when filing taxes.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that very few people were 100 percent accurate projecting their 2014 income, said Cox of the Kaiser Family Foundation. That explains why the group projects that about 50 percent of subsidy-eligible households likely owe some repayment, while about 45 percent likely will receive a refund, according to the foundation\u2019s report.\n\nCox said she didn\u2019t know why that ratio of repayments to refunds wouldn\u2019t apply to Minnesota.\n\n\u201cOverall, the estimated average repayment is $794 and the refund is $773,\u201d researchers wrote.\n\nHealth law subsidies primarily go to lower income people, researchers wrote, so some could struggle to cover the cost of a surprise repayment, the report states.\n\nBut the Minnesota impact likely is limited, Cox said, because the state has large public health insurance programs, as well as below-average commercial insurance premiums across much of the state. For both reasons, fewer people in Minnesota last year needed tax credits to make their health insurance premiums affordable as defined by the federal health law.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many Minnesotans will find they must pay a tax penalty for lacking coverage in 2014. Those who find during tax season that they must pay, however, have a special enrollment period for signing up through MNsure that lasts until April 30.\n\nBy partnering with tax preparers, MNsure officials hope to help people enroll in coverage at a time when one consequence of lacking health insurance is clear.\n\n\u201cMinnesotans are glad to have the ability to apply for coverage immediately, and the timing is good because the information they need to prepare their taxes is the same information needed to complete a health care application,\u201d said Ralonda Mason, supervising attorney and MNsure navigator at Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid in St. Cloud, in a statement. \u201cAlthough we cannot help consumers reduce the penalty for 2014, they leave feeling good about the fact that they have minimized the tax penalty for 2015.\u201d\n\nEnrollment during the special period could \u201csubstantially\u201d reduce the tax penalty someone might have to pay for 2015, according to MNsure.\n\nMNsure enrollees in 2014 have been receiving new tax forms called 1095-A, which detail the value of tax credits for which they\u2019re eligible for coverage purchased on the exchange. While MNsure expected to distribute all forms by late January and early February, thousands of forms were held back for weeks to check their accuracy.\n\nJoe Campbell, a MNsure spokesman, said Tuesday that all forms have now been mailed.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A new report predicts repayments or refunds for those who received subsidies.", "title": "Kaiser report finds many will have to pay back portion of health care subsidies", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/kaiser-report-finds-many-will-have-to-pay-back-portion-of-health-care-subsidies/297472441/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "A new report predicts repayments or refunds for those who received subsidies.", "title": "Kaiser report finds many will have to pay back portion of health care subsidies", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/kaiser-report-finds-many-will-have-to-pay-back-portion-of-health-care-subsidies/297472441/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A new report predicts repayments or refunds for those who received subsidies."}, "article_summary": "Starting in 2014, the vast majority of Americans were required to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.\nFor both reasons, fewer people in Minnesota last year needed tax credits to make their health insurance premiums affordable as defined by the federal health law.\nIn addition to the coverage mandate, the health law offers income-based tax credits available to people who buy coverage through a government-run health insurance exchange.\nIt\u2019s unclear how many Minnesotans will find they must pay a tax penalty for lacking coverage in 2014.\nIn 2014, insurance shoppers had the option of receiving tax \u00adcredits in advance, so the subsidies could discount premium costs."}
