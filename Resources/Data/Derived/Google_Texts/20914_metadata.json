At hospitals that were preparing for the two-midnight rule, a fair amount of confusion was expected for patients placed in observation status in lieu of what would have been a less than 48-hour inpatient admission.\n\n\u201cAlthough their treatment might appear to them to be an inpatient stay, i.e., in a room and in a hospital bed, their explanation of benefits and bill will reflect that they were an outpatient, which carries with it much different deductible and copay responsibilities,\u201d David Weisman, a health policy specialist st at the Indiana Hospital Association, told Healthcare Finance News last year.\n\n\u201cIn theory, the rule makes some sense,\u201d said Colleen Hall, senior manager at consulting firm Crowe Horwath. \u201cIf the patient needs inpatient care, it'll be longer than a day.\u201d\n\nThe trouble is, there is no nuance, Hall said. \u201cIt's too much of a fine line.\u201d Given the resistance to the current form of two-midnights that Congress is allowing CMS to \u201cprobe and educate\u201d about, \u201cthe rule will continue to evolve,\u201d Hall said. \u201cObservation is not going away.\u201d\n\nFor hospitals preparing for two-midnights and applying the benchmark with patients, \u201ccommunication up front is key,\u201d Hall said. \u201cMany of the hospitals we interact with are being upfront with patients, notifying them that they are an observation patient, subject to Medicare Part B.\u201d\n\nA fully implemented two-midnights rule would accelerate the trend of declining inpatient admissions in favor of outpatient treatment and lower reimbursement by as much as $4,000 per patient case, according to a study by Moody\u2019s analyst Daniel Steingart. But at the same time, the rule could come with a silver lining, Steingart argued. \u201cThe two-midnight rule could provide some relief from RAC reviews by substituting a strict rule set for the ambiguity involved in borderline cases,\u201d Steingart wrote.\n\nEither way, hospitals may have to prepare for the two-midnight rule soon. One reimbursement change they may have more time to avoid \u2013 the kind of site-neutral payment policy that the Medicare Payment Advisory Board has long called for, along with more recently the Obama Administration.\n\nAHA president and CEO Rich Umbdenstock lauded the House Ways and Means Committee for developing legislation that \u201crejects a number of flawed policy options, including reductions to outpatient hospital services.\u201d\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nThe Obama Administration, though, has seen the rise of physician services provided in hospital outpatient settings as problematic, amid waves of physician practices being acquired by hospital systems and subsequently gaining higher reimbursement for the same services.\n\nThe President\u2019s 2016 budget calls on Congress to equalize Medicare payments for services \u2013 like chemotherapy, cardiac imaging or colonoscopies \u2013 provided in hospital outpatient departments and physician offices. The change would save $29.5 billion over 10 years, according to the White House, and \"encourage efficient care by improving incentives to provide care in the most appropriate ambulatory setting.\"\n\nWhile the AHA may be fighting that proposal, the Obama Administration will have the support of a new advocacy group, the Alliance for Site-Neutral Payment Reform, a coalition of primary care medical societies, health insurers, nursing homes and patients. It is time, the group wrote to Congress, \u201cto address payment parity across site of service in order to decrease Medicare and commercial spending , ensure patients receive the right care in the right setting, lower taxpayers and beneficiary costs and increase patient access.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/two-midnight-rule-delayed-until-september-sgr-repeal-bill", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doc-and-nurse-with-hospital-patient-feature_2.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Under the provision, CMS could continue to use Medicare Administrative Contractors to \"probe and educate\" providers on their likely compliance with the two-midnight rule.", "title": "Two-midnight rule delayed until September in SGR repeal bill"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doc-and-nurse-with-hospital-patient-feature_2.gif"}, "description": "Under the provision, CMS could continue to use Medicare Administrative Contractors to \"probe and educate\" providers on their likely compliance with the two-midnight rule.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Two-midnight rule delayed until September in SGR repeal bill"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Tuesday\u2019s companion bill to repeal the sustainable growth rate is punting a decision on the controversial \u201ctwo-midnight\u201d rule into September.&#13; The new legislation continues until September a partial delay of the Medicare \u201ctwo midnights\u201d policy that establishes 48 hours as the threshold for classifying a patient stay as inpatient.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa10\"", "article_summary": "Tuesday\u2019s companion bill to repeal the sustainable growth rate is punting a decision on the controversial \u201ctwo-midnight\u201d rule into September.\n\u201cThe two-midnight rule could provide some relief from RAC reviews by substituting a strict rule set for the ambiguity involved in borderline cases,\u201d Steingart wrote.\nEither way, hospitals may have to prepare for the two-midnight rule soon.\nUnder the provision, CMS could continue to use Medicare Administrative Contractors to \"probe and educate\" providers on their likely compliance with the two-midnight rule.\nThe American Hospital Association has been waging a war on the two-midnight rule, but the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services remains intent on applying some version of it."}
