Obviously.)\n\nINTERIOR POPE & ASSOCIATES OFFICE\n\nCHRIS is standing by a conference table in a bright, high-ceilinged room. He\u2019s fidgeting and sweating slightly. A door slams offscreen.\n\nOLIVIA (OFFSCREEN)\n\nHarrison, I need those files on Obamacare now! How far are we on \u2014\n\nOLIVIA enters, walking briskly, wearing a white pant suit. She stops abruptly when she sees Chris.\n\nOLIVIA\n\nGovernor! What \u2026 are you doing here?\n\nCHRIS\n\nI gotta level with you, Liv. These people have really got me in a corner.\n\nOLIVIA\n\nThe bridge?\n\nCHRIS\n\nYeah, the damn bridge. I \u2014\n\nOLIVIA (interrupting him, yelling)\n\nHarrison! Obamacare!\n\nCHRIS\n\n\u2014 I\u2019m gonna need your help. I don\u2019t know what to do with this one.\n\nOLIVIA (yelling)\n\nNevermind, Harrison!\n\nOLIVIA throws her coat over an office chair. They both sit down. OLIVIA leans over the table.\n\nOLIVIA (continued)\n\nI have one rule, Chris. The truth. I need to know how much damage we\u2019re talking about here. I need to know exactly what kind of bridge you\u2019ve burned. And if you don\u2019t tell me the truth, I\u2019ll burn you. You think you can do that?\n\nCHRIS\n\nYeah, yeah. Of course.\n\nOLIVIA\n\nTell me what happened.\n\nCHRIS\n\nThey got e-mails between Bridget and David. The newspapers do. I was lied to, Liv.\n\nOLIVIA\n\nBridget? Your chief of staff?\n\nCHRIS\n\nYeah, and David at the Port Authority. Bridget told them to shut those lanes down, that damn idiot. What the hell was she thinking? I don\u2019t know, Liv, I\u2019ve done a lot of soul-searching, and I really don\u2019t know. I try to hire the best people\u2026\n\nOLIVIA\n\nWhy did Bridget shut the lanes down?\n\nOLIVIA begins typing frantically on her conspicuously branded Windows phone.\n\nCHRIS\n\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know whether this was a traffic study that morphed into a political vendetta, or a vendetta that morphed into a traffic study \u2014 it was about the mayor of Fort Lee. Mark something. I don\u2019t know, that guy\u2019s not even on my radar.\n\nOLIVIA (incredulous, reading from phone)\n\n\u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee?\u201d\n\nCHRIS\n\nI know. It\u2019s damn stupid.\n\nOLIVIA\n\nWho has these e-mails?\n\nCHRIS\n\nEveryone.\n\nOLIVIA\n\nThe media?\n\nCHRIS\n\nEveryone.\n\nOLIVIA\n\nOkay, we need to shut this down.\n\nOLIVIA (continued, yelling)\n\nHarrison! Get me everything you can find on Bridget Kelly!\n\nHARRISON (OFFSCREEN)\n\nGot it!\n\nOLIVIA\n\nGovernor, you\u2019re going to fire Bridget immediately. Not later, not tomorrow \u2014 immediately. You can use my phone. Don\u2019t mince words, don\u2019t tread lightly. You have a window here to condemn her e-mails, and you need to take it. We need to make it clear that Bridget is the worst kind of soulless, political \u2014\n\nCHRIS (interrupting)\n\nListen, Liv, I don\u2019t know if I want to engage \u2014\n\nOLIVIA\n\nTomorrow there will be a press conference. You will stand at a podium, in front of a New Jersey flag. No \u2014 two flags. You will express your deep embarrassment and humiliation over this terrible matter you knew nothing about. You will make it clear you didn\u2019t care about Mark Sokolich. You never met him. You don\u2019t know him. You couldn\u2019t pick him out of a line up. You\u2019ve done a lot of soul-searching \u2014 and say that governor, soul-searching \u2014 and your only concern is the trust of the people of New Jersey. You are sorry. You are very, very sorry. Do you understand?\n\nCHRIS\n\nYeah, I \u2014\n\nOLIVIA\n\nAfter the press conference we\u2019ll set something up. CNN, ABC, PostTV \u2014 I\u2019ll figure that out. But in the meantime, you need to take this very, very seriously.\n\nOLIVIA leans in across table, staring intently into CHRIS\u2019s eyes.\n\nOLIVIA (quietly, continued)\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about bridges, governor, and you know that. You have more at stake. You have 2016. You have the presidential run. You have the distant hope of getting out of New Jersey. This press conference could be the difference between future victory and defeat.\n\nCHRIS blanches, looking surprised. They both lean back slowly. There are footsteps offscreen. HARRISON enters, holding a file folder.\n\nHARRISON\n\nOlivia, I have that file on Bridget Kelly \u2014\n\nHARRISON stops abruptly, sensing tension in the room. He looks between OLIVIA and CHRIS and hesitates at the door.\n\nHARRISON\n\nOkay, well when you need it\u2026\n\nHARRISON sets the folder down and exits.\n\nOLIVIA\n\n[Thumbs through file] Governor, let\u2019s recap, shall we? Go back to New Jersey and think about what you\u2019re going to say to your constituents tomorrow. When you\u2019re talking to them, you\u2019ll maintain eye contact. You will speak confidently and clearly. You will make it clear that you were blindsided and that you had nothing, NOTHING to do with this childish act of political retribution.\n\nDon\u2019t try to figure out what happened \u2014 that\u2019s my job and I\u2019ll be there to help you through it. Tomorrow, before the press conference, it will be business as usual. You\u2019ll go to the gym, you\u2019ll do everything that you normally do. You did nothing wrong, Governor. Your constituents won\u2019t believe it if you don\u2019t. And if I find out that you knew anything about this, you\u2019ll be\u2026\n\nCHRISTIE\n\n\u2026 I know.
