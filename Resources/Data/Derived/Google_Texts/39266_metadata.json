Guess what? Give this a couple of weeks, add in a few thousand other tax break-driven milk cow owners and the price of milk at the grocery has to go up.\n\nHow could that be? Well, the grocery stays alive by buying milk at wholesale and selling at retail. The difference between the two pays for the bricks and mortar to build the store, the utilities to keep it running, the wages of everyone working there and some profit to make all the effort worthwhile.\n\nWhen the grocery has to buy milk at retail from you (and all your cow-owning pals) it has two choices: raise the price of milk it sells or eventually go out of business. Guess which choice the owner is going to make? But you don\u2019t care because you\u2019ve got a gun (the net milking law), forcing the store to buy your milk at the new higher price. It\u2019s all the cow-less suckers out there who get stuck paying for the scam when they buy more expensive milk from the grocery, the same suckers who paid for the tax break on your cow. That\u2019s the real nature of \u201cnet metering.\u201d\n\nMIKE POWELL, Topeka", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Opinion, Letters to the Editor", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "We get a lot of mom and apple pie arguments about why we need \"net metering\" of consumer-generated electricity without any explanation of just how that scam operates. \nHere's the deal - call it \"net milking.", "title": "Letter: 'Net metering' is a scam", "url": "http://cjonline.com/opinion/2014-03-01/letter-net-metering-scam", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "We get a lot of mom and apple pie arguments about why we need \u201cnet metering\u201d of consumer-generated electricity without any explanation of just how that scam operates.Here\u2019s the deal \u2014 call it \u201cnet milking.\u201d Buy yourself a cow (take a tax break for that), milk it, take the milk down to the grocery and demand it pay you $3.59 a gallon or whatever their retail price is that day.
