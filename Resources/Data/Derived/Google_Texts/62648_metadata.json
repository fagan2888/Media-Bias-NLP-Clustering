Pat Roberts.\n\nBut in the candidate debate last night, Roberts charged that Orman\u2019s attitude about abortion is \u201cUNconcionable.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how it developed: more than halfway into the debate, the sole \u201clife issue\u201d question was posed: Kansas abortion law requires a mandatory ultrasound, should that be a federal law? (By the way, no such ultrasound mandate has been filed in Congress.)\n\nOrman didn\u2019t answer, instead responding:\n\nthat, as a man, he\u2019ll never face that issue, and he \u201ctrusts women\u201d (this is the slogan created by the late-term abortionist George Tiller); abortion is settled law about which we have wasted too much time when there are other important issues to discuss.\n\nThe debate moderator interrupted to ask whether he was pro-life or pro choice and Orman said pro-choice.\n\nRoberts looked at Orman with incredulity, saying that to admonish us to \u201cget past\u201d the rights of the unborn and those at the end of life is unconscionable.\n\n\u201cI am pro-life,\u201d he said [voting record: 64 out of 64 correct pro-life votes] and am proud to be endorsed by National Right to Life and Kansans for Life.\n\nIn a follow-up rebuttal, Roberts added, \u201c[abortion] isn\u2019t settled law because we had a great fight over Hobby Lobby, didn\u2019t we? \u2026[that] we\u2019re not going to accept Obamacare because it strikes at our religious beliefs. And the Hobby Lobby won. And so it isn\u2019t settled law, not by a long shot.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nLater on, during discussion of second amendment gun rights, Roberts brought up Orman\u2019s support for a bill [S.J. Resolution 19, see here] that would severely restrict first amendment free speech rights of groups like Kansans for Life.\n\nOrman is running neck and neck with Roberts and the Kansas Democrat candidate for Senate dropped out of the race Sept. 3 (more here). Notwithstanding Orman\u2019s repeated claim that, if elected, he has not decided which party he will side with, no one believes it; there are currently two \u201cindependent \u201d Senators who vote with the Democrats.\n\nRoberts\u2019 key message is that a vote for Orman is a vote for the Democrat anti-life agenda of Harry Reid and President Obama; for example, Reid has refused to allow a vote on the Pain-capable Unborn Child Protection Act (s. 1670, read here) which passed this year in the U.S. House.[Kansas passed this law in 2011.]\n\nKFL executive director, Mary Kay Culp, commented, \u201cOne Kansas City-area abortion business has posted Orman signs at their front door, and in their window. They know that Orman is not a new-style, problem-solving \u201cUNpolitician\u201d- he is an old-style politician trying to downplay an unconscionable pro-abortion position in a state with a pro-life majority.\u201d\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Kathy Ostrowski is the legislative director for Kansans for Life, a statewide pro-life group.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kansas: Pat Roberts Calls Greg Orman \"Unconscionable\" on Abortion", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "In the cola-dominated soft drink market, 7-up enjoyed great success after it labeled itself the \"UN-cola\".
