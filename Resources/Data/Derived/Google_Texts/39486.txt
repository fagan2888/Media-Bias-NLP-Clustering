PEORIA, Ariz. — Jon Gray was sharp, Tyler Matzek was not.

That’s the Cliff’s Notes version of the Rockies’ game against the Padres Sunday afternoon at Peoria Sports Complex.

The Rockies beat the Padres 7-5 to improve to 2-3 in Cactus League play.

Matzek, who said he was rushing his delivery — see video above — and was unable to pitch consistently inside, got pounded. He gave up four runs on five hits and two walks in 1 2/3 innings. How rough was the lefty’s first Cactus League start? He threw 42 pitches, just 18 for strikes.

Gray was efficient and impressive, needing only 23 pitches (17 strikes) in his two innings. He gave up a leadoff double to Yonder Alonso, but that was the only hit he allowed. He struck out there and walked none. His fastball was clocked at 96 mph and he blew it by the Padres’ Wil Myers on a called third strike in the second innings.

“I was trying to pitch with some controlled aggression,” Gray said.

He said his feel for his slider this spring is “tremendous.”

“Last year I didn’t have it dialed in like I did in the past,” he said. “It’s good to know that I have it back. I used all three pitchers today and was able to get outs with every single one.”

Hits

New catcher Nick Hundley, the former Padres catcher, hit a two-run double in the third innings.

Rafael Ynoa continued his impressive spring, driving in a run with a single in the second.

Misses

Though Matzek’s fastball reached 94 mph, he didn’t command it very well and was constantly behind hitters.

Up Next

The Rockies host the Reds in a 1:10 p.m. game at Salt River Fields. Troy Tulowitzki and Carlos Gonzalez, coming back from injuries, could make their spring debuts.

Scheduled to pitch for the Rockies are right-handers Jordan Lyles, Tommy Kahnle, Jorge Rondon, Brooks Brown and Jose Ortega. Lefty reliever Rex Brothers is scheduled to pitch for the first time this spring, and lefty Aaron Laffey is also slated to pitch.
