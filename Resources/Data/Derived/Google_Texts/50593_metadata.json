You may not have heard of Dodd-Frank, but it\u2019s essentially Obamacare for our economy and your household finances.\n\nAnd just like Obamacare, Dodd-Frank has left us with fewer choices, higher costs and less freedom.\n\nNow, the financial crisis of 2008 and the recession that followed devastated millions of Americans. But instead of preventing the crisis, misguided Washington policies helped lead us into it \u2013 policies that either strong-armed or enticed financial institutions into loaning money to people to buy homes they couldn\u2019t afford to keep.\n\nThat was wrong.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t deregulation that caused the crisis. It was Washington\u2019s dumb regulations.\n\nThen, and now, House Republicans have offered an alternative to Dodd-Frank that would have ended taxpayer-funded bailouts and protected consumers.\n\nBut in typical Washington fashion, Democrats instead by passing a 2,300-page bill that did not solve the crisis but in my ways made it worse. When President Obama signed Dodd-Frank into law five years ago with much fanfare and celebration, we were told it would \u2018lift the economy,\u2019 \u2018end too big to fail\u2019 and \u2018increase financial stability.\u2019 It didn\u2019t happen.\n\nBut, Dodd-Frank did nothing to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were at the epicenter of the crisis. It enshrined taxpayer-funded bailouts and \u2018too big to fail\u2019 into law, and it imposed 400 new burdensome, job-destroying regulations upon our economy.\n\nAnd the harm to consumers has been real, very real. We continue to be mired in lackluster, halting economic growth. Middle income paychecks are nearly 12,000 dollars less compared to the average post-war economic recovery. It is now harder for credit-worthy Americans to buy a home. In fact, one-out-of-five who borrowed to buy a home just five years ago will not meet the underwriting requirements of Dodd-Frank\u2019s mortgage rules. According to the Federal Reserve, that\u2019ll hit roughly one-third of Hispanic and African-American borrowers.\n\nSince Dodd-Frank, the big banks have gotten bigger and the small banks are now fewer. Today there are fewer community banks and credit unions serving the needs of small businesses and families. Local financial institutions tell us they can\u2019t keep up with the sheer weight, volume and complexity of Dodd-Frank\u2019s regulations. In fact, because of Dodd-Frank, we\u2019re losing on average one community financial institution per day. It\u2019s no wonder that small business deaths outnumber small business births for the first time in 35 years.\n\nIt is also now more expensive for American companies to raise working capital that\u2019s needed to grow and create jobs.\n\nServices that we all once took for granted \u2013 like free checking \u2013 are being curtailed or eliminated because of Dodd-Frank. Before, 75 percent of banks offered free checking. Just two years after Dodd-Frank became law, that number was cut almost in half.\n\nAnd bank fees have also increased due to Dodd-Frank\u2019s costs. This has led to a rise in the number of low and moderate income Americans who simply can\u2019t afford to maintain a checking or savings account.\n\nNot long after the financial crisis, we heard the cry from the Left to \u2018Occupy Wall Street.\u2019 But hardworking taxpayers aren\u2019t interested in Occupying Wall Street. They just want to quit bailing it out.\n\nYet Dodd-Frank enshrines \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 into law. It gives Washington bureaucrats the power to officially designate large financial firms \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 and then makes them eligible for bailouts. That\u2019s wrong. We have to absolutely end bailouts \u2014 period.\n\nIt is evident that Dodd-Frank has made us less prosperous and less free. It has meant lost opportunities and frustrated dreams for millions hoping to start a small business, buy a home or plan for a secure retirement.\n\nIf we want strong economic growth, more freedom and an end to bailouts, it\u2019s time we commit to making sure this anniversary is Dodd-Frank\u2019s last anniversary.\n\nHouse Republicans are working to do just that. Together, we can end Wall Street bailouts, have a healthier economy, and protect consumer choice.\n\nThanks for listening.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Representative Jeb Hensarling urged the repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act during Saturday's GOP Weekly Address.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Representative Jeb Hensarling urged the repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act during Saturday's GOP Weekly Address.", "title": "Hensarling: Repeal Dodd-Frank - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Hensarling-718-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/07/18/hensarling-repeal-dodd-frank/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Representative Jeb Hensarling urged the repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act during Saturday's GOP Weekly Address.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Hensarling-718-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Hensarling: Repeal Dodd-Frank - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Dodd-Frank Act, Jeb Hensarling,Breitbart TV, Economics,Dodd-Frank", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Jeb Hensarling", "published_time": "2015-07-18T06:41:56-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbfa5\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepresentative Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) urged the repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act during Saturday\u2019s GOP Weekly Address.\nNow, the financial crisis of 2008 and the recession that followed devastated millions of Americans.\nThen, and now, House Republicans have offered an alternative to Dodd-Frank that would have ended taxpayer-funded bailouts and protected consumers.\nFive years ago this week President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act.\nNot long after the financial crisis, we heard the cry from the Left to \u2018Occupy Wall Street.\u2019 But hardworking taxpayers aren\u2019t interested in Occupying Wall Street."}
