They launched an investigation in October 2014 that eventually led to last week\u2019s sting.\n\nDetectives engaged Crawford in conversations online and over the phone.\n\nMaricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said detectives learned Crawford has been sexually aroused by horses for years and has traveled extensively to find horse owners in various cities willing to allow him access to their animals.\n\nAccording to Arpaio, Crawford told the undercover deputy that he purchased a non-refundable plane ticket to Phoenix and would be bringing five shirts on which he wanted the horse to urinate. He told detectives he would mail the clothing back to his home in Pennsylvania, where he apparently planned to wear them for arousal purposes, Arpaio said.\n\n\"Perversion has reached a new level,\" Arpaio said.\n\nWhen Crawford landed in Phoenix, he was met at the airport by undercover deputies.\n\n\"I take this crime seriously,\" Arpaio said. \"It is part of my office's fight against animal abuse. These animals are not meant to be sex toys for the perverted.\"\n\nArpaio said the emails, recorded phone calls, postings and a conversation from the airport to a pre-designated meeting with a posse volunteer and his mini horse confirmed Crawford's intentions of committing bestiality, a class 6 felony.\n\nCrawford was arrested and booked into the Fourth Avenue Jail.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Pennsylvania resident Michael Crawford bought a round-trip ticket and arrived in Phoenix thinking the person who responded to an online ad he had posted was a horse owner.The ad caught the attentio...", "author": "Phil Benson", "og": {"url": "http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/story/29529650/mcso-pa-man-flies-to-phoenix-for-sex-acts-with-horse", "image": "http://MEREDITHAZ.images.worldnow.com/images/8294457_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Pennsylvania resident Michael Crawford bought a round-trip ticket and arrived in Phoenix thinking the person who responded to an online ad he had posted was a horse owner.The ad caught the attentio...", "title": "MCSO: PA man flies to Phoenix for sex acts with horse"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 17641427, "title": "MCSO: PA man flies to Phoenix for sex acts with horse", "image": "http://MEREDITHAZ.images.worldnow.com/images/8294457_G.jpg", "creator": "@TucsonNewsNow", "site": "@TucsonNewsNow", "card": "summary", "description": "Pennsylvania resident Michael Crawford bought a round-trip ticket and arrived in Phoenix thinking the person who responded to an online ad he had posted was a horse owner.The ad caught the attentio..."}, "wnreadableurl": "mcso-pa-man-flies-to-phoenix-for-sex-acts-with-horse", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "MEREDITHAZ", "fb": {"admins": 644426401, "app_id": 215936215202939}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/TucsonNewsNow"}, "date": "2015/07/12", "google-site-verification": "wum6pK5VyCXxNIhQSMSz7se_UVLjlDGJFKTm4EWnWUY", "KEYWORDS": "Tucson News Now,KOLD News 13,FOX 11,KOLD,KMSB,Tucson,Southern Arizona,Arizona", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS23", "news_keywords": "Tucson News Now,KOLD News 13,FOX 11,KOLD,KMSB,Tucson,Southern Arizona,Arizona"}, "article_summary": "(ADVISORY: Article contains some descriptive content)A 68-year-old Pennsylvania man was arrested Friday night by undercover sheriff\u2019s deputies after he allegedly flew to Arizona to have sex with a horse.\nMichael Crawford bought a round-trip ticket and arrived in Phoenix thinking the person who responded to an online ad he had posted was a horse owner.\nAccording to Arpaio, Crawford told the undercover deputy that he purchased a non-refundable plane ticket to Phoenix and would be bringing five shirts on which he wanted the horse to urinate.\nHe told detectives he would mail the clothing back to his home in Pennsylvania, where he apparently planned to wear them for arousal purposes, Arpaio said.\nWhen Crawford landed in Phoenix, he was met at the airport by undercover deputies."}
