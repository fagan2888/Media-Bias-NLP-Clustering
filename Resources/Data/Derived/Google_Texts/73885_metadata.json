Rather, it came when we raised a significant concern about providing this unsafe industry a tax advantage \u2013 the so-called \u201cmedical device tax repeal\u201d.\n\nYou see, giving a financial boost to an industry whose products have virtually no standardized guarantee of safety, is wrong. That\u2019s just common sense \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter if you are a democrat, a republican or an independent.\n\nOf course, the reason we\u2019ve raised this issue is not because we are die-hard supporters of the Affordable Care Act, where the proposed tax repeal is going to come from - far from it. Rather, we are die-hard activists for patient safety and medical ethics in our healthcare establishment \u2013as all physicians ought to be.\n\nThe industry advocates who are approaching us are all kind and well meaning. They are doing a good job promoting the economic interests of their constituents. They are doing a good job trying to create more jobs. But they also feel suddenly threatened by our goal of linking this tax repeal to the severe patient safety deficit in the medical device realm. They know it\u2019s real. Their message to us about these issues is: \u201cKeep\u2019em separated\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, these are not separate issues. We do believe that a vast majority of medical devices in our country are designed to be \u2018life saving\u2019 \u2013 and to make a good profit for their manufacturers. We are not against industry or profits. But, a minority subset of these devices are faulty, in design or conception \u2013 as the power morcellator is. And no real federal safety checkpoints are in place to protect unsuspecting patients. Doctors and device reps are the only things that stand between the patient and this monster we call \u201charm\u201d \u2013 and that\u2019s just not acceptable.\n\nWhen $30 billion dollars are injected into the device industry, it will stimulate the good, the bad and the ugly all the same. And when the bad and the ugly in the medical device realm have no real federal safety checkpoints and are stimulated to grow, they devastate unsuspecting patients\u2019 lives in America.\n\nThe real problem in the medical device industry comes from the corrupted way in which the Food and Drug Administration is using the 510(k) law to clear the vast majority of medical devices in the United States. This legislation was never designed for this purpose and it was certainly not designed to ensure patient safety. But, with definitive certainty, the way to protect patients from an industry gone rogue due to defunct federal regulation, is not to boost it with a sizable tax advantage.\n\nSo, our response to our friends and colleagues in the medical device industry when they tell us to \u201ckeep \u2018em separated\u201d is: Help us drive a leadership overhaul of the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health by congress. Help us make a \u201cMedical Device Safety Reform Act\u201d a reality and the law of this land. Only then can we help you achieve your tax repeal, stimulate your industry and create your jobs.\n\nPatient Safety is first and foremost in our healthcare establishment. An industry whose products have the capacity to damage and destroy lives without any real legislative standards guiding safety, has no business influencing our hospitals and practice patterns \u2013 much less getting a tax advantage from our federal government.\n\nOur proposal to our friends in the medical device advocacy community: Secure patient safety first, and win your tax advantage next.\n\nWe hope our congressional leaders and the president of the United States are hearing us loud and clear - because real lives in America have been compromised and lost to this industry\u2019s inadequate safety legislation and to FDA\u2019s leadership failure.\n\nHooman Noorchashm and Amy Reed, husband-and-wife physicians, have campaigned to ban electric morcellators since December 2013, soon after Reed\u2019s unsuspected uterine cancer was spread by the device during a routine hysterectomy.\n\nRead more from the Check Up blog \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160527, "editdate": "20150218T07:08:50", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/healthcare/The-medical-device-tax-repeal-The-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/clinteastwood.jpg", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The medical device tax repeal: The good, the bad and the ugly"}, "cg": "health", "keywords": "Hooman Noorchashm, MD, PhD, and Amy J.
