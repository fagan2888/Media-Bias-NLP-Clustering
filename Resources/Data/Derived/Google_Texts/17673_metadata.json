Watch the short amateur video above, if you can stomach it, showing these sleazy Christianists at work. Read this excerpt from the Little Sisters\u2019 website, explaining the kind of work these filthy, filthy Catholic nuns do:\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor are an international congregation of Roman Catholic women religious founded in 1839 by Saint Jeanne Jugan. Together with a diverse network of collaborators, we serve the elderly poor in over 30 countries around the world. Continuing the work of Saint Jeanne Jugan, our MISSION is to offer the neediest elderly of every race and religion a home where they will be welcomed as Christ, cared for as family and accompanied with dignity until God calls them to himself. Our VISION is to contribute to the Culture of Life by nurturing communities where each person is valued, the solidarity of the human family and the wisdom of age are celebrated, and the compassionate love of Christ is shared with all.\n\nHere is a bit about the life and work of St. Jeanne Jugan, who was plainly the second coming of Torquemada:\n\nIn the winter of 1839, Jugan encountered Anne Chauvin, an elderly woman who was blind, partially paralyzed, and had no one to care for her. Jugan carried her home to her apartment and took her in from that day forward, letting the woman have her bed while she slept in the attic. She soon took in two more old women in need of help, and by 1841 she had rented a room to provide housing for a dozen elderly people. The following year, she acquired an unused convent building that could house 40 of them. From this act of charity, with the approval of her colleagues, Jeanne then focused her attention upon the mission of assisting abandoned elderly women, and from this beginning arose a religious congregation called The Little Sisters of the Poor. Jugan wrote a simple Rule of Life for this new community of women, and they went door-to-door daily requesting food, clothing and money for the women in their care. This became Jugan\u2019s life work, and she performed this mission for the next four decades. During the 1840s, many other young women joined Jugan in her mission of service to the elderly poor. By begging in the streets, the foundress was able to establish four more homes for their beneficiaries by the end of the decade.\n\nThese are the kind of people that NOW calls \u201cdirty.\u201d It tells you something about contemporary American liberalism \u2014 as opposed to the kind of liberalism that was normative in this country prior to 1968 \u2014 that its followers care more about sexual freedom than caring for the elderly poor, and respecting the religious liberty of women (!) who have given their entire lives to that task.\n\nIf Dorothy Day were alive today, I suppose NOW would denounce her as dirty too.\n\nRoss Douthat writes today about another of the Dirty 100, a business that\u2019s one of the companies \u201cthat still have a sense of business as a moral calling, which can be held up as examples to shame the bottom-liners.\u201d More Douthat:\n\nOne such company was hailed last year by the left-wing policy website Demos \u201cfor thumbing its nose at the conventional wisdom that success in the retail industry\u201d requires paying \u201cbargain-basement wages.\u201d A retail chain with nearly 600 stores and 13,000 workers, this business sets its lowest full-time wage at $15 an hour, and raised wages steadily through the stagnant postrecession years. (Its do-gooder policies also include donating 10 percent of its profits to charity and giving all employees Sunday off.) And the chain is thriving commercially \u2014 offering, as Demos put it, a clear example of how \u201cdoing good for workers can also mean doing good for business.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s talking about Hobby Lobby. Douthat points out that if liberals refuse to live with pluralism, and give religious people room to exist in the public square, the culture war is going to grind on and on and on:\n\nIf liberals so desire, this division could lead to constant conflict, in which just about every project conservative believers undertake is gradually threatened with regulation enforcing liberal norms. The health coverage offered by religious employers; the activity of religious groups on college campuses; the treatments offered by religious hospitals; the subject matter taught in religious schools \u2026 the battlegrounds are legion.\n\nRead his entire column.\n\nI wish somebody would ask President Obama if he shares NOW\u2019s opinion of the \u201cdirty\u201d Little Sisters of the Poor. I wish somebody would ask President Obama if he shares NOW\u2019s opinion that all the Catholic dioceses that have filed for exemptions are \u201cdirty\u201d?\n\nIs this really where liberalism wants to go? Seriously? Does advancing the Sexual Revolution require crushing those nuns, and others who share their convictions?\n\nUPDATE: For our president, yes it does.
