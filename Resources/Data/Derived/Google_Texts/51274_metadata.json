Terrence spoke about his family\u2019s struggle to scrape by on bottom-of-the-barrel wages despite working hard at multiple jobs. The Summit itself was also a reunion for he and his mother, also a fast-food worker. Because they don\u2019t make a living wage, neither Terrence nor his mother had been able to afford to travel across multiple states to see each other in ten years, a point not lost on the President. Terrence\u2019s story was no doubt all too familiar for the millions of Americans watching the promise of the middle class fade away in the face of growing income inequality.\n\nBut they haven\u2019t lost hope. Workers like Terrence are on the frontlines of our nation\u2019s fight to address income inequality and rebuild the middle class. From fast-food workers and pharmacists to reporters and adjunct professors, these workers envision a future where they will be able to support their families without relying on public assistance just to cover the basics. And if you ask them how we can achieve that vision, their answer is clear: unions.\n\nSince fast-food workers first went on strike three years ago, workers have been sounding the call for higher pay and a seat at the table \u2013 and their voices just got a lot louder. A poll released last week by the National Employment Law Project (NELP) shows an overwhelming 72 percent of workers paid less than $15 an hour support unions.\n\nThe general public isn\u2019t far behind. A recent Gallup poll found that support for unions had surged to 58 percent \u2013 an increase of five percentage points in the last year alone. And contrary to conventional wisdom, millennials have the highest rates of support. Meanwhile, economic experts like Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers are increasingly identifying unions as critical to reducing income inequality and restoring the middle class.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why. Millions of Americans today rely on public assistance just to cover basic necessities like food, rent, and clothing for their kids \u2013 despite working full-time for some of the most profitable companies in the country. For these workers, joining together in a union is a time-tested path to the middle class. For taxpayers, fair pay and a voice on the job for underpaid workers means that we won\u2019t have to make up the difference when major corporations like McDonald\u2019s shortchange their employees.\n\nWhile raising the minimum wage is an important step toward a stronger economy, it\u2019s not enough. With families to support, workers see unions as a way to address their concerns with employers in real time. And our nation\u2019s history teaches us that workers, the middle class, and our economy thrive when workers have a seat at the bargaining table. President Obama underscored this in his remarks last week when he noted that \u201cas union membership has fallen, inequality has risen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supporting strong unions isn't just smart policy -- it's also smart politics. 2016 candidates, take note", "title": "There is power in a union: Here\u2019s how we beat inequality & rebalance our economy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Supporting strong unions isn't just smart policy -- it's also smart politics. 2016 candidates, take note", "title": "There is power in a union: Here\u2019s how we beat inequality & rebalance our economy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/12/there_is_power_in_a_union_heres_how_we_beat_inequality_rebalance_our_economy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/fast_food_strike.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Supporting strong unions isn't just smart policy -- it's also smart politics. 2016 candidates, take note", "title": "There is power in a union: Here\u2019s how we beat inequality & rebalance our economy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/fast_food_strike.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dorian Warren", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, aol_on, Barack Obama, economic inequality, Labor, Labor movement, Unions", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Summit itself was also a reunion for he and his mother, also a fast-food worker.\nAnd our nation\u2019s history teaches us that workers, the middle class, and our economy thrive when workers have a seat at the bargaining table.\nWith families to support, workers see unions as a way to address their concerns with employers in real time.\nWorkers like Terrence are on the frontlines of our nation\u2019s fight to address income inequality and rebuild the middle class.\nFor these workers, joining together in a union is a time-tested path to the middle class."}
