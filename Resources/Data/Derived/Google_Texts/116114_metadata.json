(Photo: Andy Marlette illustration)Buy Photo\n\nHere it is! The perfect summer soundtrack for the city of Pensacola!\n\nIn the aftermath of goofing off, rejecting leases and losing a proposed $20 million in projects for the Community Maritime Park, city officials were still saying they really want the projects.\n\nCue the Quint Studer karaoke cover of pop sensation Meghan Trainor:\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re lyin\u2019\n\n\u2018Cause your lips are movin\u2019\n\nTell me do you think I\u2019m dumb?\n\nI might be young (at heart),\n\nBut I ain\u2019t stupid!\n\nTalking \u2018round in circles with your tongue!\n\nI gave you bass (i.e. a ton of cash), you gave me sweet talk,\n\nSaying how I\u2019m your number one,\n\nBut I know you\u2019re lyin\u2019\n\n\u2018Cause your lips are movin\u2019\n\nBaby, don\u2019t ya know I\u2019m done!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right Pensacola, on the park leases, Studer is done. Thanks Obama!\n\nOh wait. Maybe he\u2019s not the executive to blame for this botched deal.\n\nBut how in the world did the botching happen? Mayor Ashton Hayward rah-rah-ed it publicly. He called it a \u201cgolden opportunity.\u201d He even spent taxpayer dollars on a special attorney to get the deal done. Two weeks ago, he said they it just needed \u201ctweaks.\u201d\n\nThen just a few days ago, City Hall sent out an exciting, new press release in an \u201ceffort to increase transparency and respond proactively\u201d (can one \u201crespond\u201d \u201cproactively?\u201d) to the \u201chot topic\u201d of the park leases. Then about an hour later, the city blasted out another email that said the CMPA-approved leases would not be accepted. According to Studer\u2019s team, that was the first they\u2019d heard of it. No phone call, no heads up. Just the \u201ctransparent\u201d and \u201cproactive\u201d press release about what once was a \u201cgolden opportunity.\u201d\n\nCue the Meghan Trainor:\n\n\u201cIf your lips are movin\u2019,\n\nIf your lips are movin\u2019,\n\nIf your lips are movin\u2019, then you\u2019re lyin\u2019, lyin\u2019, lyin\u2019, babe!\u201d\n\nSo Studer\u2019s out. Frustrated? Done with the games? Tired of reading emails from the Upside? Presumably all of the above. Who can blame the guy? It ain\u2019t like he doesn\u2019t have other places to put shiny, new multimillion-dollar buildings. There are only so many governmental hoops a millionaire philanthropist can jump through, right?\n\nI mean, most folks in Pensacola these days seem pretty dadgum jazzed about Studer\u2019s work around here. And after starting businesses, creating jobs, promoting wellness, inclusiveness, creativity, positivity and thereby, building a better community, I reckon there\u2019s only so much jerking around a guy can take. At some point, it becomes a simple matter of self respect.\n\nTell \u2018em, Meghan:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a classy girl\n\nI\u2019m a hold it up\n\nYou full of something but it ain\u2019t love\n\nAnd what we got is straight overdue\n\nGo find somebody new.\u201d\n\nBut City Hall pleads they still want to work on the project. The mayor\u2019s newly promoted Grand Exalted Ruler over half the city, Tamara Fountain, even said so on 1620 AM on Friday.\n\nWhat say you, Miss Trainor?\n\n\u201cHey, baby, don\u2019t you bring them tears,\n\n\u2018Cause it\u2019s too late, too late, babe, oh!\n\nYou only love me when you\u2019re here,\n\nYou\u2019re so two-faced, two-faced, babe, oh!\u201d\n\nAlas, talk is cheap. Especially when it costs you $20 million. Here\u2019s the thing that the noble, competent and ethical officials at City Hall need to get. When they talk all this game and don\u2019t back it up with action, it\u2019s not just Studer that\u2019s being misled \u2014 it\u2019s all citizens.\n\nSo spare us the smack talk about transparency, proactivity and Upsidedness. Maybe we\u2019re old. Maybe we\u2019re young. But like Meghan says, we ain\u2019t stupid. And if things don\u2019t change, everyone in Pensacola will sing along:\n\n\u201cIf your lips are movin\u2019,\n\nIf your lips are movin\u2019,\n\nIf your lips are movin\u2019, then you\u2019re lyin\u2019, lyin\u2019, lyin\u2019, babe!\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1S4XBBF", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "So Studer\u2019s out.
