Rick Nolan\u2019s impassioned speech at a darkened bar here was a decided departure from those given by dozens of vulnerable Democrats across the country.\n\n\u201cOf course we support the Affordable Care Act for all the good things it\u2019s done for so many people, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re done. We\u2019re not going to be done until we have a single payer system!\u201d Nolan said, his hoarse voice rising above the friendly crowd sipping pitchers of light beer and sitting among peanut shells. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to returning the House of Representatives to the people\u2019s chamber \u2026 and then we can join \u2026 the president of these United States of America to get this country back on track again.\u201d\n\nNolan is currently a tad worrisome to Washington Democrats. An old-school politician \u2014 he served three House terms in the late 1970s \u2014 Nolan leaves party talking points out of his speeches just about every day. He brazenly bashes beltway playbooks that politely ask him to log 30 hours a week dialing for dollars. He often reverts to fevered hyperbole when talking about his job in Washington. In one speech, he called the current House of Representatives \u201cthe most undemocratic institution that I have ever served in.\u201d\n\nHe says he prefers the old days when members of Congress stayed in Washington longer, debated everything, and were handily able to secure federal funding for their districts.\n\nYet as genuine and unscrubbed as Nolan\u2019s opinions may be to some constituents, the Eighth Congressional District is no longer the Democratic stronghold of old, tending instead to whip around with the political winds of the moment.\n\nThe result?\n\nStewart Mills has cut his own counterculture GOP image with long hair, tight polo shirts and a Twitter feed full of shots of him doing pullups, eating corn and posing around various landmarks.\n\nThe 70-year-old Nolan is in the political fight of his life against Republican Stewart Mills, a 42-year-old scion of Mills Fleet Farm enterprises. Mills himself has cut his own counterculture GOP image with long hair, tight polo shirts and a Twitter feed full of shots of him doing pullups, eating corn and posing around various kitschy landmarks in the Eighth Congressional District.\n\nThis colorful matchup in the Eighth is Minnesota\u2019s hottest political race. It has been dubbed a \u201ctoss up\u201d by every political observer in the country and has already garnered more than $2 million in outside money for ads. This ranks it among the top 10 House races in the country for outside cash pouring in, according to the Sunlight Foundation.\n\nStiff competition\n\nAsk the candidates why the race is so close and the answers are starkly different.\n\nMills says Nolan is a nice guy who is too deeply embedded in the Washington establishment and too liberal for the rural stretches of northern Minnesota.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s abused the vote we\u2019ve given him in Washington DC,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI\u2019m going to remove somebody who is part of the problem.\u201d\n\nNolan says millions spent against him starting more than a year ago have roughed up his image in the district.\n\n\u201cI was running like 10 or 12 percent ahead of this guy, but a couple million dollars of beating up on you and suddenly you\u2019re in a dead heat,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to be able to win this thing, but it\u2019s going to be a close race.\u201d\n\nNotable differences\n\nOn the campaign trail, Mills is running on eliminating some proposed environmental regulations he says hurt Minnesota farmers and his support for the second amendment. He talks about ditching Obamacare for something friendlier to \u201cmain street\u201d and also frequently dings Nolan for being against veterans because he voted against a Department of Veterans Affairs appropriations bill last summer.\n\n\u201cWe do speak to the values and priorities of our part of Minnesota,\u201d Mills said. \u201cCertainly you can\u2019t be for jobs and against the activities that create jobs.\u201d\n\nTed Lovdahl, GOP chair for the Eighth Congressional District, said people find Mills\u2019 nontraditional approach and look appealing.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of DFL friends who say, \u2018Ted, I\u2019m going to vote for your man,\u2019\u201d Lovdahl said. \u201cThey like his honesty. People ask him different questions, and he never walks away.\u201d\n\nNolan engages Mills less, rarely uttering his name on the stump, and instead touts his two-year record in the minority party in Washington. He says he voted against the veterans spending bill because it didn\u2019t address mental health and was less than what President Obama and the VA sought from Congress.\n\nHe is most proud of the $71 million in federal cash he has sent back to the district for projects, along with two bills he authored that passed the House. One streamlined regulatory requirements for small aircraft manufacturers and another was an Indian land swap with Carlton County.\n\nNolan boasts that he has stood up to the Environmental Protection Agency on his district\u2019s behalf \u2014 once even flying to a Chicago field office for a meeting to delay the implementation of regulations that would affect some northern Minnesota mines.\n\n\u201cThey [the EPA] are really hurting industry up here,\u201d said Dave Bombich, union president at ArcelorMittal iron ore mine in Virginia. Two years ago Bombich supported Nolan\u2019s GOP predecessor, Rep. Chip Cravaack. Now he favors Nolan.\n\n\u201cTell me what you can do today without steel?\u201d Bombich asks. \u201cI think Rick knows all this and is backing all of us on this, and that\u2019s why I support him.\u201d\n\nIn the coming weeks, the avalanche of political advertising pulsing through the district is expected to grow. In addition to the outside money, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has reserved $1.1 million in ads for Nolan, while the National Republican Congressional Committee has booked roughly the same for Mills.\n\nThough required to help him win, this is anathema to Nolan, who this week proposed reforms to Congress that would ban fundraising during Washington work periods and limit spending on congressional campaigns to a period 60 days before an election. He said change is needed because \u201cit\u2019s too much money and not enough governance.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t change the reality of election season in a swing district.\n\n\u201cI still want to remain true to my promise to spend my time governing, which I have done,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s election time and I\u2019m busy raising money. These are the rules of the game.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "This colorful matchup is Minnesota's hottest race.
