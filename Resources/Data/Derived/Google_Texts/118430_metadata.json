The 60,000-square-foot Kochville Township Hobby Lobby store, which opened in October 2004, employs 29 people.\n\nIn an email, Parker said Hobby Lobby is opening 36 stores this year and as many as 60 stores in 2014.\n\nThe root of the rumor centers around the company's governing principles and how they line up with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHobby Lobby founder and CEO David Green, a devout Christian, has been a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare, and what he refers to as abortion-causing drugs, such as emergency contraception and the morning-after pill.\n\nAccording to Hobby Lobby's website, the company, with 561 stores across the nation, is committed to \u201chonoring the Lord in all we do by operating the company in a manner consistent with biblical principles.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA sign posted at the Kochville Township store states that the store is closed on Sundays \u201cto allow employees time for family and worship.\u201d\n\nParker said rumors that the company would close its stores because of Obamacare have been circulating for about a year.\n\n\u201cAny help you can give in dispelling this rumor would be greatly appreciated,\u201d Parker wrote in the email.\n\nParker pointed out a column Green wrote, which was published on USA Today\u2019s website in September 2012.\n\nIn the column, Green announced that the company had filed a lawsuit represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, \u201casking a federal court to stop this mandate before it hurts our business.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to a Beckett Fund for Religious Freedom news release dated Sept. 19, the United States government has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take the Hobby Lobby case.\n\nIf the petition is granted, the release states, the case would be argued and decided before the end of the court's term in June.\n\n\u2014 Heather Jordan covers business for MLive/The Saginaw News/Bay City Times.
