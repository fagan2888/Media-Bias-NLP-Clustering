But his expression would soon revert to a focused stare.\n\nRECAP: Broncos punch ticket to AFC championship game\n\nThe excitement was welcome, but the questioning soon became overwhelming.\n\nBut on Sunday, his guard came down. A smile he had tried to suppress refused to fade.\n\nFor the first time ever, his mother, Katina Stuckey Smith, got to see him play football, a divisional playoff win over the Steelers, no less.\n\n\u201cIt was great,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 I was just excited she was here for her first game. We came out with the win to make it even better.\u201d\n\nIn 1999, when Thomas was 11, Smith was arrested for operating a cocaine ring with Thomas\u2019 grandmother, Minnie Pearl Smith, out of their house in Georgia. For 15 years inside a federal correctional institute in Tallahassee, Fla., Katina Smith, whose original sentence of more than 24 years was later reduced to 20, could only cheer from afar, donning gray prison garb as she watched her son on a prison television.\n\nBESTS/WORSTS: Demaryius Thomas, Brandon McManus\n\nBut last July, just days before Thomas signed a five-year, $70 million contract extension with the Broncos, President Obama announced Katina Smith would be going home early. She was one of 46 nonviolent drug offenders to have their sentences commuted early.\n\nAfter spending more than three months in a halfway house, Smith went home the evening of Nov. 9. Her travel was restricted for 60 days after, though, ending her shot at seeing her son play before the regular season ended. But her chance to see him when it counted more was still very much alive.\n\nOn Saturday, Smith flew to Denver with Thomas\u2019 father and aunt to reunite with her son for the first time since their tear-filled goodbye more than 16 years ago.\n\nBRONCOS DEFENSE: Decodes Ben Roethlisberger in time to stop Steelers\n\n\u201cIt was good,\u201d Thomas said, still with grin. \u201cFirst thing she started doing looking around the house, trying to clean up stuff.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday Smith sat in a suite on the club level of Sports Authority Field, this time in a new uniform \u2014 a customized, sparkling No. 88 jersey that read \u201d Bay Bay\u2019s Mama\u201d on the back \u2014 as she watched her son catch four passes for 40 yards.\n\nShe watched as the Broncos struggled early, but came through late.\n\nShe watched as Demaryius all but sealed the Broncos\u2019 victory with his two-point conversion in the fourth quarter.\n\nAnd she watched as he passed Rod Smith, to sit atop the Broncos\u2019 record book with 50 career playoff catches.\n\nShe watched it all \u2014 live.\n\nMom was present, but the added pressure was not.\n\n\u201cOnly because I didn\u2019t really know where she was,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI knew what suite she was in, but I couldn\u2019t really see so it couldn\u2019t really bother me.\u201d\n\nMinutes after the game, she sauntered down to the bowels of Sports Authority Field for the reunion which the two had waited for so long.\n\nAfter the game, quarterback Peyton Manning handed Thomas the game ball, a gift to pass on to his mother. As Thomas opened the doors of the locker room, football in hand, Smith grabbed her son for a hug before posing for pictures with teammates and their families.\n\nThe embrace drew a roar of cheers, and smiles.\n\nBut none bigger than the one on Thomas\u2019 face.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Demaryius Thomas gives game ball to mother, who watched her son play for 1st time", "title": "Demaryius Thomas gives game ball to mother, who watched her son play for 1st time", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/17/demaryius-thomas-gives-game-ball-to-mother-who-watched-her-son-play-for-1st-time/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__fbn-fbn-thomasp1-2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__fbn-fbn-thomasp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-17T20:12:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T01:03:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After the game, quarterback Peyton Manning handed Thomas the game ball, a gift to pass on to his mother.\nAfter spending more than three months in a halfway house, Smith went home the evening of Nov. 9.\n88 jersey that read \u201d Bay Bay\u2019s Mama\u201d on the back \u2014 as she watched her son catch four passes for 40 yards.\nBESTS/WORSTS: Demaryius Thomas, Brandon McManusBut last July, just days before Thomas signed a five-year, $70 million contract extension with the Broncos, President Obama announced Katina Smith would be going home early.\nFor the first time ever, his mother, Katina Stuckey Smith, got to see him play football, a divisional playoff win over the Steelers, no less."}
