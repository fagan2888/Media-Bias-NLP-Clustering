The cost of not curing hep. C is unsustainable,\u201d he said.\n\nThe stakes are high for both sides, with lawmakers and regulators taking an interest in the debate and considering whether action should be taken on drug prices.\n\nIn the meantime, Buck is eager to highlight the potential consequences of high prices for all the specialty drugs currently in development.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of incentive to rein it in,\u201d he said of drugmakers, referring to the healthcare law\u2019s limits on out-of-pocket costs for consumers.\n\n\u201cThey know health plans and government programs are on the hook. \u2026 As a result, states are going to have to make trade-offs.\u201d\n\nAHIP is also concerned about the implications of drug prices for Medicare Part D.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraging [drug] companies to be transparent. Otherwise, they\u2019re inviting government intervention, and nobody wants that,\u201d Buck said.\n\nIt\u2019s a fair fight between the two industries, especially given Zirkelbach\u2019s history of winning battles for AHIP.\n\nAs to Buck\u2019s approach, time will tell whether it helps the insurers gain the upper hand.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the rules used to be, but I bring a political background, and everyone here has been really supportive of mixing it up a little,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sort of sarcastic by nature. I enjoy a little snark.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Brendan Buck is turning up the heat in K Street\u2019s biggest healthcare clash.", "description": "Brendan Buck is turning up the heat in K Street\u2019s biggest healthcare clash.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Elise Viebeck", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Brendan Buck is turning up the heat in K Street\u2019s biggest healthcare clash.", "title": "Brendan Buck throws elbows on K St.", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/213202-brendan-buck-throws-elbows-on-k-st", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/buckbrendan_012812gn_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-24T11:32:24-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-24T11:32-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/213202-brendan-buck-throws-elbows-on-k-st", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-23T20:36-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Garrett Evans", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Brendan Buck,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-23T20:36:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-24T11:32:24-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/213202-brendan-buck-throws-elbows-on-k-st", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Brendan Buck is turning up the heat in K Street\u2019s biggest healthcare clash.", "card": "summary", "title": "Brendan Buck throws elbows on K St."}, "dcterms.title": "Brendan Buck throws elbows on K St."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbcd8\"", "article_summary": "Brendan Buck is turning up the heat in K Street\u2019s biggest healthcare clash.\nThe stakes are high for both sides, with lawmakers and regulators taking an interest in the debate and considering whether action should be taken on drug prices.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t defend the prices without blushing,\u201d Buck, 32, said of the drug companies.\n\u2026 As a result, states are going to have to make trade-offs.\u201dAHIP is also concerned about the implications of drug prices for Medicare Part D.\u201cWe are encouraging [drug] companies to be transparent.\nIn the meantime, Buck is eager to highlight the potential consequences of high prices for all the specialty drugs currently in development."}
