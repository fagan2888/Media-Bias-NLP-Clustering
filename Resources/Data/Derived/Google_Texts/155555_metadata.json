But lawmakers never considered it before they left town on Wednesday for a five-week recess.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt a Thursday press conference, McConnell plugged \u201can incredibly productive first six months\u201d for the Republican-controlled Senate. He said he\u2019s still considering a legislative schedule for this fall.\n\n\u201cThe TSCA legislation is another example of something important that enjoys bipartisan support,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to look for things that make a difference for this country, that can clear the Senate, a body that requires 60 votes to do most things.\u201d\n\nThe TSCA overhaul, a bipartisan bill from Sens. David Vitter (R-La.) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.), would increase penalties for chemical violations and direct the Environmental Protection Agency to review new and existing chemicals based on safety and public health grounds.\n\nThe bill has more than 50 co-sponsors, though it has not won the backing of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. She has said the Senate should call up the House-passed TSCA bill instead.\n\nIf lawmakers reach a deal on chemical safety reform, it would be the first rewrite of the law since the 1970s.\n\nLast month, Vitter and Udall pushed leadership to bring up the bill before the end of the summer, but debate on the Senate floor focused on highway funding, Planned Parenthood and a cybersecurity bill instead.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said an overhaul of federal chemical safety laws could come to the Senate floor when lawmakers return from their summer recess.", "description": "Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said an overhaul of federal chemical safety laws could come to the Senate floor when lawmakers return from their summer recess.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Devin Henry", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said an overhaul of federal chemical safety laws could come to the Senate floor when lawmakers return from their summer recess.", "title": "McConnell: Chemical reform could get a vote in the fall", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/250430-mcconnell-chemical-reform-could-get-a-vote-in-the-fall", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-06T13:07:24-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-06T13:07-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/250430-mcconnell-chemical-reform-could-get-a-vote-in-the-fall", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-06T13:01-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Devin Henry", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Toxic Substances Control Act,Mitch McConnell,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-06T13:01:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-06T13:07:24-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/250430-mcconnell-chemical-reform-could-get-a-vote-in-the-fall", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said an overhaul of federal chemical safety laws could come to the Senate floor when lawmakers return from their summer recess.", "card": "summary", "title": "McConnell: Chemical reform could get a vote in the fall"}, "dcterms.title": "McConnell: Chemical reform could get a vote in the fall"}, "article_summary": "If lawmakers reach a deal on chemical safety reform, it would be the first rewrite of the law since the 1970s.\nShe has said the Senate should call up the House-passed TSCA bill instead.\n\u201cThe TSCA legislation is another example of something important that enjoys bipartisan support,\u201d McConnell said.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellOvernight Healthcare: Momentum on mental health?\nADVERTISEMENTAt a Thursday press conference, McConnell plugged \u201can incredibly productive first six months\u201d for the Republican-controlled Senate."}
