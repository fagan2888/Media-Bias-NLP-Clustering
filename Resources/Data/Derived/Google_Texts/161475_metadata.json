United States held that the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program would likely be found after a trial to have exceeded the president\u2019s authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The program could not be allowed to take effect in the meantime, the majority said, because it would subject Texas and the 25 other states that sued to block it to \u201ca substantial threat of irreparable injury.\u201d\n\nI wonder whether Mr. Eastland, who these days criticizes President Obama\u2019s \u201cunilateral governance\u201d and \u201cCongress-circumventing actions,\u201d is planning a new book praising \u201cenergy in the judiciary.\u201d Someone on his side of the street certainly should write one. The majority opinion is as cynical an exercise of judicial authority as I can remember \u2014 and no, I haven\u2019t forgotten Bush v. Gore. The dissenting judge, Carolyn Dineen King, nailed it when she said the case \u201cessentially boils down to a policy dispute\u201d and that \u201cthe policy decisions at issue in this case are best resolved not by judicial fiat, but via the political process.\u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. could hardly have said it better himself. In fact, he did say essentially the same thing, in his dissenting opinion last June in the same-sex marriage case.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI don\u2019t casually accuse courts of cynicism, and I\u2019m not so na\u00efve as to be shocked at the thought that a judge\u2019s political outlook might influence a judicial outcome. So let\u2019s look at the details, beginning with the untoward delay in issuing the opinion, four months after the case was argued in the Fifth Circuit\u2019s New Orleans courthouse. This was supposed to be an \u201cexpedited appeal\u201d to be decided within 60 days, and as the weeks and months went by, suspicions grew in the immigration advocacy community that the judges were deliberately running out the clock on the Obama administration\u2019s ability to get an appeal up to the Supreme Court in time for a decision during the current term. In mid-October, some immigration activists staged demonstrations in front of the courthouse, including a nine-day hunger strike, to shame the judges into releasing the opinion. In her dissenting opinion, Judge King said there had been \u201cno justification\u201d for what she called the \u201cextended delay.\u201d\n\n(The kindest thing to say about the judges in the majority, Jerry E. Smith and Jennifer Walker Elrod, is that they may have used their time not to evade timely Supreme Court review but to write snarky comebacks to Judge King\u2019s unanswerable dissenting opinion. I\u2019ve rarely read anything in an opinion as condescending as this footnote, addressed to Judge King, the circuit\u2019s former chief judgeand one of the country\u2019s most highly respected jurists: \u201cOur dedicated colleague has penned a careful dissent, with which we largely but respectfully disagree. It is well-researched, however, and bears a careful read.\u201d Another footnote contains this criticism: \u201cThe dissent, throughout, cleverly refers to the states, more than forty times, as the \u2018plaintiffs,\u2019 obscuring the fact that they are sovereign states [while referring to the defendants as the \u2018government.\u2019 ]\u201d Sorry, Judges Smith and Elrod, the 26 states are the plaintiffs, and it is standard judicial practice to refer to the federal government as the government. I suppose you might have preferred the case to be named \u201cTwenty-six Sovereign States v. A Man Called Barack Obama.\u201d)\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court\u2019s window for the current term is closing quickly, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. will get a petition up to the court in time. Assuming the justices agree to hear the case, it will be fascinating to see how they respond to a decision that reads like a judicial version of the old Woody Allen movie \u201cSleeper,\u201d in which everything that used to be bad for you is now good, and vice versa.\n\nStanding, for example. As I observed in a recent column, conservative federal judges who used to be very strict about deciding who had the requisite \u201cinjury in fact\u201d to bring a lawsuit are now flinging the courthouse doors open wide to anyone with a complaint that might prove useful in propelling a particular agenda. Was I ever right. Not a week after that column appeared, Federal District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that the House of Representatives has standing to sue the administration for using unappropriated funds for a portion of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance subsidies.\n\nNot too long ago \u2014 or at least back when I took a law-school course on federal jurisdiction \u2014 any federal judge would have promptly tossed out such a claim as a non-justiciable political dispute between two branches of government. But \u201cthe House has suffered a concrete, particularized injury that gives it standing to sue,\u201d Judge Collyer said. Last month, the judge refused the administration\u2019s urgent request to authorize an appeal of the standing question, announcing instead that she would hear the case, United States House of Representatives v. Burwell, on its merits next year.\n\nAnd then this week came the Fifth Circuit\u2019s immigration decision. The claim of Texas and its allies to standing is preposterous. The Fifth Circuit majority found that the state\u2019s concrete injury lies in the fact that some 500,000 undocumented Texas residents would be entitled under the deferral program to obtain drivers\u2019 licenses, and the state, which charges $25 for a six-year license, would lose \u201ca minimum of $130.89\u201d on each license. \u201cEven a modest estimate would put the loss at several million dollars.\u201d Hmmm. My own user-friendly state of Connecticut charges $66 for an ordinary driver\u2019s license and offers undocumented immigrants a drive-only license (legal authorization to drive, but not to be used for identification) for a $72 fee. I guess the great state of Texas would rather fight the federal government than figure out how to balance its motor vehicle department\u2019s books.\n\nThe government had argued in its brief that whatever Texas loses on issuing licenses it would more than gain on car registration fees, other driver-related expenditures, and the obvious fact that immigrants with deferred deportation would be able to work openly and pay taxes. (Attorney General Kamala Harris of California made this point in a conference call discussion on Tuesday, noting that California, with more immigrants than any other state, expected to reap sizable financial benefits from the deferred deportation program.)\n\nThe Fifth Circuit rejected the government\u2019s argument, saying that \u201cnone of the benefits the government identifies is sufficiently connected to the costs to qualify as an offset.\u201d In 2002, a lifetime ago in judicial politics, the same Fifth Circuit (different judges) denied standing to taxpayers who challenged a Louisiana law that authorized special license plates with the slogan \u201cChoose Life,\u201d while not authorizing an equivalent slogan for abortion rights. The Fifth Circuit said then that the plaintiffs could claim no injury because any extra cost of the special plates would be offset by the extra fee the state charged for them. Times change.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn its analysis of the states\u2019 standing, the Fifth Circuit majority relied heavily on a 2007 Supreme Court decision, Massachusetts v. EPA, that accorded the state standing to challenge the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s refusal to regulate motor vehicle emissions linked to climate change. Massachusetts had argued that as a predictable result of climate change, its coastline would be eroded by rising seawater. But in her dissenting opinion on Monday, Judge King pointed out that the Clean Air Act, under which Massachusetts had brought suit, specifically authorized lawsuits for a refusal to regulate, while there is no such authorization in the immigration law. Chief Justice Roberts wrote a vigorous dissent in the Massachusetts case in which he described standing as \u201ca fundamental limitation ensuring that courts function as courts, and not intrude on the politically accountable branches.\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia has also taken a classically strict view of standing. These two justices will soon have a chance to show whether they still mean it.\n\nThe administration\u2019s deferred action program was announced a year ago in a memorandum by Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security. The five-page memo, which Judge King attached to her dissenting opinion, described deferred action as \u201ca form of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d This use of administrative discretion in immigration enforcement dates to the 1960s, Mr. Johnson noted. The difference here was that a specific class of people \u2014 otherwise law-abiding parents of American-born or legal-resident children \u2014 would be eligible for a three-year deferral of deportation if they applied for it, passed a background check, and paid a fee of $465. In other words, nothing is automatic. There is no waving of a magic wand for the entire class; each applicant has to pass individually through the gateway that the program establishes.\n\nThe memo concluded: \u201cThis memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. Only an Act of Congress can confer these rights. It remains within the authority of the executive branch, however, to set forth policy for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action within the framework of existing law. This memorandum is an exercise of that authority.\u201d\n\nThe exercise of prosecutorial discretion, Judge King observed, is not subject to judicial review. She also noted that Congress in 2002 delegated to the Department of Homeland Security authority to \u201cestablish national immigration enforcement policies and priorities.\u201d Only by a twisted characterization of the program as a \u201cdecision to change the immigration classification of millions of illegal immigrants on a class-wide basis\u201d did the Fifth Circuit majority find the deferred action program to be outside the frame of that delegated authority. If not for its length at 70 pages, the opinion would fit comfortably as a talking point in a Republican presidential debate. I was not surprised to see Donald Trump nearly jumping up and down with glee when asked during Tuesday night\u2019s Republican debate what he thought of the Fifth Circuit decision.\n\nProperly understood, with all its qualifiers, I\u2019m not sure the deferred action program even counts as the kind of \u201cenergy in the executive\u201d that Terry Eastland called for so many years ago. In reviewing the decision, the Roberts court has a chance to demonstrate that it cares about principle more than politics. That\u2019s the kind of energy the judiciary needs now.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20151112032102, "twitter": {"description": "Will the Supreme Court reverse an appeals court decision blocking a program to shield undocumented parents of American-born children from deportation?", "title": "Judicial Energy and the Supreme Court", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/opinion/judicial-energy-and-the-supreme-court.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004031184"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/greenhouse-circular/greenhouse-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/opinion/judicial-energy-and-the-supreme-court.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004031184", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/opinion/judicial-energy-and-the-supreme-court.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 12, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Supreme Court (US)", "keywords": "Supreme Court (US),Courts and the Judiciary,United States", "CN": "linda-greenhouse", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Linda Greenhouse", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/greenhouse-circular/greenhouse-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By LINDA GREENHOUSE", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Will the Supreme Court reverse an appeals court decision blocking a program to shield undocumented parents of American-born children from deportation?", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/greenhouse-circular/greenhouse-circular-thumbStandard-v2.png", "description": "Will the Supreme Court reverse an appeals court decision blocking a program to shield undocumented parents of American-born children from deportation?", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 12, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/linda_greenhouse/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-11-12", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States", "published": "2015-11-12", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "slug": "12greenhouse", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151112032102, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/opinion/judicial-energy-and-the-supreme-court.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/greenhouse-circular/greenhouse-circular-superJumbo-v2.png", "type": "article", "description": "Will the Supreme Court reverse an appeals court decision blocking a program to shield undocumented parents of American-born children from deportation?", "title": "Judicial Energy and the Supreme Court"}, "pdate": 20151112, "des": "Courts and the Judiciary", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/linda-greenhouse", "tagline": "The Supreme Court and the law.", "uri": "/column/linda-greenhouse", "display-name": "Linda Greenhouse", "identifier": "linda-greenhouse", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000004031184, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Judicial Energy and the Supreme Court", "col": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "In reviewing the decision, the Roberts court has a chance to demonstrate that it cares about principle more than politics.\nThe majority opinion is as cynical an exercise of judicial authority as I can remember \u2014 and no, I haven\u2019t forgotten Bush v.
