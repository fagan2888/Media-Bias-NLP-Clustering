My vision tunneled and twirled like a party-favor kaleidoscope. The last thing I remember clearly is crying to my nurse that I was sorry I couldn\u2019t be stronger for her.\n\nI was quickly given Ativan and a painkiller. When the medical team had stitched up my leg and I was coming out of my haze, they handed me to my husband, along with some wound-care instructions and prescriptions, and I went home.\n\nOn my couch and in considerable pain, I thought, \u201cWhat the hell happened in there?\u201d\n\nThat surgery that seemed to go awry was way back in 2007, but only recently did I put that question to my surgeon, as I tried to understand both my medical care and my reaction to it. I come away convinced that the operation itself didn\u2019t go wrong \u2014 but the doctor-patient communication surrounding it did.\n\nAgain and again over the course of months, I felt too intimidated to ask the questions echoing in my mind. Nor did my health care team initiate the conversations I desperately needed. That disconnect is a towering problem in American health care, some experts say,\n\nPoor patient-doctor communication, says Harvard School of Public Health professor and former pediatric surgeon Lucian Leape, is \u201cprobably the single greatest source of missed information that leads to erroneous treatment, treatment not followed properly, unnecessary anxiety.\u201d\n\nAlso, I can attest, it can lead to doubts that may fester for many years.\n\nIt began with a blemish\n\nIn 1999, while I was living with my parents in Maryland, I noticed that a blemish on my left thigh was not going away. The dermatologist I saw told me it was probably a benign fibroma. It could be removed for cosmetic purposes or left alone with no detrimental effects. I figured my COBRA insurance wouldn\u2019t cover anything cosmetic, so I chose the latter.\n\nEventually I moved to Boston, got married, and landed a very stable job. The growth on my leg hadn\u2019t changed in size or shape, but I decided to brandish my shiny new quality medical insurance and get rid of it. In November of 2007, I showed up for a routine fibroma excision.\n\nTwo weeks later, I was alone in my office at 6:30 p.m. when the phone rang. It was the dermatology department. I was told that the growth was not a benign fibroma, but rather a rare malignancy called Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans, or DFSP. They had already scheduled me to return to the office in a week for a surgical procedure. Did I have any questions? The conversation went something like this:\n\n\u201cSo\u2026I have cancer?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s a rare form, but very treatable,\u201d said the nurse.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026.wait\u2026do I need chemo or radiation or anything?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo, just the surgery. Do you want to schedule a phone call with the doctor to ask questions?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Definitely.\u201d\n\nI remember thinking, \u201cShould that conversation have happened over the phone? With a nurse?\u201d\n\nThe next day, after extensive poking around on the Internet, I spoke to the dermatologic surgeon. I asked if they would follow the standard procedure of performing the surgery in the office, and whether they would leave the wound open for a number of days during extensive testing. The answer to both questions was yes. That was about the extent of the phone call. And again, I thought \u201cDo they really just talk to people about their cancer treatment over the phone now?\u201d\n\n\u2018You\u2019re sending me home like this?\u2019\n\nThe next week, under local anesthesia, I watched as the cancer was cut out of my leg.\n\nThe surgeon removed a golf ball-sized piece of tissue in a circle around the original excision site. That piece of tissue was taken to another room, flash frozen, and sliced into very thin sections to be analyzed microscopically. A \u201cmap\u201d was created of the wound and the location of the finger-like tendrils of cancer that were growing toward my bone.\n\nThe surgeon then laid the map over the wound and took more tissue. This time only the cancerous area was removed, leaving the healthy remainder in the hole intact. This procedure continued a couple more times, until they couldn\u2019t find any more cancer to remove. I found it riveting.\n\nI was left with a gaping hole in my leg. The surgeon estimated that about 15% of my left thigh was gone. The hole was then packed with antibiotic-soaked gauze and my leg wrapped with pressure bandages. It was at this point that I remember thinking very clearly, \u201cWait, you\u2019re still planning on sending me home like this?\u201d\n\nBut I didn\u2019t ask it out loud. I was given a prescription for pain medication and told that testing could take up to seven days. The nurse gave me printed instructions on wound care and told me I couldn\u2019t get my leg wet. She said they\u2019d call me when I could come back to either be closed up or have more tissue removed.\n\nThis was the first of multiple instances in which there was a conversation that I now think needed to happen, but didn\u2019t.\n\nThe wound on my leg seemed pretty severe and even with an attentive husband, strong pain-killers, and the occasional can of Pabst to supplement, I was in considerable pain. I couldn\u2019t shower; going to the bathroom was a challenge. Through the fog of Percocet, I thought \u201cShould I really be left to care for myself in this condition and for this long?\u201d\n\nFive days after my surgery, I arrived at the doctor\u2019s office with my bandages intact and not smelling my best. The testing had come back negative and I was cancer-free. The only thing left to do was watch them close up that hole and make up a good story about the giant scar.\n\nThen the pain hit\n\nAfter only a few days, the tissue inside my wound had been exposed to the outside environment enough to require sterilization before being closed up. To accomplish this, the surgeon needed to perform a fair amount of debriding, or \u201croughing up\u201d of the inside of the wound to clean out the wound and aid in the healing process. In addition, any blood or lymph vessels that opened into the hole needed to be cauterized to prevent drainage.\n\nSuffice it to say, it was unpleasant, but again, was done in the examination room with local anesthetic. And again, I found it fascinating to watch.\n\nThen the pain hit.\n\nHere again, another conversation was necessary. I was never told exactly what happened in that examination room. I assumed the pain jolt came from a nerve being hit during the debridement process.\n\nAs I understand it, the cavity in my leg was too large to close in a straight line, as had been the plan. In the end, the surgeon used triangular skin grafts from just outside the hole to create a \u201clid\u201d over the deepest part. The pain would eventually subside and the scar looked very cool, but I couldn\u2019t help thinking, \u201cDid my surgeon get in over his head? Should he have consulted with anyone before closing me up?\u201d\n\nIn January of 2008, I was back at my job with my fresh scar and a slight limp. Things should have ended there. But it would be six months and a hospitalization before my leg would be back to normal.\n\nShortly after I went back to work, the area underneath the scar swelled and became rock-hard. I went back to the surgeon and a tray full of clear liquid was drained from my leg. I was told it was most likely lymphatic fluid. By June I\u2019d seen the surgeon four times for the same draining procedure, and by the beginning of July, I had developed an infection and spiked a fever.\n\nBut why did this happen?\n\nI spent three days in a hospital room. During that time, there were at least three different doctors in to see me, including my surgeon, who stopped in to check on me. They all told me that my leg was looking better and that the fever and infection seemed to be slowly subsiding. Good news, but I remember thinking, \u201cBut why did this happen and how are you planning to stop it? Why won\u2019t anybody just talk to me?\u201d\n\nWhen I was released, my leg was infection-free and the swelling had gone down. I have since followed up with a number of different dermatologists to be sure the cancer doesn\u2019t return. It hasn\u2019t.\n\nOverall, I feel incredibly lucky. I had a ticking time bomb in my leg and it was defused and removed by a caring and competent group of people.\n\nBut five years later I\u2019m still haunted by conversations I didn\u2019t have. If I had been admitted to the hospital while my wound was open, would I have been in less pain? If another surgeon had been consulted, would the closing process have gone more smoothly? Could a vascular surgeon have prevented the lymphatic fluid drainage issue?\n\nEngaging the patient in their own care requires conversations about diagnoses, treatments and possible outcomes, says Lucian Leape of Harvard. This isn\u2019t always easy. It takes time, and requires physicians to give up some control and allow patients to direct their own care.\n\n\u201cInformed decision-making is the most obvious place where there\u2019s a real need for improvement in patient engagement,\u201d Leape said. \u201cCategorically, we do a crappy job of it.\u201d\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming, he said, that an informed patient, who is consulted on their own care, makes different decisions than a passive patient. \u201cAnd, the presumption is those are the more appropriate decisions because they\u2019re the ones that fit with [the patient\u2019s] values,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have fewer procedures; that is, they\u2019re more likely to opt for non-surgical or non-invasive things.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m a chatty person. I am curious, I love to ask questions and I have no filter whatsoever. And when I\u2019m in a doctor\u2019s office, I lose any and all physical modesty. But apparently, my brain adopts heightened security. What is it about a paper medical gown that makes me, and so many other patients, clam up?\n\nMocha with my surgeon\n\nUnlike most patients, I recently got a chance to speak at length with my surgeon about what happened. In a coffee shop, in civilian clothes and drinking mochas, we sat and talked as people. My surgeon seemed just as confused as I was. \u201cWhat could have been better explained? What might have been done differently to put me at ease?\u201d\n\nI concluded that my self-inflicted lockjaw was rooted in fear. I asked some technical questions, then clammed up when it came to questions that might challenge my surgeon\u2019s decisions. But those weren\u2019t the questions I really wanted to ask anyway. In the process of sipping coffee and chatting, I realized that what I had really wanted to know was \u201cAm I going to be in a lot of pain?\u201d and \u201cWill this cancer come back?\u201d\n\nHad I asked those questions back then, the honest answers would have been \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nOn our last sips of coffee, the conversation went a bit like this: My surgeon said, \u201cWhat could I have asked that might have gotten you talking about those questions?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe something like \u2018What are your greatest fears going forward\u2026what are you afraid of?\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, those might not be great words to use\u2026fears\u2026afraid. Patients might then think they have something to be afraid of. That might actually make them more afraid. What about something like \u2018What are your concerns going forward?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but isn\u2019t that too easy a question to dodge?\u201d I asked. \u201cI mean, concerns sounds technical so I could easily start asking technical questions again, right?\u201d\n\nI started to get frustrated. If you are about to be cut open, it seems to me that \u201cfear\u201d and \u201cafraid\u201d are going to be pretty common words floating in your head, and maybe that common vocabulary is needed to coax a patient out of their self-created muzzle.\n\nThen it hit me: Despite the mental pedestals we put them on, doctors are just people. They wear cargo shorts and running T-shirts and they drink mochas, and they are afraid too.\n\nNobody likes to tell someone that it\u2019s going to hurt. Nobody wants to admit they don\u2019t know something.\n\nConversation deficit disorder\n\nJo Shapiro, director of the Center for Professionalism and Peer Support (CPPS) at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, calls this \u201cconversation deficit disorder:\u201d To avoid emotional questions with blunt and sometimes unsatisfying answers, doctors often prefer to stick to technical information.\n\n\u201cThey just failed to have the series of conversations you needed,\u201d she said, in a recent interview.\n\nDr. Shapiro believes that the key to improving doctor-patient communication is peer support for the clinicians. \u201cIf you don\u2019t support the clinician, then that clinician can\u2019t really be present in that compassionate, transparent way,\u201d she said.\n\nAt Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Dr. Shapiro\u2019s center is part of a pilot program that aims to make sure colleagues are available to talk when a doctor faces a difficult conversation with a patient. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to support each other in the medical community so that, as clinicians, we can support the patient. We have to do right by the patient, even in a society that doesn\u2019t do right by us,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s from the doctor\u2019s point of view. So how can we patients get more comfortable in a doctor\u2019s office? How can we shake off the fear of what a doctor might say, and ask what we really want to know?\n\n\u201cPractice,\u201d says Dr. Zackary Berger, an internist at Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center and author of the recently published \u201cTalking to Your Doctor: A Patient\u2019s Guide to Communication in the Exam Room and Beyond.\u201d\n\nOne suggestion for a visit to a primary care doctor, Dr. Berger said in an email, is to \u201cframe symptoms in a narrative,\u201d a coherent story that is easy to understand and \u201ccan elicit sympathy (which matters for doctors, like everyone else.)\u201d\n\nDr. Berger says the doctor-patient relationship is like any relationship. It requires work. \u201cEmotions play a huge and unrecognized role in the visit,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPhysicians (and nurses) have emotions, too. Recognizing your own emotions, and how they interact with your doctor\u2019s, can help avoid misunderstandings.\u201d\n\nSo essentially, in my surgeon\u2019s office, five years ago, you had two people who were happy to have a conversation, but scared to initiate it. And I imagine that\u2019s the situation in doctors\u2019 offices all over the country.\n\nWhen I go to a doctor\u2019s appointment now \u2014 any doctor\u2019s appointment \u2014 I try to picture a paper gown on my brain, as well as my body. When the doctor says, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s drop that and take a look,\u201d they both have to come down.\n\nReaders, reactions?
