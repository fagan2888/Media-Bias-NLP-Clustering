In the 18-64 age group, the rate of uninsured dropped to 12.9% from 16.3% the previous year.\n\nDuring the same time, however, 36.2% of people under age 65 were enrolled in an HDHP. From 2010 through September 2015, the percentage of people enrolled in HDHPs grew from 17.6% to 23.1%, while the percentage enrolled in consumer-directed health plans \u2014 HDHPs with a health savings account \u2014 grew from 7.7% to 13.2%.\n\nThe change in HDHP growth between 2014 and 2015, however, was essentially flat.\n\nHospitals are reporting rising rates of bad debt.
