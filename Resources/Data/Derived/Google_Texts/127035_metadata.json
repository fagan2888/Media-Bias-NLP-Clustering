Graffiti and tattoos are both considered forms of drawings or inscriptions outside of an archeological context \u2014 graffiti falling somewhat into a social nature, with tattoos being more personal.\n\nWhat do tattoos and graffiti have in common? Graffiti and tattoos share a kinship due to both being forms of advertising. They are begot from a desire or need to make a personal statement or be recognized or acknowledged in a manner synonymous with wearing of a uniform or badge \u2014 an elevation of pseudo importance.\n\nBut, would you place graffiti on a new car or similar investment? Not likely. It could be very expensive to eradicate. Besides, it would devalue one\u2019s property, not to mention that people might consider one daft. Yet, some people will put graffiti on a more valued commodity. They write or draw on a gift that comes along but once in a lifetime \u2014 their body!\n\nAn automobile can be cleaned, repainted or replaced. But removal of a body tattoo is a difficult and painful process and can never be effectively removed 100 percent. A laser tool, used for tattoo erasing, can only attempt to remove tattoo ink. One\u2019s skin will always show the effects of tattoo needle scarring.\n\nTypically, graffiti and tattoos are outlets for those whom are expressing disdain, dissatisfaction, rebellion or hurt in their life \u2014 usually against authority or something in life or society with which they cannot effectively cope with. People whom are driven to these extreme forms of expression are attempting to make their point of view known the only way they know how in order to get recognition, importance and satisfaction.\n\nYet, some people whom indulge in graffiti or tattoos don\u2019t fit this profile. It\u2019s called, the \u201cmonkey see, monkey do\u201d syndrome \u2014 or just being copy cat, faddish or simply foolish. It\u2019s found among the uninformed and/or impulsive \u2014 usually naive young people. They do these things simply to get attention \u2014 seeking acceptance and approval, usually from among one\u2019s peers, or are simply \u201cshowing off,\u201d believing they are \u201cwith it\u201d \u2014 trying to be \u201ccool\u201d or different.\n\nAlso, of late, a practice called \u201cbody art\u201d is coming into the limelight. Body art is simply another name for tattooing \u2014 a defacing, denigration and devaluating of the human body. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe most foolish act of graffiti is placing a tattoo on a child. Tattooing a child is considered outrageous and mindless \u2014 synonymous with rape \u2014 violation of an innocent persons body. One who would do this is likely grossly immature, irresponsible and/or mentally deficient.\n\nDefaming the human body with tattooing is no different than writing graffiti on a fence or a building wall. The perpetrator likely possess little or no appreciation or regard for human values and lives in a world of their own making, in which human life and property worth are awarded lessened appeal, stature and most important, respect.\n\nThe bottom line: Desecration or defamation of one\u2019s body, in any fashion or manner, is an act of impiety (violation of nature). This degradation of respect for living things, whether for commercial and/or selfish interests, whether it be called tattooing, body art or graffiti, is never acceptable. Human nature tends to distance itself from people whom show such low respect and little value for one\u2019s body.\n\nBurke Sloan Nelson\n\nExeter\n\nRead or Share this story: http://vtd-tar.co/1pgFtkQ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Commentary by Burke Sloan Nelson", "og": {"site_name": "Visalia Times-Delta and Tulare Advance-Register", "description": "Commentary by Burke Sloan Nelson", "title": "Tattoos are graffiti, desecration", "url": "http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/opinion/2014/09/26/tattoos-graffiti-desecration/16265749/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/visaliatimesdelta.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Commentary by Burke Sloan Nelson", "title": "Tattoos are graffiti, desecration", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4163c00ee8d9df5701c6c8b6ea925bb4155c2ad5/c=122-0-605-483&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Visalia/2014/09/26/178442620.jpg", "creator": "@vtdnews", "site": "@vtdnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=870529059", "fb": {"app_id": 148799741837669}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Graffiti and tattoos are both considered forms of drawings or inscriptions outside of an archeological context \u2014 graffiti falling somewhat into a social nature, with tattoos being more personal.\nGraffiti and tattoos share a kinship due to both being forms of advertising.\nThe bottom line: Desecration or defamation of one\u2019s body, in any fashion or manner, is an act of impiety (violation of nature).\nDefaming the human body with tattooing is no different than writing graffiti on a fence or a building wall.\nThis degradation of respect for living things, whether for commercial and/or selfish interests, whether it be called tattooing, body art or graffiti, is never acceptable."}
