A group of Owensboro Catholic High School students were left stranded on the Pennsylvania Turnpike because of Winter Storm Jonas Saturday.

We’re told the 37 students and 10 chaperones spent more than 19 hours on a charter bus taking them from the March of Life in Washington, D.C. to their hotel in Somerset, Pennsylvania.

The group was one exit away from their hotel when two semis jack knifed in front of them, closing down the turnpike. That’s when the snow moved in and they were trapped.

Since their charter bus was equipped with a bathroom, food and water, they let other stranded drivers hop aboard if they ran out of gas.

After 19 hours, the National Guard came through and the bus got moving again.
