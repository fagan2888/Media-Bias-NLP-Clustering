(Photo: Rachel Mummey/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nThere are two ways to win the Iowa caucuses. One is to get more votes than everybody else. The other is to beat that ever-changing and ephemeral opponent called Expectations.\n\nExpectations are, for the most part, whatever the media say they are. It\u2019s also up to the media to decide whether any given candidate cleared that invisible bar.\n\nSometimes, the actual winner of the caucuses is not the candidate who gets the most points, but the one who beats Expectations. That was the case in 1996, for example, when conservative pundit Pat Buchanan came in a close second to caucus winner Bob Dole. Buchanan beat Expectations and went on to win the New Hampshire primary.\n\nIn the Iowa caucuses, polls taken more than two weeks before the votes are counted are still poor predictors of the actual results. The Expectations game, however, is based almost entirely on polls \u2014 with a few caveats and provisos about ground organization, debates and advertising.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at the new Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll through the lens of Expectations in the Republican presidential race.\n\nThe poll shows a 3 percentage-point race between Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, which raises the stakes for both candidates. No other candidate is within 10 points of the leader. In a close, two-man race, whoever doesn\u2019t win is the loser.\n\nMORE FROM IOWA POLL:\n\nOne could argue that Expectations are so high for Cruz he may need oxygen. He has led two Des Moines Register Iowa Polls in a row, a rare feat in this volatile GOP race. He has corralled support from the most prized coalitions of GOP voters: the very conservative, seniors, born-again Christians and evangelical conservatives. He has endorsements from Congressman Steve King and religious-conservative leader Bob Vander Plaats. Conservative and mainstream Republican activists and opinion leaders have predicted a Cruz victory.\n\nTrump is an unconventional politician with an unconventional base of support. He leads Cruz with first-time caucusgoers and people who say disrupting government is the most important factor in choosing a candidate. He leads Cruz with people who make more than $100,000 a year. Interestingly, he also leads Cruz with people who call themselves moderate and identify with the GOP mainstream. No candidate has a larger share of voters who have made up their minds than Trump.\n\nTrump has shown the rare ability to both inflate his own Expectations \u2014 they\u2019re HUUUUGE \u2014 and defy them at the same time. Trump\u2019s unceasing focus on polls and his endless braggadocio invite his supporters to expect a landslide. Anything less would be a disaster! Terrible! Trump would get little extra boost from a come-from-behind win because he\u2019s not casting himself as an underdog.\n\nHaving said that, Trump has gleefully stymied much smarter political minds than mine by consistently gaining from situations that would sink most candidates. Trump sticks his foot in his mouth and comes away acting like he\u2019s been dining on filet mignon. So maybe he could sell a caucus loss as the most cunning victory ever.\n\nThere are some limited opportunities for whoever comes in third place to be Iowa\u2019s E-winner. In the new poll, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson are just 1 percentage point apart. If Rubio nabs third place, he will have beaten a one-time national front-runner in Carson for one of the traditional \u201cthree tickets\u201d out of Iowa. He\u2019ll also be the only candidate generally classified as a \u201cmainstream\u201d or establishment choice in the top three, ahead of Jeb Bush and Chris Christie.\n\nCarson, however, who led polls in Iowa last fall, would need to finish higher than third place to get a boost. He doesn\u2019t have to win, but beating Trump would be a rocket ship for this outsider, anti-establishment candidate.\n\nAfter fourth place, there may be a few Expectation points awarded for any mainstream candidate that beats Bush. Christie has the best shot at that consolation prize, but John Kasich would also be in the running. Otherwise, the question most candidates will have to answer is why they\u2019re still in the race.\n\nThe Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll of 500 likely Republican caucusgoers was taken Jan. 7-10 by Selzer & Co. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.\n\nMORE CAUCUSES:\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1PaTb4I", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Can any Republican win the caucuses without actually winning?", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Can any Republican win the caucuses without actually winning?", "title": "Obradovich: Latest poll sets caucus expectations", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/kathie-obradovich/caucus/2016/01/13/obradovich-latest-poll-sets-caucus-expectations-iowa/78703092/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Can any Republican win the caucuses without actually winning?", "title": "Obradovich: Latest poll sets caucus expectations", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4e06aaba79b63bec3711fedb22a4879f9b3998a2/c=500-0-2500-2000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/07/IAGroup/DesMoines/635877761465048164-160107-cruz01-RM.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Topics/Iowa Poll", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Topics/Iowa Poll", "title": "Obradovich: Latest poll sets caucus expectations", "author": "Kathie Obradovich", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/kathie-obradovich/caucus", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7693856023716441bc41369055bedd0168e81635/c=750-0-2250-2000/local/-/media/2016/01/07/IAGroup/DesMoines/635877761465048164-160107-cruz01-RM.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e47265371f176e1ca60045acf5227a963f0f1c0e/c=500-0-2500-2000/local/-/media/2016/01/07/IAGroup/DesMoines/635877761465048164-160107-cruz01-RM.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67d77b70969a0c005d4a65ab900483945262d9b8/c=170-0-2830-2000/local/-/media/2016/01/07/IAGroup/DesMoines/635877761465048164-160107-cruz01-RM.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dcf7a5e162ecaf424bb786a3bfcd0eb1be1097de/c=0-153-3000-1848&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/01/07/IAGroup/DesMoines/635877761465048164-160107-cruz01-RM.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-13T05:12:17.497000-06:00", "shorthed": "Obradovich: Latest poll sets caucus expectations", "articleid": 78703092, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/514922ee78c25e2bb90a92cf29ab3e31e5542750/c=0-153-3000-1848/local/-/media/2016/01/07/IAGroup/DesMoines/635877761465048164-160107-cruz01-RM.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3872b571009e7a9e89ec6cb5deb3c24074565c3a/c=940-0-2060-2000/local/-/media/2016/01/07/IAGroup/DesMoines/635877761465048164-160107-cruz01-RM.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll of 500 likely Republican caucusgoers was taken Jan. 7-10 by Selzer & Co.\nSo let\u2019s look at the new Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll through the lens of Expectations in the Republican presidential race.\nHe has led two Des Moines Register Iowa Polls in a row, a rare feat in this volatile GOP race.\nAfter fourth place, there may be a few Expectation points awarded for any mainstream candidate that beats Bush.\nThe poll shows a 3 percentage-point race between Sen.
