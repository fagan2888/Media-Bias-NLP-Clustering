Jim McDermott, who has been representing the 7th Congressional District for 27 years.\n\nOnly six of the nine candidates were able to make it to the first televised debate of the race: state Sen. Pramila Jayapal; former Burien mayor Arun Jhaveri; current King County Council chair Joe McDermott; independent candidate Leslie Regier; political adviser Don Rivers; and state Rep. Brady Pi\u00f1ero Walkinshaw .\n\nAll candidates excluding Regier, who has no preference, prefer the Democratic Party.\n\nThe debate was moderated by KCTS 9 producer and anchor Enrique Cerna, KCTS 9 political analyst and editorial adviser Joni Balter, and managing editor Drew Atkins of Crosscut, a nonprofit news organization.\n\nThroughout the debate, candidates had one minute to respond to questions on pressing domestic and international issues.\n\nA few of the domestic issues discussed concerned addressing gun violence, undocumented immigrants, the Black Lives Matter movement, accessible public health care, the Islamic state, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and using private corporations for campaign financing.\n\nThe Affordable Health Care Act was brought up during the discussion on health care, and the majority of the candidates agreed that, while the act was a good step in the right direction, it needs revision and improvement to meet the needs of all Americans.\n\n\u201cHealth care is a human right,\u201d Walkinshaw said. \u201cReproduction rights are a human right.\u201d\n\nThe candidates also explicitly agreed that candidates running for political positions should not accept contributions from private sponsors in order to prevent political corruption.\n\n\u201cI have not taken any money from corporate PACs,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cOver 30,000 people contribute to my funding and 96 percent of them have given under $100 each. Citizens United needs to be overturned and campaigns should rely on public financing.\u201d\n\nRegarding the Black Lives Matter movement, the candidates were asked whether black lives or all lives matter.\n\nRivers, Jayapal, McDermott, and Walkinshaw stressed that black lives matter, and highlighted how institutionalized racism and discrimination play a key role in the existing policies that do not support African-Americans.\n\n\u201cIf you are an African-American child at age 2, you are already discriminated [against],\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cThey are basing the futures of African-Americans off third grade test scores. That is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Black Lives Matter movement is not only a movement about the value of lives,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cBut also a movement to recognize the institutional racism we need to abolish in America along with the school-to-prison pipeline.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Jhaveri and Regier were hesitant to disagree with the statement that all lives matter.\n\n\u201cTrans lives matter, police lives matter,\u201d Regier said. \u201cIf I keep going, we\u2019re eventually going to end with all lives matter.\u201d\n\nWhile the candidates shared similar responses, their priorities for policy are evidently different. McDermott and Jayapal focus on issues regarding social and labor inequities; Jhaveri focuses on cost-effectiveness in budget utilization; and Walkinshaw focuses on addressing global climate change.\n\nThe debate will be broadcast on KCTS 9 on June 1 at 7 p.m.\n\nReach reporter Yemas Ly at news@dailyuw.com.
