Rodney Davis of Illinois said.\n\nPrevious story: President Obama touts benefits of immigration in Nashville\n\n\u201cIn the coming days, the House will also act on legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, and to restore the 40-hour workweek for middle class families,\u201d Davis said in the GOP weekly address.\n\nRepublicans have also talked of voting again to repeal or modify the Affordable Care Act, block Obama\u2019s immigration executive action, and enact a new round of sanctions on Iran.\n\n\u201cIf the president is willing to work with us, we\u2019ll have a real chance to address our nation\u2019s most pressing challenges,\u201d Davis said.\n\nObama has said he\u2019s optimistic about finding some common ground with a Republican Congress, but will also act to aggressively defend his legislative achievements using his veto power.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of issues we could make progress on,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cBut the president is clear that he will not let this Congress undo important protections gained, particularly in areas of health care, Wall Street reform and the environment.\u201d\n\nThe president has only vetoed two pieces of legislation in six years. The expectation is that his pen will soon get a bit more exercise.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president plans to visit Detroit on Wednesday and Phoenix on Thursday, and then travel to Tennessee with Vice President Biden on Friday,\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id= 511297956", "og": {"site_name": "WATE 6 On Your Side", "description": "The president plans to visit Detroit on Wednesday and Phoenix on Thursday, and then travel to Tennessee with Vice President Biden on Friday, Schultz said.", "title": "President Obama to visit Knoxville Friday", "url": "http://wate.com/2015/01/03/president-obama-visits-tennessee-friday/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "https://mgtvwate.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/contentid6146b76066ecd32a630f6a7067009b00fmtjpgrolepreviewreldt2014-10-28t193633mediaphotorecordid72a67c3061414574bf5e089df2ca38f7akamaiavailabletrueitemid72a67c3061414574bf5e089df2ca38f7objfilenamepr.jpg", "height": 341}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president plans to visit Detroit on Wednesday and Phoenix on Thursday, and then travel to Tennessee with Vice President Biden on Friday, Schultz said.", "title": "President Obama to visit Knoxville Friday", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwate.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/contentid6146b76066ecd32a630f6a7067009b00fmtjpgrolepreviewreldt2014-10-28t193633mediaphotorecordid72a67c3061414574bf5e089df2ca38f7akamaiavailabletrueitemid72a67c3061414574bf5e089df2ca38f7objfilenamepr.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@6News", "site": "6news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "President Obama, Hawaii Vacation, Christmas, New Year's Tennessee, Visit, State of the Union, Vice President Joe Biden", "msapplication-tooltip": "Knoxville, TN News & Weather", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mediageneral.wate", "fb": {"pages": 112945508738113}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wate.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1d4ffc72e0fc147870ebace80df0a02a?s=16", "application-name": "WATE 6 On Your Side", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WATE6OnYourSide", "published_time": "2015-01-03T20:21:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-06T19:59:40+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "CV5oKVNQCepzG3ubMGxG21BH-llTVkuHAscpIom1HPI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Barack Obama will travel to Knoxville on Friday, according to Senator Bob Corker\u2019s office.\nThe president plans to visit Detroit on Wednesday and Phoenix on Thursday, and then travel to Tennessee with Vice President Biden on Friday, Schultz said.\nThe President\u2019s Knoxville visit will end a three-day travel blitz that officials describe as a sort of preemptive State of the Union.\nPrevious story: President Obama to visit Nashville TuesdayThe strategy is a departure from years past when the weeks ahead of the president\u2019s annual address to Congress have generally been a sleepy build-up to the nationally televised primetime unveiling of proposals.\nObama is scheduled to deliver the State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, Jan. 20."}
