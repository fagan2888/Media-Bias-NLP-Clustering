Harris Learning Village.\n\nThe garden's opening coincided with the start of the new Renaissance Farmers Market, bringing entrepreneurs like Nancy Berdanier a chance to grow their own food, while selling homemade products.\n\n\"There's nothing like that on this side of town I believe, so it's a whole new venue,\" said Berdanier.\n\nThe village has already started growing different types of vegetation, including peaches, pears, and apples. Shamplain says people throughout the community will soon be able to rent plots to grow and sell their home-grown fruits and vegetables.\n\nA.D. Harris Chef Tony Washam plans on buying as much produce from vendors to cook for the village.\n\n\"It's going to be a great journey that we're on,\" said Washam. \"We're just going to take it one day at a time. The community I'm sure is waiting for change, and that's what we're here for.\"\n\nAnd to stimulate the area's economy, with food and crafts straight from the heart.\n\n\"Sustainability knows no bounds. So that's our effort is to sustain the community,\" said Shamplain. \"We don't put boundaries on where our community is.\"\n\nThe market will be open every Sunday at the village from noon until 6pm.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many will soon be getting a new taste of Panama City.
