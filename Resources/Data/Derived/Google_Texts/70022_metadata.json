And negotiations are likely to last until the last minute.\n\n8News reporter Claudia Rupcich spoke with local works, who voiced their concerns.\n\n\u201cReally scary because we don\u2019t really know what that proposal will be,\u201d said union member Roger Wood.\n\nA new contract between the Communications Workers of America Union and Verizon that covers union members like Martin Grubb.\n\n\u201cThe company is making proposals that are outrageous, if you want to know the truth,\u201d said Grubb.\n\nVerizon is asking workers to pay more for healthcare costs, saying the company has been facing challenges with its landlines because more people are giving up home phones.\n\n\u201cThe healthcare costs at this point, for what the company is asking, could increase significantly,\u201d Grubb added. \u201cThey\u2019re wanting to freeze the pension and offer a either or \u2013 keep your pension or keep your 401K. Right now we have both, so it can impact people that are close to retirement.\u201d\n\nThose already retired could also see cuts to benefits.\n\n\u201c\u201dThey were banking on the count of dollars that they anticipated getting from retirement,\u201d said retired Verizon employee Roger Wood. \u201cBanking on the health care. Any cut to any of that would cut into the way they plan their future.\u201d\n\nEspecially for those who have been retired for 20 or 30 years.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t just go back tomorrow and get some additional dollars to get by on,\u201d Wood added.\n\nUnion members say preserving jobs is the main priority and are asking Verizon to build new fiber-optic networks in areas that lack service.\n\nThe company has seven locations in Virginia it wants to close. We want those to stay open,\u201d Grubb said. \u201cWe want them to increase the distribution of FIOS throughout the state, which will increase jobs and make a better broadband community.\u201d\n\nHarry Mitchell with Verizon Communications reached out to 8News to share a few facts about the negotiations:\n\nOn the first day of bargaining, June 22, Verizon presented union leaders with a comprehensive offer, which included salary increases over the next two years, and a bonus should we achieve new contracts before the current ones expired. Consistent with practices at other companies, pension-eligible associates would be given a choice of continuing to earn pension benefits under the defined benefit plan or opting for the enhanced 401(k) plan currently offered to management employees, with a larger company match and a profit-sharing contribution. It\u2019s important to note that, under this latter option, a participating associate\u2019s defined pension plan would remain intact. They would not lose the pension they have accumulated.\n\nThe rising cost of health care is a national challenge, for individuals and for employers of all sizes. To help address this, we asked union leadership to share our commitment to achieving meaningful cost management in health care, while continuing to provide employees and their families with access to outstanding health care. Currently, health plans for union employees and their families can cost as much as $23,000 a year and up to a staggering $37,881 for retirees. The average American worker\u2019s annual family health care plan costs about $16,800. In addition, the health care plans that cover Verizon active and retired employees are high-cost plans that qualify as \u201cCadillac plans\u201d under the Affordable Care Act. In 2018, during the term of the next contract, some of these high-cost plans are projected to trigger a 40 percent excise tax provided for by this law. This is estimated to be tens of millions of dollars. Our proposal to union leaders would ensure our employees continue to receive quality healthcare coverage, while asking them to chip in nominal amounts for individual healthcare premiums.\n\nCalls for expanded FiOS deployment and other network-related issues are not part of these negotiations. They are diversions that union leadership is hoping will give it an advantage at the bargaining table. The facts are that Verizon has invested $23 billion and deployed our all-fiber network to more than 20 million households across our service area, which includes Virginia.\n\nUnion members had decided earlier in the week that if no deal was reached, they would most likely start picketing Monday morning.\n\nVerizon officials say they are prepared for the strikes \u2013 saying they\u2019ve been training thousands of employees just in case.\n\nWe\u2019ll keep you updated on any new developments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The company is making proposals that are outrageous, if you want to know the truth,\" said one local union member.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=546021203", "og": {"site_name": "WRIC", "description": "\u201cThe company is making proposals that are outrageous, if you want to know the truth,\u201d said one local union member.", "title": "Local union members concerned as Verizon contract deadline looms", "url": "http://wric.com/2015/08/01/verizon-strike-possible-as-contract-deadline-looms/", "image": {"width": 510, "identifier": "https://mgtvwric.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/c94c9a367ce940009b9fabd7aba91c59.jpg", "height": 286}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cThe company is making proposals that are outrageous, if you want to know the truth,\u201d said one local union member.", "title": "Local union members concerned as Verizon contract deadline looms", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwric.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/c94c9a367ce940009b9fabd7aba91c59.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@8News", "site": "https://twitter.com/8NEWS", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Local News, National, News", "msapplication-tooltip": "8NEWS - WRIC | News Where You Live", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mediageneral.wric", "fb": {"pages": 54179888378}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wric.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/df39282cf6eb67f902e8c8c95cd35698?s=16", "application-name": "WRIC", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/8News", "published_time": "2015-08-01T14:18:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-03T02:35:57+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "4JVTVIu6T7ApYpmYwIYYL-f8hv25jbgKKaPFZc39M5c", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A new contract between the Communications Workers of America Union and Verizon that covers union members like Martin Grubb.\n(WRIC) \u2014 Thousands of Verizon workers across nine states \u2013 including right here in Virginia \u2013 could walk off the job tonight.\nCurrently, health plans for union employees and their families can cost as much as $23,000 a year and up to a staggering $37,881 for retirees.\nThe rising cost of health care is a national challenge, for individuals and for employers of all sizes.\nIt\u2019s important to note that, under this latter option, a participating associate\u2019s defined pension plan would remain intact."}
