JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Nearly three years have gone by and there are still no answers for a Jacksonville mother whose son was murdered in 2012.

The trail has gone cold but Lance Morene's mother, Janice Brown, refuses to give up. She organized a vigil to put the spotlight back on her son's case, hoping to turn up new clues in his death.

"Well, it'll be three years Nov. 11 and they haven't found the murderers yet. I know God knows who they are, and I want, in the memory of my son, pray, put the guns down and put more love. Go to church," Brown said.

For Brown, the mission is about more than finding her son's killer. She is pushing for an end to violence and a unified community. Brown said finding who murdered her son is her top priority.

"Hard, very hard. I work on a job 12 hours, and every day I ask God to give me strength," Brown said. "You know, I have a home, I have grandkids that I help take care of. So I'm not going to let this world say, 'It's over.'"

Morene was 23 years old when he was found dead in his Murray Hill apartment. Neighbors reported hearing several gunshots the morning of his death. Lance would have turned 26 on Friday.

Police initially searched for two men seen leaving the area, but turned up nothing.

"Well, he's not here. His body -- the remains of him -- are here, but he's in God's hands. I just feel close just to come by here, I come by here a lot. I sit with him, I read the Bible," Brown said. "I'm just a mother and I do what I did until the day God brings me home and I know that I will see him again in heaven. That's my reassurance."
