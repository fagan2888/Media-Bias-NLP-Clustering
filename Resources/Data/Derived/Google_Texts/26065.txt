FBI agents were in West New York Town Hall last week conducting an investigation, a town commissioner confirmed.

“All I know is they were conducting an investigation,” Commissioner FiorD’Aliza Frias said, adding that she believes the investigation is in a preliminary stage. “That’s all I know.”

She said she did not know where in the building the agents were poking around last Monday.

Pablo Fonseca, a spokesman for West New York Mayor Felix Roque, said that “we have no knowledge of an FBI visit, but the city is open to any requests. Mayor Roque runs a transparent government.”

Roque also said he knew nothing about a visit to Town Hall by the feds, who were unsuccessful earlier this year in prosecuting the mayor on computer hacking charges.

“They are always welcome to come in and stop by, and I’ll even give them a cup of coffee,” said Roque, whose son was convicted of a similar charge and will be sentenced next month.

Hudson County Freeholder Jose Munoz, a perennial Roque foe, said he does not believe there is an FBI agent under every bush, but that he does believe that where there is smoke there is fire.

“The Roque administration is an embarrassment to all West New York residents,” Munoz said. “Hopefully one day this lighting rod will be removed and administrative competence and trust will be returned.”

FBI spokeswoman Barbara Woodruff said yesterday afternoon that the FBI does “not comment on the existence or nonexistence of any investigation.”
