But the cost of benefits adds an additional $10.61, or 46 percent more, for a $31.65 total.\n\nIf the average Uber \u201cemployee driver\u201d only worked 20 hours per week, that would mean that the total hours worked by all 17,600 California drivers would be equal to 18,304,000 hours. Multiplying the total number of hours worked by Uber drivers in California times the average cost of benefits at $10.61 per hour implies that Uber immediately owes about $194,205,440 just for the drivers\u2019 benefits cost in 2014 alone.\n\nBut Breitbart News also revealed,one of biggest financial benefits in converting employees to contractors is slashing lawsuit exposure to what has become a myriad of expanding \u201cLegal Rights\u201d for \u201cemployee protections\u201d against discrimination and wrongful termination, along with enhanced rights to unionize, be paid overtime, and take numerous family leaves. Uber will probably be liable for another $200 million for employee liability claims, just in California in 2014.\n\nGiven that Uber has been in business in California for six-and-a-half years, the approximately $400 million Uber owes could be at least tripled to $1.2 billion\n\nUber has kept about 20 percent of customer charges for overhead and profit to operate what was supposed to be a smartphone referral app. But Uber will have to raise their costs immediately by up to another 45 percent just to cover the \u201cemployee\u201d costs. That would seem to destroy Uber\u2019s competitive advantage of being about a third cheaper than yellow taxis.\n\nUber did close a $4.8 billion venture capital deal in the last five months at a valuation of $50 billion. But it would seem that investors that put such huge venture capital pixie dust into Uber just lost a huge percentage of their principal dollars. With the economic fundamental of competitiveness basically destroyed, Uber is going to have difficulty raising any new money to stay in business, let alone contemplate growing the business.\n\nhe California Labor Commission\u2019s decision has very destructive implications for other \u201ccrowdsourced\u201d services such as Uber competitor Lyft; task service TaskRabbit; cleaning service Homejoy; plus dozens of knock-off companies like Handy, Eaze, Luxe, and Upwork.\n\nThe Labor Commission issued its ruling that San Francisco-based driver Barbara Ann Berwick was owed a liability award of $4,000 from Uber. The earlier award became visible when Uber said it will appeal the Commission\u2019s decision to the state courts.\n\nUber is also facing a federal mass tort litigation from a group of drivers in San Francisco. Earlier this year, the U.S. District Court refused to grant summary judgment and will let a jury decide if Uber\u2019s drivers should be classified as independent contractors, according to Reuters.\n\nUpdate: An Uber spokesperson contacted Breitbart News to offer this clarification:\n\nReuters\u2019 original headline was not accurate. The California Labor Commission\u2019s ruling is non-binding and applies to a single driver. Indeed it is contrary to a previous ruling by the same commission, which concluded in 2012 that the driver \u2018performed services as an independent contractor, and not as a bona fide employee.\u2019 Five other states have also come to the same conclusion. It\u2019s important to remember that the number one reason drivers choose to use Uber is because they have complete flexibility and control. The majority of them can and do choose to earn their living from multiple sources, including other ride sharing companies.\n\nThis article has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Uber May Owe Billions as Cal Labor Board says Drivers Employees", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Uber May Owe Billions as Cal Labor Board says Drivers Employees", "title": "Uber May Owe Billions as Cal Labor Board says Drivers Employees", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 455, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/uber-e1420059334124.jpeg", "height": 375}, "updated_time": "2015-06-18T14:57:04-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/18/uber-may-owe-billions-as-cal-labor-board-says-drivers-are-employees/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Uber May Owe Billions as Cal Labor Board says Drivers Employees", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/uber-e1420059334124.jpeg", "title": "Uber May Owe Billions as Cal Labor Board says Drivers Employees", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "california labor commission, contractors, sharing economy, Uber,Big Government, Breitbart California, Economics,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-06-18T05:17:48-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-06-18T14:57:04-07:00", "tag": "Uber", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd22\"", "article_summary": "Multiplying the total number of hours worked by Uber drivers in California times the average cost of benefits at $10.61 per hour implies that Uber immediately owes about $194,205,440 just for the drivers\u2019 benefits cost in 2014 alone.\nIf the average Uber \u201cemployee driver\u201d only worked 20 hours per week, that would mean that the total hours worked by all 17,600 California drivers would be equal to 18,304,000 hours.\nThe California Labor Commission\u2019s ruling is non-binding and applies to a single driver.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the number one reason drivers choose to use Uber is because they have complete flexibility and control.\nThe Labor Commission issued its ruling that San Francisco-based driver Barbara Ann Berwick was owed a liability award of $4,000 from Uber."}
