But on a recent Wednesday, the small business owners he met in Anne Arundel County were most interested in his economic proposals, such as phasing out the personal income tax over five years. After saying that Maryland would be more like Florida and Texas, one attendee visibly perked up. \u201cThat\u2019s the first smile I\u2019ve got out of him all day,\u201d Lollar joked. He says he would make up for the lost revenue by limiting the growth of state government.\n\nLollar often mentions Art Laffer\u2019s endorsement of his ideas. Laffer is a former Reagan advisor known for supply-side economics \u2013 the theory that lower taxes will generally increase economic growth. Another proposal of his is to sell health insurance across state lines, despite its complications. \u201cIt may take 2 years, it may take 4 years, it may take 6 years,\u201d he said at a GOP candidates\u2019 forum at St. Mary\u2019s College. \u201cBut you know what, another question I\u2019d ask is, how long [do you] think it\u2019s going to take before this Affordable Health Care Act [works]?\u201d\n\nSt. Mary\u2019s College political science professor Michael Cain has seen Lollar in action several times in the past few years. Lollar is from neighboring Charles County, where he chaired the GOP Central Committee. He also ran unsuccessfully for Congress against Steny Hoyer in 2010. Lollar \u201chas a particular viewpoint, [a political] viewpoint,\u201d Cain said, \u201cbut he very much enjoys interacting with people\u2026and a lot of people respond to that.\u201d\n\nAs a statewide candidate, Lollar talks a lot about the evils of partisanship. \u201cIt is the new segregation of our age,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt won't be long, if we don\u2019t stop this madness, there'll be Democrats water fountains on the left side and Republican water fountains on the right side.\u201d\n\nIn a bipartisan move, Lollar has campaigned in Baltimore City, despite the small number of Republican voters there. It\u2019s a general election strategy that GOP candidates have to play in the primaries, according to former Lt. Gov. and national GOP chairman Michael Steele. \u201cMembers of the black community are watching you as a candidate,\u201d said Steele, who is black. \u201cThey want to see how authentic you are...[That\u2019s] true for all candidates but [it\u2019s] notched up a level for a black candidate.\u201d\n\nThough Lollar\u2019s charisma is attractive to voters in both parties, the odds for winning are long. In the latest St. Mary\u2019s poll, Lollar\u2019s support did not break four percent of registered Republicans. In a state where Democrats so consistently dominate, the obvious question is, why run?\n\n\u201cI've taught my daughters that integrity is what you do when no one's looking,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me to run away and just say, you know what? I\u2019m [going to] keep my cushy executive job, I\u2019ll be fine, let somebody else worry about it? When I believe that I can make the kind of difference needed at this time? I just couldn\u2019t turn my back on it.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Michael Steele said that a candidate does need to be careful. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the perennial candidate who always loses\u2026because you don\u2019t get that many bites at the apple in Maryland, Democrat or Republican.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "\u201cMaryland\u2019s not so big until you have to travel it just about every day,\u201d said Republican gubernatorial candidate Charles Lollar on the campaign trail", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.wypr.org/post/lollar-hopes-defy-odds-gubernatorial-bid", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wypr/files/styles/medium/public/201405/100_9368.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "\u201cMaryland\u2019s not so big until you have to travel it just about every day,\u201d said Republican gubernatorial candidate Charles Lollar on the campaign trail", "title": "Lollar Hopes to Defy The Odds With Gubernatorial Bid"}, "story_id": 314231632, "twitter": {"site": "@WYPR881FM", "card": "summary", "creator": "@bretjaspers"}, "author": "Bret Jaspers", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Lollar Hopes to Defy The Odds With Gubernatorial Bid"}, "nid": 29502, "datePublished": "2014-05-20", "keywords": "Election 2014, politics, WYPR News, Charles Lollar", "wordCount": 758, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Lollar Hopes to Defy The Odds With Gubernatorial Bid\u201cMaryland\u2019s not so big until you have to travel it just about every day,\u201d said Republican gubernatorial candidate Charles Lollar on the campaign trail recently.\nI just couldn\u2019t turn my back on it.\u201dFor his part, Michael Steele said that a candidate does need to be careful.\nLollar \u201chas a particular viewpoint, [a political] viewpoint,\u201d Cain said, \u201cbut he very much enjoys interacting with people\u2026and a lot of people respond to that.\u201dAs a statewide candidate, Lollar talks a lot about the evils of partisanship.\nand national GOP chairman Michael Steele.\nLollar is crisscrossing the state to get his message out (and raise money) ahead of the primary election on June 24th (early voting begins June 12th)."}
