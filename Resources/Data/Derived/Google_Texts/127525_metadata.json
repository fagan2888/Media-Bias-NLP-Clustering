In a speech Saturday to a crowd of about 6,000 at the MassMutual Center, the U.S. senator from Vermont addressed an issue he hasn\u2019t talked about much: gun control.\n\nIt was an enthusiastic crowd that greeted Bernie Sanders. Even he was impressed.\n\n\u201cSpringfield, thank you! What a crowd!\u201d Sanders said, clapping.\n\nSanders told his supporters his campaign is different from others -- and much bigger than himself.\n\n\u201cIt is a grassroots campaign designed not only to elect someone to president of the United States but to build a political movement,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders addressed a number of his key issues in the hour-long speech: unemployment, tuition-free public universities, and public funding for political campaigns.\n\n\u201cI want anybody in this room or anyplace in the America who feels strongly about public service\u2026I want you to be able to run for office without having to beg wealthy people for campaign contributions,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders also talked about something he usually only addresses when asked directly: gun control. In the past, his voting record on guns has been mixed. He voted against the Brady Bill, but he also voted for an assault weapons ban and in 2013 for universal background checks.\n\nReferencing the mass shooting in Oregon, Sanders said he\u2019s sick and tired of seeing people shot down and slaughtered.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do it to is bring our people together to stop the shouting, to pass sensible gun control legislation,\u201d he said, to a roar of applause.\n\nSanders\u2019s comments spoke to Martin Jones, 46, a jazz musician from Northampton. Jones said the speech made him feel no one should doubt Sanders\u2019s electability.\n\n\u201cIt was inspiring and energizing,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd most of all, he is authentic and believable.\u201d\n\nEileen Wilkinson, 70, said she was glad to hear Sanders stick up for social security and health care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to seeing him elected and I believe he can do it,\u201d she said.\n\nSanders\u2019s visit came two days after his Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, came to the area. She held no public events in western Massachusetts, but had a fundraiser in Holyoke.\n\nThis report was originally published at New England Public Radio.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Bernie Sanders brought his campaign for the presidency to Massachusetts this weekend, speaking in Boston and Springfield.
