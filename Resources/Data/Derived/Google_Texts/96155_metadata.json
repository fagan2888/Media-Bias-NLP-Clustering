That is the consideration most likely to resonate with hospitals and insurers.\n\n\u201cThere is a danger if we only talk about our clients,\u201d Gauthier said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lose the other stakeholders in the conversation because they will not make the connection that mental health or substance abuse is a co-occurring condition with other medical conditions. If you think in terms of \u2018multiple chronic conditions,\u2019 then you cover a lot more ground in your conversations.\u201d\n\nHe recommends that providers learn to speak the language of other stakeholders and play a role in population health initiatives.\n\nWhat is population health?\n\nAccording to Gauthier, population health is the systematic effort to improve the health of a subpopulation. For example, pregnant women with Medicaid coverage in one neighborhood in St. Louis would be considered a subpopulation, and to improve their total health, care coordination and safe housing would be imperative.\n\nThe reason why population health is increasingly becoming a touchpoint for medical providers is because the Affordable Care Act, the accountable care movement and other policies are driving them toward it\u2014not just for quality reasons but for payment reasons as well. And clearly, behavioral health is part of that outlook.\n\nWhere behavioral health fits\n\nBehavioral providers must reconcile their own strategic vision and begin integrating with other stakeholders. It\u2019s inevitable, Gauthier said. Otherwise, the medical provider organizations will quickly develop their own expertise\u2014possibly recruiting your own staff away from you\u2014and become a competitor with far more capital and much better resources. An accountable care organization (ACO) with a superior in-house behavioral health unit would be hard to compete against.\n\n\u201cEighty-six percent of ACOs are doing their own behavioral healthcare right now,\u201d Gauthier said.\n\nThe better option is to become a partner at the table, promoting the obvious value of behavioral health in today\u2019s population-focused system. He recommended groups of existing providers band together and consider becoming a management services organization (MSO)\u2014a collection of providers that are independent businesses but that share resources for administrative, operational and/or infrastructure needs that are outside of clinical care. Gauthier said solo primary care practices did the same thing 20 years ago, and now they are playing at the table with large hospitals and ACOs.\n\n\u201cI believe it will be 10 to 20 years before we can make the culture change and feel like we are sitting together as behavioral healthcare providers with our medical counterparts and we all belong, once and for all, to the same culture,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "article_summary": "According to Gauthier, population health is the systematic effort to improve the health of a subpopulation.\nWhat is population health?\nAn accountable care organization (ACO) with a superior in-house behavioral health unit would be hard to compete against.\nThe better option is to become a partner at the table, promoting the obvious value of behavioral health in today\u2019s population-focused system.\nAnd clearly, behavioral health is part of that outlook."}
