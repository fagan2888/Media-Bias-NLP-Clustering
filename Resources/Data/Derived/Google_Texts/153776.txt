The combined supply chain company VHA-UHC has changed its name to Vizient following the merger earlier this year by the two firms.

Vizient Inc., which becomes official on Jan. 1, 2016, will provide services to close to 30 percent of U.S. hospitals, including nearly all academic medical centers and health systems, the company said in a statement.

The merger includes Novation, the healthcare services company VHA and UHC already jointly owned.

On April 1, the supply chain management company VHA merged with UHC, the alliance of leading academic medical centers, to create among largest member-owned healthcare companies in the nation.

"In bringing the companies together we are able to more quickly connect members with the knowledge, solutions and expertise necessary to accelerate their performance," said CEO and President Curt Nonomaque in a statement. "We recognize that the ever increasing demands in our country to improve healthcare performance require advanced thinking, smarter analytics and collaboration to drive best practices."

The company, headquartered in Irving, Texas, serves more than 5,200 health system members and affiliates as well as 118,000 non-acute healthcare customers, and represents more than $50 billion in annual purchasing volume.
