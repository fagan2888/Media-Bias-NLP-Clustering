There were also some surprising hits this year, such as a 3-foot-tall teddy bear that sold out within minutes at many Target stores.\n\nThe initial Black Friday sales reports began trickling in Friday, but the final numbers won\u2019t be in until later this weekend. That\u2019s when retailers will get a better handle on how discounts earlier in November impacted sales on Thanksgiving and the actual Black Friday as well as the extent to which online sales sapped away some of the traffic from physical stores.\n\nRetailers put more of their so-called \u201cdoorbuster deals\u201d online this year, leading to some hiccups as online traffic overwhelmed some sites.\n\nNeiman Marcus\u2019 website was down for several hours on Friday. And some disgruntled online shoppers took to Twitter on Thanksgiving morning to complain that they were having trouble buying some items from Walmart.com.\n\nA manageable crowd of shoppers descended on the Mall of America for Black Friday morning in Bloomington November 27, 2015.\n\nRavi Jariwala, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said some shoppers did experience some slowness on its site as the doorbusters were released around 2 a.m. Thursday. This year, he noted, the company put 96 percent of its doorbuster deals online, up from about 90 percent last year.\n\n\u201cLiterally as those items went live on the site, we saw an incredible surge in traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is the vast majority of customers were able to check out successfully.\u201d\n\nWalmart.com sold out of a 10-foot Skywalker trampoline and a Nintendo 3DS in the first half-hour they went on sale online, he said.\n\nLast year, Best Buy had to take its website offline several times on Black Friday due to a surge in traffic from mobile devices. This year, the Richfield-based retailer had a much smoother experience. Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly noted that the company has been working hard in the last year to handle the higher traffic loads.\n\nMinneapolis-based Target Corp., whose website nearly crashed during the launch of its Lilly Pulitzer designer collaboration earlier this year, has increased its mobile app\u2019s capacity to handle traffic sevenfold since last year. On Thursday night, CEO Brian Cornell told reporters that Target.com had not had any issues.\n\nCornell, who spent Thanksgiving night in stores in New Jersey and New York, also said traffic appeared to be very strong in stores for the retailer\u2019s 6 p.m. store opening. Big-screen TVs, other electronics such as the Apple Watch and iPads helped drive some of that traffic.\n\nTarget said Friday that Thanksgiving Day was its biggest day of online sales to date, driven largely by electronics. Its top-selling product online was the Nintendo Wii U.\n\nAdobe, which monitors online sales, said digital retail sales overall were on track to be up 22 percent over last Thanksgiving Day and likely exceeded $1.7 billion. But that also meant out-of-stock rates were more than double the normal level.\n\n\u201cOut of stock is an even bigger problem today than we expected,\u201d Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst for Adobe Digital Index, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nMatthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation (NRF), said Friday that there were reports around the U.S. of long lines outside of stores on Thanksgiving night and of record-breaking online sales.\n\nNearly 60 percent of shoppers \u2014 or 136 million people \u2014 were expected to shop between Thanksgiving Day and Sunday, according to the NRF. Those numbers are roughly in line with last year.\n\nWhile many commentators have been proclaiming the death of brick-and-mortar stores, Charlie O\u2019Shea, an analyst with Moody\u2019s, said Black Friday highlights how important the in-store shopping experience still is for many shoppers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of shoppers that don\u2019t shop online,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a lot of people like to go to the stores \u2014 the thrill of the chase, the thrill of the hunt.\u201d\n\nOne of those shoppers was Travis Campbell, of Minneapolis, who waited in line for three hours outside the Best Buy in Minnetonka to buy a 48-inch Samsung TV. He knew he could have bought it online.\n\n\u201cBut I wanted to get it in my hands the day of,\u201d he said.\n\nA manageable crowd of shoppers descended on the Mall of America for Black Friday morning in Bloomington November 27, 2015.\n\nStaff writer Mike Hughlett contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "&nbsp;.", "title": "Big-screen TVs, iPads and gaming consoles were top sellers on Thanksgiving", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/ipads-big-screen-tvs-and-gaming-consoles-were-top-sellers-on-thanksgiving/355907221/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144867743670676.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144867743670676.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "&nbsp;.", "title": "Big-screen TVs, iPads and gaming consoles were top sellers on Thanksgiving", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/ipads-big-screen-tvs-and-gaming-consoles-were-top-sellers-on-thanksgiving/355907221/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144867743670676.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144867743670676.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "&nbsp;."}, "article_summary": "Target said Friday that Thanksgiving Day was its biggest day of online sales to date, driven largely by electronics.\nRetailers put more of their so-called \u201cdoorbuster deals\u201d online this year, leading to some hiccups as online traffic overwhelmed some sites.\nNearly 60 percent of shoppers \u2014 or 136 million people \u2014 were expected to shop between Thanksgiving Day and Sunday, according to the NRF.\nAnd some disgruntled online shoppers took to Twitter on Thanksgiving morning to complain that they were having trouble buying some items from Walmart.com.\nBig-screen TVs, other electronics such as the Apple Watch and iPads helped drive some of that traffic."}
