Bush\u2019s in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. So little wonder that after spending weeks denying he had promised Americans they could keep their health plans, President Obama finally said the words \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear: He didn\u2019t really apologize.\n\nLook closely at what Obama actually said: He did not apologize for misleading the American people. And he did not apologize for people losing the plans he promised they could keep. He apologized that they can\u2019t get into Obamacare.\n\nBig difference.\n\nObama said, \u201cI am sorry that they, you know, are finding themselves in this situation, based on assurances they got from me.\u201d Well, what situation is that, Mr. President? The situation that they can\u2019t access the Obamacare exchanges. The president went on to say, \u201cKeep in mind that most of the folks who got these cancellation letters, they\u2019ll be able to get better care at the same cost or cheaper in these new marketplaces. . . . The majority of folks will end up being better off, of course. Because the Web site\u2019s not working right, they don\u2019t necessarily know it.\u201d\n\nSo if you\u2019re one of the 4.8 million people (and counting) who\u2019ve lost their health insurance, congratulations! President Obama thinks you\u2019re better off \u2014 you just don\u2019t know it yet.\n\nThe problem, in Obama\u2019s telling, isn\u2019t that Americans can\u2019t keep the plans they like \u2014 the plans he promised they could keep. The problem is that because the Healthcare.gov Web site does not work, they just can\u2019t see how much better Obamacare really is.\n\nHis non-apology apology is revealing, because it underscores what his administration\u2019s 2010 regulations proved \u2014 that his plan all along was to forced millions of Americans out of the individual market and into Obamacare. He needs those people in the exchanges because most of them are healthy and don\u2019t use a lot of services \u2014 and he needs them to join Obamacare so they can subsidize the poor and the sick. His plan all along was to force a seamless, involuntary transfer of millions out of the individual market into the exchanges.\n\nBut the White House did not anticipate that the Web site would fail. That\u2019s what the president is \u201csorry\u201d about. He\u2019s not sorry you lost your plan. He\u2019s not sorry he lied. He\u2019s sorry you can\u2019t get Obamacare.\n\nNow Obama faces a disaster of his own making: Millions of Americans are losing their insurance on Jan. 1 and can\u2019t get or afford replacement coverage. So in his interview, Obama hinted at a proposed \u201csolution\u201d \u2014 taxpayer-funded premium subsidies for people who are losing their insurance.\n\nSorry, Mr. President, but premium subsidies won\u2019t fix this mess. For one thing, premium subsidies don\u2019t help if your deductible is doubling. And premium subsidies won\u2019t help if you are losing your doctor. Remember, Obama\u2019s promise wasn\u2019t just that you could keep your plan \u2014 it was that you could keep your doctor. Well a taxpayer subsidy isn\u2019t going to bring your doctor back.\n\nAnd even if those problems could be overcome, why should taxpayers get stuck with the bill for Obama\u2019s dishonesty? Millions who were happy with their insurance, and happy to pay for it on their own, are now losing those plans because of Obamacare. They now face huge premium increases they cannot afford, because Obamacare mandates coverage for all sorts of things they don\u2019t want or need, such as maternity care, pediatric care and substance abuse services.\n\nAnd Obama\u2019s ingenious solution is more taxpayer subsidies? Already, in the Obamacare exchanges lower-income people were going to get premium subsidies to pay for coverage they don\u2019t want or need. Now middle-income people are going to get premium subsidies to pay for coverage they don\u2019t want or need? Pure genius.\n\nSo millions of Americans get to lose the plans they liked, and lose the doctors they liked \u2014 and taxpayers will lose their shirt on top of it all.\n\nIn his interview, the president declared that when he said Americans could keep their plans, \u201cI meant what I said.\u201d No he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t say, \u201cYes, you\u2019ll lose your plan, but we\u2019ll give you a better one.\u201d He didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou can keep your plan so long as it is not sub-par.\u201d He said, \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan. Period.\u201d\n\nObama didn\u2019t apologize. And he didn\u2019t offer a workable solution to the mess he created. Until he does both, he\u2019s not going to recover the trust of the American people.\n\nRead more from Marc Thiessen\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He\u2019s not sorry people are losing their plans.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "He\u2019s not sorry people are losing their plans.", "title": "Marc Thiessen: Obama\u2019s non-apology on Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/marc-thiessen-obamas-non-apology-on-obamacare/2013/11/11/28f207ce-4ad0-11e3-ac54-aa84301ced81_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/11/Editorial-Opinion/Images/TS-Was8056032-2061.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marcthiessen"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/marc-thiessen-obamas-non-apology-on-obamacare/2013/11/11/28f207ce-4ad0-11e3-ac54-aa84301ced81_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Marc Thiessen, obamacare, obama lie, affordable care act, health insurance, obama apology, losing health plan, premium subsidies, healthcare.gov, health coverage", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen"}, "eomportal-uuid": "28f207ce-4ad0-11e3-ac54-aa84301ced81", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Marc Thiessen, obamacare, obama lie, affordable care act, health insurance, obama apology, losing health plan, premium subsidies, healthcare.gov, health coverage"}, "article_summary": "The problem, in Obama\u2019s telling, isn\u2019t that Americans can\u2019t keep the plans they like \u2014 the plans he promised they could keep.\nSo in his interview, Obama hinted at a proposed \u201csolution\u201d \u2014 taxpayer-funded premium subsidies for people who are losing their insurance.\nFor one thing, premium subsidies don\u2019t help if your deductible is doubling.\nAlready, in the Obamacare exchanges lower-income people were going to get premium subsidies to pay for coverage they don\u2019t want or need.\nAnd premium subsidies won\u2019t help if you are losing your doctor."}
