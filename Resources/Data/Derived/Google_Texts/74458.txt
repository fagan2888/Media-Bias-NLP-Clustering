While only 8% of teens have met their romantic partner online, 59% say that social networking allows them to be more connected with their partner (65% of boys and 53% of girls) once they are in a relationship, according to a new study published by Pew Research Center, "Teens, Technology and Romantic Relationships."



50% of teens have friended someone on social media (primarily Facebook) to indicate romantic interest. Itâ€™s what the researchers called "entry-level" flirting and, while teens of varying dating experience use the tactic, 37% of teens with no dating experience friended someone or sent funny things to a crush (31%) to initiate contact. Teens with dating experience, meanwhile, were more likely to send flirtatious messages (63%) or flirty/sexy videos and photos (23%). Of the teens with dating experience, 69% said putting the relationship on social media allowed too many people to see what is going on.



Overall, teens preferred other methods to keep in touch with romantic partners: texting (92%), talking on the phone (87%), and being together in person (86%) all exceeded social media communication (70%), while messaging apps (49%), email (37%), and chatting during video game play (31%) are less popular.



Lawrence Steinberg, PhD, Distinguished University Professor of Psychology at Temple University, stated, "I think a lot of adults today have unnecessary worries about the ways in which social media are disrupting adolescents' emotional development. And I think social media are - they're not the evil that, really, people think of them as."



A separate study, published in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking in July 2015, found that students who spent more than two hours a day on social media "were more likely to report distress, poor mental health and even suicidal thoughts."
