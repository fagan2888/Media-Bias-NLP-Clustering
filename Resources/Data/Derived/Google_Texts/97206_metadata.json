That\u2019s why she and other gun rights activists joined the \u201cThank Goodness for Guns in America\u201d panel to defend Americans\u2019 right to bear arms.\n\nThe CNN town hall on gun violence with President Obama held a couple weeks ago at George Mason University was a constant target of the CPAC panel. They called it nothing more than a \u201cgun control infomercial.\u201d While CNN insisted they invited the NRA to partake in the discussion, the network only offered the organization one pre-screened question. So, they declined.\n\nDuring the biased CNN town hall, one participant named Kimberly Corban, a rape survivor, confronted the president about why he is so intent on scaling back the rights that could help protect her and her family. At today\u2019s CPAC discussion, Corban said Obama did not answer her but instead engaged in a \u201cpolitical pivot.\u201d\n\nAnother panelist, Sheriff David Clarke, a well-known gun rights activist, began his remarks by holding up the Constitution. This document, he said, \u201cmeans everything to me and it should mean everything to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are your rights,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am a defender of your rights.\u201d\n\nThe Second Amendment, he said, has special meaning for him.\n\n\u201cThis Constitution allowed for us to eventually get it right,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cMy ancestors fought as well as the Founding Fathers for this document to apply to us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSlaves plus guns equaled freedom.\u201d\n\nHe won\u2019t cede those rights back to the federal government.\n\nLater, when the panel fielded questions from the audience about how to fight back against gun control, Clarke insisted he will fight against regulations like expanded background checks.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat part of 'no' do they not understand?\u201d\n\nAnother specific issue that came up during Saturday\u2019s discussion was the need to encourage our police officers. Chris Cox, the director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, was disgusted that Obama is the only president in history that has \u201cturned his back on law enforcement.\u201d\n\nKudos to CPAC for having an honest discussion about guns that CNN did not.\n\n>", "article_metadata": {"description": "An honest discussion on guns..05/27/2016 8:34:29AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "An honest discussion on guns.", "title": "Pro-Gun CPAC Panel Bashes CNN 'Gun Control Infomercial'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/03/05/progun-cpac-panel-bashes-cnn-gun-control-infomercial-n2129122", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/217/2edaff3c-39c3-4fe6-9353-8c05e290f8d8.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "An honest discussion on guns.", "title": "Pro-Gun CPAC Panel Bashes CNN 'Gun Control Infomercial'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/03/05/progun-cpac-panel-bashes-cnn-gun-control-infomercial-n2129122", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/217/2edaff3c-39c3-4fe6-9353-8c05e290f8d8.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Pro-Gun CPAC Panel Bashes CNN 'Gun Control Infomercial', Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The CNN town hall on gun violence with President Obama held a couple weeks ago at George Mason University was a constant target of the CPAC panel.\nThat\u2019s why she and other gun rights activists joined the \u201cThank Goodness for Guns in America\u201d panel to defend Americans\u2019 right to bear arms.\nThey called it nothing more than a \u201cgun control infomercial.\u201d While CNN insisted they invited the NRA to partake in the discussion, the network only offered the organization one pre-screened question.\nAt today\u2019s CPAC discussion, Corban said Obama did not answer her but instead engaged in a \u201cpolitical pivot.\u201dAnother panelist, Sheriff David Clarke, a well-known gun rights activist, began his remarks by holding up the Constitution.\nLater, when the panel fielded questions from the audience about how to fight back against gun control, Clarke insisted he will fight against regulations like expanded background checks."}
