The two bills would harm the federal budget and do nothing to help consumers, but were approved by the House Ways and Means Committee and are expected to pass the House on Thursday.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act imposes a modest 2.3 percent tax on revenues from sale of medical devices in this country, to be paid by the manufacturers or importers. The tax applies to big-ticket devices like M.R.I. scanners, X-ray machines, artificial joints and pacemakers, but not to consumer items like eyeglasses, contact lenses or hearing aids. Repealing the tax would reduce revenues, and thus increase federal deficits, by an estimated $24.4 billion over the next 10 years. The bill provides no way to replace the lost revenue.\n\nPhoto\n\nIndustry spokesmen claim the tax, which took effect in 2013, is thwarting innovation by absorbing funds that could pay for research. And they say it will drive some companies to move production facilities abroad. But independent analysts have shown such claims to be wildly exaggerated. The device industry appears to be thriving from increased business generated by the reform law and, like other industries benefiting from the law (insurers and drug makers), it ought to pay to help support it.\n\nWith almost two-thirds of the House co-sponsoring the bill to repeal the tax, it is virtually certain to pass and be sent to the Senate, where four-fifths of the members expressed support for repealing the tax in 2013. President Obama ought to veto this handout to an industry that deserves no special privileges.\n\nThe bill to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, co-sponsored by more than half of the House\u2019s members, is also expected to pass. The board, to be composed of nongovernmental experts, is meant to act as a brake on excessive spending in the Medicare program. If per capita spending in Medicare exceeds specified targets, the board, whose members have not yet been appointed by the president, must recommend changes (most likely cuts in payments to health care providers) that will become law unless Congress finds alternative, equal savings.\n\nThe board has been vilified by conservative critics with outlandish charges that it will ration care, tell patients what treatments they can receive and disrupt doctor-patient relationships. In reality, the board is prohibited by law from making any recommendations to ration care, restrict benefits, limit eligibility, or increase premiums or cost-sharing. Its primary role is to stiffen Congress\u2019s spine by insulating it from powerful health care lobbies and forcing it to act when Medicare spending runs off the rails. If a bill to get rid of the board reaches his desk, Mr. Obama should veto it as well.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150618032120, "twitter": {"description": "House Republicans are moving two bills to repeal small but important provisions of the health care law.", "title": "Destructive Health Care Proposals", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/opinion/destructive-health-care-proposals.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003744543"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/18/opinion/18thu2web/18thu2web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/opinion/destructive-health-care-proposals.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003744543", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/opinion/destructive-health-care-proposals.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Destructive Health Care Proposals", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 18, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Independent Payment Advisory Board", "keywords": "Editorials,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,United States Politics and Government,Taxation,House of Representatives,Senate,Republican Party,Independent Payment Advisory Board,Medical Devices", "news_keywords": "Editorial,Tax,Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/18/opinion/18thu2web/18thu2web-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "House Republicans are moving two bills to repeal small but important provisions of the health care law.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/18/opinion/18thu2web/18thu2web-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "House Republicans are moving two bills to repeal small but important provisions of the health care law.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 18, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-06-18", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Medical Devices", "published": "2015-06-18", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "18thu2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150618140358, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/opinion/destructive-health-care-proposals.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/18/opinion/18thu2web/18thu2web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "House Republicans are moving two bills to repeal small but important provisions of the health care law.", "title": "Destructive Health Care Proposals"}, "pdate": 20150618, "des": "Medical Devices", "articleid": 100000003744543, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Destructive Health Care Proposals", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "article_summary": "Its primary role is to stiffen Congress\u2019s spine by insulating it from powerful health care lobbies and forcing it to act when Medicare spending runs off the rails.\nThe Affordable Care Act imposes a modest 2.3 percent tax on revenues from sale of medical devices in this country, to be paid by the manufacturers or importers.\nIn reality, the board is prohibited by law from making any recommendations to ration care, restrict benefits, limit eligibility, or increase premiums or cost-sharing.\nIf a bill to get rid of the board reaches his desk, Mr. Obama should veto it as well.\nThe bill to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, co-sponsored by more than half of the House\u2019s members, is also expected to pass."}
