Leaders plan to keep government running with another short-term fix, funding agencies through Dec. 22. That will give Congress time to debate and vote on the long-term bill.\n\nREAD MORE: Massive year-end spending bill includes cybersecurity act\n\nThe other proposal is a bill extending and creating dozens of tax breaks.\n\nWhenever Congress rolls out legislation in the middle of the night, we pay close attention. Here is what we found in our first look at these twin deals.\n\n$1 Trillion Spending Bill\n\nKnown by the appropriately impressive, and painful-sounding, term \u201cOmnibus Spending Bill,\u201d this bill would fund most of the federal government through the end of September 2016. Key highlights:\n\n$1.1 Trillion in spending.\n\nBiggest increase: New $1.1 billion in funding for research on traumatic brain injury and suicide in the military.\n\nFunding frozen: For the IRS. Republicans are highly critical of the agency.\n\nEnergy\n\nMore oil sales. A 40-year ban on exporting U.S. oil would be reversed by the bill, opening markets for American companies and potentially affecting world markets. Republicans tout this as a major win.\n\nMore renewable energy. The bill extends key tax credits for wind and solar energy, ultimately phasing them out over five years. This was a Democratic priority.\n\nSecurity\n\nCybersecurity and surveillance powers. The bill includes something known as CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. Supporters say it would help American companies defend themselves against cyberattack by sharing data with the National Security Agency. But the bill has sharp critics who believe it opens a back door to wide government surveillance of personal data.\n\nSecurity increase, visa waivers block. The bill includes a House-passed proposal to require visas from some citizens of friendly countries \u2014 those who are dual citizens of or had recently visited Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria.\n\nImmigration\n\nRefugees allowed. The bill does not increase requirements for Syrian or Iraqi refugees.\n\nMore agents and judges. The bill funds an additional 1080 Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents as well as 55 immigration judges and support teams to speed up deportation hearings.\n\nE-Verify. The program that helps employers check if job applicants are in the country legally is fully funded in this bill.\n\nGenetics\n\nThis bill would ban scientists from editing the DNA or genome of human embryos for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhat we eat\n\nLess food labeling. The bill ends a requirement known as \u201cCountry of Origin Labeling\u201d which required that grocery stores indicate the origin of meats, fish and many fruits and vegetable. This is a win for Canada and other nations which sell meats to the United States and to those concerned that the policy was in violation of World Trade Organization agreements.\n\nNo calories on menus. Currently, U.S. law is set to require all restaurants to list calorie counts on their menus by 2016. The omnibus spending bill pushes that back one year.\n\n9/11 Responders\n\nThe bill permanently approves the act which provides care for first responders and other emergency personnel who worked on the scene of the Twin Tower collapse in New York and who have suffered illness as a result.\n\nObamacare\n\nObamacare tax blocked. The so-called \u201cCadillac Tax,\u201d a fee for health plans with the biggest benefits, would be delayed for two years under the deal.\n\nREAD MORE: Massive tax package offers breaks for just about everyone\n\nTax Cut Extension Bill\n\nThis one is known as the \u201ctax extenders\u201d bill and is an annual end-of-the-year tradition. Lawmakers typically renew dozens of tax breaks for businesses from NASCAR to rum manufacturers. This year\u2019s bill stands out because many of the provisions are extended two years or permanently.\n\n$750 billion in tax breaks.\n\nMedical device tax frozen. A 2.3 cent tax on medical devices that was included in the Affordable Care Act will be repealed for two years. The tax has applied to a wide range of items used in hospitals, from surgical gloves to cardiac stents and artificial knees and hips. It has not applied to retail items like contact lenses and wheelchairs.\n\nTax help for big donors. The bill adds a new section making it clear that donors to special interest groups \u2014 those filing as 501c(4), 501c(5) or 501c(6) groups \u2014 do not have to pay a gift tax for their contribution. This lifts a multimillion-dollar concern for billionaire donors like the conservative Koch Brothers or liberal Tom Steyer.\n\nThe IRS. With this bill, Republicans would ban IRS employees from using personal email accounts to conduct official business and would calls for the firing of any IRS employee who makes politically-motivated decisions. Consider this a direct response to the Lois Lerner investigation which the Department of Justice closed earlier this year.\n\nThis is plenty to debate, but Republican leaders hope to steer this through Congress over the next few days.
