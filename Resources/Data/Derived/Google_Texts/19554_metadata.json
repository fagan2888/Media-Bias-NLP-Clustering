Tyler Johnson had two assists, giving him 13 over his last nine games.\n\nMarcus Johansson, Eric Fehr and Troy Brouwer scored for the Capitals, who have lost four of five. Alex Ovechkin had an assist to snap a five-game point drought, the longest of his career.\n\nSteven Stamkos won a faceoff, sending the puck back to Garrison, who gave Tampa Bay a 4-3 lead 2:27 into the third.\n\nAfter Palat scored at 9:29 of the second, Tampa Bay went up 3-2 when Kucherov tipped Eric Brewer\u2019s shot past Braden Holtby just 2:43 later.\n\nBrouwer pulled the Capitals even at 3 during a power play with 58.4 seconds remaining in the second.\n\nRight after Kucherov hit the post, Fehr put the Capitals up 2-1 from just above the goal line at 2:11 of the second.\n\nCallahan, back in the lineup after missing five games due to a lower-body injury, opened the scoring with a nifty redirection between his legs off Brian Boyle\u2019s pass 6:06 into the game.\n\nLess than a minute after Holtby made in-close saves on Callahan and Valtteri Filppula during a Tampa Bay power play, Johansson tied it at 1 with 7:01 left in the first on a rebound after Ben Bishop stopped a shot by a tripped-up Ovechkin.\n\nNOTES: Stamkos (218) and Ovechkin (208) top the NHL in goals since the start of the 2009-10 season. \u2026 Ovechkin has gone six games without a goal. \u2026 Ovechkin has 37 assists and 72 points in 55 games against Tampa Bay. \u2026 Tampa Bay C Alex Killorn left in the second with an upper-body injury. \u2026 Washington C Brooks Laich (left shoulder) missed his fifth straight game. \u2026 Lightning D Andrej Sustr (right hand), hurt in Thursday\u2019s game against Philadelphia, didn\u2019t play. He was seen flexing the hand at times during the morning skate. \u2026 Capitals LW Aaron Volpatti (neck) continues practicing with the team.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marcus Johansson, Eric Fehr and Troy Brouwer scored for the Capitals, who have lost four of five.
