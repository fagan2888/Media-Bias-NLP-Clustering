Later that night while sitting on the couch she complained of a stomach ache. Life changed forever.\n\nFast forward to present day. Ellie Porter has undergone major surgery, rounds of radiation and chemotherapy \u2014 and there\u2019s more to come for the girl that likes to wear flowered headbands.\n\nBut the difficulty didn\u2019t end there for the Salt Lake City, Utah, family that has helped their daughter battle cancer for the latter half of this year. In late November, they received a notice regarding their insurance. Porter, a dentist who chose his own insurance, was told his coverage no longer qualified as an acceptable plan under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFrom stomach ache to cancer\n\nSo how does a little girl go from a healthy, playful 6-year-old with steely green-blue eyes to a little girl who has lost her hair and is dealing with the painful side effects of chemotherapy?\n\nPorter recalled coming home from work to find his daughter on the couch. Learning of her stomach ache, he started feeling around her appendix area.\n\n\u201cI could feel a mass in her stomach,\u201d he told TheBlaze in a phone interview. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t see it protruding, but I could feel a hard mass.\u201d\n\nAt that point, Porter thought it was still her appendix. Ellie was taken to the emergency room and doctors agreed that could be the case, but her symptoms were not severe enough to merit immediate surgery. They sent the Porters home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another thing to the whole experience you wish you didn\u2019t have to go though.\u201d Share:\n\nThey came back later that night after Ellie continued complaining of the pain. They insisted on an ultrasound and got one. That\u2019s when they diagnosed the mass as a tumor on her kidney. Initially, the doctor\u2019s thought it might have ruptured, but fortunately when the tumor was removed on Aug. 2, it was intact.\n\nEllie began radiation for clear-cell sarcoma, but on her last day of treatment, doctor\u2019s told Porter they had new analysis from her tumor and found the cancer was high-grade undifferentiated sarcoma, a very rare form of childhood cancer.\n\nPorter said doctors could only point to 10 documented cases of similar tumors in published literature.\n\nBased on its high-grade nature and how the tumor looked, Ellie\u2019s treatment was changed to one her father said is four times more aggressive against the disease.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow she\u2019s handling it really well,\u201d Porter said of the difficult situation. \u201cIt has definitely been hard, no doubt. The side effects from chemo are scary, not fun at all.\u201d\n\nHe explained that a neurotoxicity that results from the chemotherapy can cause Ellie to hallucinate. It could also lead her into a coma or death, which are his greater fears.\n\n\u201cWhen she feels good though, she\u2019s up and at \u2018em, playing and being herself,\u201d Porter said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge adjustment for a kid to all the sudden have to go through treatment like that.\u201d\n\nThe insurance decision\n\nAmong all the other things weighing on the minds of Ellie\u2019s parents, Porter said he received a notice from Humana that he has until Dec. 15 to make a decision about what he would like to do with his insurance.\n\nThe well-publicized quote from President Barack Obama that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it,\u201d which has been turned on its head in recent months as provisions of the Affordable Care Act law have disqualified insurance that many had liked, is exactly what got Porter.\n\nPorter has until mid-month to choose from three options, deciding what\u2019s best for his family and his little girl in the middle of treatment. He could:\n\n1) Keep his current insurance for the next year under the extension that arose from \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it\u201d outrage;\n\n2) Switch to a compliant plan; or\n\n3) Seek out insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd Porter did like his insurance, but since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, he\u2019s been worried.\n\n\u201cI was nervous when this all hit because we\u2019ve been a healthy family. We\u2019ve never had to use our insurance before,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Porter signed up for insurance, he said he picked a plan they could afford \u201cthat would cover us if something catastrophic happened.\u201d And their catastrophic did happen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. We\u2019re right in middle of treatment with our daughter and now have to worry about which way we were going to go,\u201d he said, noting that he\u2019s hired someone to help them weed through the decisions that have to be made in an amount of time he finds wholly inadequate.\n\nPorter worries he\u2019ll have to pay a high price for coverage on any new plan because of his daughter\u2019s condition. And it\u2019s not just her treatment: the actual chemo is only one step on the road of years of tests and check-ups that will be required to monitor her condition afterward.\n\nUnder their current insurance, Porter said Ellie\u2019s treatment was a \u201cstretch but manageable.\u201d Now, he said he\u2019s \u201cback to we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nPorter said the premiums are almost double than their previous plan.\n\nKSL-TV reported Jason Stevenson, communications director with Utah Health Policy Project, said most families in a position like the Porters could potentially find a better coverage option under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cGenerally folks with cancer, with pre-existing conditions, are finding both their rates much more affordable and finding their options more widespread,\u201d Stevenson told the news station.\n\nBut to Porter, \u201cit\u2019s another thing to the whole experience you wish you didn\u2019t have to go though.\u201d\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Five months ago, Paul Porter's 6-year-old daughter was playing outside on a slide.
