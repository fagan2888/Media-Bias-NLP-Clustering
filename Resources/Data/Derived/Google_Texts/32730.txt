IT deal with Dell to affect third of Blue Cross workers

The staffing reduction will affect 260 of the 980 people Blue Cross employs; 80 will lose jobs outright; 50 will learn that their jobs are being eliminated, but that they'll be able to switch into other positions; about 130 will be offered jobs with Dell.
