A former Fulbright Scholar and current Arabic teaching assistant at Ohio University, the odds seemed stacked in her favor.\n\nNow, in the process of completing her third master\u2019s degree, Jabbari, a first-year graduate student studying African studies and political science, has run into an unforeseen roadblock: she, along with the more than 1,700 international students enrolled at OU as of Fall Semester 2015, does not have the option to choose her own health insurance plan.\n\nDomestic and international continuing students at OU are required to pay a premium of $867 per semester. Those who enrolled in classes this spring, however, were met with a $1,076 price tag \u2014 about a 14 percent increase, according to Student Insurance Administrator Anna Casteel. That increase, Casteel said, is due to the number of large claims students made during the past policy year.\n\n\u201cThe fee appears on their student account along with tuition, etc. They (international students) do not have the option to decline this coverage,\u201d Krista McCallum Beatty, director of International Student and Faculty Services, said in an email.\n\nThe system Jabbari has encountered in America is unlike the situation back home in Tunisia, she said, where healthcare is free to the public.\n\n\u201cI know how crucial it is to have health insurance, both back home and here. So what we\u2019re saying is not that we don\u2019t want to pay for health insurance,\u201d Jabbari said. \u201cWe might end up having the university health insurance, but we need to have the right to choose.\u201d\n\nEvery student at Ohio University is required to have an active health insurance plan, which is run through UnitedHealthcare. International students holding F and J immigration statuses, given to non-immigrant students, are automatically registered for the university\u2019s plan.\n\nDomestic students are able to complete a waiver that allows them to choose their own health insurance, even if that means, for example, remaining on a parent's plan.\n\nThe ability to register for classes, however, is a necessity to international students \u2014 not just to continue their education, but to stay in the country. Failure to pay for the university health insurance plan hinders international students from registering for classes in the future, Beatty said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot negotiate anything,\u201d Jabbari said. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t enroll for classes, that means you\u2019ll be violating your visa status \u2026 you can either get deported, or you will have problems.\u201d\n\nAccording to the university\u2019s medical services policy, last approved in 2014, \u201celigible\u201d international students can request a waiver after submitting proof of coverage that \u201cmeets or exceeds the university\u2019s health insurance policy repatriation coverage and meets or exceeds the Affordable Care Act requirements for all other coverage.\u201d\n\nNow, with the increase in the plan\u2019s cost, on top of paying rent and student fees, Jabbari is unsure of how she will make it through the year.\n\nJabbari recently voiced her concerns about international student health insurance at a Graduate Student Senate meeting March 21. At that meeting, former GSS president Eddie Smith and former vice president of finance Liudmila Pestun supported Jabbari\u2019s concerns.\n\nJabbari said she has no plans to challenge the university\u2019s policy directly, but hopes to raise awareness in the name of her fellow international students.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to challenge anything. I\u2019m not challenging any authority,\u201d Jabbari said. \u201cI\u2019m just here to claim my rights, and international students\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\n@lauren__fisher\n\nlf966614@ohio.edu", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Post", "description": "Students who enrolled in classes this spring were met with a $1,076 price tag for health insurance \u2014 about a 14 percent increase from last semester.", "title": "University health insurance policy provides little freedom for international students", "url": "http://www.thepostathens.com/news/university-health-insurance-policy-provides-little-freedom-for-international-students/article_dfd04662-01cc-11e6-85c9-574935b06374.html", "image": {"width": 414, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thepostathens.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/d0/fd0c0378-01d7-11e6-86fe-8735d0e1cd9c/570ee6780c5cc.image.jpg?resize=414%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thepost", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Students who enrolled in classes this spring were met with a $1,076 price tag for health insurance \u2014 about a 14 percent increase from last semester.", "p": {"domain_verify": "d1995ea7a6d9aa520d043d39c542df9d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1395412247351333}, "keywords": "international students,news,campus,student_life", "news_keywords": "international students,news,campus,student_life"}, "article_summary": "Failure to pay for the university health insurance plan hinders international students from registering for classes in the future, Beatty said.\nJabbari recently voiced her concerns about international student health insurance at a Graduate Student Senate meeting March 21.\n\u201cWe might end up having the university health insurance, but we need to have the right to choose.\u201dEvery student at Ohio University is required to have an active health insurance plan, which is run through UnitedHealthcare.\nThey (international students) do not have the option to decline this coverage,\u201d Krista McCallum Beatty, director of International Student and Faculty Services, said in an email.\nSo what we\u2019re saying is not that we don\u2019t want to pay for health insurance,\u201d Jabbari said."}
