They will appear before a judge for preliminary hearings on Friday.\n\nThe prosecution had requested that Friday's hearing for the four suspected IS recruits be closed to the public, police said.\n\nMore than 125 people are believed to have joined IS after going to Syria and Iraq from Denmark, PET said in October, adding that at least 27 had died there.\n\n\"We know that people who have fought for IS in Syria or Iraq may pose a specific security threat against Denmark,\" Justice Minister Soren Pind said in statement shortly after the arrests.\n\nOnly one person, a 23-year-old, has previously been charged under the same section of the Danish penal code with being recruited for terrorist acts. He was charged in December and his trial is expected to begin in May.\n\nDanish authorities have been on high alert since two people were killed in shooting attacks at a free speech event and a synagogue in Copenhagen in February last year.\n\nIslamic State claimed responsibility for suicide bomb attacks that killed 32 people in Brussels last month and attacks in Paris in November that killed 130 people.\n\n(Additional reporting by Nikolaj Studsgaard; Editing by Andrew Roche)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish police said they had arrested four people on Thursday su", "title": "Denmark arrests four for suspected IS support, two for weapons", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/07/Denmark-arrests-four-suspected-fighters-returned-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/denmark-security_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/07/Denmark-arrests-four-suspected-fighters-returned-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/denmark-security_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish police said they had arrested four people on Thursday su", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The two will be indicted for breaking Danish weapons law, Copenhagen Police said in a statement.\nCOPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish police said they had arrested four people on Thursday suspected of having been recruited by Islamic State (IS) to commit terrorist violence, and two others of breaking Danish weapons law.\nThe prosecution had requested that Friday's hearing for the four suspected IS recruits be closed to the public, police said.\n\"We know that people who have fought for IS in Syria or Iraq may pose a specific security threat against Denmark,\" Justice Minister Soren Pind said in statement shortly after the arrests.\nIslamic State claimed responsibility for suicide bomb attacks that killed 32 people in Brussels last month and attacks in Paris in November that killed 130 people."}
