So he tried neurofeedback, hoping this controversial treatment would improve his balance and mental processes.\n\nNeurofeedback \u2014 a type of biofeedback \u2014 uses movies, video games, computers and other tools to help individuals regulate their brain waves. A patient might watch a movie, for example, while hooked to sensors that send data to a computer.\n\nA therapist, following the brain activity on a monitor, programs the computer to stop the movie if an abnormal number of fast or slow brain waves is detected or if the brain waves are erratic, moving rapidly from fast to slow waves.\n\nThe stop-and-start feedback, repeated over and over in numerous sessions, seems to yield more-normal brain waves. Researchers who endorse the technique say they don\u2019t know exactly how it works \u2014 but they say the changes in brain waves result in improved ability to focus and relax.\n\nBetter focus and relaxation can seemingly help improve or eliminate such conditions as migraines \u2014 imbalanced brain waves are associated with certain symptoms like pain \u2014 and anxiety.\n\nNeurofeedback, which is also used for post-traumatic stress disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, has been around since the 1960s. Some research has found it promising. Other studies have been inconclusive, and some have shown no positive outcomes.\n\nThe most solid data concern ADHD, especially a recent trial involving 104 children published in March in the Journal of Pediatrics. Those who received neurofeedback had improvements in attention and impulse control, while those who did not receive the therapy did not. These improvements persisted after six months.\n\nThe authors concluded that neurofeedback may be a \u201cpromising attention training treatment for children with ADHD.\u201d\n\nGardner had read that the technique could aid in recovery from brain injuries.\n\n\u201cI was skeptical. But I was desperate. I felt like I was wrapped in miles of cotton and could not reach through it to touch or feel anything,\u201d said Gardner, an electronic technology consultant. His doctor was projecting a two- to-three-year recovery period, based on Gardner\u2019s slow progress nine months after surgery.\n\nBy his ninth neurofeedback session, he was driving, taking power walks and working from home.\n\nA MENTAL REBOOT\n\nNeurofeedback treatments vary. In Gardner\u2019s case, he sat in a chair while tiny, pulsed signals were sent to his brain. Research suggests that these signals enable the brain to revive its communication channels, which can become impaired after a brain injury.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t feel anything\u201d while the treatments were underway, Gardner said. \u201cI just sat there with my eyes closed. My therapist explained that the pulses basically reboot the brain.\u201d\n\nHe has just completed the last of 10 treatments.\n\n\u201cI am not 100 percent. I probably won\u2019t stand on my head or get on a roller coaster. But I can do almost everything I couldn\u2019t do before,\u201d said Gardner, who has returned to his martial arts.\n\n\u201cDo most people become totally normal? No. But they improve,\u201d said Michael Sitar, a Bethesda, Md., psychologist certified in neurofeedback.\n\nHe uses it to treat depression, ADHD, chronic pain and some other conditions.\n\n\u201cI find people with focus problems can switch tasks easier. Kids who repeat themselves and who are emotionally labile become calmer and don\u2019t repeat as much,\u201d Sitar said. \u201cWith some complicated cases, like bipolar disorder, people may get by on less medication. Though less common, there are documented cases of nonverbal people who become verbal.\u201d\n\nDeborah Stokes, an Alexandria, Va., psychologist, compares neurofeedback to riding a bike: It\u2019s non-conscious learning, based on the feedback, that, with repetition, can be long-lasting, she said. Her team sees 30 patients a week.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly how neurofeedback works,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a process where if clients get out of their own way, they relax. Over time, they get the desired brain pattern, feel calm and function better. This encourages them to stay with it.\u201d\n\nThomas Nicklin, whose family was living in Alexandria, saw Stokes for debilitating migraines. A year and a half after beginning a drug regimen prescribed by a neurologist, he was not getting better.\n\nNicklin, a teenager who was in boarding school, did 45 neurofeedback sessions over three months last year.\n\n\u201cOver time,\u201d said his mother, Pat Nicklin, \u201cThomas went from three or four blinding migraines a week, vomiting and daily pain, to no symptoms.\u201d\n\nMORE DATA NEEDED\n\nBut Silver Spring, Md., psychologist Robb Mapou is among the skeptics.\n\n\u201cI have not seen enough well-controlled, rigorous studies in most conditions for which it is recommended to show, definitively, that neurofeedback is effective. I also think there are other therapeutic factors that can contribute to an individual\u2019s outcome, such as discussing their problems with a therapist.\u201d\n\nMichelle Harris-Love, a neuroscience researcher at the Med-Star National Rehabilitation Network in Washington, agrees.\n\n\u201cI believe it is applied in some situations where we do not have enough information on the cause of a disorder or how recovery happens,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Rex Cannon, past president of the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, based in McLean, Va., cited nearly 200 peer-reviewed published articles that indicate neurofeedback\u2019s effectiveness. This includes a meta-analysis of 10 studies on epilepsy patients: Although they had not responded to medications, they had a significant reduction in seizures after neurofeedback treatment.\n\nAnd a study on migraine patients reported, \u201cNeurofeedback appears to be dramatically effective in abolishing or significantly reducing migraine frequency in the great majority of patients.\u201d\n\nPatients usually have sessions two or three times a week, for a total of 10 to 40. Most sessions are 30 to 60 minutes long. They can be expensive \u2014 from $50 to $130 each. Some insurance policies cover neurofeedback, depending on the diagnosis.\n\nPractitioners who use neurofeedback for medical and psychological disorders must have health-care degrees and are regulated by state agencies.\n\nAbout 1,850 professionals have been certified through the Biofeedback Certification International Alliance. To earn that credential, they must undergo 36 hours of study in neurophysiology and related topics, complete a mentoring program to learn clinical skills and pass a standardized exam.\n\nMary Lee Esty, a Bethesda, Md., clinical social worker, has a small study underway treating veterans with PTSD. In an earlier study of seven veterans who used neurofeedback, she reported, the results were promising.\n\n\u201cThese people initially had minimal function. They could not work, and many attempted suicide,\u201d she said. \u201cOne is getting a Ph.D now. One has a full scholarship when he could not read after his head injury. All of them are doing well.\u201d\n\nOther studies describe results of the therapy in a similar way, as promising but requiring further examination.\n\nEsty, who received a National Institutes of Health grant for an earlier study of brain-injured patients, has used neurofeedback to treat more than 2,500 people, mainly with brain injuries or PTSD. In her most recent and still ongoing study, she collaborates with the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, which gives participants in her program post-treatment evaluations.\n\n\u201cI am in this collaboration because I want to get the hard data out there,\u201d Esty said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/02/shutterstock_219985546-1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde39\"", "article_summary": "A therapist, following the brain activity on a monitor, programs the computer to stop the movie if an abnormal number of fast or slow brain waves is detected or if the brain waves are erratic, moving rapidly from fast to slow waves.\nNicklin, a teenager who was in boarding school, did 45 neurofeedback sessions over three months last year.\nBetter focus and relaxation can seemingly help improve or eliminate such conditions as migraines \u2014 imbalanced brain waves are associated with certain symptoms like pain \u2014 and anxiety.\nNeurofeedback \u2014 a type of biofeedback \u2014 uses movies, video games, computers and other tools to help individuals regulate their brain waves.\nThe stop-and-start feedback, repeated over and over in numerous sessions, seems to yield more-normal brain waves."}
