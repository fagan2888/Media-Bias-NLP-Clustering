No standing around. No minute or second spared.\n\nThe energy at Kubiak\u2019s practices is palpable, even to those watching from the sidelines. For the 90 players running through drills and formations, the practices can be draining.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m exhausted,\u201d safety T.J. Ward said Saturday. \u201cThese have been two really hard output days, but we got some good work in and guys are fighting through it.\u201d\n\nThe morning workouts open to fans feature a heavy rotation of individual and situational drills, with units changing often to give coaches a look at every combination of players. Weight-room sessions are quick but efficient. The afternoon walk-throughs are more like jog-throughs. And the three meetings \u2014 up from the usual two \u2014 are sandwiched in between.\n\nFor some, the pace is nothing new. Kubiak has created a following, and many of his players from past teams have re-joined him in Denver. They know the routine \u2014 and its benefits.\n\n\u201cThere are some camps out there that definitely shorten careers. Kubes\u2019 camp is one that allows you to stay fresh the whole season,\u201d said tight end Owen Daniels, who played under Kubiak in Houston and Baltimore before signing with Denver. \u201cHe\u2019s awesome about throwing us a bone here or there to get us fresh mentally or physically. Both of those things that are very important. I don\u2019t remember a lot of times in the past where we really dragged late in the season. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent all the way through and the camp has a lot to do with it.\u201d\n\nFor the others, the up-tempo practices and camp days are grueling but welcome.\n\n\u201cI like it,\u201d said Demaryius Thomas, who missed mini camp and organized team activities because of contract negotiations. \u201cIt gets you in better shape quick. You\u2019re always on the go. When you get on the field, you\u2019re always on the go. (We\u2019re) going to be able to run longer than any other team, I feel like, if we just stick with it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Broncos,Demaryius Thomas,Owen Daniels,T.J.
