Seminal sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live opened its 39th season with a cold open lampooning the rollout of Obamacare, which featured the sorts of “ordinary Americans” who are trotted out to tell their very personal stories, including a woman who has stopped washing her hands, and is “licking hella subway poles” now that she finally has health insurance. Also featured were a college student who no longer feels pressure to get a job, and an Emergency Room doctor who urges Americans to cut health care costs by refraining from putting things up their butts. Taran Killam also made a quick cameo as Ted Cruz.

The highlight of the bit, though, was President Obama‘s introduction of Breaking Bad‘s Aaron Paul, who, in character as Jesse Pinkman, explained how a lack of quality, affordable health insurance had led Walter White to murder everything he touches.
