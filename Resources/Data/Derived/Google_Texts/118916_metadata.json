Nearly 1200 adults were surveyed by telephone.\n\nBudget speak doesn\u2019t fare well either. Thirty percent of respondents said they\u2019d rather not hear the word \u201cshutdown\u201d next year \u2013 while another 11 percent are pleading with Congress to please not bring up the word \u201cgridlock\u201d next year.\n\nAs a small consolation, the term \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d seems a little less hated. One in ten people said they do not want to hear that phrase \u2013 while 4 percent said they feel that way about the unfortunate tongue twister \u201csequestration.\u201d\n\nNaturally, there\u2019s some political preference when it comes to the least favorite terms. Nearly 60 percent of Republicans would defund the word \u201cObamacare,\u201d while 45 percent of Democrats \u201ccringe at the sound of \u2018shutdown.\u2019\u201d The poll was comprised of a split sample of registered voters.\n\nYou can see the results in detail in the table from the Marist poll here.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Here\u2019s yet another cruel blow to President Obama\u2019s signature", "title": "The Word Voters Don\u2019t Want to Hear in 2014", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/20/Word-Voters-Dont-Want-Hear-2014", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01092012_Health_Costs_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/20/Word-Voters-Dont-Want-Hear-2014", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01092012_Health_Costs_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Here\u2019s yet another cruel blow to President Obama\u2019s signature", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2173\"", "article_summary": "Thirty percent of respondents said they\u2019d rather not hear the word \u201cshutdown\u201d next year \u2013 while another 11 percent are pleading with Congress to please not bring up the word \u201cgridlock\u201d next year.\nNearly 60 percent of Republicans would defund the word \u201cObamacare,\u201d while 45 percent of Democrats \u201ccringe at the sound of \u2018shutdown.\u2019\u201d The poll was comprised of a split sample of registered voters.\nYou can see the results in detail in the table from the Marist poll here.\nRelated: White House\u2019s Final Push to Save ObamacareThe results are reported in a new Marist poll conducted between Dec. 3 and Dec. 5.\nWhat\u2019s also clear is that voters are sick of bad news from the federal government \u2013 especially at what\u2019s supposed to be a joyful time of year."}
