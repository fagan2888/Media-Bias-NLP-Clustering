Without a major inflationary threat, I don\u2019t think the Fed would want the U.S. dollar to get too strong, as it could negatively impact export-oriented companies,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index DXY, -0.15% a gauge of the dollar\u2019s performance against a basket of six rival currencies, is up 6% in the first five months of this year.\n\nAnd while market volatility will be inevitable no matter how circumspect the Fed is about shifting to a tightening cycle, that, too, can be a chance to bargain hunt for undervalued stocks. \u201cWe see it as [an] opportunity to pick up shares of what we see as good-quality companies at attractive prices,\u201d Mobius said.\n\nFurthermore, with the exception of the Fed, most other central banks are maintaining accommodative policies to support economic growth. \u201cWe believe there is still money in motion as central banks globally expand their balance sheets,\u201d he said.\n\nAlong with those ample funds, tailwinds for equity markets from Brazil to Turkey include solid growth trends, wide-spread reforms and lower oil prices.\n\n\u201cBrazil\u2019s difficult current situation could be sowing the seeds of recovery with currency devaluation boosting competitiveness, while moves to root out corruption could lead to improved economic and corporate governance over time,\u201d Mobius said.\n\nFree-trade initiatives, including the President Obama\u2013backed Trans-Pacific Partnership, could provide an additional catalyst.\n\nEmerging markets, on the whole, have outperformed their more developed counterparts so far this year. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.26% has surged 52% in 2015, while Brazil\u2019s Bovespa index BVSP, +0.28% has rallied 8.3% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng HSI, +0.12% has climbed 16%. In comparison, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.70% has so far in 2015 eked out a 2.7% gain and the U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 UKX, +0.62% has added 5.9%.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Market volatility will be inevitable no matter how circumspect the Federal Reserve is about raising interest rates, but Mark Mobius sees that as a chance to bargain hunt for undervalued stocks in emerging markets.", "creator": "@SueChangMW", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BT771_mobius_MG_20140131124211.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Sue Chang", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Markets", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Market volatility will be inevitable no matter how circumspect the Federal Reserve is about raising interest rates, but Mark Mobius sees that as a chance to bargain hunt for undervalued stocks in emerging markets.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mobius-sees-fed-rate-hike-as-buying-opportunity-for-emerging-market-stocks-2015-06-02", "author": "Sue Chang", "parsely-title": "Mobius sees Fed rate hike as buying opportunity for emerging-market stocks", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-02T16:14:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Markets", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Market volatility will be inevitable no matter how circumspect the Federal Reserve is about raising interest rates, but Mark Mobius sees that as a chance to bargain hunt for undervalued stocks in emerging markets.", "title": "Mobius sees Fed rate hike as buying opportunity for emerging-market stocks", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mobius-sees-fed-rate-hike-as-buying-opportunity-for-emerging-market-stocks-2015-06-02", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BT771_mobius_MG_20140131124211.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BT771_mobius_MG_20140131124211.jpg"}, "article.id": "18F04EC8-094A-11E5-971E-11C57B18DFE4", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd994b\"", "article_summary": "Sara Sjolin/MarketWatch Mark Mobius sees more upside potential in emerging markets.\nEmerging markets, on the whole, have outperformed their more developed counterparts so far this year.\nBut in his most recent report, the executive chairman of the Templeton Emerging Markets Group at Franklin Templeton shares some compelling reasons as to why emerging markets will continue to shine even if a U.S. rate hike is a certainty.\nThat Mark Mobius has good things to say about emerging markets will come as little surprise given his enthusiasm for economies that are often marginalized in favor of developed markets.\n\u201cWe see it as [an] opportunity to pick up shares of what we see as good-quality companies at attractive prices,\u201d Mobius said."}
