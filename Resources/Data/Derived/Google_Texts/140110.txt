If you're already on Social Security, the number of extra dollars you'll get will depend on the level of your 2013 benefits. But on average, monthly retirement payments will rise from $1,275 to $1,294, an increase of $19, Social Security says. Disabled workers will receive an average of $17 more a month, while the average widowed mother with two children will see her benefits grow by $39 a month.

The COLA for 2014 is based on the increase in the consumer price index (CPI) from the third quarter of 2012 through the third quarter of 2013.

Cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, are intended to ensure that Social Security payments aren't eroded by inflation. Over the last 25 years, COLAs have averaged 2.74 percent.
