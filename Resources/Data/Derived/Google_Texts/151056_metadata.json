The tiger is currently known only as cub No. 2.\n\nAsked what the family might name the cub, David Callanan, cofounder of the company Advisors Excel, said they would have to give it some thought.\n\n\u201cProbably our daughters will decide,\u201d he said.\n\nThe auction took place at an annual fundraising gala organized by the Topeka Active 20-30 Club, a local chapter of the international men's professional networking group.\n\nHundreds of people packed the Regency Ballroom of the Ramada Hotel and Convention Center for the event, at which scores of items were up for auction.\n\nEach year the club holds the gala to benefit children's charities in Topeka and northeast Kansas. Last year the event raised more than $200,000 for charities, gala chairman Mike Maas said.\n\nFifty percent of the proceeds from auctioning the cub-naming rights will go to children's charities and the rest to preservation efforts for Sumatran tigers living in their native habitat in Indonesia.\n\nZoo director Brendan Wiley described the arrangement as a win-win situation for two good causes.\n\n\u201cTigers in the wild need a lot of help,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cThrough working with a great community partner,\u201d he said, \u201cnow children in our community will benefit, as well as the (Sumatran tiger) species.\u201d\n\nAsked why the zoo chose to auction the naming rights at the gala rather than working on its own and avoiding splitting the proceeds, Wiley said collaboration has the potential to raise more money.\n\n\u201cThe Active 20-30 Club Gala is one of the most successful fundraisers in our community,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the zoo\u2019s partnership with 20-30 stems from years earlier, when the two teamed up to auction the right to name a newborn Nile hippopotamus at the annual gala in 2010.\n\nVision Bank president Gary Yager made the highest bid \u2014 $4,200, according to Capital-Journal archives \u2014 and named the hippo \u201cVision.\u201d\n\nVision Bank then began supporting the zoo in other ways, Wiley said, a relationship that has also helped the zoo build other fundraising connections.\n\nThe cub's name will be unveiled Friday.\n\nHer siblings are named Shanti and Raza.\n\nShanti received her name, which means \u201cpeace,\u201d through a public poll. Her sister\u2019s name means \u201chope\u201d and was chosen by Karis Selk, a seven-year-old who has battled cancer.\n\nRaza also fought for her life, facing difficulties after birth that required zoo staff assistance to help her survive.\n\nThe cubs\u2019 mother, Jingga, and father, Rojo, are also residents of the Topeka Zoo.\n\nThe three cubs got their first taste of the outdoors earlier this week, in the morning before the zoo opened to visitors.\n\nSunday morning they will return to their outdoor enclosure, where they can be viewed by the public, and will then spend time outside on a daily basis until at least 10:30 a.m. each morning.\n\nContact Celia Llopis-Jepsen at (785) 295-1285 or @Celia_LJ on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Celia Llopis-Jepsen", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "At a charity auction Saturday evening, Topekans Karlun and David Callanan bought the right to name the only one of three tigers born at the zoo on May 4 that had yet to receive a moniker.", "title": "Local family will name zoo's third Sumatran cub", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2014-08-02/local-family-will-name-zoos-third-sumatran-cub", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/lead_photo/new080314tiger_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "The Topeka Zoo\u2019s as-yet unnamed Sumatran tiger cub will soon have a name.At a charity auction Saturday evening, Topekans Karlun and David Callanan bought the right to name the only one of three tigers born at the zoo on May 4 that had yet to receive a moniker.\u201cWe have two little girls,\u201d ages 4 and 7, Karlun Callanan said. \u201cIt will be fun for them.\u201dOn Sunday, Callanan said her girls had come up with a name but she wasn\u2019t going to share it until the family told the Topeka Zoo. \u201cWe went today and saw one of the bus,\u201d she said."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2fa\"", "article_summary": "The Topeka Zoo\u2019s as-yet unnamed Sumatran tiger cub will soon have a name.\nAsked what the family might name the cub, David Callanan, cofounder of the company Advisors Excel, said they would have to give it some thought.\n\u201cIt will be fun for them.\u201dOn Sunday, Callanan said her girls had come up with a name but she wasn\u2019t going to share it until the family told the Topeka Zoo.\nThe cubs\u2019 mother, Jingga, and father, Rojo, are also residents of the Topeka Zoo.\nThe auction took place at an annual fundraising gala organized by the Topeka Active 20-30 Club, a local chapter of the international men's professional networking group."}
