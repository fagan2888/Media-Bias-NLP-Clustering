We do not expect the shock to be obliterative, dislocating to both body and mind.\u201d We cannot know, she says, when we lose the person we love\u2014as she lost her husband John Gregory Dunne 11 years ago\u2014\u201cthe unending absence that follows, the void, the very opposite of meaning, the relentless succession of moments during which we will confront the experience of meaninglessness itself.\u201d The tragedy of such grief is that the loss of a loved one is irreversible. It is total and final. Even so, while some of the grief-stricken remain depressed for long periods of time\u2014developing what\u2019s called \u201ccomplicated grief\u201d\u2014most people move on. They eventually settle into their old routines or develop new ones. Their lives recover a semblance of order. Sad though they may continue to be, they are no longer held hostage by the chaos of their emotions. They are resilient. Sixty percent of mourners show no symptoms of grief one month following a loss. Some even overcome grief within days. George Bonanno, a clinical psychologist at Columbia University and author of The Other Side of Sadness, has studied grief for over 20 years. Among his most provocative findings is that 50 to 60 percent of mourners show no symptoms of grief one month following the loss. Some even overcome the grief within days. What drives these people forward? What holds the others back? And why do some mourners recover from grief quickly\u2014much more quickly\u2014than others? Psychologists who study these questions note that there is no single factor that predicts who copes well and who does not. Many variables, from your personality to your social world to your levels of stress before the loss, play distinct roles.\n\nA new study, though, hints at an answer. There is a specific way many people can, no matter what their circumstances may be, transcend despair and distress. * * * Researchers Michael I. Norton and Francesca Gino at Harvard Business School wanted to know how people cope with extreme loss. In the study, published in February in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, they found that some mourners are more emotionally resilient than others, and those who overcome their grief more quickly all have something very important in common. Following the loss, they performed what the researchers refer to as \u201crituals\u201d in the study. But these were not your typical rituals. When many people think of mourning rituals, they think of public displays of bereavement such as funerals, wearing black for a certain period of time, or religious customs like \u201csitting shiva\u201d in Judaism (a period of seven days when the bereaved are visited by guests). Though the substance of these rituals may vary\u2014Catholic Latinos view crying as a sign of respect at funerals while Tibetan Buddhists see it as a disruption\u2014public mourning rituals occur across nearly all cultures. Norton, the lead author of the study, first became interested in this line of research after reading Drew Gilpin Faust\u2019s This Republic of Suffering. The book details the public mourning rituals, often tied to clothing, of Confederate widows during the Civil War. \u201cReading it, I thought maybe there is something here,\u201d he told me, \u201cthat helps them cope in a meaningful way.\u201d To determine what that \u201csomething\u201d was, Norton and Gino asked 76 research participants in their first study to write about a significant loss they experienced, like the end of a relationship or the death of someone they love. They also asked the participants to explain how they coped with the loss and to describe any rituals they did. The researchers were surprised by the results. Many of the rituals reported were not the public ones that inspired Norton. Rather, they were private rituals. Only 15 percent of the described rituals had a social element (and just 5 percent were religious). By far, most of the rituals people did were personal and performed alone.\n\nFor example, one person, following a breakup, performed this ritual: \u201cI returned alone to the location of the breakup each month on the anniversary of the breakup to help cope with my loss and think things over.\u201d Another person gathered all of the pictures they took as a couple during their relationship and \u201cthen destroyed them into small pieces (even the ones I really liked!), and then burnt them in the park where we first kissed.\u201d One woman whose husband died still washes his car each week, as he had done when he was alive. The mourning rituals were especially moving. One woman who lost her mother would \u201cplay the song by Natalie Cole \u2018I miss you like crazy\u2019 and cry every time I heard it and thought of my mom.\u201d A man whose wife passed away wrote: \u201cIn these fifteen years I have been going to hairdressers to cut my hair every first Saturday of the month as we used to do together.\u201d Another lady, whose husband died, said she still washes his car each week as he had done when he was alive. These private rituals are very sad. One would expect that performing them\u2014and writing about them\u2014would make mourners more depressed by reminding them of who and what they have lost. But that\u2019s not what happens, as the researchers discovered in a follow-up study. Next, Norton and Gino invited 247 people into their lab to reflect on the death of a loved one or the end of a relationship. To induce grief in the subjects, the social psychologists asked them to write in detail about the loss and describe the emotions and thoughts they experienced at the time it occurred. Then, the researchers divided the group in two: a ritual and a no-ritual condition. Those in the first condition were asked to write about a ritual they performed following the loss. Here, as in the previous study, many people reported private, personal, and emotionally-moving rituals that connected them to the memory of their lost loves in a deep and powerful way. After the writing exercise was over, the researchers measured the grief of the participants in both conditions. As one would expect, people in both groups became sad doing the exercise, but the people who wrote about rituals were less sad. They reported significantly less grief than those who did not write about rituals. Those in the ritual group, for example, were less inclined to endorse statements (from a standard scale used to measure grief) such as \u201cI feel that life is empty without this person,\u201d \u201cMemories of this person upset me,\u201d and \u201cI feel stunned or dazed over what happened.\u201d\n\nIn these experiments, Norton and Gino prompted people to simply write about a major loss and coping ritual. But thinking about a ritual is different from actually doing one after a loss. In their next experiment, the researchers brought 109 people into the lab and made them experience a real loss. After people did a ritual or wrote about doing one, they were more likely to report thinking that \"things were in check\" and less likely to feel \"powerless.\" They divided the participants into groups of 9 to 15 people and told them that one person in each group would randomly win $200. They then made the subjects feel attached to the money by asking them to write an essay about why they wanted to win the money and how they would spend it. The person who actually won the lottery then left the room, while the remaining people were assigned to do one of two tasks. Either they drew how they felt (the control condition) or they performed a ritual. In the ritual condition, the people were instructed to draw how they felt on a piece of paper for two minutes, then sprinkle salt over the drawing, then rip the drawing into pieces, and then count to 10 in their heads five times. After the experiment, Norton and Gino measured levels of grief in both groups. Though losing a lottery is a far cry from losing a loved one, rituals helped here, too. Those who did the ritual reported less grief than the no-ritual group. Even people who said that they don\u2019t think rituals work benefitted from doing the ritual: They didn\u2019t feel as bad about not winning the money. * * * Public mourning rituals have a clear purpose. By gathering people together around the bereaved, they help mourners strengthen their bonds and reenter the social world after a major loss. But private rituals do no such thing. They seem to serve no practical function. They seem almost pointless. Speaking of the widow who washed her husband\u2019s car each week, Norton points out, \u201cShe didn\u2019t drive the car. There was no reason to wash the car. Yet you could see clearly how it\u2019s such an emotionally meaningful thing for her.\u201d Why are these private rituals effective? How do they help mourners cope? Related Story The Secret Life of Grief One of the most common responses to loss is feeling like the world is out of control. Day to day, most people go about their lives thinking they are in command. They decide what they do, whom they see, and where they go. And death\u2014a familiar part of life in the past, when diseases were untreatable and public parks were cemeteries\u2014is now remote, for the most part unseen, and often unthought of. So the sudden death of a loved one can shock and stun. The bereaved can be overcome by a helplessness that is otherwise foreign to their lives. As Didion writes in The Year of Magical Thinking: \u201cEverything\u2019s going along as usual and then all shit breaks loose.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The psychology of rituals in overcoming loss, restoring broken order", "author": "Emily Esfahani Smith", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The psychology of rituals in overcoming loss, restoring broken order", "title": "In Grief, Try Personal Rituals", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/03/4119909522_b894500f3a_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/in-grief-try-personal-rituals/284397/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c91\"", "article_summary": "They reported significantly less grief than those who did not write about rituals.\nAmong his most provocative findings is that 50 to 60 percent of mourners show no symptoms of grief one month following the loss.\nFollowing the loss, they performed what the researchers refer to as \u201crituals\u201d in the study.\nThey also asked the participants to explain how they coped with the loss and to describe any rituals they did.\nSixty percent of mourners show no symptoms of grief one month following a loss."}
