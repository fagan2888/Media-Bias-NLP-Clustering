It was gratifying to learn from the New Jersey Herald’s report of Aug. 17, 2015, that President Obama, along with other nations, can personally seal with Iran the nuclear agreement. This will obviate the villainous idiosyncrasies of the right wing Republican members of Congress who love nothing but disruption.



From an empirical view, it will place another feather in President Obama’s hat with his list of major achievements and, in time, he may go down as one of the best presidents of modern times — a president who loves his country and its people — witness the major drop in unemployment during his administration with a subsequent increase in new jobs. He has clipped the wings of the major oil companies who are hell-bent on profit to the detriment of the environment.

Most essentially, he has given us the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which ameliorates the plight of millions of working-class people. Additionally, it ends the “freeloading” for those individuals who will now have to buy their own insurance and who had been previously showing up at emergency hospital units, placing a burden on those who already had insurance.



Witness what the Republicans want to do if they return to the White House: increase the retirement age for working Americans into their 70s and in future probably beyond; reduce Social Security benefits and Medicare, which would be nothing short of a disaster for retired people; cut taxes for corporations and billionaires and continue to inflict hardship on the poor and working class; and, with their hawkish ideology, bomb every independent, sovereign country that doesn’t agree with American “democracy.”
