Panthers finish fourth, Knights fifth in opening tournament

The Mike Stanley Invitational at Fairview High School offered different opportunities for both the host Knights and Boulder High on Saturday afternoon.

For Fairview, it was a chance to get the season started the right way, while for Boulder, the day-long event gave the Panthers multiple matches to get back on their feet and dance again.

By the end of the day, each school had a champion crowned in the 20-team event, and both finished high on the team podium, signifying their eagerness to start the season.

Boulder finished just a step ahead of Fairview in the team standings, placing fourth overall with Martin Selby grabbing the 160-pound title. The Knights had Cliff Lester's 138-pound title as their big claim.

"The whole team, I'm proud of the effort tonight," first-year Boulder coach Gilbert Espinoza said. "I just have a lot of young kids who put it out on the line. They are barely learning at this point and are starting to pick up stuff and they're wrestling some good guys. We might be a pretty good tournament team."

"I was happy with how we performed," Fairview coach Jim Lefebvre added. "We started out kind of middle of the pack and was really happy because, it's how they wrestle down the stretch that's important ... and we saw a lot of guys come back and win in consolation rounds in addition to having two in the finals. I think it sets the tone for the rest of the season."

Selby, ranked sixth in Class 5A at 170 pounds by On the Mat, had a solid day with two second-period pins and a technical fall of Standley Lake's Lorenzo Balderas in the 160 final. He got the chance to wrestle somebody new in Fairview's Dimitri Brown in the semifinals, scoring that fall in 3 minutes, 33 seconds.

His path to the top of the podium perhaps was not surprising, especially to Espinoza. But there were others in the lineup that revealed some qualities the coach did not get to see in a dual loss to Loveland.

Keaton Williams made the championship at 152 pounds, earning three pins on the way to a runner-up finish. Espinoza was also elated to see Arron Halteman wrestle back to take third place, after losing in the championship semifinals.

"Martin had a tough opponent in the final, and he just used his technical skills to come out victorious," Espinoza said. "Keaton, what can I say, he stuck everyone up to the final match. He's a go-getter."

Lester simply dominated the field for the Knights. Ranked No. 13 on the preseason rankings, Lester scored two pins, a major decision and a technical fall in what was a stacked 138-pound weight class. He beat Gateway's Jeru Smith, 13-6.

Preston Cates had similar success at 132's, but he couldn't quite get the takedown he needed to beat Rock Canyon's Josh Heifetz in the final, losing a 3-2 decision. Still, he had a pair of first-period pins that helped him feel pretty good about the way he started the season.

"Personally, I thought it was a successful tournament, but it's still early on and you don't want to peak now," Cates said, noting he had to sit a long time before his first match. "I'm excited that there's areas to improve. I'm going to get in the room and work on technique, taking shots and getting in shape."

Brown came back to take third place at 160, and Duncan Lester also placed third at 113 pounds.

"Dimitri wasn't our starting guy, he was our varsity extra, and he came all the way back which is pretty impressive," said Lefebvre. "It bodes really well for him down the road."

Niwot, Silver Creek and Lyons were also contending and had wrestlers in the championship matches. The Cougars' Tommy Stager defeated Lyons' William Hickman in the 120-pound title match, never letting Hickman get off the ground in an 8-0 major decision. Silver Creek finished sixth, buoyed by Kenny Jones' first-period pin of Ben Higgs (Widefield) at 182 pounds.

The Raptors also had Mitch Webster place second at 220 pounds, while Lyons got a third-place effort from Kanyon Raper at 145 pounds.
