The renovation and expansion of the National Western Complex would be a positive, but the proposed (but not approved) expansion of Interstate 70 east nearby adds expensive water drainage costs due to the Colorado Department of Transportation\u2019s 40-foot deep trench. Tripling the width of the highway also limits access to the National Western Complex. Lastly, the former Denver City Council\u2019s parting gesture committed $180 million in one form or another to CDOT for I-70 east (yes, some of it for yet more water drainage!), money that (still) could go toward the stock show, reducing the amount for this tax.\n\nYour decision to vote against 2C is an easy one.
