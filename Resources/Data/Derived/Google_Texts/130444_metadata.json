Photo courtesy of Stellenbosch University\n\nMere months ago, a 21-year-old South African man became the first person in the world to successfully receive a penile transplant \u2014 and now, he and his girlfriend are expecting. Dr. Andre van der Merwe, who performed the procedure at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town back in December, announced the news during a recent lecture, adding this is one of the greater markers of long-term transplant success.\n\nThe initial procedure took Merwe and his team of surgeons nine hours to complete, thinking the transplant would take two years to become fully functional. Three months after the initial procedure, the patient already appeared to be making a rapid recovery. And now it seems the patient has recovered full use of the organ.\n\nThe patient in question underwent the transplant after sustaining injuries during a ritual circumcision; the patient\u2019s entire penis had to be amputated in order to save his life. The New York Post reported on a similar incident in 2014, where a man not only lost his penis during the ritual, but he was beaten and outcast from his community for speaking out about it.\n\nThe Post added septic shock causes many fatalities, the problem most severe in the Eastern Cape. There, a reported 500 men had died as of 2014 since 2006, including 85 in 2013. Quartz added \u201cthousands of young men undergo ritual circumcision, without anaesthetic, as part of initiation in the bush \u2014 and those who have not been circumcised are ridiculed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a greater need in South Africa for [penile transplants] than elsewhere in the world, as many young men lose their penises every year due to complications from traditional circumcision,\u201d Merwe said. \u201c\u2026This is a very serious situation. For a young man of 18 or 19 years, the loss of his penis can be deeply traumatic. He doesn't necessarily have the psychological capability to process this. There are even reports of suicide among these young men.\u201d\n\nVICE reported representatives from Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Norway, and Greenland suggested ritual circumcision is a form of genital mutilation; it\u2019s in direct conflict with the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child. These rights state, \u201cChildren should have the right to express their own views and be protected from traditional rituals which may be harmful to their health.\u201d\n\nEven when the ritual is done safely, VICE added, it\u2019s not entirely. One midwife was found guilty of neglecting postoperative care for a newly circumcised infant, and the infant bled to death. While circumcision has its benefits \u2014 it reduces risk of disease, like HIV, and \u201cimproves sexual pleasure\u201d \u2014 the American Academy of Family Physicians explains adequate anesthesia is required for safety purposes.\n\nAs countries debate the persistent rituals, the success of this one man\u2019s penis transplant could prevent future botched circumcisions, possibly even award young men to opt for the ritual at all.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "first, penis, transplant, recipient, recovers, full, use, organ, announces, girlfriend", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The South African man has recovered full use of the organ quicker than expected, and it could mean relief for other young men undergoing ritual circumcision.", "title": "Why It's A Big Deal That World's 1st Penis Transplant Recipient Is Having A Baby", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/first-penis-transplant-recipient-recovers-full-use-organ-announces-girlfriend-337920", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/12/penis-transplant_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The South African man has recovered full use of the organ quicker than expected, and it could mean relief for other young men undergoing ritual circumcision.", "title": "Why It's A Big Deal That World's 1st Penis Transplant Recipient Is Having A Baby", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/first-penis-transplant-recipient-recovers-full-use-organ-announces-girlfriend-337920", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/12/penis-transplant_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/12/penis-transplant_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-06-12T13:42:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-12T14:18:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The South African man has recovered full use of the organ quicker than expected, and it could mean relief for other young men undergoing ritual circumcision."}, "article_summary": "South African man recovers full use of the organ quicker than expected, and it could mean relief for other young men undergoing ritual circumcision.\nFor a young man of 18 or 19 years, the loss of his penis can be deeply traumatic.\nAs countries debate the persistent rituals, the success of this one man\u2019s penis transplant could prevent future botched circumcisions, possibly even award young men to opt for the ritual at all.\nThe patient in question underwent the transplant after sustaining injuries during a ritual circumcision; the patient\u2019s entire penis had to be amputated in order to save his life.\nThere, a reported 500 men had died as of 2014 since 2006, including 85 in 2013."}
