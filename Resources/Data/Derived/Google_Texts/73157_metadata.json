(Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nHealth care costs and the Affordable Care Act represent the biggest concerns right now for owners of mid-sized businesses, a newly released survey shows. In part, that may be because, now four years after the legislation was passed, most of them are still uninformed about and unprepared for the rules in the health care law.\n\nMore than two-thirds (69 percent) of mid-sized business owners say they are very or extremely concerned about the costs of health coverage and other benefits, while more than half (54 percent) say they are particularly concerned with the health law, according to an annual study conducted by the research institute at payroll firm ADP.\n\nSome of that concern, the authors of the study note, may stem from that fact that fewer than half of mid-size businesses (firms that have been 50 and 999 employees) have put formal plans to manage the changes implemented under the health care law. Additionally, more than three-fourths of their owners say they aren\u2019t confident that they completely understand the new rules.\n\nOn the whole, confidence among mid-size business owners is lacking. Only half of the roughly 750 respondents expect the industry in which they work to strengthen in coming year, while far fewer \u2014 15 percent \u2014 believe the broader economy will improve.\n\nIn their report, the researchers point out that owners of mid-sized businesses often find themselves in a difficult position, in that they are \u201cexpected to operate with the agility of smaller businesses but abide by many of the same regulations that govern larger enterprises.\u201d And perhaps nowhere is that more evident than in the health law.\n\nUnder some of most important provisions of the law, companies with more than 50 employees are considered large businesses, even though many would be considered small by other federal standards (the Small Business Administration\u2019s definition generally includes firms with up to 500 workers). For example, they are not permitted to apply for small-business tax credits, shop for coverage on new employer insurance marketplaces or seek a small-business exemption to rules requiring companies to offer health coverage.\n\n\u201cA changing landscape, coupled with heightened responsibility, can take a toll on the confidence of mid-sized business owners,\u201d the authors of the study wrote. \u201cIn 2014, they seem to be struggling to find it.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t just health care concerns that are weighing heavily, though. More than half of respondents said they are very or extremely concerned with the number of government regulations. A third said they have been hit by unexpected fines or expenses in the past year resulting from noncompliance with government rules.\n\n\u201cIn 2013 alone, there were more than 19,000 proposed changes to laws and regulations that impact how businesses manage employees,\u201d Anish Rajparia, an ADP executive, said in a statement about the report. \u201cSo it comes as little surprise that the level and volume of government regulation made our list of top concerns three years running.\u201d\n\nFollow J.D.
