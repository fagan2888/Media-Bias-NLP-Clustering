School choice is "the most compelling civil rights issue of the 21st century," said Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.The potential 2016 presidential candidate spoke out about the issue during a Senate hearing on community policing that had been scheduled following the protests surrounding the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, CNN reported "When it comes to civil rights, I think there is no civil right more important than the right of every child to access a quality education," Cruz said, according to CNN."And in my view, the most compelling civil rights issue of the 21st century is the need to expand school choice and educational options so that every child, regardless of raceâ€¦has a fair opportunity to receive an excellent education."Cruz said he will focus on the issue when he takes up the chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution.Many conservatives champion the work of charter schools for boosting the fortunes of inner city or underprivileged students.Since the decision in Ferguson not to indict the officer responsible for the death of Brown, Cruz has remained silent on the issue, as have many of potential 2016 presidential hopefuls, and he has not made public statements about the decision regarding Garner.Earlier this week, Cruz met with high-powered Jewish donors that was seen by many as a precursor to a possible run for the White House in 2016. He raised eyebrows after telling attendees at an event, "I don't think I'm all that conservative."
