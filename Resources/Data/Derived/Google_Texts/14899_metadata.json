John Kasich, fighting to rise in the Republican presidential race, says he would allow U.S. companies to repatriate without penalty trillions of dollars they have earned and kept offshore and then create a new system ensuring Americans aren\u2019t double-taxed on foreign profits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for bringing the taxes down, and I\u2019m for repatriation at no charge. Just bring the money back,\u201d Mr. Kasich told The Washington Times. \u201cI would let them bring it back, and then I would have a territory program where you don\u2019t get double-taxed. You pay taxes where you do your operations. If you do an operation in Poland, then you get taxed there. And then you bring your profits home.\n\n\u201cI think it would be the most significant stimulus package we\u2019ve seen in modern times, because there are so many dollars that can come back and be invested in plants and equipment, which would help workers to get higher wages,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with The Washington Times after last week\u2019s CNBC candidates debate in Boulder, Colorado, Mr. Kasich also made clear that he intends to significantly reshape government by freezing federal hiring, privatizing certain programs and turning over others to the states backed with federal funds without the bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should hire any more people,\u201d he said. \u201cI have the lowest number of state employees in Ohio in 30 years. And that comes from managing, not hiring more people, and being able to manage things to get them done better.\u201d\n\nAmong the federal agencies, he recommended keeping the Environmental Protection Agency, which most conservatives revile, but he suggested that the Education Department, Transportation Department, Labor Department, Medicaid and foreign corporate assistance programs such as the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Protection Insurance Corp. could be radically restructured.\n\n\u201cWe need an EPA that is going to balance the environment with economic growth, using common sense like we do in Ohio. We need to do that federally,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that programs like Education, welfare, Medicaid, infrastructure, job training, all of those programs ought to be sent to the states.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t exactly call them bloc grants, but I would begin to shift the power and money and the influence,\u201d he said.\n\nMired in the single digits in the polls, Mr. Kasich has positioned himself as a common-sense fiscal conservative whose record in Ohio shows he can achieve a balanced budget, lower taxes and economic growth while appealing to non-ideological voters. He won 51 percent of the union vote in Ohio, for instance.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t overregulate, you have to reduce your taxes and you have to be fiscally responsible. And we have to take advantage of this energy boon that we have in this country,\u201d he said, succinctly repeating his stump speech agenda. \u201cAll of those things together are going to give you the kind of economic growth you want. And then you get to a balanced budget by both trimming your expenses and growing the economy.\u201d\n\nHe told The Times he has a patient strategy that plans to use the primary in New Hampshire, where votes are fiscally conservative, as a slingshot toward the upper echelon of the Republican field.\n\nAsked when he expects his poll numbers to start rising, Mr. Kasich answered: \u201cAfter New Hampshire. That\u2019s what I think. We\u2019re in for the long haul, of course.\u201d\n\nObamacare, the Fed and Paul Ryan\n\nThe Ohio governor\u2019s positioning has put him at loggerheads with some of the leading candidates in the field right now on issues such as immigration reform, Obamacare and fiscal planning. He has even suggested that some of his rivals\u2019 tax plans are \u201cfantasy.\u201d\n\nOn the trail, it has been clear that Mr. Kasich has taken aim at the fiscal policies of front-runners Donald Trump and Ben Carson, but during the interview he repeatedly declined to single out any candidates whose plans he thought were fiscally unsound. Instead, he called on the media and voters to analyze details carefully and to make sure the math adds up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said enough about all of these numbers,\u201d he said, even throwing a bone to one of his rivals: \u201cI\u2019m starting to hear that some people think maybe Ben Carson has some good ideas on Medicare.\u201d\n\nThat said, Mr. Kasich made clear he doesn\u2019t intend to change his budget-laden message. He expects the economy to come into focus when New Hampshire voters casts ballots in February.\n\nHe also made clear that he doesn\u2019t plan to alter, in the face of conservative opposition, his advocacy for a path to legalization for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country once the southern border is fully secure.\n\n\u201cYou have to register, and if you haven\u2019t violated any laws, you get a path to legalization,\u201d he said, explaining his immigration policy. \u201cIf you\u2019ve committed crimes, you will need to be deported or put in prison. But if you have been law-abiding and contributing, then I want you to have a path to legalization.\n\n\u201cBut clearly, this border has to be built, it has to be protected, and we can have no more excuses for people coming in illegally,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about whether such a position puts him in peril with conservative voters who often dominate the Republican primaries, Mr. Kasich shrugged off the concerns.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get that question in town halls. I don\u2019t get any of that. I think most people realize that if [illegals] are here and haven\u2019t broken the law, that it is impractical to be able to ship them out of the country and break up families. I just don\u2019t get any pushback on it.\u201d\n\nThe two-term Ohio governor also said any Republican reform of Obamacare must ensure that those who want health insurance can get it, even while shifting the system from federally controlled to more market-driven.\n\n\u201cI think the ultimate answer on the health insurance question is two things. One, we need to change the very model of how we do health insurance from the current system that incentivizes quantity rather than quality,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd secondly, I would basically block-grant some of the subsidy money back to the states and I would turn Medicaid back to the states and free it up.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s probably going to be a need for some state subsidy to make sure the working poor are going to get health insurance ,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have a situation where you have millions of Americans lose their health insurance.\u201d\n\nMr. Kasich said he opposes efforts by some conservatives to move the Federal Reserve under greater control of Congress, but that he believes the Fed could be more transparent and needs to be vigilant for the potential of future inflation.\n\n\u201cThe Fed should be a little more open. But I\u2019m not for turning the Fed over to Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the Fed needs to be in the position where it is watching the growth and the money supply and the whole philosophy of money because you don\u2019t want to inflate yourself into a bad situation.\u201d\n\nMr. Kasich, who served as House Budget Committee chairman when Rep. Paul Ryan worked as an aide on the panel, also gave a hearty endorsement to the new House speaker.\n\n\u201cHe and I kind of come from the same Republican bloodline: Jack Kemp, pro-growth, Ronald Reagan. That\u2019s the way I see it,\u201d he said. \u201cPaul is a very rational, reasonable leader who will promote good, aggressive pro-growth policies that will be responsible.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to be a good speaker who will bring people together. If I am president, I\u2019m going to be thrilled to work with him,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
