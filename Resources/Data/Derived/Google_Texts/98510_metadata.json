This is the first time Maxwell has publicly come forward with the story.\n\nAt the time, Maxwell was a leader in the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, which was charged with collecting emails and documents relevant to the Benghazi probe.\n\n\u201cI was not invited to that after-hours endeavor, but I heard about it and decided to check it out on a Sunday afternoon,\u201d Maxwell says.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know it then, but Maxwell would ultimately become one of four State Department officials singled out for discipline\u2014he says scapegoated\u2014then later cleared for devastating security lapses leading up to the attacks. Four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were murdered during the Benghazi attacks.\n\n\u2018Basement Operation\u2019\n\nMaxwell says the weekend document session was held in the basement of the State Department\u2019s Foggy Bottom headquarters in a room underneath the \u201cjogger\u2019s entrance.\u201d He describes it as a large space, outfitted with computers and big screen monitors, intended for emergency planning, and with small offices on the periphery.\n\nWhen he arrived, Maxwell says he observed boxes and stacks of documents. He says a State Department office director, whom Maxwell described as close to Clinton\u2019s top advisers, was there. Though the office director technically worked for him, Maxwell says he wasn\u2019t consulted about her weekend assignment.\n\n\u201cShe told me, \u2018Ray, we are to go through these stacks and pull out anything that might put anybody in the [Near Eastern Affairs] front office or the seventh floor in a bad light,\u2019\u201d says Maxwell. He says \u201cseventh floor\u201d was State Department shorthand for then-Secretary of State Clinton and her principal advisers.\n\n\u201cI asked her, \u2018But isn\u2019t that unethical?\u2019 She responded, \u2018Ray, those are our orders.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDid Hillary Clinton aides withhold damaging Benghazi documents?\n\nA few minutes after he arrived, Maxwell says, in walked two high-ranking State Department officials.\n\nIn an interview Monday morning on Fox News, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, named the two Hillary Clinton confidants who allegedly were present: One was Cheryl Mills, Clinton\u2019s chief of staff and a former White House counsel who defended President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial. The other, Chaffetz said, was Deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan, who previously worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s and then Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns.\n\n\u201cWhen Cheryl saw me, she snapped, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u201d Maxwell says. \u201cJake explained, \u2018That\u2019s Ray Maxwell, an NEA deputy assistant secretary.\u2019 She conceded, \u2018Well, OK.'\u201d\n\nMaxwell says the two officials, close confidants of Clinton, appeared to check in on the operation and soon left.\n\nMaxwell says after Mills and Sullivan arrived, he, the office director and an intern moved into a small office where they looked through some papers. Maxwell says his stack included pre-attack telegrams and cables between the U.S. embassy in Tripoli and State Department headquarters. After a short time, Maxwell says he decided to leave.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel good about it,\u201d he says.\n\nWe contacted Mills and Sullivan to ask about the allegations and the purpose of the described separation of documents, but they did not return calls or emails. We reached out to Clinton, who declined an interview request and offered no comment. A State Department spokesman told us it would have been impossible for anybody outside the Accountability Review Board (ARB) to control the flow of information because the board cultivated so many sources.\n\n\u2018Unfettered Access\u2019?\n\nWhen the ARB issued its call for documents in early October 2012, just weeks after the Benghazi attacks, the executive directorate of the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs was put in charge of collecting all emails and relevant material. It was gathered, boxed and\u2014Maxwell says\u2014ended up in the basement room prior to being turned over.\n\nIn May 2013, when critics questioned the ARB\u2019s investigation as not thorough enough, co-chairmen Ambassador Thomas Pickering and Adm. Mike Mullen responded that \u201cwe had unfettered access to everyone and everything including all the documentation we needed.\u201d\n\nMaxwell says when he heard that statement, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the ARB\u2014perhaps unknowingly\u2014had received from his bureau a scrubbed set of documents with the most damaging material missing.\n\nMaxwell also criticizes the ARB as \u201canything but independent,\u201d pointing to Mullen\u2019s admission in congressional testimony that he called Mills to give her inside advice after the ARB interviewed a potential congressional witness.\n\nIn an interview in September 2013, Pickering told me that he would not have done what Mullen did. But both co-chairmen strongly defend their probe as \u201cfiercely independent.\u201d\n\nMaxwell also criticizes the ARB for failing to interview key people at the White House, State Department and the CIA, including not only Clinton but Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides, who managed department resources in Libya; Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs Andrew Shapiro; and White House National Security Council Director for Libya Ben Fishman.\n\n\u201cThe ARB inquiry was, at best, a shoddily executed attempt at damage control, both in Foggy Bottom and on Capitol Hill,\u201d Maxwell says. He views the after-hours operation he witnessed in the State Department basement as \u201can exercise in misdirection.\u201d\n\nSullivan did not respond to emails or to messages sent to him through his current teaching job at Yale Law School. Mills did not respond to a message passed to her through Black Rock, a major global investment firm where she is on the board of directors. Clinton\u2019s press officer ultimately referred us to the State Department, though none of the three currently works there.\n\nState Department Response\n\nA State Department spokesman, Alec Gerlach, calls the implication that documents were withheld \u201ctotally without merit.\u201d Gerlach says: \u201cThe range of sources that the ARB\u2019s investigation drew on would have made it impossible for anyone outside of the ARB to control its access to information.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe allegations are as serious as it gets,\u201d says one lawmaker of the alleged Benghazi document review.\n\nGerlach says the State Department instructed all employees to cooperate \u201cfully and promptly\u201d with the ARB, which invited anyone with relevant information to contact the board directly.\n\n\u201cSo individuals with information were reaching out proactively to the board. And, the ARB was also directly engaged with individuals and the [State] Department\u2019s bureaus and offices to request information and pull on whichever threads it chose to,\u201d Gerlach says.\n\nBenghazi Select Committee\n\nMaxwell says he has been interviewed privately by several members of Congress in recent months, including Chaffetz, a member of the House Oversight Committee, and Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Chaffetz told me that Maxwell\u2019s allegations \u201cgo to the heart of the integrity of the State Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe allegations are as serious as it gets, and it\u2019s something we have obviously followed up and pursued,\u201d Chaffetz says. \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent confident the Benghazi Select Committee is going to dive deep on that issue.\u201d\n\nFormer Obama Supporter\n\nMaxwell, 58, strongly supported President Barack Obama and personally contributed to his presidential campaign. But post-Benghazi, he has soured on both Obama and Clinton, saying he had nothing to do with security and was sacrificed as a scapegoat while higher-up officials directly responsible escaped discipline.\n\nMaxwell spent a year on paid administrative leave with no official charge ever levied against him. Ultimately, the State Department cleared Maxwell of wrongdoing and reinstated him. He retired a short time later, in November 2013.\n\nMaxwell worked in foreign service for 21 years as the well-respected deputy assistant secretary for Maghreb Affairs in the Near East Bureau and is a former chief of staff to the ambassador in Baghdad. Fluent in Portuguese, Maxwell is a Navy \u201cmustanger,\u201d which means he successfully made the leap from the enlisted ranks to commissioned officer.\n\nMaxwell also is a prolific poet. While on administrative leave, he published poems online: allegories hinting at his post-Benghazi observations and experiences.\n\nA poem entitled \u201cInvitation\u201d refers to his placement on leave in December 2012: \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Henchmen / request the pleasure of your company / at a Lynching \u2014 / to be held / at 23rd and C Streets NW [State Dept. building] / on Tuesday, December 18, 2012 / just past sunset. / Dress: Formal, Masks and Hoods \u2014 / the four being lynched / must never know the identities/ of their executioners, or what/ whose sin required their sacrifice./ A blood sacrifice \u2014 / to divert the hounds- / to appease the gods \u2014 / to cleanse our filth and /satisfy our guilty consciences\u2026\u201d\n\nIn another poem called \u201cTrapped in a purgatory of their own deceit,\u201d Maxwell wrote: \u201cThe web of lies they weave / gets tighter and tighter / in its deceit / until it bottoms out \u2014 / at a very low frequency \u2014 / and implodes\u2026Yet all the while, / the more they talk, / the more they lie, / and the deeper down the hole they go\u2026 Just wait\u2026/ just wait and feed them the rope.\u201d\n\nSeveral weeks after he was placed on leave with no formal accusations, Maxwell made an appointment to address his status with a State Department ombudsman.\n\n\u201cShe told me, \u2018You are taking this all too personally, Raymond. It is not about you,\u2019 \u201d Maxwell recalls.\n\n\u201cI told her that \u2018My name is on TV and I\u2019m on administrative leave, it seems like it\u2019s about me.\u2019 Then she said, \u2018You\u2019re not harmed, you\u2019re still getting paid. Don\u2019t watch TV. Take your wife on a cruise. It\u2019s not about you; it\u2019s about Hillary and 2016.\u2019 \u201c\n\nSince retiring from the State Department, Maxwell has obtained a master\u2019s degree in library information science.\n\nThis is a Daily Signal special feature.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton confidants were allegedly part of operation to \u201cseparate\u201d damaging documents before they were turned over to team investigating the attacks.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Hillary Clinton confidants were allegedly part of operation to \u201cseparate\u201d damaging documents before they were turned over to team investigating the attacks.", "title": "Did Clinton Aides Withhold Damaging Benghazi Documents?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/cnpphotos042907.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-22T12:03:06+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tTxlK5"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Hillary Clinton confidants were allegedly part of operation to \u201cseparate\u201d damaging documents before they were turned over to team investigating the attacks.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/cnpphotos042907.jpg"}, "title": "Did Clinton Aides Withhold Damaging Benghazi Documents?", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2014-09-15T06:01:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-22T12:03:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "benghazi, state department, Benghazi Accountability Review Board, hillary clinton, raymond maxwell, trey gowdy, jason chaffetz, house select committee on benghazi"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe6c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI asked her, \u2018But isn\u2019t that unethical?\u2019 She responded, \u2018Ray, those are our orders.\u2019 \u201dDid Hillary Clinton aides withhold damaging Benghazi documents?\nHe says \u201cseventh floor\u201d was State Department shorthand for then-Secretary of State Clinton and her principal advisers.\nNew Benghazi allegation puts spotlight on Hillary Clinton confidants, alleged after-hours document review.\nClinton\u2019s press officer ultimately referred us to the State Department, though none of the three currently works there.\nHe says a State Department office director, whom Maxwell described as close to Clinton\u2019s top advisers, was there."}
