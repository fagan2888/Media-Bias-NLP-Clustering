He approved another Phase 3 clinical trial of solanezumab, this time in only mild Alzheimer's patients. Lilly has not said how much that decision cost, but the typical Phase 3 clinical trial will set a company back by hundreds of millions of dollars, according to research by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development.\n\n\n\nBut so far, Lechleiter\u2019s bet appears to be paying off. Investor excitement about the Alzheimer\u2019s is a big reason Lilly\u2019s shares have surged more than 40 percent this year. Lilly\u2019s shares closed Thursday at $86.76 apiece\u2014levels the stock, whena adjusted for dividend payments, hasn\u2019t seen since 2000.\n\n\n\nAnd on Wednesday, the company said its latest study of the drug gave even stronger evidence that it is altering the course of Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2014albeit modestly\u2014which is something no other drug has even been shown to do in a Phase 3 clinical trial.\n\n\n\nAnalysts still question whether solanezumab has enough effect to be meaningful to patients, but with no other effective drugs on the market, they still figure it will be the biggest blockbuster in Lilly\u2019s history\u2014with sales between $5 billion and $10 billion.\n\n\n\nSwedish, a Virginia native, already took a huge risk\u2014jumping from a more than 35-year career running hospitals to take the tiller at Anthem, the nation\u2019s second largest health insurer.\n\n\n\nBut then he continued Anthem\u2019s history of audacious mergers\u2014roughly the same strategy the company has used for the past 25 years to turn from a struggling single-state Blue Cross plan into an industry behemoth.\n\n\n\nIt would have been easier for Swedish, who is likely close to retirement, to sell Anthem to Cigna, which has a CEO that\u2019s 20 years younger\u2014and walk away with tens of millions in golden parachute payments.\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not his nature. He\u2019s a big-game hunter (or, more precisely, a big fish hunter).\n\n\n\nWhen I first interviewed Swedish back in April 2013, he talked about how \u201cmanaging at scale\u201d was one of the key skills he had developed in his career. And he clearly was interested to put it to use.\n\n\n\nSo instead of cashing out, Swedish has worked for a year to strike a $48 billion merger with Cigna. Investors like the deal. And analysts say it\u2019s critical for insurers to get bigger if they want to survive and thrive in the new Obamacare era.\n\n\n\nJust consider the size of this deal\u2014the largest in the history of the health insurance industry and certainly the largest in Indiana. It\u2019s nearly twice as large as the deal in 2006 when Indianapolis-based Guidant sold itself to Boston Scientific Corp. And its nearly three times larger than the mammoth deal a decade ago between Anthem and California-based WellPoint.\n\n\n\nNot only that, Swedish has fought hard to remain CEO. If he\u2019s fighting just as hard to keep the Anthem headquarters in Indianapolis, the $48 billion deal would make Indianapolis home to one of the nation\u2019s 20 largest companies, according to Fortune magazine\u2019s annual Fortune 500 ranking.\n\n\n\nThe wealth and talent that come with a major corporate headquarters would be a huge boon for a city that has, for decades, been mostly bereft of major corporate headquarters and, more often than not, seen its promising companies acquired\u2014rather than be the acquirers.\n\n\n\nKeeping the CEO local is a good way to make that happen, concluded former Arvin Industries CEO Bill Hunt in his recent \u201cmea-culpa\u201d about his role in transferring the Arvin headquarters from Indiana to Ohio.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn closing, I largely concur with your conclusion that the \u201cnitty-gritty details of a deal can make all the difference to a community,\u2019\u201d Hunt wrote in response to an IBJ editorial about the Anthem-Cigna deal. \u201cThe \u2018nitty-grittiest\u2019 detail is the selection of the CEO at the date of merger. From that decision most of the consequences flow.\n\n\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope,\u201d he added, \u201cAnthem remains an \u2018anchor tenant\u2019 in the Indiana business community.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed, the state needs to hang on to all riverboat gamblers and big-game hunters it can.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hoosiers have a reputation for being risk averse. \u00a0 We like to see what works well elsewhere, and see what doesn\u2019t, and then chart a safe, steady course. \u00a0 But Eli Lilly\u2019s John Lechleiter and Anthem\u2019s Joe Swedish\u2014a couple of transplants to the state\u2014are making national news this week for leading their Indiana-based companies to take huge risks\u2014and are being handsomely rewarded for doing so.", "csrf-token": "ZKZ3bVTTpEuGjJd0ruXFr3TYjELDNey0JlA1PfCzyJQ=", "twitter": {"description": "The CEOs of Eli Lilly and Anthem are being rewarded by investors for taking high-risk approaches to develop breakthrough drugs, make major acquisitions.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lilly, Anthem show high risk, high reward strategy can pay off"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/aa-stock-images/og-logo.jpg", "type": "Article", "description": "The CEOs of Eli Lilly and Anthem are being rewarded by investors for taking high-risk approaches to develop breakthrough drugs, make major acquisitions.", "title": "Lilly, Anthem show high risk, high reward strategy can pay off"}, "keywords": "Alzheimer's,Anthem,Arvin,Bill Hunt,Cigna,Eli Lilly,Joe Swedish,John Lechleiter,Lilly,Solanezumab,clinical trial,drugs,health care,health insurance,life sciences,merger,pharmaceutical", "google-site-verification": "dEpdCgWEqtwBQ26es3xvj1hiJAdg_f1dGEb3ojELomo", "verify-v1": "g4IS1SbAtb6k021/9HzhkZ2B++kYDaZ8FN48PiruaO8=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "First, back in 2008, Lechleiter made the decision to push two Lilly drugs quickly into expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.\nHe approved another Phase 3 clinical trial of solanezumab, this time in only mild Alzheimer's patients.\nInvestor excitement about the Alzheimer\u2019s is a big reason Lilly\u2019s shares have surged more than 40 percent this year.\nWe like to see what works well elsewhere, and see what doesn\u2019t, and then chart a safe, steady course.\nBut while Lilly\u2019s researchers were presenting slides on the solanezumab data to him, including on just how the patients with mild Alzheimer\u2019s had fared, Lechleiter interjected."}
