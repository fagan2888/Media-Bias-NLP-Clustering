Knightdale will open its farmers market at the newish Knightdale Station Park, which opened last year.

The market runs 8 a.m. to noon, Saturdays, starting this weekend through Oct. 11.

Vendors will be selling fresh produce and vegetables, along with baked goods, meat, seafood, eggs and other items. Live music and other activities, including a food truck rodeo this Saturday, are planned.

Plus, you've got the fun playground at Knightdale Station. I'll be working this into my weekend at some point for breakfast and play and to pick up some local produce.

The park is at 810 N. 1st Ave., Knightdale.
