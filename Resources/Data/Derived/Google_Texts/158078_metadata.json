Unfortunately, the team, which was famously portrayed in the 1993 Disney classic Cool Runnings, has run into a bit of a money problem again. This time they need to raise $80,000 in the next week in order to get to Sochi. As sled driver Winston Watt told the Associated Press on Saturday, \u201cRight now, we\u2019re at zero.\u201d\n\nRelated: Crowdfunding Promoted to Help Small Businesses\n\nNot to worry, guys. the Internet is on it.\n\nSo far, in less than three days, Crowdfunding, Reddit and virtual currency have combined to raise approximately $56,300, according to Mashable. Indiegogo and Crowdtilt, two major crowdfunding platforms, have raised a combined $26,458. The rest of the donations have primarily been drummed up on Reddit.\n\nAs an example, one post on the dogecoin subreddit titled, \u201cLet\u2019s send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Winter Olympics!\u201d encouraged viewers to donate using dogecoins, a virtual currency similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThe bobsled team\u2019s twitter account has also been helping drive traffic to the crowdfunding websites in order to meet their goal. This isn\u2019t the first time the team struggled for funding, when they competed in the 1988 games in Calgary, as depicted in the movie, the team had to scrounge for funding from U.S. businessmen and the president of the Jamaica Olympic Association.\n\nTechnology has transformed fundraising in the past few years. Now crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have become major resources for everything from startups to science research and more. Some individuals have even used the fundraising sites as tools to bankroll their own personal expenses like college tuition.\n\nIf the team meets its goal, this will be the first time an Olympic team (and a potential movie sequel) has been funded through Internet donations.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, get on up, it\u2019s bobsled time\u2026Cool Runnings\u20262?", "title": "Jamaican Bobsled Team Could Go to Olympics in 2014\u2026Thanks to Crowdfunding", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/20/Jamaican-Bobsled-Team-Could-Go-Olympics-2014-Thanks-Crowdfunding", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/CoolRunnings.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/20/Jamaican-Bobsled-Team-Could-Go-Olympics-2014-Thanks-Crowdfunding", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/CoolRunnings.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, get on up, it\u2019s bobsled time\u2026Cool Runnings\u20262?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "After a 12-year hiatus, the Jamaican bobsled team announced Saturday that it has qualified to compete in the Olympic games.\nIf the team meets its goal, this will be the first time an Olympic team (and a potential movie sequel) has been funded through Internet donations.\nAs an example, one post on the dogecoin subreddit titled, \u201cLet\u2019s send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Winter Olympics!\u201d encouraged viewers to donate using dogecoins, a virtual currency similar to Bitcoin.\nNow crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have become major resources for everything from startups to science research and more.\nIndiegogo and Crowdtilt, two major crowdfunding platforms, have raised a combined $26,458."}
