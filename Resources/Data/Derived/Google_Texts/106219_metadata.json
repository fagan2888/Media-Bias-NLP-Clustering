With the exception of anal cancer, treatment rates differed significantly between HIV-infected people and those who weren\u2019t infected, according to the study.\n\nFor example, 33 percent of patients with HIV and lung cancer failed to receive any treatment for the cancer compared with 14 percent of those who weren\u2019t infected. Similarly, 44 percent of people who were HIV positive didn\u2019t receive treatment for upper GI cancer versus 18 percent of those where weren\u2019t infected with HIV. Twenty-four percent of men with prostate cancer who were HIV positive didn\u2019t get treatment compared with 7 percent of non-HIV infected men.\n\nFor example, 33 percent of patients with HIV and lung cancer failed to receive any treatment for the cancer compared with 14 percent of those who weren\u2019t infected.\n\nCancer treatment was defined as radiation, chemotherapy and/or surgery.\n\n\u201cTo have made such great strides with treating HIV only to have them succumb to cancer is devastating,\u201d said Dr. Gita Suneja, a radiation oncologist at the University of Utah\u2019s Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City and the lead author of the study. It was published online this month in the journal Cancer.\n\nThe study used the National Cancer Data Base to analyze treatment for adults younger than 65 who were diagnosed with any of the 10 most common cancers to affect HIV patients between 2003 and 2011. The study included 10,265 HIV-infected adults and 2.2 million without HIV.\n\nThe data base, which is sponsored by the American Cancer Society and the American College of Surgeons, captures roughly 70 percent of newly diagnosed cancer cases in the United States.\n\nThe study noted that more than a third of the patients with HIV had stage 4 cancer \u2014 cancer that has metastasized \u2014 when they were diagnosed, while only 19 percent of those without HIV did.\n\nImprovements in antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV have helped reduce the incidence of cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma that are closely linked to AIDS, but rates for other cancers often associated with normal aging have increased among HIV patients. In addition, people with HIV have a higher incidence of some lifestyle-related cancers, such as lung cancer, which could be linked to higher rates of smoking. Cancer is now the second most common cause of death among HIV-infected people, behind AIDS-related causes.\n\nHIV patients are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured, and lack of coverage can affect access to cancer care. But having insurance didn\u2019t eliminate the problem: privately insured people with HIV were significantly more likely to be untreated for many cancers than were privately insured people without HIV, the study found.\n\n\u201cWe know that people with Medicaid or who are uninsured receive subpar cancer treatment, and that\u2019s a big public health issue,\u201d said Suneja. \u201cBut even factoring that in, HIV-infected people are still less likely to receive cancer treatment. That means there are other drivers that we couldn\u2019t measure in the study.\u201d\n\nDisparities in cancer treatment could exist for several reasons. For one thing, for most cancers there are no national treatment guidelines for HIV-infected patients, Suneja said. One of the few exceptions is anal cancer, the only cancer for which the study found little discrepancy in treatment among HIV-infected and non-infected patients. According to the research, the difference among those not receiving treatment was 4.8 percent for HIV patients versus 3.1 percent for others.\n\nFor other cancers, \u201cthe oncologist may pause and ask, \u2018Does the HIV infection mean they shouldn\u2019t get standard cancer treatment?\u2019\u201d Suneja added.\n\nPlease contact Kaiser Health News to send comments or ideas for future topics for the Insuring Your Health column.\n\n3\n\nEMAIL\n\nBY KAISER HEALTH NEWS February 11, 2014 at 4:56 PM EDT\n\nOn Monday the Obama administration announced another delay in rolling out the Affordable Care Act, weakening the requirement to offer coverage next year for large employers and postponing it for smaller ones. Here\u2019s what it means.\n\nThe Obama administration pressed the pause button on part of the health law again.

Kaiser Health News reporters explain what it means for employers, employees \u2014 and politicians. Getty Images\n\nThere have been other delays in health-law implementation. What\u2019s different about this one?\n\nThis is the second big change to rules for employers. The ACA requirement for employers with at least 50 workers to offer minimum coverage \u2014 or pay a fine \u2014 was supposed to take effect in January. But after getting complaints from business ,the administration said last summer it would wait until 2015 to penalize employers that didn\u2019t offer coverage.\n\nNow the administration has moved the deadlines again. Companies with 50 to 99 employees won\u2019t have to offer minimum coverage until 2016. And companies with at least 100 employees are required to offer minimum coverage to only 70 percent of their workers in 2015, down from a previous target of 95 percent.\n\nWill this affect me?\n\nIf you work fulltime for a large company, probably not. Most employers with at least 100 workers already offer a medical plan because it helps them hire and retain talent, not because of a government rule.\n\n\u201cFor the majority of large employers \u2026 neither the employees nor the employer are going to see that much of a difference,\u201d says Steve Wojcik, vice president for public policy at the National Business Group on Health, a big-business coalition.\n\nEmployers with staffs under 50 have always been exempt from the coverage requirement. (Still, many do offer health insurance.) They are likely to be untouched, although growing businesses that had been reluctant to go over the 50-worker threshold may feel freer to hire.\n\nCompanies most affected are those in the 50-to-99 employee slot and large retailers and restaurant chains, many of which don\u2019t offer coverage to many employees now.\n\n\u201cI imagine we\u2019ll have some employers in that space who were not offering coverage before and were gearing up to offer it in 2015,\u201d said Edward Fensholt, director of compliance services for Lockton Benefit Group. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably be delighted with the delay.\u201d\n\nI work a flexible schedule for a big retailer. Does this delay my access to company health coverage?\n\nIt might. But it also might delay a cut in your hours. Once the ACA is fully implemented, large companies must offer coverage to anybody who puts in at least 30 hours a week. Analysts expect big-box chains, restaurants and hotels to offer insurance to some workers who currently lack it but also to limit hours for others to avoid coverage requirements.\n\nShrinking the big-employer target in 2015 from insuring nearly all workers to 70 percent gives more time for those adjustments to take place, analysts say.\n\nThere are elections in November. Isn\u2019t this mainly about Democratic damage control?\n\nThat\u2019s what Republicans say. Besides seeing the delay as new evidence that the law is fatally flawed, they depict it as political camouflage for vulnerable Democrats, as a way to avoid potential October stories blaming job-market disruption on the health law.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., said Democrats don\u2019t believe they \u201ccan survive politically if Obamacare is allowed to fully go into effect. This is just one more admission that the law is bad for hardworking taxpayers and American employers.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say the extension is about giving employers more leeway to comply with a very complex law.\n\nDo I have to still buy coverage if my employer doesn\u2019t offer it?\n\nIn most cases, yes. Unless you get an exemption, you must enroll by March 31 or pay a penalty.\n\nPeople whose companies don\u2019t offer coverage can purchase insurance in online state and federal marketplaces. If they earn less than $46,960 for an individual or $78,120 for a family of three, they could qualify for a subsidy.\n\nWhy do employers get a reprieve from ACA requirements but not individuals?\n\nIt\u2019s a question many are asking. Some believe the administration will yield to pressure to delay the mandate for individuals, especially since so many of the online marketplaces proved difficult to navigate.\n\n\u201cHow are you going to penalize people who didn\u2019t make it through the system?\u201d wonders Joseph Antos, a health care economist at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nInsurance companies, which need as much participation as possible to make individual coverage financially sustainable, would sharply oppose such a move. Unfortunately for Democrats, that nuance might be lost on voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain to the electorate that [postponing the individual mandate] would subvert the risk pool,\u201d said Dan Mendelson, head of consultant Avalere Health.\n\nWill this pacify critics?\n\nNo. True, the National Retail Federation\u2019s Neil Trautwein said the administration should get \u201ca gold medal\u201d for \u201cits agility and flexibility\u201d in working with employers.\n\nBut the change doesn\u2019t affect that many companies. And it delivers a new talking point to opponents who say the law is unworkable.\n\n\u201cEmployers know they have the administration on the run,\u201d said Robert Laszewski, an insurance consultant and former industry executive. \u201cPutting this off one more year isn\u2019t going to mollify them. They are more mad now because they are more convinced they are right.\u201d\n\nJay Hancock, Julie Appleby and Mary Agnes Carey wrote this report.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
