The fastball velocity that he once used to overwhelm hitters is now relatively tame, coming in at 87-88 mph. It might not be accurate to label Lincecum a \u201cfinesse pitcher,\u201d but he definitely has to hit his spots and throw a variety of pitches in order to be effective. He\u2019ll face the Rockies on Wednesday night at AT&T Park, and if the Rockies aren\u2019t patient, he can make them look silly. In San Diego on Friday night, Lincecum threw seven shutout innings, allowing four hits.\n\nBackground: There was a time when Lincecum really was \u201cThe Freak.\u201d He threw a 94 mph fastball that peaked at 99, with a diabolical curveball that froze even the best of hitters. Though he\u2019s only about 5-foot-7 (he\u2019s generously listed at 5-11), he was a giant on the mound, winning two National League Cy Young Awards.\n\nSaunders\u2019 take: The press box at AT&T sits low and in a perfect place to study a pitcher\u2019s delivery. Lincecum\u2019s long stride and whiplike motion has always been wondrous to watch. The motion is still there, even if the results have dimmed. He was 12-9 with a 4.74 ERA last season, but it will still be interesting to see how the Rockies deal with the reinvented Lincecum.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Tim Lincecum has been forced to reinvent himself as a starting pitcher.
