The law empowered the Department of Health and Human Services to compel employers to provide contraception and abortion-inducing drugs and devices to their employees through their health-insurance plans.\n\nThe case of Priests for Life vs. HHS, one of seven cases comprising Zubik vs. Burwell, now challenges that mandate in the Supreme Court, with oral arguments on March 23.\n\nOf the 37 plaintiffs in the current Supreme Court case \u2014 including the Little Sisters of the Poor, the Archbishop of Washington, DC, and Geneva College \u2014 we were the first to challenge the HHS mandate, which violates not only our beliefs, but is a head-on collision with the very purpose of our ministry, which is to lead people away from abortion rather than expanding access to it.\n\nAs our case progressed, it reached the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, on which President Obama\u2019s new Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, joined a 6-3 vote to deny us a hearing by the full court. As we pressed on, Priests for Life vs. HHS made it to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe contraception rule is unevenly enforced. Parish churches are exempt, and yet religious nonprofits like Priests for Life, who send our priests into those same churches and share in the same faith, aren\u2019t.\n\nBy what standard do Uncle Sam\u2019s bureaucrats determine that some priests are more Catholic than others?\n\nThe government did come up with what it calls an \u201caccommodation.\u201d But the government itself describes the accommodation as a way for objectors to comply with the mandate, hence leaving our religious freedom still burdened.\n\nWell, this objector will not comply.\n\nA priest\u2019s mission is to nurture the exercise of religion in those to whom he ministers. Yet the mandate would require us to violate that religion, in full view of those we teach to live it.\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual place to find myself after almost 28 years in the priesthood, as the feds sit in judgment on our beliefs. The government may disagree with our religious objections, but isn\u2019t free to discredit them.\n\nThe government wants our help to assure that nobody who wants coverage for abortion-inducing drugs and contraceptives will lack it. Yet in all the years of Priests for Life, not a single employee has ever objected that our insurance doesn\u2019t cover these things.\n\nIn fact, when I first announced our lawsuit in February 2012, all our employees applauded. No one on our staff wants Priests for Life to compromise its faith, even though this court battle could cause them to lose their health insurance or even their jobs.\n\nIf we refuse to abide by the mandate, we\u2019ll be fined so heavily that it could threaten our existence.\n\nI\u2019ve led the New-York based Priests for Life since 1993. Its goal is to restore protection to children in the womb. We train the clergy and their churches in providing alternatives to abortion for those who feel they have no choice, and compassionate counseling through Rachel\u2019s Vineyard, the largest ministry in the world for healing after abortion.\n\nOur Silent No More Awareness Campaign gives voice to women and men who regret their abortion experiences and say so publicly. We\u2019re a registered NGO at the United Nations. Rev. Martin Luther King\u2019s niece, Alveda King, leads our African-American outreach, and is a co-plaintiff in our case.\n\nThe government doesn\u2019t dispute the sincerity of our beliefs, nor the fact that it\u2019s pressuring us to violate those beliefs. This is a textbook case of a burden on religious freedom that the law does not allow.\n\nOur case is not about making abortion or contraception illegal. It\u2019s simply an objection to being forced to choose between following our faith and following the law. Every American should be free to do both at the same time.\n\nFr.
