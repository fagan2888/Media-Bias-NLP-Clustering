The subsidies available on the health care exchanges seem to be based on adjusted gross income (line 37 on Form 1040)\u2013 and there\u2019s a huge, conspicuous difference between the subsidy available at, say, a $25,000 income and a $46,000 income. (The subsidy cutoff of is $45,960 for a single person). In California, for the \u201cbronze\u201d policy I\u2019m interested in, at $46,000 I\u2019d pay $507 a month. At $25,000 I\u2019d pay \u2026 $63. A difference of $444 a month.\n\nSure there\u2019s always an incentive to cheat on your taxes (assuming you don\u2019t get caught). But people in this income range don\u2019t pay much in income taxes to cheat on\u2013this is basically the 15% bracket. Lower your income by $20,000 and you save $3,000. They also pay FICA payroll taxes (though they get something in exchange\u2013more Social Security benefits). FICA taxes are a maximum of about 15% for the self-employed in that range. Lower your earnings from $46,000 to $25,000 and you save another $3,000 and change. The Obamacare cheating bonus\u2013$5,328, in the above example\u2013dwarfs either of those incentives, and almost doubles the payoff for understating your income. Save on income taxes and FICA and get near-free health insurance too!\n\nOf course, it\u2019s mainly the self-employed who are able to fudge their incomes\u2013no annoying w-2 forms, lots of loosely characterizable deductions. Don\u2019t expect to see a lot of freelancers with $46,000 incomes next year.\n\nIndeed, if you go onto the California Obamacare web site (www.CoveredCa.com) and tell them you have an income of $46,000 you get a helpful little notice:\n\nYour Annual Income is just above the boundary for premium assistance \u2013 please be sure you have entered an accurate income.\n\nTranslation: \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to cheat us just a little?\u201d (wink wink). ** Maybe that visit to your girlfriend in Florida was really a trip to scout business leads. Yeah, it\u2019s all coming back now! If you can get your AGI down by just $100 to $45,900, your Obamacare subsidy jumps from 0 to $225 a month.\n\nIn fact it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if there\u2019s an unexpected dip in reported incomes in the entire $25-$46,000 income range next year.\n\n_____\n\n**\u2013The California site gives an equivalent notice if you come in a few dollars below the cutoff: \u201cYour Annual Income is just below the boundary for premium assistance \u2013 please be sure you have entered an accurate income.\u201d This may be the clearest example of false symmetry ever discovered.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mickey Kaus", "description": "Dept. of Maybe-Not-So-Unintended Consequences: Doesn't Obamacare create a big new incentive to fudge your income on your tax returns?
