Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin called himself “aggressively normal” in the first Republican presidential debate — and saw his poll numbers go backward.

Now he’s highlighting the “aggressive” part.

In an interview with John Harwood in Manchester, N.H., he hit his Republican rival John Kasich, assailing his expansion of Medicaid as governor of Ohio, calling it “precisely what’s wrong” with government. He accused Republican senators, including Marco Rubio of Florida, of “procedural talk” in saying they can’t repeal the Affordable Care Act during President Obama’s tenure, and said Hillary Rodham Clinton’s handling of her email as secretary of state disqualifies her from the White House race.

As for the mood of American voters, the scrappy Mr. Walker declared, “Right now people do want a fight.”
