However, the Department of Health and Human Services issued guidelines in March reiterating that same-sex couples, who were legally married in any of the states that currently authorize gay marriage, are entitled to the same coverage as heterosexual couples.\n\n\u201cUnder this CMS rule, if a health insurer offers coverage for opposite-sex spouses, then the insurer must also offer coverage to same-sex spouses that are legally married in any state regardless of the state of residence,\u201d company spokeswoman Koko Mackin wrote in an email.\n\nThe Obama administration in March urged insurers to voluntarily comply. It becomes a requirement for coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2015, according to the HHS guidance.\n\nMark Fowler, a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Insurance, said the department did not know how many companies in Alabama were currently offering spousal coverage to legally married gay couples.\n\nThe requirement applies to underwritten insurance plans, and includes both those sold on the federal insurance exchange and many, but not all, of the plans sold to directly to individuals and companies.\n\nPlans grandfathered in under the Affordable Care Act and self-insured plans, where large employers run their own programs, were not affected by the federal rule.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 14 Dec 2014 09:44:14 -0400", "Description": "Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Associated Press", "title": "Blue Cross extends coverage to married gay couples", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/wires/blue-cross-extends-coverage-to-married-gay-couples-20141214/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-12-14T09:44:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Blue Cross extends coverage to married gay couples"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-12-14T09:44:14Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-12-14T09:44:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd488\"", "article_summary": "Associated PressMONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2013 Alabama\u2019s largest insurer now offers spousal coverage to legally married gay couples in order to comply with a federal rule that insurance companies must treat married couples the same regardless of sexual orientation.\nMark Fowler, a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Insurance, said the department did not know how many companies in Alabama were currently offering spousal coverage to legally married gay couples.\nHowever, the Department of Health and Human Services issued guidelines in March reiterating that same-sex couples, who were legally married in any of the states that currently authorize gay marriage, are entitled to the same coverage as heterosexual couples.\nThe requirement applies to underwritten insurance plans, and includes both those sold on the federal insurance exchange and many, but not all, of the plans sold to directly to individuals and companies.\nIt becomes a requirement for coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2015, according to the HHS guidance."}
