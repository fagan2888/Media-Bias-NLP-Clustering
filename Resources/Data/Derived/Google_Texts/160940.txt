EDITOR: As president of the Portage County Crime Stoppers I would like to extend an invitation to join us in our first public fundraiser.

We are holding a Johnny Cash Tribute at Sentry Theater on Sunday, Aug. 28. Doors open at 4:30 p.m. and the concert will begin at 5:30 p.m. The tribute performer is Terry Lee Goffey and from what I have seen, it looks to be a great show.

Some of you have already been contacted by phone to contribute. The callers will be working diligently for the next couple months contacting individuals about the show. If you have any concerns or questions, please contact your police department or sheriff’s office and they will get you in contact with someone to answer any questions you may have. Crime Stoppers is a non- profit 501(c)3 corporation.

The reason for having a fundraiser such as this is that we are in the process of implementing the Tip Soft crime reporting service. Almost every county in the state is using this system which is in part a benefit to the Crime Stoppers as all the CS organizations can now interact with each other much more easily.

The other important factor is one more layer of anonymity for tip callers using the service. All of the calls made up to now by tipsters are anonymous, but we now have a text-tip service to compliment a phone call. Text “Tip1301” plus your tip to 274637 (crimes) or you can use our Facebook page to report a tip.

Thank you and again please join us on Sunday, Aug. 28, for a show you will not want to miss.

Greg Swan, president
