Here\u2019s some of what they said:\n\nOn game statuses:\n\n\u201cOut: [QB] Peyton [Manning], [S] T.J. [Ward] and [ILB] Danny Trevathan are out. Guys that are questionable: [S David] Bruton [Jr.], [TE] Vernon Davis, [RB] C.J. Anderson, [RB] Ronnie Hillman, [S] Omar Bolden, and [WR Andre] Bubba Caldwell. They\u2019re all questionable. I\u2019m missing one here, [WR] Bennie [Fowler] is questionable, too. Probable: [NT Sylvester] Sly [Williams] is probable. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve missed anybody did I, [Vice President of Public Relations] Patrick [Smyth]? If you want to ask about anybody in particular go ahead. It\u2019s so long I\u2019m not going to sit here and read off of it.\u201d\n\nOn the running backs for Sunday\n\n\u201cRonnie is good. Ronnie practiced today. C.J. did not. He\u2019s still sore, still very sore. I think that we still have a chance of getting him to game day and being available for us, but [RB] Juwan [Thompson] has had a good week. Ronnie looks fine. We\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll go from there, but I think C.J. still has a shot.\u201d\n\nOn if the goal is to have three running backs in uniform on Sunday\n\n\u201cYeah, obviously you want that. I\u2019ve played with two before. On a given day, you kind of have some emergency ways that you could go about it. We just kind of have to look at the big picture right now. We have through tomorrow to make some of those decisions, look at the big picture and see what we think gives us the best chance this weekend.\u201d\n\nOn Bruton\u2019s participation in practice\n\n\u201cBrute [Bruton] actually came out to do just a little bit today. He\u2019s still really, really sore. We thought between him and Omar that he may have the better chance of the two to maybe give us a little help this weekend, but we\u2019ll have to see where he is. He\u2019s pretty sore today.\u201d\n\nOn if Thompson will start at running back\n\n\u201cNo, Ronnie is ready to go. Ronnie will start. Ronnie is ready to go. He practiced well today. I think he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nOn his confidence in S Josh Bush\n\n\u201cThe good news is that he was with us throughout the course of the offseason and played a little bit last week, so I\u2019m comfortable. I think that getting [S] Shiloh [Keo] here, knowing our defense and the situation that we\u2019re in that he can go in there and know exactly what\u2019s going on, which is really important to us right now. Probably the biggest thing is that it\u2019s filtered through special teams and those types of things have some big concerns. We just have to muster it up and find a way. That\u2019s part of what we do.\u201d\n\nOn if he has concerns with the special teams because of all of the injuries\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably been the biggest challenge right now because some of those guys have moved up in what they\u2019re doing. It stretches you a little bit. David does a lot for us special teams-wise as the punt protect and those type of things. Yeah, that\u2019s been a big challenge.\u201d\n\nOn if Manning will be on the sideline for Sunday\u2019s game\n\n\u201cYou know what, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to talk to him. He could definitely, but if he wants to do it exactly like we did against New England\u2014if he wants to do it there and is more comfortable doing that, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll have to visit with him, but he worked out this morning and worked out well.\u201d\n\nOn Davis and Trevathan\u2019s status in the concussion protocol\n\n\u201cVernon is expected to clear this afternoon and be fine. He still, obviously, hasn\u2019t passed the final test, but he has practiced well and has done well. Obviously, Danny is out.\u201d\n\nOn if ILB Todd Davis would start in place of Trevathan\n\n\u201cYeah, Todd is going to start. We\u2019re actually sliding [ILB] Brandon [Marshall] over and Todd will start, so those two will work inside.\u201d\n\nOn what he likes about Todd Davis\n\n\u201cI like him a lot. He\u2019s very detailed. I\u2019ll say this, no player has had a better week of practice than that guy from me watching practice. I\u2019m excited to see him play. There\u2019s a lot on his plate. He still does special teams stuff and those types of things, but he\u2019s worked really hard for this opportunity, so I\u2019m excited to watch him play.\u201d\n\nOn OLB DeMarcus Ware\u2019s status\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Probable. He has a good chance. Put him in that category.\u201d\n\nINSIDE LINEBACKER TODD DAVIS\n\nOn starting on Sunday\n\n\u201cIt feels great. It\u2019s a great opportunity for me. The defense is playing so well, so it\u2019s just a tremendous blessing to be able to come in and be able to play on a defense that\u2019s doing so well. I know that [ILB] Danny [Trevathan] is going to get back healthy, but in the meantime, I\u2019m going to take full advantage of the opportunity.\u201d\n\nOn how prepared he is for the opportunity to start\n\n\u201cI feel really prepared, now. It\u2019s definitely better being here the full time instead of the two weeks before. It\u2019s definitely great going in and then having the team chemistry that I have now. It\u2019s a lot different going into a game knowing everybody that you\u2019re playing with and having such a close bond with everybody.\u201d\n\nOn extra work this summer with injuries to Trevathan and ILB Brandon Marshall\n\n\u201cIt helped me a lot. It was a lot of time for me to grow as a player coming from my rookie year to my sophomore, it definitely helped a lot. It helped me grow taking reps with the ones a lot. It was a great time for me to grow as a player.\u201d\n\nOn his excitement to start\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited. I can\u2019t wait to get out there and play. One of the very first games that I started last year was against the Raiders. It feels good.\u201d\n\nOn if he doesn\u2019t expect a drop-off in defensive performance despite injuries\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen a lot of guys come in when people have been injured. [OLB Shaquil] Shaq [Barrett] and different players have come in and played tremendously. I think, defense as a whole, we can still play tremendously. We do have some adversity to face right now, but I think that we\u2019re still going to play at the same high level.\u201d\n\nOn if he\u2019ll continue to have his special teams duties\n\n\u201cYeah, pretty much. They don\u2019t shy away from that. It\u2019ll be fun playing both. I love special teams and I love defense, so it will be fun doing both.\u201d\n\nOn being a leader on special teams\n\n\u201cFor me, I would love to play defense, but right now being a backup to Danny and Brandon, with my role on special teams I want to take full advantage and give everything I have to it. I definitely love playing it. This week I\u2019ll be playing both, so it\u2019s going to be fun for me.\u201d\n\nINSIDE LINEBACKER BRANDON MARSHALL\n\nOn if he sees himself in ILB Todd Davis\n\n\u201cYeah. Heck yeah, man. I told Todd before, \u2018You\u2019re going to be a starter this week. You\u2019re going to be a starter. You just have to bide your time.\u2019 It took me three years to start. Everybody\u2019s time comes at a different time. He\u2019s going to be a starter. He\u2019s going to be good.\u201d\n\nOn how his role is changed on Sunday\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be playing the \u2018MO\u2019 position. Todd will move into my position and I will move into [ILB] Danny\u2019s [Trevathan] position, so I\u2019ll just playing the weakside inside linebacker. My responsibilities will change. How I play the defense will change a little bit, but it\u2019s almost all relative, but it\u2019s really not. It\u2019s kind of different. It\u2019s a little different.\u201d\n\nOn the challenge of switching to Trevathan\u2019s position\n\n\u201cIt was a challenge for me because I have to be on point with almost forgetting everything that I\u2019ve been doing the last 14 or 15 weeks and stepping into a new role. It\u2019s really different how you fit the run, your pass responsibilities and how you play a slot formation. It\u2019s really all different, so I just try to throw everything out the window.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Denver Broncos coach Gary Kubiak and his players spoke to the media on Friday.
