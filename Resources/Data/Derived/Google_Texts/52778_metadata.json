For the 30-year-old megastar, her ambitions for the massive performance are surprisingly simple: \u201cI want to bring the humor, I want to bring the color, I want to bring the sass and I want to bring the incredible joy,\u201d she told the Daily Mail.\n\nThese qualities, of course, also sum up Perry\u2019s musical aesthetic and career to this point. Her albums are full of frothy, bulletproof-pop confections devised by her and collaborators such as Dr. Luke, Bonnie McKee and Max Martin; songs effortlessly veer between soft-glow synthpop, danceable neo-disco and sweeping ballads, with whispers of EDM, rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and hip-hop thrown in for good measure. In concert, Perry brings her vision to life in a brightly colored cartoon dreamland that in the past has resembled a cross between a rave at Willy Wonka\u2019s candy factory and \u201cMy Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.\u201d It\u2019s during these marathon shows that her overarching lyrical tropes\u2014marching to the beat of a different drummer, finding perfect love, staying strong in the face of adversity\u2014are most striking and empowering.\n\nCertainly Perry\u2019s neon-and-rainbows veneer is charming\u2014to a point. But this kitsch sometimes overwhelms her music. Although the rah-rah, screw-the-haters sentiment of mega-hit \u201cRoar\u201d is inspiring and sincere, the song\u2019s lyrics (\u201cI got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire/\u2019Cause I am a champion and you\u2019re gonna hear me roar\u201d) aren\u2019t clever, just nicking themes from \u201cRocky.\u201d The use of shallow, tired physical descriptors throughout \u201cCalifornia Gurls\u201d (\u201cCalifornia girls, we\u2019re unforgettable/Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top\u201d) is cloying. And the less said about her early hit \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d and the way it plays into every insulting stereotype about girl-on-girl makeouts, the better. At other times, Perry\u2019s over-the-top pageantry has been an inadvertent detriment. Her moments of high-profile cultural appropriation\u2014including the notorious geisha performance at the AMAs and her exaggerated turn as a bar mitzvah host in the \u201cBirthday\u201d video\u2014were tone deaf, even if she insisted she meant nothing malicious by either of them.\n\nThese lowest-common-denominator references are frustrating, because Perry doesn\u2019t need to be edgy to attract attention; her songwriting is strong enough to stand on its own. During the Prismatic world tour, a mid-set break found her strapping on a guitar to belt out \u201cThe One That Got Away,\u201d a perfect snapshot of ephemeral summer romance that matches memories of \u201c[making] out in your Mustang to Radiohead\u201d to regrets over how things ended. The piano-based \u201cBy the Grace of God\u201d is an affecting pep talk to herself about staying strong and moving forward after her divorce from Russell Brand; \u201cNot Like the Movies,\u201d meanwhile, acknowledges that perfect romance is actually very imperfect. Fans might come for the self-empowerment of \u201cFirework\u201d\u2014but stay for Perry\u2019s genuine reflections about her own struggles.\n\nWhat\u2019s perhaps more impressive is that Perry\u2019s emotional complexity isn\u2019t an act; she\u2019s always seemed to be completely comfortable in her skin, warts and all. Even if her music comes across as grating, as a person she\u2019s almost impossible to dislike, because she appears to be so normal. Her Twitter feed is a conversational mix of emojis, self-deprecation, chatter about Girl Scout cookies and adorable things she\u2019s found on the Internet. In interviews, she is cheerfully honest about everything from her \u00fcber-Christian upbringing to believing in aliens. And in her 2012 documentary, \u201cKaty Perry: Part of Me,\u201d scenes depicting her fan meet-and-greets or her candid backstage interactions are completely lacking pretense or sugarcoating: As the documentary unfolds (and her marriage crumbles) Perry visibly grows more exhausted and vulnerable. But she never complains about the brutal traveling pace or her life falling apart. It\u2019s hard to find fault with someone so committed to becoming successful\u2014and so confident about who they are and what they stand for.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Perry wants to be pop music's Lucille Ball, but her Technicolor kitsch upstages her talent", "title": "Katy Perry\u2019s jumble of sugar and spice: Unwrapping the complicated appeal of this year\u2019s Super Bowl half-time star", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Perry wants to be pop music's Lucille Ball, but her Technicolor kitsch upstages her talent", "title": "Katy Perry\u2019s jumble of sugar and spice: Unwrapping the complicated appeal of this year\u2019s Super Bowl half-time star", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/01/katy_perrys_jumble_of_sugar_and_spice_unwrapping_the_complicated_appeal_of_this_years_super_bowl_half_time_star/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/katy_perry.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Perry wants to be pop music's Lucille Ball, but her Technicolor kitsch upstages her talent", "title": "Katy Perry\u2019s jumble of sugar and spice: Unwrapping the complicated appeal of this year\u2019s Super Bowl half-time star", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/katy_perry.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Annie Zaleski", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, halftime show, Katy Perry, Super Bowl", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f18\"", "article_summary": "Topics: halftime show, Katy Perry, Super Bowl, Entertainment NewsWhen Katy Perry performs today at Super Bowl XLIX, she\u2019ll join an elite group of pop artists to have graced the game\u2019s halftime show in recent years\u2014among them, Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars.\nHer Twitter feed is a conversational mix of emojis, self-deprecation, chatter about Girl Scout cookies and adorable things she\u2019s found on the Internet.\nThese qualities, of course, also sum up Perry\u2019s musical aesthetic and career to this point.\nAnd in her 2012 documentary, \u201cKaty Perry: Part of Me,\u201d scenes depicting her fan meet-and-greets or her candid backstage interactions are completely lacking pretense or sugarcoating: As the documentary unfolds (and her marriage crumbles) Perry visibly grows more exhausted and vulnerable.\nFans might come for the self-empowerment of \u201cFirework\u201d\u2014but stay for Perry\u2019s genuine reflections about her own struggles."}
