Trump\u2019s advisers later said he did not hear the question.\n\nAfter several groups on both sides of the aisle called out Trump for not repudiating the comments, Trump canceled his appearance at an event in South Carolina, though his campaign said it was not related to Thursday\u2019s controversy.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump took to Twitter to defend himself.\n\n\"Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time someone says something bad or controversial about him? I don\u2019t think so!\" wrote Trump in the first of several tweets on the subject.\n\nHe continued, \"This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something \u2026 If someone made a nasty or controversial comment about me to the president, do you think he would come to my rescue? No chance! \u2026 If I would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man\u2019s right of free speech. A no win situation!\"\n\nHis final tweet on the matter said, \"Christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake! Obama has been horrible, I will be great.\"", "article_metadata": {"contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Donald Trump responds to critics after \u2018Muslim\u2019 flap\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/whdh.com\\/news\\/donald-trump-responds-to-critics-after-muslim-flap\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"September 19, 2015\",\"mod_date\":\"September 19, 2015\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":24393,\"author_id\":66591,\"author_name\":\"\",\"author_display_name\":\"\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"News\"],\"image\":\"https:\\/\\/sunbeamwhdh.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/02\\/8524341_g.jpg?w=640\",\"app_id\":\"whdh\",\"version\":\"3.0\"}", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://whdh.com/news/donald-trump-responds-to-critics-after-muslim-flap/", "image": "https://sunbeamwhdh.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/8524341_g.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "Donald Trump is not known for being reserved on any topic, and true to form, he\u2019s responded to critics who said his lack of response...", "title": "Donald Trump responds to critics after \u2018Muslim\u2019 flap"}, "fb": {"app_id": 200286483369828}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WHDH", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://whdh.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/9f4e45f307c06529c914715b2cbc325b?s=16"}, "article_summary": "\"We need this question,\" Trump said after the man called Obama a Muslim.\nOn Thursday, a man asked Trump a question about President Barack Obama, calling the president a Muslim and asking Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, \"when can we get rid of them (Muslims)?\"\n\"Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time someone says something bad or controversial about him?\nDonald Trump is not known for being reserved on any topic, and true to form, he\u2019s responded to critics who said his lack of response to a question at a recent town hall meeting was insensitive.\nHis final tweet on the matter said, \"Christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake!"}
