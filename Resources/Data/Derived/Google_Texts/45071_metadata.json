The project is expected to have 85,000 \"implants\" in machines around the world by the end of the year, according to the report.The implants can be used to monitor an enemy's activity and can also make networks vulnerable to more destructive cyberattacks.Finan argued that the government should think more creatively about its cyber strategy. He said the U.S. could use long distance Wi-Fi technology to provide Internet access in Syria, which he said would allow for more free communication and empower moderates in the country.Lewis predicted that the U.S. would stage cyberattacks to disable Syrian air defense systems.\"If you see any air attack against Syria, cyber would be part of the supporting effort,\" he said. \"Interfering with Syrian air defense \u2014 that's almost a given.\"But Finan expressed doubt that the U.S. would try to use hackers to take out Syrian air shields. He said such an advanced computer virus would likely cost millions of dollars to develop and might only be used once, since enemies could patch their systems.\"You might only have one shot in the gun,\" he said. \"You're only going to use it when the stakes are really high.\"Finan argued that the U.S. would likely save such an advanced cyber weapon for a larger conflict, rather than trying to protect unmanned drones in Syria.Adam Segal, a fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations who studies cyber conflict, agreed that the U.S. is unlikely to try to disable Syrian air defenses with cyberattacks.\"I just think taking air defense out with a cruise missile is faster and easier,\" he said. \"If it is a virus, eventually they could get the virus out, and they could put the air defenses back up. If you blow it up, it's gone.\"But Lewis, Finan and Segal all said the U.S. would almost certainly hack into Syrian systems to gather information about the regime's chemical weapons and defenses.Segal predicted that the U.S. could also send emails and text messages as propaganda to demoralize Syrian officials.\"I don't think there's really any doubt that [cyber] is going to be part of it,\" Segal said. \"I just think it will probably be a part we don't see.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Experts say the U.S. would almost certainly hack into Syrian systems to gather intelligence on the regime.", "description": "Experts say the U.S. would almost certainly hack into Syrian systems to gather intelligence on the regime.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Brendan Sasso", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Experts say the U.S. would almost certainly hack into Syrian systems to gather intelligence on the regime.", "title": "US likely to wage cyber attacks against Syria", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/320127-us-expected-to-wage-cyber-attacks-in-syria-offensive", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-03T01:12:04-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-03T01:12-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/320127-us-expected-to-wage-cyber-attacks-in-syria-offensive", "dcterms.date": "2013-09-04T09:45-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-04T09:45:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-03T01:12:04-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/320127-us-expected-to-wage-cyber-attacks-in-syria-offensive", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Experts say the U.S. would almost certainly hack into Syrian systems to gather intelligence on the regime.", "card": "summary", "title": "US likely to wage cyber attacks against Syria"}, "dcterms.title": "US likely to wage cyber attacks against Syria"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce35\"", "article_summary": "\"If you see any air attack against Syria, cyber would be part of the supporting effort,\" he said.\n\"But Finan expressed doubt that the U.S. would try to use hackers to take out Syrian air shields.\n\"Interfering with Syrian air defense \u2014 that's almost a given.\nThe United States is likely to make cyberattacks part of any military action against Syria, experts say.\n\"I just think taking air defense out with a cruise missile is faster and easier,\" he said."}
