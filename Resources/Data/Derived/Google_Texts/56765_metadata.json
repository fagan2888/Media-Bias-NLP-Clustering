(The study adjusted for premature births, which are also higher in the United States partly because of poverty. They were kept out of the study, researchers said, because the policies to reduce them are different.)\n\nIn Memphis, where close to half of children live in poverty, according to census data, the infant mortality rate has long been among the country\u2019s highest. Sleep deaths \u2014 in which babies suffocate because of too much soft bedding or because an adult rolls over onto them \u2014 accounted for a fifth of infant deaths in the state, according to a 2013 analysis of death certificates by the Tennessee Department of Health.\n\nWhen Ms. Pletz recently visited Darrisha Onry, 21, she saw Ms. Onry\u2019s week-old child, Cedveon, lying beside her on a dark blue couch. The room was warm, small and crowded with a large living room set, a glass table, porcelain statues of dogs and an oversize cage holding two tiny, napping puppies.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhere is he sleeping?\u201d Ms. Pletz asked.\n\nCedveon started to cry, and Ms. Onry walked out of the room to make his bottle.\n\n\u201cThe safest place for him is alone by himself on his back in his crib,\u201d Ms. Pletz said, scooping up Cedveon, who had launched into a full-throated squall.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA little later, Ms. Pletz said, \"You know never to shake the baby, right?\u201d\n\nMs. Onry nodded.\n\nMs. Pletz continued: \u201cNerves get shot and sometimes people lose their cool. If that happens, just put him on his back on a bed and close the door, and take a little rest away from him.\u201d\n\nThe program is unusual because it is based on a series of clinical trials much like those used to test drugs. In the 1970s, a child development expert, Dr. David Olds, began sending nurses into the homes of poor mothers in Elmira, N.Y., and later into Memphis and Denver. The nurses taught mothers not to fall asleep on the couch with their infants, not to give them Coca-Cola, to pick them up when they cried and to praise them when they behaved. The outcomes were compared with those from a similar group of women who did not get the help.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe results were startling. Death rates in the visited families dropped not just for children, but for mothers, too, when compared with families who did not get the services. Child abuse and neglect declined by half. Mothers stayed in the work force longer, and their use of welfare, food stamps and Medicaid declined. Children of the most vulnerable mothers had higher grade-point averages and were less likely to be arrested than their counterparts.\n\nThe program caught the attention of President Obama, who cited it in his first presidential campaign. His administration funded the program on a national scale in 2010. So far, the home visits have reached more than 115,000 mothers and children. States apply for grants and are required to collect data on how the families fare on measures of health, education and economic self-sufficiency. Early results are expected this year.\n\n\u201cThe big question is, can the principle of evidence be implemented in a large federal program?\u201d said Jon Baron, president of the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy, a nonprofit group in Washington whose aim is to increase government effectiveness in areas including education, poverty reduction and crime prevention. \u201cAnd if so, will it actually improve health?\u201d\n\nExperts say federal standards are too loose and have allowed some groups with weak home visiting programs to participate, even if they show effects on only trivial outcomes that have no practical importance for a child\u2019s life. Congress should fix the problem, Mr. Baron said, warning that the program in its current state is \u201ca leaky bucket.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIf left unchanged, essentially anyone will figure out how to qualify,\u201d he said.\n\nIts future is not assured. Funding for the home visiting initiative runs out as early as September for some states, and if Congress does not reauthorize it this month, programs may stop enrolling families and the $500 million the Obama administration has requested for 2016 will not be granted. Last week, its supporters urged Congress to extend it.\n\nIn Tennessee, where home visiting programs have bipartisan support, infant mortality is down by 14 percent since 2010, and sleep deaths dipped by 10 percent from 2012 to 2013. State officials credit a multitude of policies, including the home visits.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Pletz worries that she has helped only a handful of her clients truly improve their lives. But Ms. Corley, 28, the mother who drove herself to the hospital, said Ms. Pletz, who has been visiting her for two years, had made a difference. She \u201chas been my counselor, my girlfriend, my nurse,\u201d Ms. Corley said. Ms. Pletz helped her cope with the disappearances of her children\u2019s fathers, taught her to recognize whooping cough and pushed her to set career goals, she said.\n\n\u201cShe knows more about me than my own family does,\u201d Ms. Corley said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve grown more wise. I feel stronger for sure.\u201d\n\nThe morning after Ms. Corley gave birth, Ms. Pletz brought her breakfast: eggs, flapjacks and bacon. The new baby, Daniel, lay in a clear plastic crib next to Ms. Corley\u2019s hospital bed, and the two women talked over his head like old friends.\n\n\u201cCan I pick him up?\u201d Ms. Pletz asked.\n\nMs. Corley replied: \u201cI think he\u2019s waiting on it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150308170011, "twitter": {"description": "The Nurse-Family Partnership is at the heart of a sweeping federal effort aimed at improving children\u2019s health by educating mothers.", "title": "Visiting Nurses, Helping Mothers on the Margins", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/health/program-that-helps-new-mothers-learn-to-be-parents-faces-broader-test.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003472669"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/10/science/09MEMPHIS2/09MEMPHIS2-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/health/program-that-helps-new-mothers-learn-to-be-parents-faces-broader-test.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003472669", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/health/program-that-helps-new-mothers-learn-to-be-parents-faces-broader-test.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health", "hdl_p": "Visiting Nurses, Helping Moms on the Margins", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 8, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Nurse-Family Partnership", "keywords": "Nurse-Family Partnership,Nursing and Nurses,Infant Mortality,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Parenting,Women and Girls,Poverty", "news_keywords": "Parenting,Poverty", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Sabrina Tavernise", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/10/science/09MEMPHIS2/09MEMPHIS2-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By SABRINA TAVERNISE", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Nurse-Family Partnership is at the heart of a sweeping federal effort aimed at improving children\u2019s health by educating mothers.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/10/science/09MEMPHIS2/09MEMPHIS2-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The Nurse-Family Partnership is at the heart of a sweeping federal effort aimed at improving children\u2019s health by educating mothers.", "CG": "health", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 8, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/sabrina_tavernise/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/health/index.html", "section": "Health", "modified": "2015-03-11", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "tag": "Poverty", "published": "2015-03-08", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "09memphis", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150311020017, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/health/program-that-helps-new-mothers-learn-to-be-parents-faces-broader-test.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/10/science/09MEMPHIS2/09MEMPHIS2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Nurse-Family Partnership is at the heart of a sweeping federal effort aimed at improving children\u2019s health by educating mothers.", "title": "Visiting Nurses, Helping Mothers on the Margins"}, "pdate": 20150308, "des": "Poverty", "articleid": 100000003472669, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Visiting Nurses, Helping Mothers on the Margins", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "I feel stronger for sure.\u201dThe morning after Ms. Corley gave birth, Ms. Pletz brought her breakfast: eggs, flapjacks and bacon.\nWhen Ms. Pletz recently visited Darrisha Onry, 21, she saw Ms. Onry\u2019s week-old child, Cedveon, lying beside her on a dark blue couch.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyA little later, Ms. Pletz said, \"You know never to shake the baby, right?\u201dMs. Onry nodded.\nBut Ms. Corley, 28, the mother who drove herself to the hospital, said Ms. Pletz, who has been visiting her for two years, had made a difference.\nMs. Pletz continued: \u201cNerves get shot and sometimes people lose their cool."}
