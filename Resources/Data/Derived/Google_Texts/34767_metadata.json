Revenue jumped 50 percent in 2014, an increase attributed to the $4.3 billion acquisition of Tennessee\u2019s Vanguard Health Systems that added 29 hospitals and 39 outpatient centers to its portfolio.\n\nThe company\u2019s quarterly financial reports since have taken on the air of a broken record\u2014each have been marked by year-over-year revenue increases, and organic growth from its acquisition strategy is becoming more attributable for admission increases than factors like the Affordable Care Act. Last year, it posted revenue of $16.6 billion. Too, the company\u2019s purchase of healthcare services company Conifer has been a significant gain (revenue jumped 20 percent last quarter year-over-year and its earnings increased by 71 percent).\n\nMuch in that same line, Tenet believes its joint partnership with the Addison outpatient facility company United Surgical Partners International will help foster further growth. The grouping creates the largest ambulatory surgical center network in the country, targeting the rapidly growing outpatient set. According to Avanza Healthcare Strategies, 65 percent of all visits are now outpatient and services provided at ambulatory centers are up more than 300 percent since 2003. Tenet\u2019s looking to capitalize on that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the way healthcare is moving,\u201d Trevor Fetter, the CEO of Tenet, said at the time. \u201cSo many procedures now can be done on an outpatient basis. The physicians prefer to practice in these more convenient, simpler environments.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has also helped Tenet drop the uncompensated care it provides. In the last quarter, uncompensated admissions system-wide dropped by nearly 14 percent as Medicaid admissions jumped by 8 percent. In the six states where it operates that expanded Medicaid, the effects are even more stark: a 50 percent drop in uninsured plus charity admissions and a nearly 10 percent increase in Medicaid admissions.\n\nTenet is the third-largest hospital system in the nation, trailing the Hospital Corporation of America and Community Health Systems, both based in Tennessee. Its headquarters are located in Fountain Place downtown.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "D Healthcare Daily", "description": "The Tenet Healthcare Corp. is now among the 10 largest public companies in Texas based on revenue, according to an analysis by\u00a0The Dallas Morning News.
