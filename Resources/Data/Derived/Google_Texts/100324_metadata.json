The candidate of the conservative Law and Justice party (L&J) Andrzej Duda won popular elections in May 2015 and the party itself secured a plurality of votes and absolute majority of seats in October elections. On November 16, a new L&J government, headed by the Prime Minister Beata Szyd\u0142o, was sworn into office. This completes the process of establishing a single-party rule for the first time since the introduction of democracy in Poland in 1989.\n\nThe true architect behind L&J victories is its undisputed leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, a twin brother of the former Polish president killed in the plane crash in Russia. Despite his party\u2019s success, Kaczy\u0144ski did not assume a position in the government but is expected to wield unparalleled power behind the scenes, mudding democratic transparency and accountability.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt the end of last week, the new parliamentary majority steamrolled a bill to take full control of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal that has powers to rule future L&J legislation unconstitutional. The L&J grudge against the Polish high courts goes back to last year\u2019s local elections. Kaczy\u0144ski accused the chief justices of the Constitutional Tribunal, the Polish Supreme Court, and the Supreme Administrative Court of \u201cterrorizing courts\u201d to approve the validity of allegedly rigged elections.\n\nTogether with the assault on the independence of the judiciary the new L&J parliamentary majority quickly assumed control over security services that, in the past, were used to keep watch on political opponents. In the process, the opposition was rooted out from the customary rotating chairmanship of the powerful parliamentary intelligence committee. The L&J party is now working on new legislation that will, among other things, establish tight control over public media, including dismissal of journalists that do not comport to the L&J party line, turn prosecutor general into a strictly government subordinate, and force early elections to local government to capture the remaining state institutions outside the government\u2019s control.\n\nThe government\u2019s actions have already raised serious concerns. According to the former chief justice of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal and a staunch conservative, Andrzej Zoll, the actions of the new government amount to \u201cthe end of rule of law\u201d in Poland. Adam Michnik, former anti-communist dissident and the recipient of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, openly warns about coming of \u201ca velvet dictatorship.\u201d\n\nStrong pro-American views of the new Polish government and the Polish society in general gives the U.S. Congress a unique opportunity and responsibility to support and defend, if necessary, democratic procedures in Poland. Here is how:\n\nDuring each official and unofficial meetings with the Polish government officials, the Congressional representatives must continuously stress the necessity for a genuine inclusion of the opposition into major political processes and ask for specific examples of such inclusion. L&J has certainly a mandate to rule the country but hardly a popular mandate to overhaul the Polish constitutional and political order without general support from opposition parties and the public. In recent parliamentary elections L&J won less than 20 percent of votes of all eligible Polish voters. It received less support (approx. 38 percent of those who cast the vote) than all opposition parties combined (approx. 44 percent);\n\nAny U.S. military aid to Poland that the current L&J government might ask for must be inextricably linked to the state of democratic practices in the country, including respect for the independence of the judiciary;\n\nAny U.S. Congressional delegations that visit Poland must request separate meetings with the parliamentary and non-parliamentary opposition leaders as well as representatives of the civil society to hear their views about the state of the Polish democracy.\n\nKaczy\u0144ski, not the prime minister or the president, is now the real power holder in the country. U.S. officials, however, should not seek the meeting with the L&J leader unless similar meetings with the heads of other parliamentary groups are arranged during a visit. This will insure that the U.S. Congress treats all party heads in the Polish parliament equally and does not legitimize the non-transparent rule of a party leader with no official government position.\n\nWithout the decisive leadership of the U.S. Congress Poland under Kaczy\u0144ski and his allies might soon become like Hungary under its current Prime Minister Victor Orb\u00e1n \u2013 democratic by name, authoritarian in practice.\n\nBartkowski specializes in democratic change and popular pro-democracy movements.
