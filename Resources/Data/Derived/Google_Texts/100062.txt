Nice to see one of Arizona's own – one who would like to be a United States senator, no less -- weigh in on today's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act.

Clearly, state Sen. Kelli Ward was not happy that the Supreme Court didn't see things her way. Here's Kelli on Twitter this morning:

At one point prohibition & slavery were the law of the land too - they were wrong & so is #Obamacare#StopJudicialActivism#ChangeDC — Dr. Kelli Ward (@kelliwardaz) June 25, 2015

So wait…. a law that allows millions of people to finally be able to afford to go to the doctor is like slavery?

Fortunately, Ward clarified her position.





Comparison of Obamacare to slavery? No. Comparison of previous laws of the land that were just as wrong as Obamacare #honesty @adamlongoCBS5 — Dr. Kelli Ward (@kelliwardaz) June 25, 2015

So wait … a law that ensures that people don't go bankrupt if they get cancer, that people with pre-existing conditions are not shut out of the insurance market is "just as wrong" as a law that enslaved millions of people and treated them as chattel?

Ward is contemplating a run for the U.S. Senate against John McCain. I imagine his campaign staff is writing this one down to store it...right next to the news clips about her public hearing on chemtrails.
