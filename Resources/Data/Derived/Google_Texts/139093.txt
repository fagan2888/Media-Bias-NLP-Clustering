Palm Bay Police Officer Amy Revis Uses Portable Defibrillator To Save 8-Year Old Girl

BREVARD COUNTY • PALM BAY, FLORIDA – An eight year old girl is in stable condition at an Orlando hospital following a near drowning in a backyard swimming pool.

At 4:44 p.m. Sunday, Palm Bay Police patrol officers and Palm Bay Fire-Rescue firefighters and paramedics responded to the 2600 block of Lakeland Avenue SW for reports of a child not breathing.

The first officer on scene was Officer Amy Revis, who immediately began assisting with CPR which was already being done by one of the witnesses at the scene who was a retired nurse.

According to Palm Bay Public Information Coordinator Yvonne Martinez, the child was unconscious and had no pulse, but Officer Revis had a portable defibrillator with her and applied it to the child.

After two “shocks” from the device the child regained a pulse.

Firefighter paramedics continued with treatment and the child was later taken to the hospital where she was conscious and alert. The child was at home with friends and family for a Memorial Day Weekend party.

There were about five to six children in the pool when one of the children noticed the girl under water. He yelled for help and an adult pulled the child from the water and called 911.
