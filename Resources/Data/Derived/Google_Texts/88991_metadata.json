The payments were front loaded by Congress in 2006, and have placed a huge burden on the cash-strapped agency. USPS has defaulted on billions of dollars in payments over the last few years.\n\nFrank Todisco, chief actuary at the Government Accountability Office, told the panel the Office of Personnel Management does not know how it would legally handle the hypothetical situation in which USPS could no longer afford payments to its retirees. In that scenario, retirees could possibly lose benefits, or \u201ctaxpayers could be brought in,\u201d Todisco said.\n\nThe Postal Service\u2019s Chief Human Resources Officer Jeffrey Williamson said by requiring eligible USPS retirees to enroll in Medicare, the agency would virtually eliminate its unfunded liability. A Senate oversight committee has cleared legislation that would do exactly that, and amortize outstanding obligations over 40 years.\n\nRep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, chairman of the House subcommittee, had two officials from the Defense Department testify on its unfunded liability and discuss its own prefunding requirement. Farenthold said postal advocates have maintained the Postal Service is the only federal agency required to prefund retirees\u2019 health, and by showing the Pentagon also faces the obligation, they can \u201cscratch that talking point off.\u201d\n\nThe subcommittee\u2019s Ranking Member Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., countered that juxtaposing Defense to USPS was like \u201ccomparing apples and oranges,\u201d as the Pentagon receives annual appropriations from Congress to meet its prefunding requirement, whereas the Postal Service is almost entirely a fee-funded agency.\n\nDemocrats also argued USPS\u2019 overpayment into the Federal Employees Retirement System -- which OPM has said is about $5 billion but the Postal Service\u2019s inspector general has said is more than $12 billion -- should be returned to the agency and used to pay down its debts. The Senate bill included such a provision.\n\nThey also argued USPS\u2019 debt should not trigger any reactionary measures to dismantle the agency.\n\n\u201cNo one is talking about dismantling the federal government when it is $17 trillion in debt,\u201d said Rep. Lacy Clay, D-Mo.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Eric Katz", "description": "Postal Service again asks for congressional assistance in reducing its unfunded obligations.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "Postal Service again asks for congressional assistance in reducing its unfunded obligations.", "title": "USPS Should Keep Funding Future Health Care Costs, Republicans Say", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2014/03/usps-should-keep-funding-future-health-care-costs-republicans-say/80500/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2014/03/13/031314uspsGE.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Postal Service again asks for congressional assistance in reducing its unfunded obligations.", "creator": "@EricM_Katz", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2014/03/13/031314uspsGE/open-graph.jpg", "title": "USPS Should Keep Funding Future Health Care Costs, Republicans Say", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-13T21:09:00Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2014/03/13/031314uspsGE.jpg", "sailthru.title": "USPS Should Keep Funding Future Health Care Costs, Republicans Say", "keywords": "health benefits, postal reform bill, postal service losses", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2014/03/13/031314uspsGE/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "health-benefits,postal-reform-bill,postal-service-losses,channel-pay-&-benefits,type-story,length-medium,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "Postal Service again asks for congressional assistance in reducing its unfunded obligations."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0dc\"", "article_summary": "Current law requires the Postal Service to prefund health care costs for all retired employees and some of its current workforce.\nPostal Service retirees\u2019 health benefits at a congressional hearing Thursday, calling the payments necessary to avoid workers losing promised benefits or the costs being deferred to taxpayers.\nThe Postal Service\u2019s Chief Human Resources Officer Jeffrey Williamson said by requiring eligible USPS retirees to enroll in Medicare, the agency would virtually eliminate its unfunded liability.\nPostal Service and Census Subcommittee that the agency\u2019s total obligations -- including retirees\u2019 health benefits and pensions, workers\u2019 compensation, debt owed to the Treasury Department, benefits for current workers and other liabilities -- exceed its assets by $90 billion.\nThey also argued USPS\u2019 debt should not trigger any reactionary measures to dismantle the agency."}
