The Public Utilities Commission on Monday approved Summit\u2019s request to drop its rate per therm from 83 cents to 26 cents, a 68 percent decrease, according to a news release from the company.\n\nThe rate will be retroactive to March 1 and will stay in place until Oct. 1.

The magnitude of the loss for the Lewiston-based nonprofit became clear late last year and led to the decision to stop individual enrollments of new customers in December, weeks before the end of the enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act. Now the chief executive officer of Community Health said the insurer is setting aside millions to cover the possibility of big losses this year, and premiums are likely to go up. The cooperative will submit its rate proposal to state insurance regulators in mid-May and the premium request is still being developed. Premiums increased only about 0.5 percent in 2015.

But they might have done so out of necessity: The arrival of consistently warm weather typically ends the maple season, because budding trees produce sap that makes for much less palatable syrup. Maine\u2019s maple syrup season got started abnormally early this year, with sap buckets visible on trees around Valentine\u2019s Day in the southern part of the state. But producers promise the state\u2019s official sweetener will still be available when the annual statewide Maine Maple Sunday celebration arrives on Easter Sunday. Maine has the third-largest maple syrup industry in the country after Vermont and New York.
