A tenth employee, David Weaver, also operated as a mental health professional, and along with the company's owner, fabricated client assessments to get authorization to bill Medicaid for services. The FBI says once they got that authorization, false claims were submitted for services they claimed to have provided in the hopes of milking the system for money. However, authorities say the defendants were not qualified to provide mental health services, the counseling sessions never actually happened and notes documenting the sessions had been falsified.\n\nHalf of the defendants plead guilty to various charges related to the scheme, while the others were convicted after a month-long jury trial.
