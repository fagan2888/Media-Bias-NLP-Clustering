When you become all three branches of government, this is what happens. The president can\u2019t easily reverse himself, and yet this flood is going to mean children dying trying to get in, and more important, children coming here in the anticipation that somehow they\u2019re going to be granted citizenship.\n\nEric Cantor\u2019s unexpected downfall to an anti-immigration Tea Partyer caused a lot of buzzing about the future of comprehensive immigration reform, but this is the next phase in the fight over immigration. Republicans and conservatives are trying to capitalize on the emerging humanitarian crisis caused by tens of thousands of children streaming across the southern border, arguing that this is the consequence of Obama\u2019s lax immigration policies. Some observers see this becoming a political jam for the White House as the president weighs easing deportations through executive action, but the best thing the White House could do is ignore the politics.\n\nFirst let\u2019s take a look at everything Issa got wrong (it\u2019s quite a lot). Per Issa, Obama created a \u201cmagnet\u201d for undocumented minors when he announced his executive action to halt deportations of undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children. That policy change was announced in June 2012, so if what Issa said is true, then we would expect that the surge of undocumented minors crossing the border began sometime after then. But as Vox\u2019s Dara Lind reports, \u201cthe current surge of child migrants began in October 2011,\u201d a full eight months before Obama\u2019s executive action was handed down.\n\nAlso, Issa claimed that the \u201cmagnet\u201d was particularly strong for \u201cchildren who would qualify under the president\u2019s own executive DREAM Act.\u201d This is a curious assertion since none of the kids who migrated after Obama\u2019s policy change was announced will benefit from it. One of the qualifications for deferred action is that you have to have been physically present in the U.S. on or before June 15, 2012.\n\nLastly, the notion that the rush of underage migrants is an attempt to capitalize on relaxed deportation policies is at best an oversimplification, and obscures the reason so many kids are fleeing Central America. They\u2019re running for their lives. The UN\u2019s High Commissioner for Refugees interviewed migrant children El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico and found that \u201cno less than 58% of the 404 children interviewed were forcibly displaced because they suffered or faced harms that indicated a potential or actual need for international protection.\u201d National Journal\u2019s Brian Resnick talked to one of the report\u2019s authors, who said that only nine of the kids interviewed said anything about the U.S. giving preferential treatment to children. This picture is muddied by reports like this one from the Washington Post, which notes a growing body of anecdotal evidence that misinformation about lax deportation policies for children is widespread in the migrants\u2019 countries of origin. Regardless, the administration is handling the situation at the border as a humanitarian crisis and Obama has ordered FEMA and Homeland Security to help alleviate the crowding at detention facilities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With thousands of children streaming across the border, here's how GOP looks to capitalize on humanitarian calamity", "title": "Darrell Issa tries to exploit child crisis: The next ugly phase in immigration fight", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With thousands of children streaming across the border, here's how GOP looks to capitalize on humanitarian calamity", "title": "Darrell Issa tries to exploit child crisis: The next ugly phase in immigration fight", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/17/darrell_issas_plan_to_exploit_a_child_crisis_next_ugly_phase_in_immigration_fight/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/darrell_issa2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With thousands of children streaming across the border, here's how GOP looks to capitalize on humanitarian calamity", "title": "Darrell Issa tries to exploit child crisis: The next ugly phase in immigration fight", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/darrell_issa2.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Bob Goodlatte, Brian Kilmeade, Comprehensive Immigration Reform, Darrell Issa, Deportation, Editor's Picks, Eric Cantor, Fox News, Fox News Radio, Immigration, Immigration Reform, President Obama, United Nations", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2977\"", "article_summary": "But as Vox\u2019s Dara Lind reports, \u201cthe current surge of child migrants began in October 2011,\u201d a full eight months before Obama\u2019s executive action was handed down.\nPer Issa, Obama created a \u201cmagnet\u201d for undocumented minors when he announced his executive action to halt deportations of undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children.\nEric Cantor\u2019s unexpected downfall to an anti-immigration Tea Partyer caused a lot of buzzing about the future of comprehensive immigration reform, but this is the next phase in the fight over immigration.\nRepublicans and conservatives are trying to capitalize on the emerging humanitarian crisis caused by tens of thousands of children streaming across the southern border, arguing that this is the consequence of Obama\u2019s lax immigration policies.\nTopics: Barack Obama, Bob Goodlatte, Brian Kilmeade, Comprehensive Immigration Reform, Darrell Issa, Deportation, Editor's Picks, Eric Cantor, Fox News, Fox News Radio, Immigration, Immigration Reform, President Obama, United Nations, Politics NewsA week ago on Brian Kilmeade\u2019s Fox News Radio program, House Oversight Committee chairman Darrell Issa made a serious charge against President Obama: that his policies on immigration were responsible for the deaths of children."}
