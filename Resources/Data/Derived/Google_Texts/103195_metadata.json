That's why you need to take off winter coats.\n\n\"When a child is wearing their bulky winter coat, it's providing extra space between the child's body and the safety straps, and we don't want any space,\" Norling said.\n\nIf you buy a car seat cover, you also want to make sure it doesn't go inside and underneath your child.\n\n\"That would be providing that extra space again, so we recommend using the car seat covers that just cover the outside or top of the coat,\" Norling said.\n\nAlso make sure the seat is tightly secured in the vehicle. There should be no more than one inch of movement.\n\n\"We also want children to remain rear-facing for as long as the seat allows. Children are safer rear-facing,\" Norling said.\n\nAnd finally you want to make sure the harness is up around the armpit, at the chest level.\n\n\"A lot of times the straps aren't tight enough,\" Norling said.\n\nAll tips Thorkelson and her family plan to use while traveling this winter. That includes taking off the winter coats.\n\n\"You want your child to be warm, but at the same time, I'd rather have them be safe. Take that extra step and buy a coat and get the car seat cover that goes on top of the car seat,\" Thorkelson said.\n\nYou can get a lesson in car seat safety from an expert at Sanford CHILD Services.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "While it&#39;s good to keep your children warm during the winter, bulky winter coats and car seats don&#39;t mix.
