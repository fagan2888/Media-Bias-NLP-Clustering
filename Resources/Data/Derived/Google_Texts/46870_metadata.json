And during the promotion of that book, which included a Reddit question-and-answer session with The Onion\u2019s imaginary Biden, the real vice president took to Twitter to clarify something important:\n\nQ for @reddit AMA with my @TheOnion pal: A Trans-Am? Ever look under the hood of a Corvette? #imavetteguy \u2013VP pic.twitter.com/xPGMBBYl \u2014 Office of VP Biden (@VP) January 18, 2013\n\nHe\u2019s a \u2018Vette guy.\n\nAnd in case that was in any doubt, Mr. Biden made it even clearer in a speech at the Detroit auto show this week. \u201cWhat a difference five years makes,\u201d he told the audience, recalling the crisis that threatened to decimate the U.S. auto industry. \u201cAmerican cars and trucks are once again changing the game and I might add providing good, decent jobs.\u201d\n\nBut he had a particular interest in one American car. Via the WSJ\u2019s Jared A. Favole:\n\nMr. Biden was particularly impressed with the new Corvette Z06, a 625-plus horsepower sports car unveiled this week by GM. The vice president has a 1967 Corvette Sting Ray that his father bought him as a wedding gift. He lamented that the Secret Service doesn\u2019t allow him to drive it anymore due to security reasons, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him getting behind the wheel in his driveway at his home in Delaware. He said he told his Secret Service agent last year \u201ceither get in the passenger seat with me or shoot me, because I\u2019m moving.\u201d Mr. Biden said he did a 60-foot burnout\u2014in his driveway, not on a public road. He added: \u201cI just want you to know that that \u201967 was zero to 60 in 5.5 seconds. I didn\u2019t do that\u2026but it was. But this new Corvette, Z06, is zero to 60, allegedly, in 3.4 seconds.\u201d\n\nOther cars Mr. Biden was keen to check out at the show: the new aluminium-bodied Ford F-150, and GM\u2019s new Cadillac ATS.
