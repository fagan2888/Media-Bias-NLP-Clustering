His latest book is: \u201c The Power of RELENTLESS! \u201d Dubbed by the media as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist,\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years. Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nI admit it. Global warming is real and is warping brains.\n\nEither that or Democrats are really really dumb. They voted for Barack Obama\u2026twice. They think our economy is in \u201crecovery.\u201d Now they are getting ready to vote for Hillary Clinton. It must be global warming.\n\nWhat else explains the stupidity, idiocy and delusion? What else explains the self-destructive behavior?\n\nWhat else explains\u2026\n\nObama refusing to lift a finger to stop Islamic State; denial there is a problem, after Islamic State has already taken over half of Syria and Iraqi city after city, headed for Baghdad. All while Obama keeps repeating the massive lie, \u201cI have a plan.\u201d\n\nA plan? Obama won\u2019t even admit the \u201cIS\u201d in ISIS stands for Islamic State.\n\nWin the war? We aren\u2019t even allowed to call a Muslim\u2026a Muslim! Can you imagine in World War II if we weren\u2019t allowed to call the Germans Nazis?\n\nYour typical Democrat voter is either an idiot or maybe global warming must be real, turning their brains to mush.\n\nEvery Democrat in the country screamed in shock and dismay when George W. Bush added $4 trillion in debt. Yet they don\u2019t see a thing, hear a thing, say a thing about Obama adding $8 trillion. And by the end of his second term $12 trillion; three times more.\n\nHas global warming turned them all into brain dead zombies?\n\nHillary Clinton erased 32,000 emails, promising they were none of our business.\n\nShe wiped her server clean and refuses to discuss it. Her Democrat supporters say \u201cNothing to see here\u201d and echo her famous \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d Surely they can\u2019t be that stupid!\n\nIt must be global warming causing them to bury their empty heads in the sand.\n\nHillary, while secretary of State, collected nearly $2 billion for the Clinton Foundation, mostly from foreign governments.\n\nThen those same countries are awarded government contracts and awards. Anyone else would be tried for treason and bribery. A Republican doing the same thing would be worried about spending years in prison, not the White House.\n\nJudicial Watch just proved that Obama and Hillary covered up the Benghazi scandal- arms dealing, a terrorist attack and murders \u2013 to win the 2012 election. What do her Democrat supporters say about all this?\n\n\u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d\n\nIt can only be global warming hollowing out the brains of Democrats.\n\nHillary took millions in donations from governments that stone, whip and jail women for \u201cthe crime\u201d of being rape victims. Yet she claims to be a hero for women\u2019s rights and that Republicans are at war with women. What do Democrats say?\n\n\u201cRight on, Hillary!\u201d\n\nOnly global warming causing severe mental illness could explain this.\n\nHillary says she \u201cfights for the middle class\u201d while demanding $250,000 per speech, plus a private jet and the presidential suite at the fanciest hotel in town, while giving speeches at colleges where middle class kids will graduate with massive debt and no job prospects.\n\nThen she complains about CEO compensation while collecting $30 million in the past 16 months for selling her influence as secretary of State. Yet, Democrats and young progressives ignore the blatant corruption and hypocrisy. Surely they aren\u2019t that stupid?\n\nGlobal warming has melted their brains to the point they couldn\u2019t spell \u201cCAT\u201d if we spotted them the \u201cC\u201d and \u201cA.\u201d They just walk forward like zombies, eyes looking up through their skulls, mumbling \u201cHillary, Hillary, Hillary!\u201d\n\nObama and Secretary of State John Kerry call \u201cglobal warming\u201d and \u201cclimate change\u201d America\u2019s biggest threat, worse than terrorism. They say we must re-configure the entire U.S. economy and kill coal and oil to become a \u201cgreen energy nation\u201d while ignoring the fact that the green energy sham has destroyed the European Union and has left their continent in economic collapse, killed millions of jobs and produced youth unemployment rates of 55 percent or higher in \u201cgreen countries\u201d like Spain.\n\nThe media never mentions the \u201cinconvenient fact\u201d that the results in the EU are so bad even leftist politicians now publicly admit that green energy kills jobs and bankrupts nations with high energy costs. Nor do they mention that while the EU has scrapped their own greenhouse gas emissions standards that killed their economies, Obama demands we institute those same standards in America.\n\nInsanity.\n\nHow can it be that the mainstream media doesn\u2019t think to mention any of this? How could Democrats not notice the tragedy in Spain, Greece, Italy or France? Green energy saves the planet while it destroys the economy. So you\u2019re broke, living in misery, starving and you\u2019re breathing the same dirty air, because no matter how many jobs you kill in the interest of saving the planet, China and India just keep doubling their pollution. So you\u2019ve accomplished nothing \u2013 except ruining your economy. No one thinks to mention this?\n\nGlobal warming is the only possible reason this is happening. It must be like heroin combined with crack cocaine and crystal meth. There must be a genetic weakness within the DNA of Democrats and the mainstream media.\n\nObamacare is a proven failure. How do I know? The two most liberal, brain-dead states where everyone loves Obama and big government have given up: Vermont and Hawaii.\n\nVermont just closed its entire healthcare experiment. It went bankrupt. Obamacare exchanges across America are going broke \u2013 including Hawaii. If Obamacare can\u2019t work in Hawaii with a small population and $205 million in taxpayer subsidies it can\u2019t work anywhere.\n\nThen, there are cities like Chicago, Detroit and Baltimore that have been run 100 percent by Democrats and progressive policies for 50 straight years.\n\nAll are bankrupt, abandoned, violent, crime-ridden hellholes. Residents, in all but the most affluent neighborhoods, live in misery. After pouring billions into them, their schools are a disaster. Drugs are sold in broad daylight. No one can walk the streets at night. Violent animals rule.\n\nBut Democrats want to use the exact same policies to \u201csave\u201d America.\n\nGlobal warming has to be the cause and it must turn Democrats into brain dead zombies.\n\nAmerica, under Obama, has become a low-wage, part-time economy with near zero GDP growth.\n\nObama has presided over a record 40-plus straight months of 46 million or more citizens on food stamps \u2013 a permanent underclass living in misery. Just like Cuba, Venezuela and Greece. Why would anyone be surprised? Obama is using the exact same progressive policies as the socialists in Cuba, Venezuela and Greece. But Democrats don\u2019t notice.\n\nI can only think global warming is the leading cause of blindness and deafness in Democrats.\n\nSomething has obviously dumbed down the young people. They are clueless that the Obama plan is printing trillions in new, fake money, thereby forcing the stock market to record heights. That makes Obama\u2019s biggest donors wealthy beyond their wildest imagination, but leaves the average middle class kid with the bill \u2013 a crushing $250,000 of debt. They are graduating from college with massive debt and no opportunity for a decent job; to live in their parents\u2019 basement in record numbers.\n\nYet, college grads vote Democrat because they get free contraception and abortion.\n\nGlobal warming must be especially deadly to young brains, leaving holes the size of manhole covers.\n\nMy fellow Jewish Americans don\u2019t notice Obama\u2019s hatred of Israel and that every action proves he is on side of radical Muslims. \u201cHe is Israel\u2019s best friend\u201d say delusional Jewish Democrats.\n\nBut Israelis know the truth. They see Obama as the worst American president \u2013 by a landslide. It isn\u2019t even close: 63 percent vs. 16 percent for second place (Jimmy Carter). Forget global warming. Israelis see Obama as the biggest threat to their existence.\n\nThe results of this poll prove American Jews are living in a make-believe world of rainbows and unicorns. It has to be global warming.\n\nThe Amtrak crash proves anyone not admitting government is a failure is a complete, blithering idiot. Amtrak has lost over $40 billion after 40 years of government welfare and it\u2019s results are still getting worse.\n\nSo Democrats demand more government spending on Amtrak. Only a zombie or lobotomy victim would decide more spending will solve the problem after 40 years of failure, incompetence and waste of taxpayer money.\n\nIt must be the global warming. Because anyone who wants to waste more money on Amtrak also believes in the Tooth Fairy and the Loch Ness monster.\n\nSomething has created brain-dead zombies that ignore the obvious connection between Obama\u2019s all-time record levels of spending, debt, taxes and regulations\u2026and the fact that for the first time in the history of America more businesses fail each day than open each day. Then those same zombies conclude \u201cI have the answer. Let\u2019s add even more regulations.\u201d\n\nIt must be global warming hollowing out their heads like a pumpkin on Halloween. Come to think of it, Democrats do have that same kind of smile as a pumpkin.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t seem to notice the fact that Obama spent a billion dollars of your money to build and fix the defective Obamacare web sites; given to foreign companies; one of them run by Michelle Obama\u2019s Princeton Black Alumni Association college classmate; that scandal alone should have led to Obama\u2019s impeachment. But Democrats were too busy watching \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t seem to notice health insurance premiums and co-pays have doubled and tripled for middle class Americans (the group paying the bill), or that inflation is back, caused by massive jumps in healthcare spending.\n\nNo one seems to care and the media doesn\u2019t see a story. They are living in the dark and silence at the same time.\n\nPaul Krugman of the New York Times just wrote about the lies and fraud committed by Bush during the Iraq war. Yet he doesn\u2019t notice Obama committed massive fraud when he sold Obamacare by saying \u201cIf you like your insurance, you can keep it\u201d and \u201cIf you like your doctor, you can keep him\u201d and \u201cObamacare will lower prices\u201d and \u201cObamacare will lower the deficit.\u201d Krugman never saw any of that.\n\nIt has to be global warming. It turns even Nobel Prize winners into idiots foaming at the mouth.\n\nLiberals like Krugman hate bullying. It\u2019s their cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. But they didn\u2019t notice that Obama used the IRS in a widespread criminal conspiracy to target, intimidate, bankrupt and bully his critics, while trying to silencing free speech. Obama makes Nixon look like Mother Teresa. Obama is the \u201cmother of all bullies.\u201d\n\nFinally liberals like Krugman don\u2019t notice that progressive policies have turned Cuba into the country that time forgot, forever frozen in 1950. Those same progressive policies have led to food and toilet paper shortages in Venezuela. Those same progressive policies have left hospitals in Greece without painkillers, scissors or bed sheets.\n\nLiberals don\u2019t notice that big government, big spending, big taxes, big regulations, big unions and free healthcare cripple every nation and bankrupt every economy they touch.\n\nThose are the same progressive policies that Obama has used to damage the U.S. economy beyond repair. We are in slow motion disaster headed toward the end of America. The people who support and defend Obama and Hillary are clearly brain dead.\n\nIt must be super-charged rays of sun burning holes in their minds. Global warming must be shrinking brains to pea-size. It\u2019s clear now\u2026Democrats are being lobotomized.\n\nGlobal warming must be real\u2026\n\nEither that or Democrats are so dumb and blind they shouldn\u2019t be let out of the house without diapers and a security guard.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
