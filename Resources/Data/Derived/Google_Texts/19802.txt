Dive Brief:

A survey of 700 health IT workers found the average salary in healthcare IT is $87,000, but the average desired salary is $105,000. Project managers reported the highest average health IT salaries at $105,674 and the highest average bonus of $12,702.

Additional survey information gathered included that 69% currently work in health IT (50% for a hospital/health system and 30% for consulting company) and most (78%) are permanent employees.

Average salaries differed by geographic location with New England paying the highest ($99,536) and the Midwest with the lowest ($80,311).

Dive Insight:

According to the survey, health IT continues to be the fastest-growing industry in the U.S. due to factors such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), meaningful use, the HITECH Act, and ICD-10.

However, a recent Black Book survey found 73% of surveyed hospitals with more than 300 beds are now considering complex IT outsourcing next year and 81% of provider organizations with less than 300 beds have also made outsourcing a priority, as reported in Healthcare Dive.

Doug Brown, managing partner of Black Book Market Research said, "Most hospital leaders see no choice but to evaluate and leverage next generation information and financial systems as an outsourced service in order to keep their organizations solvent and advancing technologically."
