An amazing 44 percent of all respondents said they didn\u2019t often feel proud to be American. Only 28 percent said that America was the greatest nation on earth. So how do you unite people to save the country if they\u2019re not invested in its success? And how do you reverse a belief that is searing in its self-fulfillment? We talk a lot in America about economic, demographic and other \u201ctipping points,\u201d but the patriotism gap is arguably the most important of all.\n\nLiberals care less - Pew divided their sample into different categories across the left-right political spectrum. When asked if respondents \u201coften feel proud to be American,\u201d a majority of strong liberals, 60 percent, said no. The only group that solidly agreed with the statement was conservatives, ranging from 72 percent to 81 percent. About half of the respondents in the middle of the spectrum \u2013 essentially libertarians to socially conservative fiscal liberals \u2013 said they were proud to be American.\n\nTaking exception with exceptionalism - When asked if the United States ranks above other countries, fewer than three in 10 overall said the U.S \u201cstands above all other counties\u201d while 58 percent said the U.S. \u201cis one of the greatest countries, along with some others.\u201d And 12 percent of respondents definitively said \u201cthere are other countries that are better than the U.S.\u201d When broken down into groups, conservatives are tops on exceptionalism at 46 percent. Close behind are members of the ethnically diverse ranks of socially conservative, fiscally liberal Americans who formerly made up the Democratic base before the Obama era at 39 percent Strong liberals and libertarian-leaning young adults were least likely to see America as the greatest, 11 percent and 16 percent respectively. And 19 percent of strong liberals, the leader in this ranking, said other countries were better.\n\nWhy it matters - If the individuals in a disagreement don\u2019t at least agree that they are trying to preserve a common endeavor, spirited debate turns into acrimony. Splitsville, man. If America is just another country with a soccer team, the extraordinary doses of patriotic grace, forbearance and sacrifice that have been required of citizens since our country\u2019s founding don\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s not that the 44 percent who aren\u2019t proud are all moving to Costa Rica, it\u2019s that they feel less obliged to do the hard work necessary to make a system this demanding work. Politicians and public figures who intentionally exploit and deepen divisions and resentments are doing more than just creating gridlock, they\u2019re undercutting the very idea that has lit the lamp of America\u2019s greatness for nearly three centuries.\n\nNO BALONEY: OBAMA STILL SAYS SCANDALS ARE \u2018PHONY\u2019\n\nRallying supporters in Minnesota the day after new revelations about wrongdoing at the IRS related to the targeting and harassment of his political enemies, President Obama doubled down on claims that the mounting scandals around his administration are fabrications. The Hill: \u201cPresident Obama charged that his Republican opponents had \u2018nothing to offer except cynicism and fear and frustration\u2019 during a fundraiser Thursday in Minnesota. The fundraiser capped off a day Obama spent with Rebekah Erler, a working mother who wrote the president to detail her financial struggle. \u2018It moved me,\u2019 Obama said of the letter, adding that he only went into politics to help people like her. Obama said he remembered what it felt like to be struggling to figure out \u2018how you lead a good life and raise your kids, not looking to get wildly wealthy\u2026 trying to make ends meet. That\u2019s what we should be talking about every day in Washington,\u2019 he said. \u2018We talk about everything else. .. We talk about phony scandals. We talk about Benghazi. and we talk about polls and we talk about the tea party and we talk about the latest controversy... We don\u2019t talk about her.\u2019\u201d\n\n[Johnnie M. Walters, an IRS commissioner during former President Richard Nixon term, died Tuesday at the age of 94. Walters was best known for resigning after he refused to prosecute the people on the president\u2019s \u201cenemies list.\u201d]\n\nSTEEP CONSEQUENCES FOR OBAMA\u2019S SUPREME COURT REBUKE\n\nWashington Examiner: \u201cNational Labor Relations Board Chairman Mark Gaston Pearce said Thursday the federal labor-law enforcement agency was still trying to determine the impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling\u2026 Pearce issued a terse statement, which said in part: \u2018We are analyzing the impact that the Court\u2019s decision has on Board cases in which the January 2012 recess appointees participated. ... The Agency is committed to resolving any cases affected by today\u2019s decision as expeditiously as possible.\u2019\u2026The NLRB had previously asserted that all of the disputed rulings were valid, despite the rulings in federal court that said the board did not have the authority to make them. Potentially all those actions will now have to be re-litigated. The cases were ones decided by President Obama\u2019s appointees Sharon Block, Richard Griffin and Terence Flynn. The ruling leaves intact rules that were made by another disputed appointee, Craig Becker.\u201d\n\nPretty cocky for a guy coming off a unanimous SupCo smackdown - \u201cYou know, the suit is a stunt. But what I've told Speaker Boehner directly is if you're really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, why don't you try getting something done through Congress?\u201d \u2013 President Obama speaking to ABC News discussing the looming lawsuit from House Republicans seeking to force him to enforce the laws passed by the legislative branch.\n\n[Fox News Sunday - Host Chris Wallace welcomes Rep.

Watch full interview here.\n\nOBAMA CLAIMS POWER FOR INDEFINATE IRAQ DEPLOYMENT\n\nRoll Call: \u201cPresident Barack Obama told Congress Thursday that he has the authority on his own to send troops to Iraq indefinitely under the Constitution. \u2018These forces will remain in Iraq until the security situation becomes such that they are no longer needed,\u2019 Obama told lawmakers of his decision to send 300 military advisers there. \u2018This action is being undertaken in coordination with the Government of Iraq and has been directed consistent with my responsibility to protect U.S. citizens both at home and abroad, and in furtherance of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive,\u2019 Obama wrote in a letter to Congress. Obama does not use either the 2001 authorization to use military force (AUMF) after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks nor does he cite the 2002 Iraq AUMF as justification. Both acts of Congress remain in effect today because they have no expiration date and have not been repealed.\u201d\n\nSTUDY SAYS OBAMACARE RATES SET TO SPIKE\n\nObamaCare customers face steep premium hikes next year unless they opt to wade through the cumbersome Healthcare.gov marketplace again and switch plans according to a new report by Avalere Health out Thursday. But, \u201cshopping around may not be as likely,\u201d Kaiser Health points out, \u201cunder proposed rules also released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that will automatically re-enroll the vast majority of those who are signed up for plans through the online marketplaces. Automatic re-enrollments might ease the experience, but it also will make it less likely consumers will check out other options.\u201d Most of those insured under ObamaCare receive subsidies to lower the cost of coverage, but the plans those subsidies rates are based on will change significantly the Avalere reports says. The federal government ties subsidy rates to the second lowest cost silver-rated health insurance plan on each state exchange. In six of the nine states studied by Avalere, plans that currently serve as the benchmark for federal subsidies will lose their status next year and the subsidy calculation will change as a result. \u2018The lowest cost plans in 2014 may no longer be low cost in 2015,\u2019 said Avalere Health\u2019s Elizabeth Carpenter.\n\n[Storm warning - ICYMI, WaPo put a human face on how firms are cutting worker hours, delaying raises and struggling with regulations, as ObamaCare\u2019s employer mandate nears]\n\nOn the docket: Religious freedom v ObamaCare - In perhaps the most closely-watched case of the year at the Supreme Court, justices are slated to rule Monday on a critical challenge to ObamaCare.

But our belief in it is unquestionably real. Roulette players will bet on more numbers after they win than after they lose, psychologists have found. A store that issues a winning lottery ticket will tend to sell more lottery tickets afterward, economists have observed. Investors often assume that a rising stock\u2019s price will keep rising. Time and again, we don\u2019t want to believe that streaks can be the result of pure chance \u2014 probably because the bias appears to be deeply ingrained in our minds, researchers say.\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Her husband talking to other rich people, mostly. WaPo expertly catalogues the sources of the Clinton\u2019s fortune: \u201cBill Clinton has been paid $104.9 million for 542 speeches around the world between January 2001, when he left the White House, and January 2013, when Hillary stepped down as secretary of state, according to a Washington Post review of the family\u2019s federal financial disclosures. Although slightly more than half of his appearances were in the United States, the majority of his speaking income, $56.3 million, came from foreign speeches, many of them in China, Japan, Canada and the United Kingdom, the Post review found. The financial industry has been Clinton\u2019s most frequent sponsor. The Post review showed that Wall Street banks and other financial services firms have hired Clinton for at least 102 appearances and paid him a total of $19.6 million.\u201d\n\n[Doesn\u2019t translate - Democratic 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cHard Choices\u201d will not be sold in China.

When she was out of power, Hillary Clinton yearned for a more aggressive press: \u201cEven people who think they\u2019re doing an in-depth interview, or pursuing issues, they very often are nervous about asking questions, or at least come across that way and they don\u2019t follow through.\u201d\n\n[Peggy Noonan writes: \u201cIt is Mrs. Clinton\u2019s habit to fake identification with people who\u2019ve had real struggles by claiming she\u2019s had them too. All humans have struggles, but hers were not material. She came from a solidly suburban upper-middle-class home, glided into elite schools, became a lawyer, married a politician who quickly rose, enjoyed all the many perks of a governor\u2019s mansion and then the White House, and then all the perks of a senator, secretary of state and former first lady. She\u2019s been driven in limousines and official cars almost all her adult life.

Jeb Bush of Florida is planning to headline a fundraiser for at least four Republican Senate candidates, seeking to make an impact on the 2014 election while exploring the possibility of his own presidential bid in 2016. The fundraiser is scheduled for Sept. 23 in Tampa, Fla. The chosen candidates are crucial to a Republican takeover of the Senate, including Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Monica Wehby in Oregon and Tom Cotton in Arkansas. The event may also benefit the winner of the Aug. 26 Republican primary in Alaska. Allies of Mr. Bush said an event of this magnitude will test the organizational skills of his team and allow him to connect with donors who could form the nucleus of his presidential fundraising network.\u201d\n\n\n\nSCOTT WALKER \u2018WAS NOT THE TARGET OF THE INVESTIGATION\u2019\n\nWisconsin State Journal: \u201cGov. Scott Walker[, R-Wis.] is not a target of the John Doe investigation into possibly illegal campaign finance coordination during the 2011 and 2012 recall elections, an attorney for the special prosecutor overseeing the probe said Thursday. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Walker has been exonerated in the eyes of prosecutors, and he could continue to be a subject of the investigation if it is allowed to continue, legal experts said Thursday. Randall Crocker, the lawyer for special prosecutor Francis Schmitz, said that at the time the investigation was halted in early May, \u2018Governor Walker was not a target of the investigation. At no time has he been served with a subpoena.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nFIRST IN FOX NEWS FIRST: CROSSROADS HITS GRIMES ON WARREN VISIT\n\nAhead of a Sunday Kentucky campaign stop by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for Democratic Kentucky Senate nominee Alison Lundergan Grimes, pro-Republican group American Crossroads is debuting an ad reminding Kentuckians of Warren\u2019s stances, particularly in support of President Obama\u2019s global warming regulations on the use of coal. Grimes, who has tried to distance herself from the carbon controversy, is trying to unseat Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in November. The new ad opens with multiple comments from Warren saying, \u201cI applaud President Obama\u2026 The EPA proposal is a powerful step.\u201d The ad concludes saying, \u201cElizabeth Warren: Campaigning for Obama\u2019s Liberal Agenda\u2026Now campaigning for Alison Lundergan Grimes.\u201d\n\nMCDANIEL\u2019S ELECTION INQUEST CONTINUES\n\nMississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel appeared on \u201cHannity\u201d Thursday night to discuss his investigation into Sen. Thad Cochran\u2019s, R-Miss. win Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a recount. We\u2019re looking into the issue of whether or not people who participated in the June the 3rd Democratic primary crossed over into the Republican primary this Tuesday night,\u201d McDaniel told Sean Hannity. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve already found more than a thousand examples of that in one county alone. So we\u2019re talking about widespread irregularities of ineligible voters that should not have been there in the first place.\u201d McDaniel lost his primary runoff to Cochran by some 6,000 votes. Asked whether he would support Cochran in November \u201cunder any circumstances,\u201d McDaniel said he hadn\u2019t made up his mind.\n\n\n\n[Since state law blocks McDaniel from a third-party or write-in candidacy (unless Cochran dies before the election) his only apparent hope to wrest control of the Senate seat is to invalidate the results of the primary.]\n\n\n\nPERDUE PUSHES POLL CLAIMING RUNOFF LEAD\n\nThe Hill: \u201cBusinessman David Perdue (R) has a narrow lead over Rep. Jack Kingston (R) in Georgia\u2019s Senate race, according to an internal poll for Perdue\u2019s campaign obtained by The Hill. The poll, conducted by GOP pollster Wilson Perkins Allen and sent to top Perdue supporters, shows him leading Kingston by 45 percent-44 percent\u2026Internal polls should always be viewed skeptically, and this poll seems designed to show that Perdue is still well-positioned for a win after a handful of public polls and an internal one from Kingston found the congressman with a lead in the race.\u201d\n\nPICK SIX\n\nThe status quo will change dramatically in Washington if Republicans are able to gain an additional six Senate seats.

Down to the second. Consider this from GOP firm Smart Media Group: \u201c[The firm] and FourthWall Media, the largest independent source of cable set-top box viewing data announced today a licensing agreement that will provide second-by-second television viewing data to SMG. This viewing data will allow SMG to match specific voter segments with households from FourthWall Media\u2019s household level television viewing data. This data will better identify the viewing habits of each desired political segment, leading to more efficient advertising spending and better targeted creative. \u2018What our relationship with FourthWall Media allows is access to a large stream of near real time set top box data,\u2019 said Kyle Roberts, CEO, Smart Media Group. \u2018This data stream can be matched with individual voter information allowing Smart Media to know what specific programs voters prefer to view and when.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nTALK ABOUT AN EXPERT WITNESS\n\n(Florida) Sun Sentinel: \u201cThe last time that Jeffrey Groover gave sworn testimony, he got a day pass from federal prison to lecture a U.S. Senate committee on how to stop convicted identity thieves like him from committing crimes. But the South Florida man apparently paid no heed to his own crime prevention tips that he shared with politicians on Capitol Hill in 2004. Groover testified again this week \u2013 this time in his own defense in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, trying to persuade jurors to find him not guilty of stealing identities and committing bank fraud in Broward and Palm Beach counties. The jurors obviously found his bizarre testimony less compelling than the senators once did \u2014 they took just 40 minutes Wednesday to find him guilty of all six federal charges.\u201d\n\n\n\nAND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cThis is a stinging rebuke to [President Obama\u2019s] overreach in general and I think it will have implications for other cases. Remember, the argument Democrats have made up till now with [House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s] lawsuit that is going to challenge overreach: \u2018This is simply a partisan attack on the president.\u2019 But the court is saying this is a constitutional travesty what happened in this case.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
