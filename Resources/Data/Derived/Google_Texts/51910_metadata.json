Circuit \u2013 often called the nation\u2019s second highest court \u2013 struck down an IRS rule that extends federal subsidies for health insurance purchased on ObamaCare exchanges to the 36 states that rely on federal exchanges. The statute, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), explicitly authorizes the subsidies only in states that set up their own exchanges.\n\nBoth sides in the case, Halbig v. Burwell, agree that if the decision stands on appeal, it would effectively gut the ACA in 36 states by ending subsidies and \u2013 through a series of interrelated statutory provisions \u2013 terminating the ACA\u2019s employer mandate and, for millions of people, the individual mandate as well. However, the Obama Administration is expected to ask the full D.C. Circuit to review the three-judge panel\u2019s decision.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nObamaCare supporters have taken solace in the presumption, shared by many ACA critics, that the full court \u2013 consisting of seven judges appointed by Democrat presidents and just four by Republicans \u2013 will agree to hear the case and rule for the Administration.\n\nThe conventional wisdom assumes that virtually all the judges will vote for whichever outcome of the case serves their political affiliation or policy views, despite their sworn duty to rise above politics and \u201cadminister justice without respect to persons.\u201d While this view is understandable \u2013 decades of judicial activism have produced a widespread perception of judges as only slightly removed from politics \u2013 it is a bit simplistic.\n\nYes, judges appointed by Democrats are likely to vote to uphold the ObamaCare rule in question, and Republican appointees are likely to conclude that it is unlawful. However, the predictability comes not just from pure politics but from disparate approaches to statutory interpretation as well. Liberal and conservative judges approach statutes differently, just like they interpret the Constitution differently.\n\nThe liberal philosophy of statutory interpretation is summed up by Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer: \u201cjudges, in applying a text in light of its purpose, should look to consequences, including \u2018contemporary conditions, social, industrial, and political, of the community to be affected.'\u201d (quoting Justice Louis Brandeis). Breyer explains that \u201cLaw is tied to life, and a failure to understand how a statute is so tied can undermine the very human activity that the law seeks to benefit.\u201d\n\nCompare this \u201cliving statutes\u201d philosophy \u2013 to coin a term based on the similar \u201cliving Constitution\u201d theory urged by progressives \u2013 to Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s approach to statutory interpretation. He believes a judge\u2019s task is \u201cnot to enter the minds of the Members of Congress \u2026 but rather to give fair and reasonable meaning to the text of the United States Code.\u201d Scalia notes that \u201csometimes [that produces] a terrible result because that\u2019s the terrible statute that Congress wrote.\u201d\n\nA judge\u2019s responsibility to adhere to a statute\u2019s text even when that compels an undesirable result is precisely what Republican appointee Judges Thomas Griffith \u2013 joined by Republican colleague Raymond Randolph \u2013 had in mind when he concluded the Halbig majority opinion by writing:\n\nWe reach this conclusion, frankly, with reluctance\u2026 [O]ur ruling will likely have significant consequences both for the millions of individuals receiving tax credits through federal Exchanges and for health insurance markets more broadly. But, high as those stakes are, the principle of legislative supremacy that guides us is higher still.\n\nDespite their reluctance, Griffith and Randolph could not get away from the fact that the ACA provision they were interpreting was abundantly clear on its face. The provision says that the ObamaCare subsidy is available to individuals who purchase health insurance on exchanges that are \u201cestablished by the State under section 1311\u201d of the ACA.\n\n\u201cIn case anyone missed the fact that the federal government is not a \u2018State,\u2019 Congress added \u2018under section 1311\u2019 \u2013 a section dealing exclusively with state-established exchanges,\u201d points out Ken Klukowski, an attorney litigating the same issue in a separate case but speaking here as the senior legal analyst for Breitbart News. \u201cThe federal exchange is created by section 1321, not 1311. So this really is crystal clear.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the majority\u2019s textualist approach compelled only one result: \u201capplying the statute\u2019s plain meaning, we find that it unambiguously forecloses the interpretation embodied in the IRS Rule and instead limits the availability of premium tax credits to state-established Exchanges.\u201d In his concurrence, Judge Randolph added, \u201cTo hold otherwise would be to engage in distortion, not interpretation.\u201d\n\nIn dissent, Judge Harry Edwards, a Carter appointee, took the holistic approach to statutory interpretation favored by progressives. Applying what the majority called an \u201cabstract form of legislative history,\u201d Edwards rejected their reliance on the provision\u2019s plain meaning because it \u201cwould destroy the fundamental policy structure and goals of the ACA that are apparent when the statute is read as a whole.\u201d The result would be to create \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d such as \u201ccondemn[ing] insurance markets in States with federally-created Exchanges to an adverse-selection death spiral.\u201d\n\nEdwards goes on to assert that the contradiction between the ACA\u2019s goals and the disastrous consequences that would flow from a plain reading of the relevant provision creates enough ambiguity about the provision\u2019s meaning to justify giving deference to the IRS rule. Scalia would say that disastrous statutes create disastrous consequences, but Edwards, instead, applies Breyer\u2019s rule that \u201cjudges \u2026 should look to consequences.\u201d\n\nUC-Irvine law professor Richard Hasen accuses the Halbig majority of using \u201cunfeeling tools of interpretation,\u201d but he manages a pretty accurate description of how liberal and conservative judges interpret statutes:\n\nRepublican presidents now appoint judges who stick to textualism even when it leads to harsh results while Democratic presidents are more likely to choose judges who will look at the big picture and the human costs, when they\u2019re parsing the words of a law.\n\nThis article will not settle the long-running debate about whether courts should be more feeling \u2013 recall Obama\u2019s promise to appoint judges with \u201cempathy\u201d \u2013 and sensitive to consequences when interpreting statutes. However, those favoring the holistic approach to statutory interpretation taken by Judge Edwards should be aware that it carries several of the same downsides associated with the \u201cliving Constitution\u201d approach to constitutional interpretation, including tension with representative democracy and the danger of elevating the rule of judges over the rule of law.\n\nAfter all, notes Justice Scalia,\n\n[If we are] governed by some judicial determination of [a statute\u2019s] spirit \u2026 [j]udges can simply say, \u201cOh, yes, the text says that but that\u2019s contrary to the spirit of the law and we\u2019re going to go ahead and do whatever we like.\u201d\n\nThat is why the Halbig majority concludes by reminding us that the \u201climited role\u201d of ascertaining the plain meaning of a statute\u2019s words \u201cserves democratic interests by ensuring that policy is made by elected, politically accountable representatives, not by appointed, life-tenured judges.\u201d\n\nCurt Levey is a constitutional law attorney and president of the Committee for Justice.
