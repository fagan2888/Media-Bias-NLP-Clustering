Instead, focus on what is happening behind the scenes.\n\nTake Hillary Clinton, for example. She tells us she \u201c[has] a decision to make.\u201d Which is true. But at this point, it\u2019s not about wrestling with what is in the best interests of her family and the country. It\u2019s more along the lines of when and how to announce.\n\nShe\u2019s running.

But her book, due out any day now, is designed to address her main areas of concern. \u201cHard Choices\u201d will be 600 pages of exculpatory evidence about her involvement in what her handlers believe to be the three most vulnerable areas:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Republicans Need to Prepare Now for Hillary Clinton's 2016 Run", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "If Republicans want to stop Hillary Clinton, they need to get into the game now.", "title": "Time to Prepare", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/ford-oconnell/2014/06/06/republicans-need-to-prepare-now-for-hillary-clintons-2016-run", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/ff/df/afa3689f4bcebb8b914d19dd393f/140605-hillaryclinton-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "If Republicans want to stop Hillary Clinton, they need to get into the game now.", "card": "summary", "title": "Republicans Need to Prepare Now for Hillary Clinton's 2016 Run"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "June 6, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Ford O'Connell,Clinton, Hillary,politics,2016 presidential election,Obama, Barack,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "If Republicans want to stop Hillary Clinton, they need to get into the game now."}, "article_summary": "She is parking a battleship in plain view, and it\u2019s getting harder and harder for the media to ignore it.\n[SEE: Cartoons on the Democratic Party]It\u2019s also getting harder and harder for her supporters to hold back.\nShe thinks half the country \u2013 the female half \u2013 will vote for her just so we can have a woman president.\nWhen trying to judge whether a politician plans to run for president, don\u2019t listen to the choreographed blather.\nAs I wrote in my book, \u201cHail Mary: The 10-Step Playbook For Republican Recovery,\u201d Clinton has several potential campaign liabilities."}
