The building also may also feature a facility for physical therapy and a pharmacy on the first floor. No tenants have signed pre-construction leases.\n\nPeter Becronis, owner of Wembley Realty Advisors, the developer of the L.A. medical building, told the Wall Street Journal: \u201cWe see building on spec to be a minimal risk \u2026 There\u2019s not any large block of space in the area, so this allows health-care providers the opportunity to lease a brand new medical office building built specifically for health care.\u201d\n\nBecronis said the partnership behind the self-funded development expects to break ground in the third quarter of 2016 and open the medical building in 2018.\n\nAssuming their location is a good one with an attractive demographic profile, medical office developers may find themselves \u201cin a good spot to attract a large user and may find someone before they even break ground,\u201d John Wilson, president of Chicago-based developer and building manager HSA PrimeCare, told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHowever, as the Affordable Care Act reshapes the delivery of health care, the law is \u201ccausing a lot of consolidations of providers, or they\u2019re being purchased by health care systems,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSo there are fewer tenants today, and they need spaces that are not cookie-cutter. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t see a lot of speculative space within the industry.\u201d [Wall Street Journal] \u2014 Mike Seemuth", "article_metadata": {"description": "Construction of medical office buildings appears to have increased from last year's level, including some built on speculation.", "og": {"site_name": "The Real Deal Miami", "description": "Construction of medical office buildings appears to have increased from last year's level, including some built on speculation.\r\n\r\nBrokerage Marcus & Millichap reported that U.S. developers are expected to deliver 8.8 million square feet of newly built medical office space this year, up", "title": "Market for medical office space looks healthy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://therealdeal.com/miami/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/A-medical-bldg.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-18T13:03:05+00:00", "url": "http://therealdeal.com/miami/2015/10/18/market-for-medical-office-space-looks-healthy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Construction of medical office buildings appears to have increased from last year's level, including some built on speculation.", "title": "Medical Office | Marcus & Millichap | CoStar Group |", "image": "http://therealdeal.com/miami/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/A-medical-bldg-200x142.jpg", "creator": "@trdmiami", "site": "@trdmiami", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "medical office,marcus & millichap,costar group,office vacancy,marcus & millichap,hsa primecare,marcus millichap", "date": "2015-10-18 13:00:27", "article": {"section": "Home Page", "published_time": "2015-10-18T13:00:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-18T13:03:05+00:00"}, "sailthru.featured": "http://therealdeal.com/miami/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/A-medical-bldg.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Brokerage Marcus & Millichap reported that U.S. developers are expected to deliver 8.8 million square feet of newly built medical office space this year, up from 7.1 million square feet in 2014.\nThe speculative component of medical office development is small because most projects need to be 50 percent pre-leased before they advance to the construction phase, said Scott Niedergang, director of the Healthcare Real Estate Group at Marcus & Millichap.\nConstruction of medical office buildings appears to have increased from last year\u2019s level, including some built on speculation.\nThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t see a lot of speculative space within the industry.\u201d [Wall Street Journal] \u2014 Mike Seemuth\nCoStar Group Inc. reported that medical office vacancy rates nationwide dropped to 8.8 percent in this year\u2019s third quarter from 9.2 percent in the same period last year."}
