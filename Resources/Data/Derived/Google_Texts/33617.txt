More than 300,000 views on YouTube and not a cute kitten in sight – just a man looking straight into the camera and issuing a confession and a plea.

In the video a pixelated face and distorted voice tells the viewer that he has a drinking problem. But then his face is revealed and the viewer sees a young man who says his name is Matt Cordle looking straight into the camera.

Cordle confesses that he killed a man while driving drunk and says he wants to take full responsibility for his actions, "When I get charged I will plead guilty."

But that's not all he has to say. He asks the viewer not to repeat his mistakes, "I'm begging you, please don't drink and drive."

The video was released to promote http://becauseisaidiwould.com/ – a site aimed at encouraging people to keep their promises.
