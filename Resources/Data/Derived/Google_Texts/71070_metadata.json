Hughes, 67, formed Greensburg-based Universal Oral Fluid Laboratories of PA LLC in 2009 and built its business by paying kickbacks to doctors, a federal prosecutor alleged in court documents.\n\nThe allegations emerged in a forfeiture complaint in which Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee J. Karl seeks to seize $269,926 from the lab\u2019s bank account, $415,529 in certificates of deposit from Mr. Hughes and his wife, and $68,500 in cash uncovered in March.\n\nThe lab has been inactive since March, when federal officials served search warrants at the business.\n\nMr. Hughes said he did not believe there was anything illegal in the business arrangements he had with doctors.\n\n\u201cThere were no guarantees\u201d of payments to doctors, he said. Doctors could refer lab work to his firm or take their business elsewhere, he said. \u201cThere were no minimums. There were no maximums.\u201d\n\nThe seizure effort and the investigation that underlies it reflect the Affordable Care Act\u2019s increased emphasis on fighting fraud in the health marketplace, said Valarie K. Blake, a visiting assistant professor of health law at Duquesne University.\n\nKickbacks, she said, \u201ccan kill competition, because other labs that are abiding by the law can\u2019t compete.\u201d They also can spur unnecessary care, noting that an estimated one-third of the money that flows into the American health-care system is wasted.\n\nUniversal Oral Fluid Lab, according to its website, tested saliva for drugs, allowing doctors to monitor their patients\u2019 adherence to prescriptions.\n\nIn 2011, a Florida firm, Millennium Laboratories Inc., sued Universal, accusing the company of using \u201ca scheme\u201d masquerading as a series of \u201cjoint ventures\u201d under which it paid physicians for every lab test referral. According to the lawsuit, Universal kept $150 of the insurance proceeds from each test and sent the balance to the doctors.\n\nUniversal unfairly won over doctors in Florida and Texas, Millennium alleged.\n\nMillenium argued that violated federal laws against paying or receiving kickbacks in relation to services covered by federal health-care programs. The firm also cited the Stark Law, which bars physicians from referring federal health-care program patients to labs with which they have financial interests.\n\nUniversal countered that those laws didn\u2019t give Millenium any right to sue. The case appears to have settled in January.\n\nMr. Hughes said Thursday that his lab simply charged \u201ca flat fee of $150. \u2026 We had about 30 [referring doctors]. Eight of them made money, and some didn\u2019t make money.\u201d\n\nThe FBI, however, \u201chas been conducting an investigation of William Hughes and others\u201d for health-care fraud, kickbacks and money laundering, according to Mr. Karl\u2019s complaint. \u201cThe investigation revealed that [Universal] engaged in kickback arrangements with physicians in order to be the exclusive lab for providing drug testing services.\u201d\n\nThe lab and at least one doctor, identified in the complaint only as \u201cJJ,\u201d discussed how to \u201cramp up\u201d swabbing and \u201copen the floodgates\u201d to bill \u201cthe insurance companies with the largest kickback potential,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nFrom January 2011 through November 2013, insurance companies paid $42 million into the lab\u2019s account, and Medicare Part B paid $11.2 million.\n\n\u201cOf the approximately $11.2 million, approximately $1,869,926.37 was paid to [Universal] for oral swabs submitted to [the lab] by Dr. JJ,\u201d according to the federal complaint.\n\nDocuments filed as part of the Millenium lawsuit indicate that Universal had a relationship with John Johnson, a doctor with Central Pennsylvania Pain Management. He could not be reached for comment Thursday at his office in Tyrone, near Altoona.\n\nAccording to the federal complaint, Mr. Hughes shifted some of the money earned by Universal to himself. \u201cFor example, from January 2013 through October 2013, Hughes wrote checks to himself totaling approximately $1.7 million,\u201d Mr. Karl wrote.\n\nMr. Hughes said he shifted money between accounts only to cover Universal\u2019s employee pension plan.\n\nHe said that Universal charged \u201chardship cases\u201d only $30 and shut its doors even as some clients owed it millions of dollars. \u201cHow can it be a kickback if I\u2019m losing money?\u201d he asked.\n\nU.S. Attorney David Hickton declined to speak specifically to the case involving Universal. He has, however, repeatedly said that he is focusing federal investigative powers on the health-care industry.\n\n\u201cMoney spent on medical care should benefit patients not line the pockets of fraudsters,\u201d he said in a statement issued Thursday.\n\nMs. Blake said there probably will be more investigations like the one involving Universal because the Affordable Care Act allocated $350 million to fight fraud and abuse through 2020.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Universal Oral Fluid Laboratories of PA LLC and owner William Hughes have been asked to forfeit more than $750,000 in a federal complaint.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "A Peters man who five years ago launched a medical lab testing firm that rattled the competition has become the subject of a federal investigation that emerged Thursday with the seizure of more than $750,000 in allegedly fraudulent gains.
