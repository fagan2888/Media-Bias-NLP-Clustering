A bit of perspective: Ten players on the University of Denver Pioneers\u2019 roster are older than the Avalanche\u2019s captain.\n\nOf late, Avalanche coach Patrick Roy has made it a habit of referring to Landeskog not by name, but as: \u201cOur captain \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHe deserves it,\u201d Roy said Thursday in Vancouver. \u201cThe way he\u2019s been acting on and off the ice, he\u2019s been showing great leadership, and to me, this is very positive.\u201d\n\nAs a locker room spokesman for the team once the media hordes invade, Landeskog is thoughtful and eloquent \u2014 if not particularly controversial \u2014 to the point that many hearing him or even asking the questions often forget he is a native Swede, speaking in his second language. It\u2019s almost as if you want to dare him to say something in Swedish to prove he\u2019s not a guy from Saskatoon pulling a fast one.\n\nWhen the Avalanche named him captain in September 2012, it came off as a bit theatrical, at least in terms of the timing. The NHL was in the early stages of a lockout that would last until January. But naming Landeskog captain then meant, at age 19, he became the youngest with the C in NHL history, beating Pittsburgh\u2019s Sidney Crosby by 11 days.\n\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Terry Frei, Mike Chambers\n\nThat led into the final season of the Joe Sacco coaching tenure at Colorado, a mess that led to the housecleaning that included Roy\u2019s return to the franchise. Yes, there were moments when it seemed that Roy pondered saying that Landes- kog wasn\u2019t ready for the C, that it was unnecessary additional pressure for a young player, and made another choice. But Roy says those who drew those inferences were wrong.\n\n\u201cI guess the fact that I\u2019ve been working with younger players at the junior level helped me a lot, and my objective was to try and help him as much as I could,\u201d Roy said. \u201cAt the same time, I think Landy\u2019s been the choice of the organization and I have no problem with that. Actually, right now I\u2019m very pleased with the step he has made in his role as the captain of the team.\u201d\n\nThis is legitimizing too: Going into Saturday\u2019s home game against Buffalo, Landeskog had 12 goals in the previous 20 games as the Avalanche at least showed signs of avoiding an ignominious folding down the stretch of a disappointing season. He took over the team scoring lead, and came into the night with 22 goals and 54 points.\n\nThe Landeskog-Ryan O\u2019Reilly-Alex Tanguay line has been terrific of late. And Landeskog seems to have grown into the captain\u2019s role.\n\n\u201cI think no doubt, when the team\u2019s going through a tough time, that\u2019s when you get a challenge as a captain and as a player,\u201d Landeskog said. \u201cYou get challenged both as an individual and as a team. When I first got the C, every loss became so much more personal, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s definitely been hard on everybody this year, especially at the start of the year.\n\n\u201cAs the season has progressed, I feel like I\u2019ve been able to focus on seeing the outside picture and seeing what the team is looking like, and being able to assess and address the team accordingly, and being able to lead in the way I want to lead. If I\u2019m not focused on what I have to do out there on the ice, I\u2019m not going to play my game, and if I don\u2019t play my game, I\u2019m not going to lead the team. It\u2019s been both up and down, but I feel like I\u2019ve definitely come a little way on the journey.\u201d\n\nLandeskog\u2019s torrid streak of late has enhanced his credibility.\n\n\u201cThe last two months, he\u2019s been one of the best players in this league,\u201d Roy said.\n\nJarome Iginla was the longtime captain at Calgary and now, with Cody McLeod, is an assistant captain with the Avs. In his first season with Colorado, Iginla has gained respect for Landeskog. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the top power forwards in the league,\u201d said Iginla, who then rattled off Landeskog\u2019s various on-ice roles before adding of the captain role: \u201cHe does a great job because he knows what\u2019s going on with all the guys, and he and Patty have a good relationship. They go in and they talk things out. I\u2019m impressed. I was older when I was captain and there still was pressure and at times I felt it, but you don\u2019t notice it with him. His game has only gotten better and better.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: Patrick Roy is OK with Gabe Landeskog\u2019s C", "title": "Frei: Patrick Roy is OK with Gabe Landeskog\u2019s C", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/28/frei-patrick-roy-is-ok-with-gabe-landeskogs-c/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150328__avs-Landeskogp1.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150328__avs-Landeskogp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-28T18:18:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T16:15:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But naming Landeskog captain then meant, at age 19, he became the youngest with the C in NHL history, beating Pittsburgh\u2019s Sidney Crosby by 11 days.\nGabe Landeskog, who turned 22 on Nov. 23, is in his third season as the Avalanche\u2019s captain.\nOf late, Avalanche coach Patrick Roy has made it a habit of referring to Landeskog not by name, but as: \u201cOur captain \u2026\u201d\u201cHe deserves it,\u201d Roy said Thursday in Vancouver.\nA bit of perspective: Ten players on the University of Denver Pioneers\u2019 roster are older than the Avalanche\u2019s captain.\nHe took over the team scoring lead, and came into the night with 22 goals and 54 points."}
