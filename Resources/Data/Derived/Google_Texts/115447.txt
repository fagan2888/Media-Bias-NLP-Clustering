The Obama administration is sending a new message to people on the Obamacare e-mail list. Sign up for health insurance by December 15 or face big fines.

“Important,” the new email warns subscribers. “The penalty for not having health insurance is increasing. If you don’t sign up for coverage, you’ll risk having to pay $695 per person or more for the year.”

Since the new enrollment period is in session, email messages from the Obamacare website have increased urging more people to sign up for coverage or face fines. When asked about the fines faced by Americans without insurance, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that he was unaware of any plans to reduce the penalties.

“I’m not aware of any plans to change the penalties that would be levied,” Earnest said, during the daily press briefing reminding reporters that some people would be fined more for not having health insurance than the actual the cost of health insurance itself.

“I think we’re going to continue to be creative … we’re going to be aggressive about making sure we get the word out,” he said.
