True story.

Neff headwear, a self-proclaimed “leading lifestyle brand,” announced on Tuesday that it has collaborated with Seahawks cornerback and Richard Sherman for a series of commercials that feature him and a llama in Brodie glasses.

Launched in 2002 by Shaun Neff in Southern California, Neff was the “first authentic core snow and skate headwear company in the world” and works with other celebrities, including Snoop Dogg, Deadmau5, Kate Upton and Wiz Khalifa.

“Such an amazing experience to work with one of the most animated, nicest and top athletes in the NFL, it’s an awesome privilege and opportunity,” Shaun Neff said in a news release.
