× North Carolina’s popular Google searches include ‘Your Mama’ jokes and ‘White Snake’

North Carolinians love their barbecue, White Snake, ‘Your Mama’ jokes and Charles Barkley’s golf swing.

According to data compiled by Estately and Google data trends over the past decade, more North Carolinians search for those four search terms than any other state.

“We focused our search queries divisive topics like politics and religion, as well interest in types of recreation, music, movies, diet and health topics, famous people, TV shows, dumb questions, and a bunch of silly stuff like thumb wresting and glam rock,” said Ryan Nickum, blogger for Estately, said in a statement to the Salt Lake Tribune. “It’s obviously not hard science, but it does provide an interesting window into each state’s personality.”
