Despite already modifying their benefit plans last year, employers expect their health care costs to rise again in 2016, which will require additional changes, according to the Employee Benefits Trend Study released by Wells Fargo Insurance, part of Wells Fargo & Co.

Fifty eight percent of employers surveyed expect their medical plan costs to exceed the thresholds for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) excise tax, or “Cadillac” tax, which was originally to take effect in 2018, but has been delayed until 2020. Additionally, 70% of employers expect their budgets for benefit plans to increase, as human capital and health and productivity remain key issues for businesses to manage.

Half of the employers in the study said they will continue to make changes to their plans either this year or in 2017 by adding a high deductible plan option (52%), increasing the employee contribution percentage (56%), or increasing co-insurance features (55%). Employers are also making strategic changes to plans that address not only the physical well-being of their employees, but also chronic condition management and mental, financial, and social well-being.

For example, as more employers offer high deductible health plans, the C-suite is also aware of the financial exposure that employees face with these types of plans. As a result, they are looking to mitigate those costs by offering voluntary benefits solutions (e.g. critical illness and accident insurance). In addition, employers of all sizes are seeking ways to encourage a healthier and more productive workforce. Fifty one percent of companies expect to increase wellness offerings, and 37% will add wellness incentives or penalties to their programs in 2016.
