The recently unemployed and disgraced former Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner is no fan of Republicans. Nor is he a fan of Texas Senator and GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz .

The noted Twitter pervert retweeted Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon writer Albertina Rizzo’s tweet containing a quote from Craig Mazin smearing Cruz as “a nightmare of a human being.”

Mazin was roommates with Cruz their freshman year at Harvard, an odd couple with Cruz being conservative and Mazin being ultra-liberal. Mazin has gone on to become a screenwriter in Hollywood, with films like critical flops Identity Thief and The Hangover parts 2 and 3 to his credit.

Weiner, husband to top Hillary Clinton aide and confidant Huma Abedin, declared Mazin’s quote a “Amazing quote from a Mazin guy.”

Some Twitter users unuounced on Weiner after the tweet and reminded him of his own problems:

It wasn’t the first shot Weiner has taken at Cruz:
