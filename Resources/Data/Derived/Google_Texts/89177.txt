Pakistan announced Sunday that it will try former President Pervez Musharraf for treason, which is punishable by death or life imprisonment, for declaring a state of emergency and suspending the constitution while in power in 2007.

“Following the judgment of the Supreme Court and a report submitted by an inquiry committee, it has been decided to start proceedings against General Pervez Musharraf [for treason] under Article 6 of the Constitution,” Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said during a televised press conference, Agence France-Presse reported.

“It is happening for the first time in the history of Pakistan and the decision has been taken in the national interest,” Mr. Khan said. “Gen. Musharraf is accountable to the nation and the constitution.”

Mr. Musharraf, a former army chief, has maintained his innocence. He would be the first military ruler tried for treason in a country that has experienced three military coups in its 66-year history, The Associated Press reported.
