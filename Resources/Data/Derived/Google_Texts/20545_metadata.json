Whoops - nothing to redistribute--not that there is anything right with the government forcibly redistributing private income.\n\nWhy should entrepreneurs hire when hiring--and firing--is an expensive, punishing obstacle course in France? As one French entrepreneur explained,\n\nTired of delays in getting orders filled, Pierrick Haan, CEO of Dupont Medical (not to be confused with chemical company DuPont (DD)), decided last year to return production of some wheelchairs and medical equipment to France. The 150-year-old company, based in Frouard in eastern France, created 20 jobs making custom devices at a French plant-and will stop there. Faced with France's stifling labor code, Haan probably will send any additional production of standard equipment to what he calls \"Near France\"-Tunisia, Bulgaria, or Romania. \"The cost of labor isn't the main problem, it's the rigidities,\" Haan says. \"If you make a mistake in your hiring plans, you can't correct it.\"\n\nThere are now 2.9 million people out of work in France, almost 10 percent of the workforce and the most in 12 years. \"For the 100 employees we have in France, we have 10 employee representatives, for whom we have to organize weekly meetings even when there is nothing to discuss,\" Haan says. \"Every time a social security contribution changes, which is frequently, we have to update software and send our HR people for training. We can't fire anyone without exorbitant costs.\"\n\nThe code sets hurdles for any company that seeks to shed jobs when it's turning a profit. It also grants judges the authority to reverse staff cuts years after they're initiated if companies don't follow the rules. The courts even deem some violations of the code a criminal offense that could send executives to jail.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/01/_how_can_we_redistribute_if_theres_no_wealth.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog:  'How can we redistribute if there's no wealth?'"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca97b\"", "article_summary": "Faced with France's stifling labor code, Haan probably will send any additional production of standard equipment to what he calls \"Near France\"-Tunisia, Bulgaria, or Romania.\nHollande certainly noticed that adding a 75% surcharge on multi, multi millionaires' income, including star sports figures, doesn't yield more tax revenue but literally kicks out the star business generators to friendlier tax countries.\nThe courts even deem some violations of the code a criminal offense that could send executives to jail.\nIt also grants judges the authority to reverse staff cuts years after they're initiated if companies don't follow the rules.\nThe 150-year-old company, based in Frouard in eastern France, created 20 jobs making custom devices at a French plant-and will stop there."}
