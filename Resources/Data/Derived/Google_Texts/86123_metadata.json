But those same groups have voiced no complaints when labor unions do the same.\n\nA number of \u201cliving wage\u201d laws being passed across the country\u2014including the one in Milwaukee County\u2014have been heavily influenced by labor unions and are designed to generate revenue for unions through provisions that exempt companies from paying the increased wages if they force full unionization.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very rich for the unions to criticize people for doing the exact same things they do,\u201d said James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics for The Heritage Foundation.\n\nJane Carter, a labor economist with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said what unions are doing is different because corporations associated with ALEC are spending tens of thousands of dollars behind closed doors on bills that benefit the rich and hurt economic growth and the middle class.\n\nBut Milwaukee County\u2019s living wage law is expected to cost taxpayers almost $30 million by the end of 2019 and possibly shut down the Milwaukee County Department of Family Care, according to a fiscal analysis by the county\u2019s nonpartisan comptroller\u2019s office. The ordinance was written by Service Employees International Union officials and County Supervisor David Bowen, who has received numerous campaign contributions and political endorsements from SEIU agencies and individuals.\n\nSEIU Healthcare Wisconsin could gain an additional $300,000 a year from Supportive Homecare Options alone if that firm obligates its employees to join the union. But its workers would make less because they would keep the same wages but have to pay union dues and initiation fees.\n\nPaid membership in ALEC, a nonprofit organization in which state legislators and private business representatives work together on legislation to advance the fundamental principles of free-market and limited government, is voluntary.\n\nNot so with unions.\n\n\u201cIf workers don\u2019t want to support the union agenda, they shouldn\u2019t be required to pay $500 to $1,000 a year in order to have their money then get turned around and spent promoting left-wing causes that, in many cases, the workers may not agree with,\u201d Sherk said.\n\nAbout half the states allow public-sector union contracts to require mandatory dues as a condition of employment.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Number of \"living wage\" laws have been heavily influenced by unions.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Number of \"living wage\" laws have been heavily influenced by unions.", "title": "Labor Unions Adopt Tactics They Once Criticized to Lobby for Living Wage Laws", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/14582907576_27d7742919_k.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-01T11:56:39+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1v5yoae"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Number of \"living wage\" laws have been heavily influenced by unions.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/14582907576_27d7742919_k.jpg"}, "title": "Labor Unions Adopt Tactics They Once Criticized to Lobby for Living Wage Laws", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "labor", "published_time": "2014-10-04T03:01:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-01T11:56:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "unions, wisconsin, ALEC"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd036e\"", "article_summary": "But those same groups have voiced no complaints when labor unions do the same.\nA number of \u201cliving wage\u201d laws being passed across the country\u2014including the one in Milwaukee County\u2014have been heavily influenced by labor unions and are designed to generate revenue for unions through provisions that exempt companies from paying the increased wages if they force full unionization.\nBut its workers would make less because they would keep the same wages but have to pay union dues and initiation fees.\nAbout half the states allow public-sector union contracts to require mandatory dues as a condition of employment.\nBut Milwaukee County\u2019s living wage law is expected to cost taxpayers almost $30 million by the end of 2019 and possibly shut down the Milwaukee County Department of Family Care, according to a fiscal analysis by the county\u2019s nonpartisan comptroller\u2019s office."}
