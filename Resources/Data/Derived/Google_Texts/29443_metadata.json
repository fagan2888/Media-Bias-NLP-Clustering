They see hope in the emotional tug of a Davis candidacy talking about health care, education, and leaders who disregard their voices.\n\nCertainly, they were the target for Davis\u2019 message as she began her 2014 campaign last week. Davis strategists hope that an emphasis on health care, education and a business-friendly posture will give her an edge. But counting on Republican-leaning women to abandon the low-tax, small-government comfort of their own party is probably wishful wooing, many pollsters and strategists say.\n\nIn the last four elections for governor, the Republicans \u2014 George W. Bush and Rick Perry \u2014 have won the women\u2019s votes by no fewer than 7 percentage points.\n\nWhile minority female voters are strongly Democratic, they make up about 15 percent of the electorate. White female voters are 33 percent of all voters, and they have gone overwhelmingly Republican in Texas.\n\nAnalysis by Stefan Hankin \u2014 a Washington-based Democratic strategist who helped in President Barack Obama\u2019s victories \u2014 shows that even under the \u201crosiest scenario\u201d of historically unexpected high percentages of minorities streaming to the polls, Davis would still fall below 49 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cThe numbers show that in Texas, even the most ideal Democratic candidate with the most ideal turnout will still likely fall short of victory,\u201d Hankin wrote for Washington Monthly.\n\nRepublican pollster Mike Baselice said he cannot see a scenario where Davis defeats the rock-solid conservative, well-financed campaign of Greg Abbott, the likely GOP nominee.\n\n\u201cA lot is already built into the outcome of these races based on the partisanship in this state,\u201d Baselice said.\n\nParty affiliation has historically always trumped gender identification, he said, meaning Republican women won\u2019t vote for a Democratic woman, even if she promotes ideas they like.\n\n\u201cYou could make people more likely to vote for Attila the Hun if you get a good message around it. But that doesn\u2019t mean at the end of the day that they\u2019re going to vote for the Hunster,\u201d Baselice said.\n\n\u2018Out of step\u2019\n\nRep. Stefani Carter, a Republican who has knocked on an estimated 10,000 doors in winning her Far North Dallas swing district twice, notes that she ousted a Democratic incumbent, Rep. Carol Kent, who ran a similar campaign to Davis\u2019.\n\nCarter said Davis, a two-term state senator whose district has a similar makeup, will not make headway with suburban women simply because they don\u2019t agree with her on issues.\n\nShe cited Davis\u2019 consideration of tax increases for public education, her support for the federal Affordable Care Act and her championing of abortion rights.\n\n\u201cFrom my own interaction with my own community, I can tell you that she\u2019s just out of step with reality here in Texas,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWomen\u2019s voices will be heard that they want to elect another Republican governor.\u201d\n\nShe said she doesn\u2019t believe Abbott has anything to worry about.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are women and women are Republicans. Greg Abbott will win the race,\u201d said Carter, who is running statewide next year for the Texas Railroad Commission.\n\nTexas Democratic strategist Stanford said that to win, Davis will need to do much better among white voters altogether \u2014 going from the 29 percent that 2010 Democratic nominee Bill White won, to 40 percent.\n\n\u201cMy analysis is that the only way to do that is with suburban women, because the suburbs are where all the white people are, and the women are the ones listening to us,\u201d Stanford said.\n\nIn 2010, White took five of the state\u2019s largest counties: Harris, Dallas, Bexar, El Paso and Travis. But Rick Perry clobbered him in Collin, Williamson and Denton counties, and other vote-rich suburbs throughout the state, enough to win comfortably overall.\n\nStanford points to recent polls showing Davis having 35 percent of support among white women, \u201cwhich would be revolutionary,\u201d he said. Another poll had Davis and Abbott virtually tied among female voters.\n\nHe attributed the uptick to the shuttering of dozens of women\u2019s health care centers, the complete removal of state funding for Planned Parenthood, and the sweeping abortion bill that Davis filibustered, which could close 80 percent of the abortion clinics in Texas.\n\n\u201cRight now, women could be forgiven for thinking that a bunch of men are playing politics with their health care, and that somehow birth control has become an issue we have to talk about again,\u201d Stanford said.\n\nOpponents throwing out dismissive labels such as \u201cAbortion Barbie\u201d only underscore the connection. Women understandably get riled when men belittle a woman for disagreeing with them, Stanford said.\n\n\u201cThe conventional wisdom is that she has to run screaming\u201d from the filibuster, he said. \u201cBut what she did is to stand up for beliefs that more than one-third of soft Republicans share. Her issue \u2014 access to women\u2019s health care \u2014 is an entree into the suburbs. Not a hindrance.\u201d\n\nBut abortion, particularly the ban on the procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy that Davis temporarily derailed, remains a problem for Texas Democrats. Davis did not mention her abortion filibuster during her campaign announcement speech Thursday.\n\nRepublicans have argued that Davis\u2019 filibuster shows her to be a radical on the issue. She has not said at which point in pregnancy the procedure should be outlawed, if at all.\n\nAbbott, too, is outside the mainstream on the issue. He has said unequivocally that abortions should be denied in cases of rape and incest.\n\nConnecting with voters\n\nThe last Democrat to win a majority of women was Ann Richards, who stunned Clayton Williams in 1990 by snaring 59 percent. But Williams had made a joke about rape and was seen as being disrespectful of Richards.\n\nThe margin of victory was \u201cthe suburban woman vote,\u201d said Cathy Bonner, a top Richards adviser.\n\n\u201cWendy\u2019s issue will be whether those same suburban, tend-Republican women care about how women are treated in state government,\u201d Bonner said.\n\nThe door-knocking, friends-phoning-friends and other networking Richards employed in the suburbs can now be achieved through microtargeting and using social media, she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the most effective type of campaigning you can do is to peer-to-peer. And it\u2019s the kind of retail politics that Wendy knows how to do,\u201d she said.\n\nBonner acknowledged that Williams was gaffe-prone in a way that Abbott isn\u2019t likely to be. Baselice, the GOP pollster, said Williams fell more than 20 points in the last month of the 1990 campaign, and \u201cit was his own undoing.\u201d\n\nDavis could get 5 percent more of the overall vote and a much larger share of the women\u2019s vote, and still wouldn\u2019t get close to victory, he said.\n\nFor Democrats, \u201cturning their wishful thinking into a feasible plan has proven to be a failing effort for more than a decade,\u201d Baselice said.\n\nBut Davis could give voice to women\u2019s concerns about education and pocketbook issues in a way recent Democratic candidates have failed to do, Stanford said.\n\n\u201cAll too often, Democrats tell you how a car is built and Republicans talk to you about how it feels to drive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to talk about how they fit into Texas\u2019 future in a way that makes an emotional connection.\u201d\n\nFollow Christy Hoppe on Twitter at @christyhoppe.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats say she can win over GOP converts, but Republicans say such voters are staunchly conservative.", "og": {"description": "Democrats say she can win over GOP converts, but Republicans say such voters are staunchly conservative.", "title": "Suburban women a key target for Wendy Davis\u2019 governor campaign", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20131005-suburban-women-a-key-target-for-wendy-davis-governor-campaign.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131005-wendy_women.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/wendy_women.jpg", "height": 429}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2013-10-06T04:51:36Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2013-10-06T04:08:29Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Suburban women a key target for Wendy Davis\\u2019 governor campaign\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20131005-suburban-women-a-key-target-for-wendy-davis-governor-campaign.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131005-wendy_women.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/wendy_women.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1231075\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-06T04:08:29Z\", \"section\": \"State Politics\", \"author\": \"CHRISTY HOPPE\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131005-wendy_women.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/wendy_women.jpg", "publishtime": "2013-10-06T04:08:29Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb714\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWendy\u2019s issue will be whether those same suburban, tend-Republican women care about how women are treated in state government,\u201d Bonner said.\nStanford points to recent polls showing Davis having 35 percent of support among white women, \u201cwhich would be revolutionary,\u201d he said.\nCertainly, they were the target for Davis\u2019 message as she began her 2014 campaign last week.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not going to win unless she can get white suburban women to vote for her,\u201d said Jason Stanford, a consultant for Democratic statewide campaigns.\n\u201cRepublicans are women and women are Republicans."}
