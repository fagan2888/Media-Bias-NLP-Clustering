He's running for president (probably). He's got a TV show...and a head of hair that sometimes gets more headlines than he does. And now, he's talking...farmland?\n\nDonald Trump was in Iowa over the weekend, first to discuss the state of affairs in the real estate (farm and non-farm) world, then later to rub shoulders with fellow Republicans potentially courting a nomination from the party for a presidential run. The latter came Saturday as part of an event hosted Saturday by Iowa Congressman Steve King, while the former came during the Peoples Company Land Investment Expo on Friday.\n\nTrump's been in the real estate business for almost 4 decades, and though his specialty is far from the fields comprising the region covered by the 680-plus farmland brokers and ag lenders in the room at the Land Investment Expo Friday, there are similarities between the 2 sectors, says the 68-year-old New York native whose estimated net worth is around $4 billion as of earlier this month.\n\n\"You're getting hit here, but other places are getting hit. Land is a commodity to a certain extent and seems to tie in well with other commodity prices. It could very well be with what's happening with the dollar -- not so much what's going up with the dollar -- and other currencies that are being artificially lowered by their governments to hurt the United States in order to take business from the United States,\" Trump said Friday. \"That's having a big effect on Iowa land, there's no question about it.\"\n\n\n\nRELATED VIDEO\n\n\n\nTrump, who spent considerable time addressing who would be his likely opponents in a race for the White House in 2016, spent most of his time at the podium talking about his business experience and how it could serve him in a political capacity, namely when it comes to fiscal and health care policy. He'd repeal the Affordable Care Act and would offer what he calls a more viable alternative. And, he says a focal point of his fiscal policy -- one that of his platform points pertains most closely to agriculture -- will be improving the status of the U.S. in the global economy, especially as it applies to our foreign trading partners.\n\n\"I would make sure China and other countries stop ripping us off. They are treating us like a very, very stupid group of people. I have made a lot of money with China. I made a tremendous amount of money on 1 deal; I have made a fortune dealing with Chinese people,\" says Trump, who adds he'd self-fund his presidential campaign, about which a final decision he plans to make \"sometime prior to June. \"I have a lot of friends in China and they can't believe what they're getting away with. I would stop the ripoff of the United States by virtually every country we do business with.\"\n\nDoing so -- the means by which action Trump did not enumerate in his brief remarks Friday -- will have a ripple effect that will reach well into the farmland market, one he says may be amidst a downturn now, but that will recover given time for the price cycle turn turn.\n\n\"You're getting hit here, but other places are getting hit. Land is a commodity to a certain extent and seems to tie in well with other commodity prices. It could very well be with what's happening with the dollar, not so much what's going up with the dollar, but what's going down with other currencies that are being artificially lowered by their governments to hurt the United States in order to take business from the United States. That's having a big effect on Iowa land, there's no question about it,\" Trump says. \"The lesson I learned at the bottom of the real estate cycle is that you have to hang in there. When the real estate market crashed, it was much worse than it is right now. When the market crashed in 1990, so many of my friends were going bankrupt -- I never went bankrupt, by the way -- and so many people were just going out of business. One of the things I learned is you have to hang in, and you have to wheel and you have to deal. The market will go up. And, that's what it did, and today my company is a very powerful, very strong company, far stronger than it ever has been in the past.\"\n\nSo, staying alive is key in the high spots of the cycle in a business like real estate or farmland. What about at the lows?\n\n\"You learn less on the top, to be honest with you. The top takes care of itself. What I've learned through all of these cycles -- because real estate is all about cycles and so is farm business and land -- is be conservative, because bad times will come. Bad times will come and when those bad times come and you have cash and you're really liquid, strong and smart, you can buy up the world. Remain very liquid and remain conservative and lots of good things can happen.\"\n\nThere is a silver lining to the cloud of a lower farmland market right now, though, Trump says. Taking advantage of lower costs across the board will help farmers keep their heads above water as the ag markets slip.\n\n\"The farm market will be back and it will be back strong. You do have the advantage of the low fuel costs, which probably solves some of the problem. But, it will be back. Just hang in,\" he says. \"Never ever quit, never give up. [Farmers] are great people. They don't know what quit means. They will be back and they will be back soon.\"", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "farmland values, land values, land prices, farmland prices, donald trump, news, business news, agriculture news, ag news, finance news", "fb": {"app_id": 1545978839053740}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Staying alive is key in the high spots of the cycle in a business like real estate or farmland.
