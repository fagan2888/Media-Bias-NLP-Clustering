Last summer, my 84-year-old dad faced a frightening kidney cancer. It turned out to be readily treatable. He got excellent care at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. Our family came together to help him with his surgery. He\u2019s back to emailing impossible questions about general relativity and string theory.\n\nStill, we had frank conversations about unsettling possibilities that did not come to pass. Some concerned his preferences regarding end-of-life care. We talked about other tough things, too: money issues, how my 82-year-old step-mother would meet both of their needs if he became chronically debilitated, and more. I\u2019m sure my dad had private talks with his doctor, too.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDeath and physical infirmity intrude on every human life. It\u2019s important to frankly discuss these matters\u2014lovingly, honestly, with particularity and without euphemism\u2014long before you\u2019re holding your semi-conscious loved-one\u2019s hand in the ICU. People also need to discuss these issues with the doctor who knows them best.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing particularly costly here. A health-care system that promiscuously reimburses proton beam cancer therapies can finance a 45-minute conversation about your advanced-care directives. Some private insurers and state Medicaid programs already reimburse such consultations. So it\u2019s no surprise that the Illinois medical society, geriatricians, policymakers and advocacy groups are quietly pushing both private insurers and Medicare to reconsider the idea, this time through regulatory and administrative actions rather than new legislation. The American Medical Association\u2014which plays an outsized role in determining how doctors are compensated\u2014will also submit information to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services concerning the mechanics of reimbursing such services.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing inherently ideological about these services, either. Donald Taylor of Duke University, one of the nation\u2019s leading palliative care policy experts, notes that \u201cPrior to the Affordable Care Act, hospice policy and discussions around advanced directives and the like tended to have broad bipartisan support.\u201d Indeed, it was a Republican senator, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, who co-sponsored 2007\u2019s Medicare End-of-Life Planning Act to expand coverage for voluntary care counseling in cases of serious illness. A very similar provision was included in the House version of what became the Affordable Care Act. Section 1223 would have paid physicians for discussing advanced-care planning with their patients.\n\nThen came the \u201cdeath panel\u201d bomb. I still can\u2019t quite believe that occurred. Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann and Betsey McCaughey, a pundit whose health-care writings have been widely discredited, grotesquely distorted the debate. In Palin\u2019s memorable words:\n\nThe America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama\u2019s \u201cdeath panel\u201d so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their \u201clevel of productivity in society,\u201d whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.\n\nIt\u2019s disgraceful that a national figure would peddle malicious nonsense that earned Politifact\u2019s \u201c Lie of the Year\u201d award. It was more than a little pathetic, too. Politicians across the political spectrum have made important contributions in the domain of intellectual disability. When Palin\u2019s life was unexpectedly touched in this way, I had hoped that she would parlay her charisma and national platform to accomplish something worthy.\n\nShe chose a different path. To my knowledge, Palin has played no sustained or substantial role in any disability policy issue. She quit her job as governor to hit the right-wing mashed potato circuit. The \u201cdeath panel\u201d episode itself sealed her transition from intriguing newcomer on the national scene to embarrassing fringe figure. She\u2019s garnered some lucrative media deals. But her reputation has suffered heavily.\n\n***\n\nAmericans with most reason to worry about supposed death panels\u2014individuals with disabilities or costly chronic conditions\u2014 rank among the most vocal supporters of health reform. The Arc, America\u2019s leading advocacy organization for people living with intellectual disabilities, concluded in a 2012 report: \u201cNumerous ACA provisions related to both acute care and long term services and supports hold great promise for improving the health and well-being of people with disabilities.\u201d\n\nIronically, the ACA specifically (and rather foolishly) forbids considerations of cost-effectiveness and quality-of-life in a wide range of coverage decisions. Moreover, the experts who do want to aggressively deploy cost-effectiveness research in coverage decisions are much more passionate about needless endoscopies, back surgeries and CT scans than they are about end-of-life care. An Institute of Medicine report identified \u201cpriority topics\u201d in which to apply comparative effectiveness research. None of their top 25 priorities were in end-of-life care.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "It\u2019s time to revisit a good idea that was distorted by demagoguery.", "title": "Let\u2019s Talk About \u2018Death Panels\u2019", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/07/death-panels-108553.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/07/06/140706_pollack_deathpanels_gty.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Health Care,The Big Idea,Death Panels,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "It\u2019s time to revisit a good idea that was distorted by demagoguery.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The \u201cdeath panel\u201d episode itself sealed her transition from intriguing newcomer on the national scene to embarrassing fringe figure.\nThen came the \u201cdeath panel\u201d bomb.\nSome concerned his preferences regarding end-of-life care.\nNone of their top 25 priorities were in end-of-life care.\nMoreover, the experts who do want to aggressively deploy cost-effectiveness research in coverage decisions are much more passionate about needless endoscopies, back surgeries and CT scans than they are about end-of-life care."}
