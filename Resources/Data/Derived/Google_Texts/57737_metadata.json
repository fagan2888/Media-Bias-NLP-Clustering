I already know I walk about 5 miles a day, in addition to my daily swim. My weight is stable within a range of 2 pounds. I prefer to remain accountable only to myself, not to a gadget.\n\nBut several of my peers swear by their fitness trackers, and experts say that older adults are among those who could benefit most from such devices.\n\nElise Bloustein, a 62-year-old Brooklynite, calls the Fitbit she has worn daily since Christmas \u201cmy little health whisperer\u201d that asks, \u201cHave you walked today?\u201d It has made her \u201chungry for walking,\u201d she said, prompting her to triple her daily mileage, improve her diet and shed 13 pounds she had carried around since her first child was born.\n\nBy syncing the device with her iPhone via a free app and recording the foods she eats, she has learned to balance calorie input with output and to eat more fruits, vegetables and fiber. She also uses the device to monitor the quantity and quality of her sleep as she strives for seven solid hours of shut-eye a night.\n\n\u201cAs a lawyer,\u201d she said, \u201cI spend the day sitting at my desk on the computer or the phone. I had read that the longer you sit, the sooner you\u2019ll die. The Fitbit encourages me to get up and move. I now average 40 to 43 miles a week just walking.\u201d\n\nBloustein got her sister, a 61-year-old high school social worker in San Francisco, hooked on the tracker as well. Instead of driving to do errands, her sister now walks to reach the number of steps she sets as her daily goal.\n\nThe main motivator for those who love a fitness tracker seems to be the pat on the back it gives them when goals are achieved. As my friend Fran Saunders put it, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of cool when it buzzes because you\u2019ve reached your 10,000 steps, especially when that happens early in the day.\u201d\n\nThis surging industry of wearable technology \u2014 the Fitbit now has plenty of competition, including devices from Jawbone, Garmin, Nike and Misfit \u2014 has had brisk sales, particularly among young adults \u201cmotivated enough to want a device and be able to afford it,\u201d Mitesh S. Patel and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania wrote in the medical journal JAMA.\n\nAlas, the experts noted, these are the people who least need a technological push to improve their health.\n\n\u201cThe individuals who might have the most to gain from these devices are likely to be older and less affluent,\u201d they wrote, including those who are sedentary or have a chronic ailment and could benefit from more activity.\n\nPatel and his colleagues at Penn\u2019s Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics are doing clinical trials to determine what strategies can best sustain changes in health behaviors induced by fitness trackers.\n\nBloustein said it definitely helped to be a compulsive person.\n\n\u201cAt night if I see I haven\u2019t met my goals, I\u2019ll take a nice walk through the neighborhood until I hit my 5 miles,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a personality thing \u2014 my colleagues said the tracker made them claustrophobic.\u201d\n\nBut her college-age daughter, who like the rest of the family also wears a Fitbit, is now walking 25,000 steps a day, five times the amount of the average American.\n\nSome have reported online that wearing a fitness tracker was counterproductive, resulting in weight gain. Korie Mulholland, a 24-year-old tutor in Chicago, wrote that \u201csince I was walking 10 to 15 miles a day at my stand-up desk, it told me I could eat 2,200 to 2,400 calories a day.\u201d But instead of losing weight, she gained, and after six months, she abandoned the tracker.\n\nMulholland is not alone among tracker dropouts. In a survey of 6,223 individuals, Endeavor Partners, a research firm, found that more than half who bought a fitness tracker had stopped using it.\n\nDifferent folks need different strokes. Those motivated by competition, for example, might enjoy mileage contests. The Penn team suggested that users might \u201cform teams that provide peer support and promote a sense of accountability\u201d to maintain the new behavior, \u201cperhaps aiming for everyone to achieve a minimum amount of activity rather than simply rewarding the power walkers.\u201d\n\nBut Rikke Duus, a professor at University College London, said that there is a dark side to the tracker.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning it was a very helpful friend, but after a while, many felt quite controlled by the device, feeling pressured to reach their daily targets and feeling guilty when they failed to do so,\u201d she said. \u201cIt became more about reaching goals than doing what\u2019s good for you.\u201d\n\nWearable fitness trackers vary in price \u2014 from about $49 to $250 \u2014 and technical accuracy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think of the Fitbit as 100 percent accurate,\u201d Bloustein said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s accurate or not, it keeps me in a place I want to be.\u201d\n\nFor those interested in saving money, the University of Pennsylvania study in JAMA, found that most smartphone applications were just as accurate as a wearable device in tracking someone\u2019s physical activity.\n\n\u201cCompared with the 1 to 2 percent of adults in the U.S. that own a wearable device, more than 65 percent of adults carry a smartphone,\u201d Patel said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/04/wpfitband.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Like many people who grew up long before personal computers and cellphones became ubiquitous, I\u2019ve never tried a fitness tracker.\nThe main motivator for those who love a fitness tracker seems to be the pat on the back it gives them when goals are achieved.\nIn a survey of 6,223 individuals, Endeavor Partners, a research firm, found that more than half who bought a fitness tracker had stopped using it.\nSome have reported online that wearing a fitness tracker was counterproductive, resulting in weight gain.\nI already know I walk about 5 miles a day, in addition to my daily swim."}
