That\u2019s a 34 percent drop \u2014 or as much as Canada spent to fight ISIS last year.\n\nIt has been a windfall for hospitals.\n\n\u201cI think we need to stop and recognize that 430,000 more Oregonians are covered under the ACA, and that was exactly the plan, and we anticipated this increase in financial performance in the short-term,\u201d said Andy Van Pelt, the executive vice president of the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems.\n\nOPB asked him, at some point, doesn\u2019t all this success begin to call into question the status of tax-exempt hospitals?\n\n\n\n\u201cMedicare put in several cuts over a 10 year period, specifically designed to offset some of these gains,\u201d he said.\n\nThose cuts amount to $155 billion \u2014 a lot of money. Van Pelt said making up for those smaller government payments is a form of charity care.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced.\n\n\u201cSeeing Medicare and Medicaid patients as a community benefits activity rather than as a regular line of business \u2014 I think the state does have an interest in looking at that,\u201d said Mitch Greenlick, chair of Oregon\u2019s House Healthcare Committee.\n\nHe said pointing to the difference between what Medicare pays for a procedure and what a hospital charges doesn\u2019t work. That is because hospital costs are notoriously variable.\n\nA hip replacement, for example, can be $60,000 in one Oregon hospital and $30,000 in another, even though they\u2019re down the street from each other and there is no difference in quality.\n\nAs far as the IRS is concerned, there is no financial threshold that a hospital has to cross to justify tax-exempt status. But it does have to operate to serve the public interest rather than a private interest.\n\nIRS spokesman David Tucker said they\u2019ll be looking at hospitals on a case by case basis.\n\n\u201cThe IRS will weigh all facts and circumstances in each case to determine if a specific hospital is tax-exempt. Community benefit is a flexible standard based on a totality of circumstances,\u201d said Tucker.\n\nQuite apart from whether smaller federal payments constitute community benefit, Andy Van Pelt said Oregon hospitals are doing other things to increase charitable care.\n\nFor example, his group is telling hospitals to help families with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level instead of the previous level of 139 percent.\n\nHe also said hospitals are being asked to spend about the same amount on community benefit in future years, as they did in previous years.\n\nBut that figure is not linked to inflation, so its effect will reduce over time. And, any change is voluntary.\n\n\u201cNot every hospital has accepted it,\u201d said Andy Van Pelt. \u201cBut over 90 percent have.\u201d\n\nSo what does he think about Oregon politicians looking into the community benefit of hospitals?\n\n\u201cBecause we are still so early into this transformation, we just have to, in a sense, be patient before we start changing policies when we really don\u2019t know the true impact of what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nThe chair of Oregon\u2019s House Healthcare Committee, Mitch Greenlick, says they won\u2019t be looking into this issue this short legislative session. But the longer session in 2017 is a different matter.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Kristian Foden-Vencil", "og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-hospital-charity-care-dropping-precipitously/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_300,q_90,w_400/hospital6_zddklr.jpg", "description": "Now that more people have health insurance, tax-exempt hospitals aren't performing as much charity care.
