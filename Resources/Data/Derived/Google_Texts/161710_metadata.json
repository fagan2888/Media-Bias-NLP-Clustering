View Larger SAVANNAH \u2014 The Webb Military Museum is now open in downtown Savannah and features military artifacts from the Civil War to the present.\n\n\n\nThe personal collection, collected and curated by Savannahian Gary Webb, features rare military items, each with an interesting story. This self-guided museum is the only one of its kind in Savannah and aims to have visitors feel closer to the men and women who wore the uniforms, hats and metals.\n\n\n\nWebb said his parents instilled a love of military history at an early age. Webb was raised in military life with a father who served as an Air Force officer for 33 years.\n\n\n\nHowever, it was his mother\u2019s personal stories of growing up in London during World War II and her firsthand accounts of living through five years of deadly bombing and rocket attacks from the Germans that really instilled his love of history and ultimately created the inspiration for the new museum.\n\n\n\n\u201cI began collecting military artifacts at the age of 10 while living in Germany in the mid-1960s,\u201d Webb said. \u201cAs my collection grew of these servicemen\u2019s personal items, I wanted to find a way to honor their service and share with the Savannah community the love of history I have.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe museum is at 411 E. York St. on Columbia Square in Savannah. It also features a store and website where patrons can buy collectables not found in the museum.\n\n\n\nAdmission is $9 for adults with discounts for senior citizens and children 8-17. Younger children and active-duty military get in free. The museum hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Saturday.
