Combined, their combined price tag tops $2.5 billion.\n\nThe latest purchase: Phoenix Physicians, a Fort Lauderdale-based provider of doctors and medical personnel to 21 hospitals in six states, including the Broward Health system. Phoenix was just bought for $170 million by Dallas-based EmCare, which calls itself the country's biggest physician services group.\n\nExperts say the trend stems from a mix of factors, including the Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare; requirements for electronic medical records; a squeeze on payments from insurance companies; and a rise in demand for health care from aging baby boomers and others.\n\nMany companies want to bulk up to afford new information technology systems and to spread their administrative systems over a larger base, cutting their costs. They say many big hospital groups want to deal with fewer vendors to reduce their administrative costs, so they're pushed to merge.\n\n\"The pace of acquisitions is going to accelerate, because that's the way to keep costs down,\" said Laura Kozloski Hart, a consultant on mergers and acquisitions and associate professor of business at Barry University. \"We're going to find health care to be an extremely consolidated industry.\"\n\nThe Phoenix Physicians deal shows the consolidation trend.\n\nThe buyer, EmCare, now serves more than 500 hospitals with some 9,000 medical professionals. It in turn is part of Colorado-based Envision Healthcare Holdings, which had nearly $4 billion in revenue last year.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "description": "The health care industry in South Florida has a serious case of acquisition fever.
