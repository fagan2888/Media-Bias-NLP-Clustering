Fifty-six percent of American adults say that it is not the federal government’s responsibility to provide healthcare coverage, according to a new Gallup poll.

The survey released Monday shows that anti-government healthcare sentiment, which has risen dramatically during Obama’s presidency, is now at a “record high,” according to Gallup.

Fifty-five percent of independents don’t think the government needs to provide health coverage, compared to just 27 percent of independents in 2000.

Eighty-six percent of Republicans think it is not the government’s job to provide health coverage, while only 12 think that it is the government’s responsibility.

A record 30 percent of Democrats now feel that it is not the government’s job to provide health coverage.

In 2006, however, a whopping 69 percent of Americans believed that the government has a responsibility to provide health coverage.
