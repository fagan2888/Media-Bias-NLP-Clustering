It would increase by 16 percent from 2017 to 2026.\n\nUnder Sanders' plan, the federal government would bear the brunt of healthcare spending and states and local governments would spend far less.\n\nOverall, state and local governments could save up to $4.1 trillion from 2017 to 2026, the think tank said.\n\nSince the plan would eliminate private health insurance, households and employers would pay less as the federal government absorbs more of the costs. For instance, private-sector spending would drop by $1.7 trillion in 2017 and $21.9 trillion to 2026.\n\n\"These considerable savings would partially offset the impact on the private sector of new taxes,\" Urban said.\n\nThe analysis details other issues with a single-payer system, including hospitals and doctors getting paid less.\n\nHospitals would see only a small effect since Medicare and Medicaid patients would pay more and get payments from the newly insured. However, providers would \"receive less revenue for providing care to those who would otherwise be privately insured,\" the analysis said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bernie Sanders' ambitious plan for universal healthcare would need $16.6 trillion more in tax revenue to pay for it, according to a new analysis.\nThe center-left think tank Urban Institute found that Sanders' plan would need additional taxes and would hit doctors and hospitals with lower payments.
