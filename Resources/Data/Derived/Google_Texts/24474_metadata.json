But as technology advances, deaf people may soon have cochlear implants that are invisible to observers, which could challenge the community\u2019s identity. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is developing an entirely internal cochlear implant. Users would charge the device wirelessly; the prototype charger plugs into a cell phone and charges the implant in two minutes. This middle-ear technology created by MIT, Harvard University, and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary has already been tested on a few patients, who were able to hear with it. The University of Utah has also previously worked on a microphone that can be implanted in the middle ear. The conflict is essentially over our individual approaches towards our hearing loss, by way of culture and technology. The currently available cochlear implant is a physical behind-the-ear piece, which looks like a larger hearing aid. It has a microphone, which brings sound through a wire to an external magnet that connects to an internal magnet by the inner ear. The brain then translates the audio it receives from the microphone into understandable messages. I am a person with a hearing loss. At nine months of age, I was diagnosed as having been born \u201cprofoundly deaf.\u201d I received two hearing aids when I was 10-months-old and began learning American Sign Language (ASL) around the same time. My parents then enrolled me in an oral-deaf educational program from preschool to eighth grade, where I learned how to hear and speak. At 11 years old, I got my cochlear implant. Now, I am a member of the everyday hearing world, living in New York, and about to graduate from Pace University.\n\nWithin the deaf population, there is a divide over how people with hearing loss should approach technology. The Deaf (note the capital \u201cD\u201d) subculture, largely using ASL, believes we should embrace our deafness and not treat it as something to be \u201cfixed.\u201d Whereas the deaf (lowercase \u201cd\u201d) community has adopted devices to hear and speak, becoming a part of the hearing world. The conflict is essentially over our individual approaches towards our hearing loss, by way of culture and technology. While I have many deaf friends in both communities, I am a part of the lowercase \u201cd\u201d deaf culture or the oral-deaf group. The emerging technology of invisible implants will challenge our community in dealings both with hearing and Deaf people. The Hearing World When venturing into the hearing world, the oral deaf often bump into many who see the cochlear implant (and also the hearing aid) as a \u201ccure\u201d for hearing loss. We have to argue that it isn\u2019t because, while our hearing is improved, we still have difficulty understanding others. Related Story How Digital Technology Is Transforming Our Relationship With Sound We don\u2019t know if this new internal cochlear implant is a \u201ccure.\u201d It probably won\u2019t be. But in the eyes of many hearing people, it already is. Deaf people wearing internal cochlear implants will have trouble validating themselves as deaf to hearing people who don\u2019t see a physical device on their heads. The loss of that visual cue will blur the line between the oral deaf and the hearing. I can already imagine a situation in which I\u2019m wearing an internal cochlear implant and ask my hearing friends to set up subtitles for a movie. What kind of response would I get? \u201cBut you don\u2019t have a hearing aid.\u201d \u201cAre you wearing a cochlear implant? I don\u2019t see one.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t need captions.\u201d When I don\u2019t catch what was said in a conversation, I often casually point to my external cochlear implant and say \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t hear what you said,\u201d or \u201cI totally misunderstood you.\u201d It\u2019s an easy shortcut that would be lost with the new technology.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When cochlear implants are no longer visible, the solidarity of a deaf community may be lost.", "author": "Patrick deHahn", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "When cochlear implants are no longer visible, the solidarity of a deaf community may be lost.", "title": "How Technology Could Threaten Deaf Identity", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/05/RTR1R1LL/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/how-technology-could-threaten-deaf-identity/361604/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd98b9\"", "article_summary": "But as technology advances, deaf people may soon have cochlear implants that are invisible to observers, which could challenge the community\u2019s identity.\nDeaf people wearing internal cochlear implants will have trouble validating themselves as deaf to hearing people who don\u2019t see a physical device on their heads.\nWithin the deaf population, there is a divide over how people with hearing loss should approach technology.\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is developing an entirely internal cochlear implant.\nThe emerging technology of invisible implants will challenge our community in dealings both with hearing and Deaf people."}
