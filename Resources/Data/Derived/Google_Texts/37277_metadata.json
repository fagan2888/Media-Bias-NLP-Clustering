This morning, he called me to discuss the prospects for the two-year budget deal (covering 2016 and 2017) that his report says must be concluded \u201cno later than the next month or so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remain hopeful but less hopeful than I was a few months ago,\u201d Hale told me. \u201cThings aren\u2019t going especially well. To my knowledge, there are no discussions going on with the Congress or the administration, and the Planned Parenthood issue will add to the partisanship.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Congress, [though], it\u2019s always darkest just before the dawn,\u201d he went on, since legislators love to use time pressure to force last-minute compromise. Partisanship \u201cis worse than it was 20-30 years ago, it\u2019s harder to make a deal, and definitely the chaos level is higher, [but] all is not lost.\u201d\n\nThe best sign we could see when Congress reconvenes, Hale told me, is for key members to step up \u2014 with the explicit or tacit blessing of leadership \u2014 and start working out a deal, much as Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Paul Ryan did two years ago. There\u2019s no visible evidence such negotiations are underway yet, he acknowledged, \u201cbut these things are best done quietly.\u201d\n\nThe worst sign, he said, would be for the partisan battle over Planned Parenthood to escalate. That could not only poison the waters for any bipartisan cooperation. As a matter of simple scheduling, the Planned Parenthood debate could run out the clock: There are just 10 legislative days left before the fiscal year ends on September 30. Without at least a stopgap budget deal before October 1st \u2014 if only a much-dreaded continuing resolution \u2014 the government shuts down.\n\nA year-long continuing resolution, which would simply put the government on autopilot at 2015 funding levels, would be a \u201cnightmare,\u201d Hale made clear. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s politically possible to overturn the Budget Control Act this year or next \u2014 that will have to wait for the next president, he said \u2014 but he\u2019s hoping for both more money than the BCA caps allow and more predictability than the last five years have offered.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the last five years have been unprecedented in the level of budget turmoil, I never remember anything like it,\u201d Hale said. So, looking forward, he said, \u201cthe one thing that strikes me as critically important is to get a two-year deal, [so] we won\u2019t have to do this again next year, in the endgame of a presidential election.\u201d (He wouldn\u2019t reject a one-year deal if two years proved impossible, he acknowledged).\n\nGetting adequate funding levels is at least as important as getting certainty, however, Hale went on. \u201cWe have certainty, I guess, with the Budget Control Act such as it is, [but] the funding level, given the state of the world, doesn\u2019t seem adequate,\u201d he said. He\u2019d consider the president\u2019s budget request for 2016 \u2014 prepared after Hale left office \u2014 a good level.\n\nSo which is more important, greater certainty or a bigger budget? Faced with a choice between either settling for a deal with inadequate funding \u2014 knowing that you\u2019d at least have certainty \u2014 or pushing for a deal with adequate funding \u2014 at the risk of getting no deal at all \u2014 Hale said he\u2019d choose the latter. If it were up to him, Hale said, he\u2019d shoot for \u201cadded funding, even at the cost of uncertainty.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON: The former top budgeteer at the Pentagon says he\u2019s clinging to hope for a sequestration deal this fall \u2014 but he admitted the signs so far aren\u2019t looking good. \u201cI\u2019ve got my fingers crossed for when Congress come backs next week,\u201d Bob Hale told me this morning.
