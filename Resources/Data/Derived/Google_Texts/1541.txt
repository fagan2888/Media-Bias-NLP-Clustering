The Choctaw Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America held a dinner at the Northwood Country Club Saturday evening to raise funds for the upcoming year. Each year, the scouts help local kids go to Camp Binachi and upkeep the camp. Scout executive Ken Kercheval says fundraisers like this make a huge impact for local youth.

"It's important to support great programs that teach young people character, leadership and that's what scouting does it's what our world needs and what our community needs," he explains.

The Choctaw Area Council serves six counties across the area.
