Clippers\u2019 former owner, who is being countersued by the NBA, was banned for life from the NBA after his racist rant, Buss released this statement on LakersNation.com.\n\n\u201cIn my statement yesterday, I said I had full confidence in Adam Silver and how he and the NBA would handle this situation. In today\u2019s announcement Adam was decisive, firm and compelling and showed great leadership in his condemnation of the horrible and offensive comments that have led to this action.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Parallels Drawn Between NBA\u2019s Sterling and NFL\u2019s Snyder on Racism\n\nLast year, Buss\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Knicks president Phil Jackson, also said via Twitter that the name should be changed. \u201cFor the past decade my alma mater has dithered about their mascot name: The Fighting Sioux. I gave a talk some 5 yr ago when honored with a PhD of Phil-osophy about \u201cchange.\u201d How each generation has to embrace change\u2026. The use of the name #Redskins is highly offensive. It is time to find a new name. I suggest the name Whigs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President of Lakers Won\u2019t Draft Redskins Players For Fantasy Football Team", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/16/president-lakers-wont-draft-redskins-players-fantasy-football-team-156423", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/buss.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "President of Lakers Won\u2019t Draft Redskins Players For Fantasy Football Team"}, "abstract": "President of Lakers Won\u2019t Draft Redskins Players For Fantasy Football Team", "dc": {"title": "President of Lakers Won\u2019t Draft Redskins Players For Fantasy Football Team"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/16/president-lakers-wont-draft-redskins-players-fantasy-football-team-156423", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Jeanie Buss, Lakers, Donald Sterling, Redskins, NBA", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-16T07:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "President of Lakers Won\u2019t Draft Redskins Players For Fantasy Football Team"}, "article_summary": "But the Lakers President, Jeanie Buss, who recently created her fantasy team, says she\u2019s not taking any Redskins players.\nIt\u2019s Fantasy Football time, which means that drafting the NFL\u2019s best players, like Peyton Manning, Adrian Peterson or Alfred Morris to your squad is a win-win.\nThis is not the first time Buss has voiced her disapproval of a professional sports franchise.\n\u201cIn my statement yesterday, I said I had full confidence in Adam Silver and how he and the NBA would handle this situation.\nThe use of the name #Redskins is highly offensive."}
