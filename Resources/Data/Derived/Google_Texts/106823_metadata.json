The Coast Guard launched a 25-foot boat to assist in the search. About 40 minutes later, the girl was found about a mile from her group.\n\nThe coxswain for the response boat, Petty Officer 2nd Class Nicholas Cavallo, says having a buddy system when diving makes the experience safer.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
