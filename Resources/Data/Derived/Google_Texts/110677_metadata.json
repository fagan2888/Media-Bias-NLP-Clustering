He developed a signature hand gesture, \u201cthe cobra,\u201d a sharp four-fingered jab at the object of his contempt that usually accompanied the abrupt dismissal, \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\nRelated: Ex-Trump Insider \u2013 Donald Doesn\u2019t Want to Be President\n\nBut in his current role as frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, Trump appears to have allowed his trademark skill to atrophy. Because, let\u2019s face it, he is surrounded by people who need firing in the worst way.\n\nHe has a spokesperson whose list of lies, misrepresentations and blunders rivals his own. Yet she is still put in front of the cameras to represent the campaign.\n\nHe has an attorney on staff who insisted that it was legally impossible for a husband to rape his wife. That man still has a job and, apparently, a law license.\n\nMost plainly in need of the Trump cobra, though, is campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who was arrested Tuesday morning in Florida and charged with simple battery for grabbing a reporter and yanking her out of his way after a Trump press conference earlier this month.\n\nVideo evidence released by the Jupiter, FL police Department today makes it pretty clear that what former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields claimed after the event was true: that she had been grabbed and pulled out of the way by Lewandowski, leaving her bruised and shaken.\n\nRelated: How Trump Got Outfoxed by Cruz in Louisiana\n\nBut after she made her original allegation, Lewandowski, with the backing of the Trump campaign organization, began an all-out assault on her credibility and reputation:\n\nToday\u2019s report of his arrest and the filing of a battery charge make it plain that Lewandowski lied about the incident. In any normal campaign, a senior official accused of assaulting a reporter would be jettisoned immediately \u2013 particularly after attempting to smear the reporter\u2019s reputation while lying about his own actions.\n\nBut the Trump campaign quickly closed ranks around Lewandowski. An official press release claimed that he was \u201cabsolutely innocent.\u201d Spokesperson Katrina Pierson went on CNN and declared that even if he were convicted, the campaign would still keep him on.\n\nTrump got in on the act personally, using Twitter to claim that the video tape, which plainly shows Lewandowski grabbing Fields, actually shows nothing of the sort.\n\nWow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016\n\nThen, Trump suggested that maybe he ought to file a complaint against Fields himself, for asking him questions after a press conference was over.\n\nVictory press conference was over.\n\nWhy is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? pic.twitter.com/qbW2RjkINX \u2014 Donald J.
