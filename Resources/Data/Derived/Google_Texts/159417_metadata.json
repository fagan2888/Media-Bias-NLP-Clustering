The large-diameter water line connects areas located on both sides of Silver Creek between Jeffersonville and New Albany.\n\nBecause of concerns, the company activated its system to contact customers via phone to alert them. Several received calls on home landlines on Saturday afternoon.\n\nFloyds Knobs Water customers also have been placed under the advisory because the utility purchases water from Indiana American.\n\nSilver Creek Water Corp. was not placed under the advisory, but issued a request through Indiana American for its customers to restrict non-essential water usage, spokesman Joe Loughmiller said.\n\nThe advisory does not affect customers who are served by other water utilities, such as Sellersburg, which has customers in the city of Jeffersonville. Ramsey, which buys water from Indiana American, had \u201cvalved off\u201d from the larger utility\u2019s supply lines and didn\u2019t need to participate in the precaution, Dave Seacat said.\n\n\u201cBecause we have already had many calls about low or no-water pressure throughout the system, we\u2019re asking customers to boil any water used for consumption as a precaution until we are able to repair the main and conduct water tests to ensure no contamination has entered the water system,\u201d said Bill Reedy, Southern Indiana operations manager.\n\n\u201cBecause of the size of the main and the amount of water being lost, we are also asking our customers to temporarily restrict their non-essential water use\u201d by turning off irrigation systems and lawn sprinklers, Reedy said.\n\nMore information will be provided as crews access the break. Expect the boil water and restrictions to remainn in place until at least late Sunday because of the size of the break, Loughmiller said.\n\nReporter Grace Schneider can be reached at 502-582-4082.

Among the tips:\n\n\u00b7 Avoid use of water for non-essential uses like washing vehicles, driveways, sidewalks and buildings.\n\n\u00b7 Avoid any use of water that results in flooding or run-off in waterways or hard surfaces like driveways or streets.\n\n\u00b7 Repair any plumbing leaks quickly and utilize water-saving shower heads, toilets, faucet aerators and other water-conserving appliances. Report any suspected leaks in company-owned facilities immediately to the customer service center at 1-800-492-8373.\n\n\u00b7 Avoid using water for decorative fountains or the filling or topping off of decorative lakes or ponds.\n\n\u00b7 Turn off the tap while brushing teeth or washing dishes.\n\nAdditional tips can be found on \u201cwise water use\u201d under the Learning Center tab at www.indianaamwater.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1S1i0aD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Clark, Floyd customers tied to Indiana American Water told to boil water after main break", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Clark, Floyd customers tied to Indiana American Water told to boil water after main break", "title": "31,000 in S.
