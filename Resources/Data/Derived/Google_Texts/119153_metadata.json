That much is evident in the dismal retail sales during the holiday shopping season. The Bureau of Economic Analysis\u2019s update for full personal consumption expenditure figures shows mostly the same (even though overall PCE is highly influenced by \u201cservices\u201d spending in the form of imputations and, where evident, services in the form of a tax, or health care).\n\n\n\nReal PCE spending was slightly negative in December month-over-month, which suggests another reason why GDP disappointed without too much snow or \u201cresidual seasonality.\u201d That makes two of the last three months with essentially zero spending growth despite both what the BEA suggests as somewhat rising income and no \u201cinflation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis has been an issue with these data points for some time, as the BEA continually suggests that income is rising faster than spending only to revise income lower in persistent fashion. This dichotomy is highlighted by the personal savings rate, which in count of repeated revisions appears as just noise almost without discernable pattern.\n\nEach time the savings rate moved up erratically (before the current spike) the BEA would eventually counter with a downward revision to income.\n\n\n\nEven still, the current trend in income growth remains lackluster by any reasonable standard, which is worse than even that appears in \u201creal\u201d terms since there is little to no calculated \u201cinflation\u201d subtracted in the past year or so. As a result, the savings rate has risen to the highest since 2012 as consumers aren\u2019t following these numbers.\n\n\n\nIn nominal terms, personal spending growth is as low as it was into the middle of the Great Recession and equivalent to the lowest point in the dot-com recession (just like 2012). The real PCE estimates would suggest that near-zero inflation is a significant difference in favor of the overall economic growth trend but the savings rate and other economic accounts show strongly otherwise.\n\n\n\nThat is all the more concerning given that the savings rate even on an upward trend here is relatively low to begin with. Consumers have very little room to absorb any negative factors since they are spending (in historic terms) almost all their income just for minor positive numbers overall (for now).\n\n\n\nFor most of the Great Recession, the savings rate fluctuated between 4 percent and 6 percent; in September 2008, the rate was 4.4 percent, jumping to 5.4 percent in October 2008 and 6.2 percent the month after.\n\n\n\nThe slope of the savings rate now is much shallower, but the direction remains (if or until there are income revisions again) to a somewhat similar degree. There isn\u2019t much discretion and what little consumers have been able to find (despite \u201cthe best jobs market in decades\u201d) they aren\u2019t parting with; and no discernable \u201ctax cut\u201d from the gasoline/oil price collapse, either.\n\n\n\nInstead, as far as monetary policy is concerned, December 2015 represented the 44th consecutive month of \u201cinflation\u201d undershooting the 2 percent target for the PCE deflator. At 0.58 percent, it was the highest rate since December 2014 but it won\u2019t last into January with at least the renewed commodity liquidation.\n\n\n\nInstead, there is clearly no relationship whatsoever between the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet and the PCE deflator. That might suggest one more reason why the whispers of negative nominal interest rates have only grown since last year rather than perhaps the more expected appeal of a fifth quantitative easing.\n\n\n\nWhatever the ultimate case for monetary policy, there is nothing in the spending and income estimates that suggest the economy the FOMC claimed it expected toward \u201coverheating.\u201d Quite the opposite, as \u201cunderheating\u201d appears to be widespread and more universal; maybe it\u2019s not that QE was ineffective but monetary policy overall, just in time for increasingly serious economic concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2016 Newsmax Finance.
