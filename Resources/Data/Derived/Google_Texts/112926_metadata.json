Police posted a YouTube video Friday in which a veterinarian and Animal Control officer both explain why it\u2019s best to wait for professionals to handle any injured animal.\n\nAfter watching the police explanation, Juras said she wasn\u2019t buying it.\n\nThe dog was hit on West 21st Avenue and Federal Boulevard \u2014 two blocks from her house.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the officers that were involved, whether it\u2019s a reprimand, whether it\u2019s a fine, I would like to see them be held accountable,\u201d Juras said.\n\nJuras said she is grateful for Ross Knapp, the neighbor who tried to intervene.\n\nAn online petition demanding an apology from DPD has more than 5,000 signatures.\n\nJuras said she signed the online petition herself before she discovered it was her dog.\n\nThe dog was hit on West 21st Avenue and Federal Boulevard \u2014 two blocks from Juras\u2019 house.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Owner of dog left in street doesn\u2019t buy police explanation", "title": "Owner of dog left in street doesn\u2019t buy police explanation", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/12/owner-of-dog-left-in-street-doesnt-buy-police-explanation/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-12T18:32:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-12T18:32:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16f5\"", "article_summary": "Police called Animal Control 15 minutes after arriving to the scene, but it took the on-call Animal Control officer more than an hour to arrive because he came from his home.\nThe owner of a dog hit by a car in Denver, which died 90 minutes later as police stood by, wants at least an apology from police.\nJuras said she signed the online petition herself before she discovered it was her dog.\nAn online petition demanding an apology from DPD has more than 5,000 signatures.\nJuras posted fliers of Harley throughout her neighborhood and on animal websites before she saw the video on 7News."}
