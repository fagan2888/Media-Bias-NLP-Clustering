The iconic actor who gave a generation nightmares and an unnatural fear of mirrors, along with saying the name Candyman repeatedly, graciously offered to have a chat with the Guardian Liberty Voice (GLV) via myself and we spent huge amount of time talking about many things. One of which is his upcoming one-man show titled Ghost in the House which is about the last 90 minutes of boxer Jack Johnson\u2019s life. The title is said to be from Drew \u201cBundini\u201d Brown, Muhammad Ali\u2019s cornerman, who used the boxer\u2019s mental connection with Johnson to give him a boost while the fighter was in the ring. During a number of Ali\u2019s major bouts, Bundini could be heard to shout from the corner, \u201c\u2026Jack Johnson\u2019s here! Ghost in the house!\u201d Although Tony himself explains later what the phrase means.\n\nFans of Mr. Todd\u2019s may not realise that he started in, and loves, theatre and studied at the Eugene O\u2019Neill National Actors Theatre Institute. Therefore it is not surprising that he is excited about doing the one-man play and taking it on tour. Tony is tall and impressive at six foot five inches and his personality is a big as his size. It is this presence that gives him the advantage over other actors since he combines his height with an unmatchable ability to act whoever is on screen with him right off the camera. It is also this ability that gave one fan at the Star Trek Las Vegas 2014 Convention a self professed terror of entering his bathroom alone, and in being front of the mirror (\u201cCandyman, Candyman\u2026\u201d) while he was growing up.\n\nWhile chatting with this award- performer, and producer, we talked about his latest work on the Diahnna Nicole Baxter/Andrew Piccone short film Cowboy\u2019s Girl. The film which was written by Baxter and Piccone (who also directed the production) star\u2019s Tony as Diahnna\u2019s father in the movie, \u201cCowboy.\u201d It is a biographical film by the actress/producer based on her issues with her own father. Mr. Todd and I came very close to chatting about the film in June this year, but since he has got to be the only actor in Hollywood who is busier than James Franco, the opportunity never came about.\n\nWhen the 59 year-old actor realized that we had \u201cmissed one another in June\u201d he kindly offered to have a chat while he was here at the Star Trek Convention. Before doing a transcript of the interview, a few things need to be pointed out. Firstly, Tony Todd is easily the most enjoyable interview I have ever done, he had me laughing constantly. Secondly, he is generous with his time and I almost felt we could have talked the afternoon/evening away without any pressure from him to stop. Thirdly, his quick mind can move from subject to subject in about a nanosecond.\n\nSo on August 2, 2014 at around 5:00 p.m. at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino, Tony Todd talked with myself about his upcoming one-man show, Twitter and pawn or porn. While the last bit sounds a bit dubious it is more innocent than it appears, think of the television commercial \u201cfrog or fraud\u201d and all will become abundantly clear. After taking a good bit of time to set up, which Mr. Todd did not mind in the least, the two of us were ready to talk.\n\n\n\n\n\nGLV: \u201cI found out recently, as in yesterday, that you are co-starring with the gentleman sitting next to us, Richard Hatch, in the upcoming Star Trek Independent film Axanar. Of course you\u2019ve just finished working on Cowboy\u2019s Girl\u2026\n\nTony Todd: \u201cYes that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\n\n\nGLV: \u201cI\u2019m very excited to see that film when it comes out. And Sushi Girl is making the rounds?\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cWell that actually made the rounds a couple of years ago but I was executive producer on that.\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cBut there are still good things being mentioned about the film.\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nGLV: You are going to be doing, as in voicing, another video game which you said yesterday you can\u2019t say what it is?\n\nTony Todd: \u201cYes, for example when I did the Call of Duty game, I had to sign a nondisclosure agreement about it. They said that while we won\u2019t fire you, we will sue you if you talk about the game. I guess they want the game to be the star.\u201d\n\n\n\nGLV: \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense when they go out of their way to put people who are so well known, like you, in the game.\u201d\n\nSidenote: The day before a younger fan wanted an autographed picture of Tony\u2019s character in the Call of Duty: Black Ops II. Tony told the youngster that he would be doing another video game but could not tell anyone what it was. I asked how excited was he, the lad, when he saw Tony Todd in the game.\n\nGLV: It\u2019s like when I asked the kid yesterday about how excited he was when he saw it was you in the game.\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cExactly you saw his little joy, that\u2019s why I had to give it to him [the picture] and hopefully he will treasure it, not covet it, but treasure it and appreciate it, because at the end of the day that\u2019s all we want.\u201d\n\n\n\nGLV: \u201cYou\u2019ve been working for a very long time in the industry and you\u2019ve become what I consider an icon in just the horror Genre alone\u2026\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cYeah\u2026I just want to grow up to be Morgan Freeman so I can play the same guy in every movie\u2026\u201d\n\nGLV: [laughing] \u201cThat is brilliant.\u201d\n\nTony Todd: [laughing] \u201cI read an article that Morgan himself did and he said that at this point he works two days, three days a week but they always say he gets second billing in the movie. And I guess that\u2019s what everybody aspires to, some of us, or I just want to be James Earl Jones and just be able to say \u2018CNN.\u2019 Just three letters\u2026CNN.\u201d\n\n\n\nGLV: \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is that they haven\u2019t used you in that capacity. You do have the same quality voice\u2026\u201d\n\nTony Todd: I\u2019m just not commercially friendly enough\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGLV: \u201cI think that there are millions of fans who would disagree with that.\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cWell you know what? Have you seen the Jack Daniels commercials for the honey?\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cWell you\u2019ve got all these actors doing these TV shots now. Kiefer doing whatever he\u2019s doing, playing himself\u2026I\u2019ve only seen it once though, the one with all the bees swarming around. Have you seen this? Flying into battle and I was thinking where are all my people on this thing. This would be perfect for the character.\n\nGLV: \u201cPerhaps since Candyman as a character actually killed people they couldn\u2019t get the negativity .\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cIt is an iconic character, maybe I\u2019ll just grow up to be the \u2018most interesting man in the world'\u201d [talking about the Dos Equis beer commercials]\n\nSidenote two: At this point, I made a reference to something I\u2019d heard about the man in the advert being Julio Iglesias. Having since learned that was a complete bit of misinformation, this part of the interview will be left out. Although it should be noted that Tony had heard nothing about the singer being in the adverts and did not believe it.\n\nTony: \u201cThat\u2019s okay, I\u2019m not really too serious about this advert business, especially since I\u2019m a bourbon fan and I wouldn\u2019t drink it. I like Woodford, if they want to do business that would be fine. Otherwise I\u2019d be lying. Have you ever heard of a drink\u2026I\u2019ve been doing work on a side project on interesting drinks (the Esquire channel, Esquire\u2019s America). Did you ever hear of a drink called the Pickle Back?\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cPickle Back?\u201d No I\u2019ve never heard of it.\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cWell you\u2019ve got to try it sometime, okay. You take Jamesons and then you take a shot of pickle juice.\u201d\n\n\n\nGLV: \u201cWow that is two of my favorite things in the world. I used to drink pickle juice straight from the jar when I was a kid.\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, that combination of flavor is something else. Don\u2019t have more than three of them. So, anyway Pickle Back is just one of the strange drinks we\u2019ve discovered on our American fascination.\u201d\n\n\n\nGLV: \u201cSo, are you going to be at the Axanar screening?\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cTonight? Less than 50/50 because I\u2019m doing a one-man show and we open in two weeks, and I have to do my work. I don\u2019t just show up [for the play] I\u2019ve got to get him in my bones.\u201d\n\n\n\nGLV: \u201cJust looking on IMDb alone this year and next year\u2026\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cThis year\u2019s been a great one .\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cYes, you have got a lot of projects going on.\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cAnd good stuff. Some years, I\u2019ve learned, I\u2019ve learned how to say no. There was a point when I didn\u2019t realise that I was becoming such a hard working actor and then that led to a couple of questionable things and I discovered that you\u2019re only as good as your weakest link and you\u2019ve got to respect the words. And sometimes saying no gives you more respect.\u201d\n\n\n\nGLV: \u201cSpeaking of respect, one of the things I loved that you did through the entire life of the Final Destination franchise, was that you kept showing up either in person or\u2026\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cor somehow\u2026\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cYes. If they come back yet again, and it would not surprise me if they did, would you say yes and come back?\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cI would have to because they would finally have to explain who the h*ll I am.\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cYes that would be brilliant.\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cAnd I know who I am, because I told them who I was [in the film] \u2013 the powers that be \u2013 as they had no idea. I had to make it real. But it\u2019s not what people think.\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cI always thought that in that particular role you were the emissary of death, not the big-bad himself.\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cNo, that\u2019s what people think, but that\u2019s not it. You can\u2019t play negative, as an actor you can\u2019t play negative, you have to use the positive. So I made another choice.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*At that point two gentlemen came up to sort out something with Tony and after a short break we got back into the interview.*\n\nTony: \u201cNow where were we.\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cI was just about to ask that, but just remembered that I forgot to pick up your business card yesterday.\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cThis is like radio folks, so let\u2019s pretend we\u2019re like Orson Welles. \u2018I am handing him a perfectly laminated card, I think it says Twitter or something, tweet tweet? Are you a bird man Michael? [gives his classic Tony Todd laugh]\n\n\n\nAfter thanking Mr. Todd for retweeting a post I\u2019d done the day before we talked some about the social networking site. I was, and still am actually, amazed that Twitter has not verified this iconic man\u2019s account. At that time a couple of fans came up for an autograph and one of the two men had a vibrating tribble. Tony then asked if he could hold the thing and then did a Vine video of him and the \u201ccreature\u201d trembling. Pausing for this very entertaining exchange, the fan revealed that after seeing Candyman, \u201cwhen I was a kid,\u201d he was too scared to go into his bathroom alone for a shower or to stand in front of the mirror for years.\n\nGLV: \u201cI forgot where we were at now. \u201c\n\nTony: \u201cWell, we were having too much fun. We had a tribble moment, somebody came up with a pink tribble and I put it in my hand and was shaking it and it felt great. And before that it was the laminated tweet card that we told our fine audience about.\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cThat\u2019s right we talked about celebrities who have Twitter accounts but who don\u2019t personally use them.\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cWell, Twitter doesn\u2019t come with instructions right? No. So learn as you go and my the best proclivity win.This new one though is the one that frightens me, the Vine, because it\u2019s geared towards six seconds of expression a visual expression and this feeds into America and the world\u2019s whole short attention span which is getting shorter as we speak. And for kids I think there\u2019s more to life than just six seconds.\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cYeah, yeah, Definitely, and yet I\u2019m glad you brought that up. I did an article a couple of years ago about an interview they did with children in the U.S. and in England, where they asked school kids what they wanted to be when they grew up and their answer was \u2018famous.\u2019And that was it, they had no idea how to get there\u2026\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cNo, no idea of how to be famous. I think, I don\u2019t want to name any names, but I think a certain family made that sort of palpable in our society and unfortunately a lot of reality shows, and I don\u2019t want to mention any particular brand\u2026But they are all based on bad behaviour towards each other. Particularly the women shows that are around. \u201c\n\n\n\nGLV: \u201d I know exactly what you mean and I can think of the initials right off the top of my head.\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cAnd it\u2019s all on bad behaviour and these people feel that they are now famous and okay, this one I will name, cause I\u2019m not going to say anything bad about it, look at the Pawn Stars. I didn\u2019t know, until I was in one of my rooms upstairs, that\u2019s there\u2019s a live show\u2026did you know this?\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cNo I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cIn Vegas, every afternoon at 4:30\u2026\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cI had no idea.\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cIt\u2019s called the lost episode and they\u2019re getting paid for this bullsh*t and they\u2019ve done a spun-off into another show called Pawnography. All right?\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cI had no idea. I knew that this was like the mecca of the world for porn\u2026\u201d\n\nTony:\u201dDid you say pawn or porn?\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cPorn.\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cPawn or Porn. It\u2019s like that show where he says frog or fraud\u2026frog\u2026fraud\u2026So did you say pawn or porn?\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cI said Porn, with an Irish pronunciation.\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cOh, you know what they\u2019re doing, they are doing the Vanessa del Rio Story.\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cNo kidding.\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cDo our friends out there know who Vanessa del Rio was?\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cWould you care to explain to them?\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cNo I cannot!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGLV: [laughter}\n\nTony Todd: \u201cShe was a seminal participant in the Pawn industry. Pawn or Porn\u2026Pawn. No I\u2019m actually happy for her because it\u2019s going to be like Boogie Nights meets Taxi Driver. She\u2019s part, and I don\u2019t know why I know all this, Cuban and Puerto Rican and she came up at the time that Times Square was still there. The Midnight Cowboy Times Square and there was a lot of mob influence in the Pawn industry and it makes for a fascinating story if you do it right. She\u2019s got over a 100 literal bodies of work already. Anyway, I digress, I\u2019ll let you bring me back on point.\u201d\n\n\n\nTony: \u201cHang on a second while I have another sip of my Caramel Macchiato on ice.\u201d\n\n\n\nGLV: [laughter] \u201cWill they be doing a premiere of Cowboy\u2019s Girl?\u201d\n\nTony Todd: \u201cYes they will be.\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cIn LA or will they be doing it here?\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cI think, you know, she wants to do both.\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cThat would be great.\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cBecause she has family here. Yes, her father, the actual cowboy, lives here.\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cWhat I would love to do, when it comes out, is have a chat with you and I want to have a chat with her. [Diahnna]\n\nTony Todd: \u201cThat\u2019s what you should do.\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cAnd lastly, your show. Starts in two weeks? And is called?\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cGhost in the House. Which is in reference to superstition in boxing gyms all over the world and people who really know the history of boxing is that the spirit of Jack Johnson is a restless soul. The play is about the last 90 minutes of Jack\u2019s life.\n\nGLV: \u201cHow long is that going to run for?\n\nTony Todd: \u201cWell We hope it runs forever. But we\u2019ll do four quick days in LA for spring training and then we\u2019re touring around everywhere, we\u2019ve got Puerto Rico, Howard University, Tuskegee, Chicago, and Reno so far. When that is all \u201cofficial,\u201d official that will be dropped on Twitter. So I hope you get to see it.\u201d\n\nGLV: \u201cI hope so too! Thank you so much sir for taking so much time with me.\u201d\n\nTony: \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d\n\nAs the interview ended, Tony Todd agreed to have a photo taken with me, and he had talked of many things; his one-man show, Twitter, which I still think the social network should get off their backsides and verify his account, and pawn or porn. His show, Ghost in the House will open in two weeks time. Check Twitter, @TonyTodd54 on a regular basis as I\u2019m sure this iconic performer will be tweeting where and when in Los Angeles. This particular interview has been memorable as this fan finally got to meet the man behind Candyman and so many other iconic characters.
