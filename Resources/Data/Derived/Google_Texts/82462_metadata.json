Axis has clinics in Cortez and Pagosa Springs as well as running La Plata Integrated Health, the Crossroads at Grandview for crisis-level psychiatric care and detox patients, and the Columbine Center in Bodo Industrial Park.\n\nThe money will be used to create a Cortez Integrated Health along the lines of La Plata Integrated Health, Axis Chief Operating Officer Shelly Burke said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re operating on a limited scope there, with a much smaller clinic that includes both primary care and mental-health services,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will allow us to increase our services, because they have the same problem recruiting primary-care physicians as we do over here.\u201d\n\nThe problem with recruiting primary-care physicians isn\u2019t just the cost of doing business here, she said.\n\n\u201cThere are so few primary-care physicians coming into the market,\u201d Burke said, \u201cbecause most physicians are specializing now.\u201d\n\nThe increase in capacity in Cortez is sorely needed, said Bern Heath, CEO of Axis Health.\n\n\u201cWe have as high a population of Medicaid patients in Montezuma County as we do in La Plata County,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s numbers, not percentage. Because Montezuma County has half the population, that means twice the percentage of Medicaid patients. And reimbursement for Medicaid services is pitiful.\u201d\n\nFortunately, he said, health centers receive a higher reimbursement than private physicians. It\u2019s as difficult in Montezuma County as it is in La Plata County to find physicians who will accept Medicare, as well, so the Cortez Integrated Health will help fill that void, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for people to understand that this is not a free clinic,\u201d Heath said. \u201cWe have a sliding scale based on ability to pay, and we determine what constitutes an ability to pay.\u201d\n\nLa Plata Integrated Health opened in January 2014 after Axis received a similar grant through the federal Health Resources and Services Administration. It currently has about 1,400 patients and a capacity for about 2,000 more, Heath said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20150506/NEWS01/150509732/", "type": "article", "image": "http://durangoherald.com/storyimage/DU/20150506/NEWS01/150509732/AR/0/AR-150509732.jpg?maxw=1000&imageversion=16by9", "site_name": "The Durango Herald", "title": "Axis Health gains a $541,000 grant"}, "fb": {"app_id": 263076300371367, "pages": 205518469520233}}, "article_summary": "The money will be used to create a Cortez Integrated Health along the lines of La Plata Integrated Health, Axis Chief Operating Officer Shelly Burke said.\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced more than $101 million in grants to health centers, including more than $541,000 to Southwest Colorado Mental Health Center, now doing business as Axis Health.\n\u201cWe have a sliding scale based on ability to pay, and we determine what constitutes an ability to pay.\u201dLa Plata Integrated Health opened in January 2014 after Axis received a similar grant through the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.\n\u201cWe have as high a population of Medicaid patients in Montezuma County as we do in La Plata County,\u201d he said.\nAxis has clinics in Cortez and Pagosa Springs as well as running La Plata Integrated Health, the Crossroads at Grandview for crisis-level psychiatric care and detox patients, and the Columbine Center in Bodo Industrial Park."}
