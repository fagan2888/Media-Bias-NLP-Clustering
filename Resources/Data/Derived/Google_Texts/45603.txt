If the Republicans attempt to force President Barack Obama to defund the Affordable Care Act and his possible immigration action, as part of a GOP-led congressional budget proposal, Fox’s Brit Hume suggests it would be a major “blunder.”

The Fox News senior political analyst told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace that regardless of whether it is the president’s veto pen that forces a shutdown, the Republicans would receive the blame — “not most of the blame,” he clarified, “all of the blame.”

While most of the party’s leadership seems to have learned that fact, Hume cautioned, “there are some within the House and Senate who think that kind of brinkmanship might work.”
