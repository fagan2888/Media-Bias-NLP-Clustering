The goal is to improve the patient experience and enhance quality at lower costs by improving the efficacy and efficiency of care managers.\n\nThe partnership aligns Agile Health, Inc.'s text-messaging based communication platform with MCG care guidelines to allow healthcare organizations to improve patient experience and quality through personal, timely and comprehensive support while lowering communication costs.\n\n\"MCG and Agile Health solutions empower patients to more easily access the care support they require,\" said Jon Shreve, president and CEO of MCG. \"The capabilities we provide are key because patient engagement and behavioral modification are game-changers for the healthcare industry in helping to reduce costs and efficiently move patients toward health.\"\n\nChanges in healthcare delivery toward a value based business model inspired by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement are known as the Triple Aim. This refers to the simultaneous pursuit of improving the patient experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing the per capita cost of health care.\n\nAgile Health's text-messaging based communication platform engages patients deeply in three ways: daily, clinically-validated behavior-centric message curriculum; automated interaction and support features; and access to live, ad hoc interaction with professional care managers. Care managers monitor patients in real-time so they can respond efficiently to patient concerns.\n\nMCG synthesizes evidence-based and up-to-date clinical best practice guidelines that help clinicians to assess and define the needs of patients with chronic diseases or complex care issues, and to develop individualized care management plans that incorporate elements of education, coordination of resources, and self-management. The collaboration will leverage MCG's rigorous, systematic analysis of current research and scholarly articles and standardized methodology for guideline development to align selected Agile Health programs.\n\nOne of the first opportunities in which the two organizations will join forces is myAgileLife|Welcome Home, which helps patients comply with hospital discharge care plans. The solution keeps patients connected following hospital discharge and provides information and support to help them avoid readmission.\n\nThis is important both for patients and for healthcare organizations, which face potential reimbursement penalties \u2013 as mandated by federal regulations \u2013 when certain readmissions occur within 30 days.\n\n\"This collaboration marks the achievement of a significant milestone for Agile Health, allowing us to strengthen the connection between evidence based practice and behavior change,\" said Scott Werntz, president of Agile Health. \"With MCG, we will connect more people to the healthcare they need, through comprehensive and personalized support.\"\n\nHEALTHCARE COMPANIES PARTNER AS A TOOL TOWARD TRIPLE AIM\n\nCOMBINED CAPABILITIES TO IMPROVE PATIENT EXPERIENCE, ENHANCE HEALTHCARE QUALITY AND REDUCE COSTS OF CARE\n\nAbout MCG\n\nMilliman Care Guidelines became MCG in December 2012 as part of the Hearst Corporation acquisition.
