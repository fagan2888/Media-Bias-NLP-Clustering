The scandal that Christie finds himself ensnared in\u2013his aide and his buddy at the Port Authority ordered the closing of a bridge that caused a massive traffic jam in Fort Lee\u2013has hardly changed the mainstream media\u2019s treatment of him. Christie\u2019s political friends also continue to stick up for him.\n\nHere\u2019s 6 examples showing how the media, and other politicians, can\u2019t fall out of love with Christie, a star in the Republican Party who is likely to run for president in 2016.\n\n1. Rudy Giuliani: It Was a Prank\n\nThe basic contours of the bridge scandal in New Jersey are by now well-known. Christie\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelley, along with David Wildstein, a high-school friend of the governor\u2019s who was appointed to Port Authority, closed lanes on the George Washington Bridge which caused traffic jams in Fort Lee, New Jersey. They took those actions to punish Fort Lee\u2019s Mayor, Mark Sokolich, who did not endorse Christie\u2019s re-election bid.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, though, sees the whole scandal as a harmless joke. Speaking on CNN last Thursday, Giuliani described the scandal as a \u201cstupid political prank that backfired.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitically stupid things, political pranks that turn bad, all that other stuff [happens in] every administration,\u201d Giuliani added. Unmentioned by Giuliani is that the \u201cprank\u201d slowed emergency response teams and caused children to be late to school.\n\n2. Mika Brzezinski: Christie Responded Better Than Obama\n\nThe MSNBC pundit is a good friend of Christie\u2019s, and she defended him after the governor\u2019s marathon press conference. She favorably compared Christie\u2019s response to the scandal to President Obama\u2019s response to the alleged IRS scandal.\n\n\u201cObama said he didn\u2019t know about it, but he didn\u2019t do what Chris Christie did. Which was [to] say, \u2018But I\u2019m responsible, and I don\u2019t know what I did in my office, and I\u2019ve got to do a lot of soul-searching to figure out why people felt they could do this,\u2019\u201d said Brzezinski.\n\n3. Joe Scarborough: Let\u2019s Look At Obama\n\nScarborough joined his colleague Brzezinski in apologizing for Christie.\n\nThe \u201cMorning Joe\u201d host said that \u201cif we are going to be critical of Chris Christie, we have to be critical of a culture in Washington D.C. where Barack Obama has allowed one scandal after another to break and then say, oh, I didn\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rudy Giuliani seems to think bridgegate is just an elaborate prank, while Karl Rove asks: What about Benghazi?", "author": "Alex Kane", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Rudy Giuliani seems to think bridgegate is just an elaborate prank, while Karl Rove asks: What about Benghazi?", "title": "6 most ridiculous Chris Christie apologists", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/14/6_absurd_apologies_for_chris_christie_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/chris_christie2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rudy Giuliani seems to think bridgegate is just an elaborate prank, while Karl Rove asks: What about Benghazi?", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/chris_christie2.jpg", "title": "6 most ridiculous Chris Christie apologists", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "6 most ridiculous Chris Christie apologists", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Apology, Chris Christie, George Washington Bridge scandal, GOP, Politics", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde754\"", "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Apology, Chris Christie, George Washington Bridge scandal, GOP, Politics, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlternetNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie has long been the toast of the mainstream media, who liked to describe him as a straight-shooter not afraid to make tough decisions.\n\u201cObama said he didn\u2019t know about it, but he didn\u2019t do what Chris Christie did.\nShe favorably compared Christie\u2019s response to the scandal to President Obama\u2019s response to the alleged IRS scandal.\nChristie\u2019s political friends also continue to stick up for him.\nRudy Giuliani: It Was a PrankThe basic contours of the bridge scandal in New Jersey are by now well-known."}
