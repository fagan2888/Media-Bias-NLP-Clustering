“There’s a need for this kind of office because the growth of D.C. and the expansion of D.C. and making sure every resident of D.C. plays a part in that is really what the community has requested,” said Branch.

More than three years have passed since the D.C. Council created an unpaid Commission on African-American Affairs to “assist the Mayor in planning policies beneficial to African American communities with low economic, education, or health indicators.” Branch will be its first full-time director.

“The Commission on African-American Affairs, meanwhile, is gathering data on the exodus of the city’s black residents and businesses, and analyzing the disparities affecting those who remain,” reports The Washington Post.
