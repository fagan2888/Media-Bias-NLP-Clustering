You\u2019d think he\u2019d be used to it after the millionth time.\n\nI\u2019m fine with swapping it out for another term, but how do I describe myself then? \u201cCandy-ass \u2026 centrist\u201d? That\u2019s too vague. \u201cCandy-ass \u2026 establishmentarian\u201d? Better, but still a mouthful. Few substitutes have the pithy poetic zing of \u201ccandy-ass RINO.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of you used a term that I\u2019d like to see outlawed from the vernacular of the party: RINO,\u201d he said, calling it a \u201cpejorative term\u201d that questioned one\u2019s purity\u2026 \u201cWith all due respect, I\u2019ve fought in the trenches of Republican politics for over two decades, but I wouldn\u2019t pretend that I\u2019m lord over determining who the real Republicans are versus the so-called RINOs,\u201d he said\u2026 Huckabee reminded his readers that Jesus once said that \u201ca house divided against itself cannot stand,\u201d referring to the Gospel of Matthew\u2026 \u201cI\u2019d rather have a loyal dog who licks me than one with a pedigree who bites me,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019d rather go to battle with someone who isn\u2019t perfect than with someone who thinks he is.\u201d\n\nHow Jesus ended up in a scolding about RINOs versus true cons, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand the dog analogy either. The point about conservatives and RINOs isn\u2019t that the former has a \u201cpedigree\u201d and the latter doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s that the latter frequently advertise themselves as one thing and then vote as another. They\u2019re the opposite of loyal. Although maybe that\u2019s an insight into where Huck stands on all this. From the perspective of, say, John Boehner, it\u2019s true \u2014 the RINOs are the loyal dog and tea partiers are the pedigreed ones who bite. How does that analogy work from the standpoint of conservative voters, though? Who would Huck\u2019s erstwhile constituents in Arkansas regard as having more of a \u201cpedigree,\u201d tea-party freshmen or Beltway Republicans who\u2019ve been in Washington gladhanding rich lobbyists for 25 years?\n\nThat\u2019s a key irony about Huck, though: He\u2019s really not a \u201cRINO\u201d in the sense that the term\u2019s usually used these days. He\u2019s no more a creature of the Beltway than those tea-party freshmen are; on the contrary, one of the core grievances of his 2008 campaign was that the GOP establishment disdains the sort of rural, religious, blue-collar voters that it purports to represent and that he connects with. He gets slapped with the \u201cRINO\u201d label because of his big-government heresies but there\u2019s got to be another term to distinguish a social-conservative warrior from the sort of status-quo D.C. slicksters we all think of when the R-bomb is dropped. How about \u201cPope Francis Republican\u201d? There\u2019s a market for that out there. Not enough to get him close to the nomination in 2016 but enough to keep politics interesting.\n\nExit question: Isn\u2019t there some support among tea partiers too for jettisoning increasingly outdated labels like \u201cRINO\u201d? Read this Erick Erickson post from October before you answer.\n\nUpdate: A friend suggests \u201cEeyorepublican.\u201d I could live with that.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cHuckabee pointed out that he got a tweet from someone who complained that he was a RINO, which upset him.\u201d", "title": "Mike Huckabee: Isn\u2019t it time we retire the term \u201cRINO\u201d?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/14/mike-huckabee-isnt-it-time-we-retire-the-term-rino/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-14T21:41:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-14T23:34:27+00:00"}, "keywords": "conservative, huckabee, name, only, republican, Republicans In Name Only,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0620\"", "article_summary": "Mike Huckabee: Isn\u2019t it time we retire the term \u201cRINO\u201d?\nposted at 4:41 pm on January 14, 2014 by AllahpunditApparently someone applied this term to Huck himself and it brought him up short.\nFrom the perspective of, say, John Boehner, it\u2019s true \u2014 the RINOs are the loyal dog and tea partiers are the pedigreed ones who bite.\nExit question: Isn\u2019t there some support among tea partiers too for jettisoning increasingly outdated labels like \u201cRINO\u201d?\nThat\u2019s a key irony about Huck, though: He\u2019s really not a \u201cRINO\u201d in the sense that the term\u2019s usually used these days."}
