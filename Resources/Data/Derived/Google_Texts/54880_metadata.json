He was considered to be one of the last \"Blue Dog\" Democrats in Congress.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney won McIntyre's district by a 19-point margin in 2012. McIntyre beat his Republican challenger David Rouzer by only 654 votes, the closest margin of any House race in the nation.\n\nMcCarthy, who announced in June that she was undergoing treatment for lung cancer, was nationally-recognized as an advocate for gun control in Congress. She told Newsday that she decided, after struggling with health issues, that it was time to let someone new represent her district.\n\nPresident Barack Obama carried McCarthy's seat by 12 points in 2012.\n\nSam Stein contributed to this report.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 2014 Gubernatorial Candidates 2014 Gubernatorial Candidates\n\n1 of 95 Greg Abbott (R-Texas) State Attorney General (2002-Present) State Supreme Court Justice (1995-2001) Share this slide:\n\n(AP Photo/Pat Sullivan)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Representatives Mike McIntyre (D-N.C.) and Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.) are retiring, according to Democratic party sources.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-01-09 13:08:26 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Representatives Mike McIntyre (D-N.C.) and Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.) are retiring, according to Democratic party sources.", "title": "Democratic Representatives Mike McIntyre And Carolyn McCarthy Retiring", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/08/mcintyre-mccarthy-retiring_n_4562646.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1551162/images/o-CAROLYN-MCCARTHY-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Representatives Mike McIntyre (D-N.C.) and Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.) are retiring, according to Democratic party sources.", "title": "Democratic Representatives Mike McIntyre And Carolyn McCarthy Retiring", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1551162/images/o-CAROLYN-MCCARTHY-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "SamLachman", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-08 13:08:26 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4562646", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "elections 2014,Politics News,politics,Carolyn McCarthy,mcintyre mccarthy retiring,video,congress,Rep.
