Medal-adorned veterans tend to bask in the postshow glow, giving the young up-and-comers in their wake a shot on the big stage.\n\nThat slope-worn narrative is dissolving this year as an ambitious crew of young-gun skiers and snowboarders climbs Olympic-qualifying podiums, forcing the veterans to dig deep. Eight of the 32 athletes closest to making the U.S. Olympic men\u2019s and women\u2019s freeskiing and snowboarding teams for the Sochi Games are rookies.\n\nThey are the teenagers being groomed for 2018. They are the next generation. But after two recent Olympic-certifying events, the rookies aren\u2019t settling for spectator status.\n\nThe early surge of medaling freshmen has been a \u201chuge success\u201d for the red-hot rookies, said U.S. Freeskiing and U.S. Snowboarding coach Mike Jankowski.\n\n\u201cThis whole process of the rookies pushing the pros and how the pros respond is going to really build things up to a high level of performance where these athletes are going to be battling it out to make the U.S. team, so when they get to Sochi it\u2019s going to be smooth sailing,\u201d Jankowski said.\n\nThe coach was about to express another thought when 16-year-old snowboarder Ty Walker spun a flawless off-axis 720 off the Breckenridge slopestyle course. The explosive trick has propelled her to the second-highest rider in the battle to make the U.S. women\u2019s slopestyle Olympic team after two of five contests.\n\n\u201cYes! Did you see that? Right on, Ty!\u201d Jankowski said, dashing off to congratulate the ecstatic Vermont teenager.\n\nTaylor Gold, the Steamboat Springs 20-year-old who finds himself a breath away from top qualifier Greg Bretz (an Olympic veteran) in snowboard halfpipe, said his young colleagues spent the summer working hard with an eye on unseating the kings and queens of snow sports. His 18-year-old friend, Ben Ferguson of Oregon, is the country\u2019s third-ranked top qualifying snowboard halfpipe snowboarder.\n\n\u201cEveryone worked so hard to learn a bunch of new tricks and practice going big. I think we outworked them this summer and I think that\u2019s where our success is coming from,\u201d said Gold, after a day of home-hill powder riding during a three-day Christmas break. \u201cWe are doing a good job of showing we can hang.\u201d\n\nMontana\u2019s Maggie Voisin is the top qualified skier after two slopestyle contests, one step ahead of 16-year-old Darian Stevens in a field rich with battle-tested pros. If Voisin, 15, makes the U.S. Olympic team, she would be one of the youngest competitors in Sochi.\n\n\u201cI try to take the pressure off myself. Especially being a younger athlete, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on me as much, which is going to help me learn to manage the pressure in the future when I get older,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a long career ahead of me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s yet another glimpse of wisdom that belies her age. She seems amazed at the disparity between her life \u2014 living away from her family, traveling across the continent, winning contests \u2014 and her age.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only in ninth grade. It\u2019s crazy. I only see my parents occasionally in the winter. Where I come from, that\u2019s rare,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t think of anything else I\u2019d rather be doing.\u201d\n\nVoisin joins Crested Butte\u2019s Aaron Blunck as U.S. Freeskiing\u2019s top teens. Blunck is having the season of his life, with a career-apex win at the Copper Grand Prix last month, but said he\u2019s not skiing exclusively for Olympic glory.\n\n\u201cA lot of people, the Olympics weigh so heavy on their mind. It\u2019s all they think about for every run,\u201d Blunck said. \u201cI know there\u2019s more to life than the Olympics. I\u2019m trying to look at all of these (Olympic-qualifying) competitions like they are any other competitions.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t expect the pros to roll over, said Jankowski, noting that the Olympic-tested Louie Vito will come out big at this week\u2019s Breckenridge Grand Prix and the final two events at California\u2019s Mammoth Mountain. \u201cLouie will fight like no one you\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Shaun White, who is splitting his time and training between the halfpipe and slopestyle course, has yet to stick his best run in the pipe.\n\nThe rookies know that the heavy hitters will be coming in hot in these final three contests.\n\n\u201cThe competition will step up,\u201d Gold said. \u201cIf Shaun is riding at the level he normally rides, no one can touch that. It\u2019s interesting to see him balance slopestyle and halfpipe. He\u2019s having a hard time, I think, trying to maintain his skills in the pipe. It seems like the playing field is more level right now.\u201d\n\nThe fierce competition among Americans is all part of the U.S. coaches\u2019 Olympic plan.\n\n\u201cThat way has proven successful for us,\u201d Jankowski said. \u201cThis five-stop qualifier process in December and January right before the Games really brings out the best in these riders, so when they show up for the Olympics, they are really firing on all cylinders.\u201d\n\nJason Blevins: jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasontblevins\n\nRed-hot rookies\n\nA look at top rookies in position to qualify for the Sochi-bound U.S. Olympic team after the first two of five events:\n\nAaron Blunck, 17\n\nHometown: Crested Butte\n\nRank: First in men\u2019s skiing halfpipe\n\nLyman Currier, 19\n\nHometown: Boulder\n\nRank: Fourth in men\u2019s skiing halfpipe\n\nMaggie Voisin, 15\n\nHometown: Whitefish, Mont.\n\nRank: First in women\u2019s skiing slopestyle\n\nDarian Stevens, 16\n\nHometown: Missoula, Mont.\n\nRank: Second in women\u2019s skiing slopestyle\n\nBrandon Davis, 18\n\nHometown: Mammoth Lakes, Calif.\n\nRank: Fourth in men\u2019s snowboard slopestyle\n\nTy Walker, 16\n\nHometown: Stowe, Vt.\n\nRank: Second in women\u2019s snowboard slopestyle\n\nTaylor Gold, 20\n\nHometown: Steamboat Springs\n\nRank: Second in men\u2019s snowboard halfpipe\n\nBen Ferguson, 18\n\nHometown: Bend, Ore.\n\nRank: Third in men\u2019s snowboard halfpipe", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Up-and-comer skiers and snowboarders stealing Olympics show", "title": "Up-and-comer skiers and snowboarders stealing Olympics show", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/04/up-and-comer-skiers-and-snowboarders-stealing-olympics-show/", "image": {"width": 653, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140104__20140105_C3_SP05OLYYOUTHp1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140104__20140105_C3_SP05OLYYOUTHp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-04T20:01:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T00:18:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Fishing, hunting, Snowboarding"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde298\"", "article_summary": "The explosive trick has propelled her to the second-highest rider in the battle to make the U.S. women\u2019s slopestyle Olympic team after two of five contests.\nHis 18-year-old friend, Ben Ferguson of Oregon, is the country\u2019s third-ranked top qualifying snowboard halfpipe snowboarder.\nRank: Second in women\u2019s skiing slopestyleBrandon Davis, 18Hometown: Mammoth Lakes, Calif.Rank: Fourth in men\u2019s snowboard slopestyleTy Walker, 16Hometown: Stowe, Vt.Rank: Second in women\u2019s snowboard slopestyleTaylor Gold, 20Hometown: Steamboat SpringsRank: Second in men\u2019s snowboard halfpipeBen Ferguson, 18Hometown: Bend, Ore.Rank: Third in men\u2019s snowboard halfpipe\nRank: First in women\u2019s skiing slopestyleDarian Stevens, 16Hometown: Missoula, Mont.\nEight of the 32 athletes closest to making the U.S. Olympic men\u2019s and women\u2019s freeskiing and snowboarding teams for the Sochi Games are rookies."}
