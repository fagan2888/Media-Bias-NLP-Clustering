(ST. JOSEPH, Mo.) A home invasion ends with a man going to the hospital.



"Just before 5 this morning I heard this crash and I got up to see what it was," Elvin Sisk, homeowner.



Elvin Sisk said he woke up Monday morning and saw two people standing in his hallway.



"We stood there and talked and telling me give me money and I told them I'm not giving them money. I don't have money," said Sisk.



Sisk grabbed the closet thing in his room, a table, and threw it at the two suspects. Then he followed them into the kitchen where a fight began.



"I was fighting them in the kitchen and I had them back over in the corner and they said well give me all your drugs then," said Sisk.



Sisk has a camera on the front of his house, but the suspects entered from the back so they were not caught on camera.



He has two knee replacements and a bad disc so he takes prescriptions everday.



Sisk says the suspects headed to the exact cabinets where he keeps all his medication.



"It has to be somebody that I know cause they got them out of where they were because they done beat me and I was laying on the floor," said Sisk.



Sisk's roommate was upstairs and heard all of the noise so she called the police. She had to take Sisk to the hospital where he was treated for multiple injuries.



After the invasion, Sisk says it's not going to bother his Christmas but he hopes that the suspects are found.



"There's too much of this going around in town and something needs to be done about it," said Sisk.



Police are asking if you have any information, call the Tips Hotline (816) 238-TIPS.
