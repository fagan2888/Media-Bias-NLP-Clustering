President Obama has settled on the chief federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, Loretta Lynch, as the nation's next attorney general.

The White House said late Friday that Lynch was the president's pick to replace the departing Eric Holder, confirming a selection that CNN first reported earlier in the day. By choosing Lynch, Obama is bypassing a pair of candidates with more senior roles in his administration in favor of a prosecutor who could, potentially, be more easily confirmed by a Senate that Republicans will soon control.

"Ms. Lynch is a strong, independent prosecutor who has twice led one of the most important U.S. attorney’s offices in the country," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement. Obama will announce her nomination in a Roosevelt Room ceremony on Saturday.

By choosing Lynch, President Obama is bypassing a pair of candidates with more senior roles in his administration.

Lynch is the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, which covers Brooklyn along with Queens, Staten Island, and parts of Long Island. She has served twice in that post—initially during the end of the Clinton administration—and was confirmed unanimously by the Senate both times. But a promotion from federal prosecutor to leading the entire Justice Department would be a big bureaucratic leap, one that according to The New York Times has not occurred in nearly 200 years.

Latino lawmakers and advocates have pushed hard for Obama to nominate his Labor Secretary, Thomas Perez, who had previously led the Justice Department's civil rights division. But most Republicans opposed his nomination to the Labor Department, and his elevation to attorney general would likely have provoked another contentious confirmation fight. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, already smarting over the president's decision to delay executive action on immigration, formally endorsed Perez for attorney general last week.
