There\u2019s enthusiasm, and there\u2019s optimism. There\u2019s also a recognition that Alaska faces many challenges.\u201d\n\nBut this time, Native expertise is available, Reitmeier said. Ahead of taking office December 1, governor-elect Bill Walker and his Tlingit lieutenant governor, Byron Mallott, sought diverse advisors and opinions. Co-directing the Walker\u2013Mallott transition team was Bethel Native Corporation\u2019s Yup\u2019ik CEO Ana Hoffman, also co-chair of the Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN), the state\u2019s largest Native organization.\n\nMore prominent Native transition-team members included First Alaskans Institute president Elizabeth Medicine Crow, who is Haida and Tlingit; University of Alaska Kuskokwim Campus director Mary Pete, who is Yup\u2019ik and an Obama appointee to the U.S. Arctic Research Commission; former fish and game deputy commissioner Craig Fleener, Gwich\u2019in Athabaskan; and Bristol Bay Native Corporation\u2019s Yup\u2019ik vice president and general counsel, April Ferguson.\n\n\u201cThe new administration reached out to rural Alaska,\u201d said AFN\u2019s Athabaskan general counsel, Nicole Borromeo, another transition-team participant. \u201cNative people feel included. This feels different.\u201d\n\nRELATED: New Governor Works With Citizens, Tribes to \u2018Create a Vision for Alaska\u2019\n\nThe 2014 election was a watershed moment, agreed Medicine Crow. \u201cAlaska Native people felt empowered.\u201d Encouraged to \u201crise as one\u201d at AFN\u2019s pre-election annual meeting, voters throughout vast rural stretches of the state came out in force. Most majority-Native villages exceeded their turnout in the 2010 midterm, according to Alaska Democratic Party figures. Some villages nearly doubled their numbers over the most recent presidential year, an impressive achievement, as that\u2019s when turnout is typically highest.\n\nIn addition to electing an Alaska Native to statewide office, rural voters contributed to the success of ballot measures they favored, including increasing the minimum wage and preserving the Bristol Bay fisheries\u2014a huge employer and a mainstay of their subsistence lifeways. \u201cAlaska Natives protected their cultural and economic relationship to the environment,\u201d said Alaska Democratic Party communications director Zack Fields. He called Byron Mallott\u2019s election \u201canother historic achievement.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Native Alaska Votes and Celebrates\n\nAccess to early voting drove turnout, said Medicine Crow. Though casting a ballot ahead of Election Day has been possible in the state\u2019s urban areas, many Native villages obtained this right for the first time in 2014. A speedy and concerted effort by AFN, ANCSA and Get Out the Native Vote set up rural early-voting offices this past summer; First Alaskans Institute then trained election workers.\n\n\u201cMany of us blocked out our calendars and in a very short time made sure rural Alaska had early-voting access,\u201d said Medicine Crow. \u201cI have to ask, though: Why did private organizations have to do what government should have been doing all along?\u201d\n\nRELATED: Ballot Power: The Revolution in How Alaska Natives Vote\n\nThe pre-election victory in the landmark Toyukak v. Treadwell language-assistance lawsuit, applicable immediately to certain Yup\u2019ik speakers, boosted turnout in the Bristol Bay region, where Yup\u2019ik dialects are prevalent. \u201cPeople were happy,\u201d said lead plaintiff Mike Toyukak. \u201cBoth elders and younger people understood the ballot.\u201d He described past elections, in which Alaska Natives voted differently than they\u2019d intended. \u201cI agreed to be a plaintiff because I want our people to know what they\u2019re voting for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe record level of Native turnout was astonishing,\u201d said plaintiffs\u2019 attorney James Tucker, of law firm Wilson Elser. \u201cToyukak v. Treadwell was as much about respecting and empowering Native voters as it was about the law.\u201d Tucker called Election 2014 a \u201crevolution\u201d in Alaska Native enfranchisement, attributable to the efforts of Native individuals and organizations. They did away with a two-tier system that favored non-Native over Native voters, Tucker said.\n\nThere\u2019s more to do, said Borromeo. \u201cGoing forward, villages must receive enough ballots. Some ran out this time around. Further, rural election workers need training and pay equivalent to that of their urban counterparts.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s Shelby decision, which eliminated federal oversight of Alaska elections, the Voting Rights Act needs fixes, Reitmeier added. \u201cWe also want to see modernization of Alaska Department of Elections systems and procedures. We want to understand how Help America Vote Acts funds are used. And we want to figure out which additional groups need translation and language assistance.\u201d\n\nEven before ballots can be translated, warned Calista Corporation\u2019s Cup\u2019ik communications manager Thom Leonard, Alaska must improve their \u201creadability.\u201d The confusing legalese baffles even English speakers, said Leonard: \u201cBecause the state has failed to provide understandable ballots in English, that sets up failure for translation into any language.\u201d\n\nRELATED: On a Roll: Alaska Native Voters Win Another Civil-Rights Battle\n\nSaid Reitmeier: \u201cNative Alaska has momentum, and we\u2019re going to build on it. Alaska was third in the nation for voter turnout this year. In 2016, we want to make Alaska first.\u201d\n\nThis story was written with support from the Fund for Investigative Journalism.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ahead of taking office Dec. 1, governor-elect Bill Walker and his Tlingit lieutenant governor, Byron Mallott, sought diverse advisors and opinions.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/11/28/native-alaska-takes-seat-table-and-plans-stay-there-158048", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/mike_toyukak_lead_plaintiff_in_lawsuit_securing_language_assistance_for_alaska_native_voters_-_stephanie_woodard1.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Native Alaska Takes a Seat at the Table\u2014and Plans to Stay There"}, "abstract": "Ahead of taking office Dec. 1, governor-elect Bill Walker and his Tlingit lieutenant governor, Byron Mallott, sought diverse advisors and opinions.", "dc": {"title": "Native Alaska Takes a Seat at the Table\u2014and Plans to Stay There"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/11/28/native-alaska-takes-seat-table-and-plans-stay-there-158048", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Alaska Natives, Gov.
