Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Science Committee, asked the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s inspector general to sort out the agency\u2019s claims and determine whether anyone\u2019s been punished, saying that deleting the messages appears to break the EPA\u2019s own policy.\n\n\u201cThese actions point to an apparent pattern of behavior directed at subverting transparency and accountability,\u201d the Texas Republican said in a letter to the inspector general.\n\nSEE ALSO: Ted Cruz: Net neutrality is \u2018Obamacare for the Internet\u2019\n\nThe accusations stem from a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Competitive Enterprise Institute and researcher Chris Horner, who believe Ms. McCarthy\u2019s text messages will shed light on her dealings with the agency\u2019s coal regulations.\n\nMr. Horner has been seeking the messages since last year, and sued to force the agency to turn them over.\n\nRep. Lamar Smith, Texas Republican, asked the EPA\u2019s inspector general to sort ... more >\n\nAfter a long legal back-and-forth the EPA earlier this fall officially notified the National Archives that it might have lost some text message records. At the same time, the EPA maintains that text messages usually aren\u2019t records and there\u2019s no evidence Ms. McCarthy\u2019s messages should have been preserved as official documents.\n\nSEE ALSO: EPA, Justice Department hit automakers Kia, Hyundai with record $100M fine\n\n\u201cEPA is not aware of any evidence that federal records have been unlawfully destroyed,\u201d said Liz Purchia, an EPA spokeswoman. She said their notification to the National Archives was done \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d and said the notification makes clear the EPA doesn\u2019t believe it lost any preservable records.\n\nMs. Purchia said that because of their nature as short snippets, text messages are \u201cinherently unlikely\u201d to meet the legal requirements for an official record, which are supposed to be documents that describe decision-making.\n\nThe inspector general didn\u2019t return a call seeking comment on the request for an investigation.\n\nMr. Smith said the lost text messages are similar to the situation facing the Internal Revenue Service and former employee Lois G. Lerner, who is the central figure in the investigation into the agency\u2019s tea party targeting. The IRS also belatedly notified the National Archives that it lost some agency records.\n\nOnce an agency notifies the Archives of a potential loss of data, the Archives creates a case to get to the bottom of the allegation.\n\nMr. Horner and CEI, in a new court filing, argue that they have evidence the EPA encourages employees to use text and instant messages to conduct business with outside groups, which would counter the EPA\u2019s claim that text messages are unlikely to qualify as official records.\n\n\u201cThat EPA would represent to a court that its employees do not use instant messaging for work-related correspondence is scandalous,\u201d Mr. Horner said. \u201cThat the agency does so to avoid responsibility after having been caught destroying its text messages wholesale sets it apart even from the IRS, which hasn\u2019t gone that far.\u201d\n\nMr. Smith\u2019s letter asking for an investigation says the EPA is sending mixed signals. It quotes an article in the Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, that reported Ms. Purchia said text messages can legally be deleted. Yet Mr. Smith points to EPA regulations that instruct employees to \u201cmaintain electronic records\u201d and specifically mentions \u201cIMs,\u201d or instant messages.\n\nThe quote attributed to Ms. Purchia was a paraphrase of her statement to the Hill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A congressional committee chairman demanded an investigation Monday into whether EPA employees are illegally deleting text messages after the agency officially notified the National Archives last month that Administrator Gina McCarthy expunged her phone texts, which are now the subject of a lawsuit.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A congressional committee chairman demanded an investigation Monday into whether EPA employees are illegally deleting text messages after the agency officially notified the National Archives last month that Administrator Gina McCarthy expunged her phone texts, which are now the subject of a lawsuit.", "title": "EPA sued over Gina McCarthy\u2019s deleted text messages", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/10/epa-sued-over-gina-mccarthys-deleted-text-messages/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/10/11102014_ap809827849418201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/10/11102014_ap809827849418201.jpg", "description": "A congressional committee chairman demanded an investigation Monday into whether EPA employees are illegally deleting text messages after the agency officially notified the National Archives last mont", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "EPA sued over Gina McCarthy\u2019s deleted text messages"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environmental Protection Agency, Lamar Smith, Chris Horner, Liz Purchia, Gina Mccarthy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae6b\"", "article_summary": "It quotes an article in the Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, that reported Ms. Purchia said text messages can legally be deleted.\nAt the same time, the EPA maintains that text messages usually aren\u2019t records and there\u2019s no evidence Ms. McCarthy\u2019s messages should have been preserved as official documents.\nThe quote attributed to Ms. Purchia was a paraphrase of her statement to the Hill.\nYet Mr. Smith points to EPA regulations that instruct employees to \u201cmaintain electronic records\u201d and specifically mentions \u201cIMs,\u201d or instant messages.\nThe IRS also belatedly notified the National Archives that it lost some agency records."}
