The point, according to everyone involved, was to look for ways the policymakers can find some common ground and try to get things done in 2016.\n\nTo help set the tone, the Wisconsin congressman told reporters yesterday he was excited about the Iowa caucuses because \u201cwhat it tells me is the days of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency are numbered.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a real charmer, this one. You can just feel his enthusiasm for bipartisan policymaking in an era of divided government.\n\nAfter the meeting in which the president tries to find areas of possible agreement with GOP leaders, Ryan will hold another vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act. The Washington Post reported\n\nThe House is scheduled to vote Tuesday on overturning President Obama\u2019s veto of legislation to repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood. The vote, appropriately scheduled for Groundhog Day, is expected to fail, leaving conservatives to gear up for a final year of budget fights with the president.\n\nAsked about today\u2019s events, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters, \u201cRepublicans are poised to host another vote in the United States Congress today for the 60th time to repeal Obamacare. It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s Groundhog Day, except today it is actually Groundhog Day and they\u2019re doing it again.\u201d\n\nEarnest added, \u201cSo I\u2019m not really sure that qualifies as the contours of a proactive legislative agenda but it does put some pressure on Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell, and other Republicans in Congress, to lay out what it is exactly they support and try to find some common ground with the administration.\u201d\n\nFor the record, estimates vary on exactly how many times Republicans have tried to repeal all or part of the ACA, but the last time I checked, they were up to 62 . In other words, Earnest might have been understating the case a bit.\n\nIncidentally, shortly before the last repeal vote, Ryan was asked why he was moving forward with a bill to eliminate the Affordable Care Act before the Republican alternative is ready. The Republican leader told reporters with a smile, \u201c Just wait .\u201d\n\nWe later learned that this wait will continue past this year \u2013 because GOP lawmakers have already effectively given up on their plans to unveil a reform alternative in 2016.\n\nAs for today\u2019s veto-override vote, there\u2019s no chance of the bill succeeding. Paul Ryan and his team know that, of course, but they\u2019re holding the vote anyway, just to go through the motions.\n\n\u201cGroundhog Day\u201d was\n\nPostscript: In case anyone doesn\u2019t get the reference, I should probably mentionwas a classic movie from 1993 in which Bill Murray is stuck in a time loop, forced to live the exact same day over and over again. For those who haven\u2019t seen the movie, I can assure you it\u2019s far more entertaining than watching Republicans vote 63 times to take health care benefits away from millions of families for no particular reason.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The timing could hardly be more appropriate.
