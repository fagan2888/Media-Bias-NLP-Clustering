Yeah, me neither.\n\nHere is the proposal, which will be discussed at an upcoming meeting:\n\nThe University of California is committed to protecting its bedrock values of respect, inclusion, and academic freedom. Free expression and the open exchange of ideas \u2014 principles enshrined in our national and state Constitutions \u2014 are part of the University\u2019s fiber. So, too, is tolerance, and University of California students, faculty, and staff must respect the dignity of each person within the UC community. Intolerance has no place at the University of California. We define intolerance as unwelcome conduct motivated by discrimination against, or hatred toward, other individuals or groups. It may take the form of acts of violence or intimidation, threats, harassment, hate speech, derogatory language reflecting stereotypes or prejudice, or inflammatory or derogatory use of culturally recognized symbols of hate, prejudice, or discrimination. Everyone in the University community has the right to study, teach, conduct research, and work free from acts and expressions of intolerance. The University will respond promptly and effectively to reports of intolerant behavior and treat them as opportunities to reinforce the University\u2019s Principles Against Intolerance.\n\nBut what would happen when the university\u2019s state commitment to free speech conflicts with its stated desire to eliminate intolerance? And such a conflict is not unlikely, given how broadly UC defines intolerance:\n\n* Vandalism and graffiti reflecting culturally recognized symbols of hate or prejudice. These include depictions of swastikas, nooses, and other symbols intended to intimidate, threaten, mock and/or harass individuals or groups. * Questioning a student\u2019s fitness for a leadership role or whether the student should be a member of the campus community on the basis of race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, citizenship, sex, or sexual orientation. * Depicting or articulating a view of ethnic or racial groups as less ambitious, less hardworking or talented, or more threatening than other groups. * Depicting or articulating a view of people with disabilities (both visible and invisible) as incapable.\n\nUnder the above definitions, it\u2019s easy to imagine a person committing \u201cintolerance\u201d by uttering a statement that should be completely permissible, given free speech assurances. What if a student told his wheelchair-bound friend, \u201cSorry, dude, you can\u2019t join the track team\u201d? Would the student be accused of violating the university\u2019s code of conduct for making this insensitive remark?\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Eugene Volokh asks similar questions:\n\nDefending traditional exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage, by arguing that same-sex couples aren\u2019t as good at raising children as opposite-sex couples? (I suspect that view is wrong, but we can only know it\u2019s wrong if people are able to freely debate it.) Discussing purported differences in temperament, cognition, and more between men and women? Sharply criticizing certain religious denominations, and suggesting that people who are genuinely committed to those religious denominations are misguided or morally reprehensible? \u2026 Now I\u2019m a tenured faculty member, and I\u2019ll keep on expressing my views despite this sort of policy. But what about undergraduates? Graduate students, who might be relying on the university for teaching assistant positions, progress in their departments, and more? Lecturers who don\u2019t have tenure? Tenure-track faculty members who don\u2019t yet have tenure? When these students and faculty members are told that certain views about disabilities, about race or ethnicity, or (by obvious extension) about sexual orientation, sex, or religion have \u201cno place at the University\u201d \u2014 and violate others\u2019 rights to be \u201cfree from\u201d such \u201cexpressions\u201d \u2014 will they feel free to openly discuss these topics? Or will they realize that they had best follow the orthodoxy?\n\nThe Regents should reconsider this proposal, in light of the obvious chilling effect it would have on constitutionally-protected speech.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Intolerant of intolerance", "title": "University of California May Codify Right to Not Be Offended", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/09/11/university-of-california-may-codify-righ", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14420023447700.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Intolerant of intolerance", "title": "University of California May Codify Right to Not Be Offended", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14420023447700.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-09-11T20:20:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6df\"", "article_summary": "So, too, is tolerance, and University of California students, faculty, and staff must respect the dignity of each person within the UC community.\nEveryone in the University community has the right to study, teach, conduct research, and work free from acts and expressions of intolerance.\nThe Regents of the University of California system are considering a proposal that bans intolerance and hate speech, but promises members of the campus community that their free speech rights will still be respected.\nBut what would happen when the university\u2019s state commitment to free speech conflicts with its stated desire to eliminate intolerance?\nIntolerance has no place at the University of California."}
