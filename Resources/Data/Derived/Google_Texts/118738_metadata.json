The court reversed and remanded a case out of Ohio that involved a law making it a crime for any person to \u201c[p]ost, publish, circulate, distribute, or otherwise disseminate a false statement concerning a candidate, either knowing the same to be false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not\u201d during the course of a political campaign.\n\nRecently a Nevada judge forced a state Senate candidate in the Republican primary to stop running a television commercial saying his opponent was a supporter of Harry Reid.\n\nA group called the Susan B. Anthony List attempted to erect a billboard in Ohio during the 2010 election season criticizing Rep. Steve Driehaus for voting for ObamaCare and thus supporting taxpayer-funded abortion. Driehaus got the Ohio Elections Commission to threaten the billboard company and the billboard was never posted.\n\nSusan B. Anthony List sued saying the law abridged its First Amendment rights.\n\nWriting the high court\u2019s unanimous opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas said a \u201cCommission panel here already found probable cause to believe that SBA (Susan B. Anthony) violated the statute when it stated that Driehaus had supported \u2018taxpayer-funded abortion\u2019 \u2014 the same sort of statement petitioners plan to disseminate in the future. Under these circumstances, we have no difficulty concluding that petitioners\u2019 intended speech is \u2018arguably proscribed\u2019 by the law.\u201d\n\nConsidering ObamaCare dictates the coverage of abortifacients, the statement about tax-payer funded abortion might well be considered true by many.\n\nJust as Nevada state Senate candidate Gary Schmidt\u2019s claims about opponent Ben Kieckhefer were not proven untrue merely by the absence of his name on a list of Republicans for Reid. No one has found any evidence he supported Reid\u2019s opponent, while he told a newspaper reporter he intended to support Reid backer Bill Raggio\u2019s bid to retain a Republican leadership position.\n\nBut the judge in the case wrote, \u201cBen Kieckhefer is likely to suffer irreparable injury to his career and reputation from defendant\u2019s television advertisements.\u201d Being associated with our senior U.S. senator can do that. There may yet be further court proceedings in this matter.\n\nTruth in an election campaign is not something for a commission or a judge to decide. That is for the voters to determine.\n\nJustice Thomas also noted:\n\n\u201cThe burdens that Commission proceedings can impose on electoral speech are of particular concern here. As the Ohio Attorney General himself notes, the \u2018practical effect\u2019 of the Ohio false statement scheme is \u2018to permit a private complainant \u2026 to gain a campaign advantage without ever having to prove the falsity of a statement.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018[C]omplainants may time their submissions to achieve maximum disruption of their political opponents while calculating that an ultimate decision on the merits will be deferred until after the relevant election.\u2019 \u2026 Moreover, the target of a false statement complaint may be forced to divert significant time and resources to hire legal counsel and respond to discovery requests in the crucial days leading up to an election. And where, as here, a Commission panel issues a preelection probable-cause finding, \u2018such a determination itself may be viewed [by the electorate] as a sanction by theState.'\u201d\n\nDriehaus lost. Kieckhefer won.\n\nThomas Mitchell Thomas Mitchell is a former newspaper editor who now writes conservative/libertarian columns for weekly papers in central Nevada and blogs at http://4thst8.wordpress.com/ Twitter: @thomasmnv More Posts - Website - Twitter\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nCOMMENTS", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog Wire - Nevada", "description": "A U.S. Supreme Court ruling negating an Ohio law regarding political campaign free speech is contrary to a recent Nevada court ruling.", "title": "Unanimous Free Speech Ruling from High Court Contradicts Nevada Judge\u2019s Decision", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5c0e6179893645d6efbaac9ef7bb9c95?s=100&d=mm&r=g", "updated_time": "2014-06-17T12:11:45+00:00", "url": "http://watchdogwire.com/nevada/2014/06/17/unanimous-high-court-campaign-free-speech-ruling-contradicts-nevada-judges-decision/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Waste, Fraud and Abuse", "tag": "U.S. Supreme Court", "published_time": "2014-06-17T11:26:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-17T12:11:45+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 318261258258275}, "robots": "all", "description": "A U.S. Supreme Court ruling negating an Ohio law regarding political campaign free speech is contrary to a recent Nevada court ruling."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe212a\"", "article_summary": "Truth in an election campaign is not something for a commission or a judge to decide.\nDriehaus got the Ohio Elections Commission to threaten the billboard company and the billboard was never posted.\nJustice Thomas also noted:\u201cThe burdens that Commission proceedings can impose on electoral speech are of particular concern here.\nRecently a Nevada judge forced a state Senate candidate in the Republican primary to stop running a television commercial saying his opponent was a supporter of Harry Reid.\nThomas Mitchell Thomas Mitchell is a former newspaper editor who now writes conservative/libertarian columns for weekly papers in central Nevada and blogs at http://4thst8.wordpress.com/ Twitter: @thomasmnv More Posts - Website - TwitterRELATED ARTICLESCOMMENTS"}
