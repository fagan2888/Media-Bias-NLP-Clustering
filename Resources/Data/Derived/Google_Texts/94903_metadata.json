The piece\u2019s title: \u201cStark Raving Rahm.\u201d\n\n\u201cA conversation with Emanuel is a physical experience,\u201d reports the magazine\u2019s Isaac Chotiner, who interviewed Emanuel in March. \u201cWhen he has strong feelings about a subject \u2014 which is often \u2014 he frequently sits on the very edge of his chair, emphasizing his point through proximity.\u201d\n\nYou can read the whole Q&A with Emanuel, who also served as President Barack Obama\u2019s White House chief of staff, here. But here are a few excerpts from the interview.\n\nOn HealthCare.gov:\n\nIsaac Chotiner: When the Obamacare website wasn\u2019t working properly, did you want to be in Washington trying to fix it? Rahm Emanuel: You gotta be kidding. You get a freebie question for the ridiculousness of that question. Chotiner: I was asking about your competitive instinct. You say you like to fix things. Emanuel: [Gets up and starts walking around the office.] That goes down as one of the more intriguing questions I have ever had. Did I wish I was in Washington to fix a website? Let me answer that. I have a single-word answer. No. Please do not edit out the sarcasm of that answer. Chotiner: Don\u2019t worry, it is staying. Emanuel: I don\u2019t want it to be missed on your readers.\n\nOn New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s possible White House bid:\n\nChotiner: Chris Christie was going to be the savior. Emanuel: He \u201cwas.\u201d You said it in past tense. Chotiner: Do you think it is past tense? Emanuel: I do. Nothing is ever absolute in politics, but I am willing to go out on a limb and join you. It may take more than an immediate time frame for him to recover, and he doesn\u2019t have more than that. Chotiner: Right. Emanuel: I am listening [for the next question].\n\nOn the earned-income tax credit:\n\nEmanuel: I have a piece today [in the Chicago Sun-Times] about the earned-income tax credit. I have negotiated to expand it. Now, is that considered left or right? Chotiner: Uh\u2014 Emanuel: It\u2019s full of [expletive], OK? [Raises voice.] It\u2019s crap. Chotiner: What\u2019s full of [expletive]? Emanuel: I consider myself a progressive. I have a passion for people who work. To me, this is about forward looking versus backward looking. Ideological gradations are the wrong way to look at it.\n\n\u2013 Robert Schroeder\n\nFollow Capitol Report on Twitter @capitolreport\n\nFollow Rob on Twitter @mktwrobs\n\nRead more from MarketWatch\n\nJeb Bush on illegal immigration as \u201cact of love\u201d\n\nWomen earn less than men even in woman-dominated jobs\n\nMarketWatch\u2019s IPO Calendar", "article_metadata": {"article.author": "MarketWatch", "description": "Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel answers questions from the New Republic about HealthCare.gov, Chris Christie, the earned income tax credit, and more.
