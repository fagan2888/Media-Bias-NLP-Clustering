A Kansas inmate accused of raping and trying to kill a woman last summer has been found dead in his cell.

The Johnson County Sheriff's Office says 59-year-old Gary McCormick was found unresponsive in his cell at 4:51 a.m. Sunday while detention staff was conducting a routine welfare check of inmates.

Detention center staff and in-house medical workers tried to save his life but were unsuccessful.

McCormick was housed alone and had been in custody since July awaiting trial for attempted first-degree murder, rape, aggravated criminal sodomy, aggravated battery and felony fleeing and eluding.

He was being held on $1 million bond.

The Sheriff's Office is investigating his death.
