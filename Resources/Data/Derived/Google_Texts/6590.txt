Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will continue sleeping on the couch in his congressional office despite being elected to succeed Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) as House majority leader.

The current House majority whip says he prefers to sleep on his office couch because he’s worried about becoming too comfortable with Washington.

“You know why I do it?” he asked host Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” “Because I go back and I read for the next day. I don’t want to ever become Washington. I go home every weekend. I don’t want it to be comfortable.”

McCarthy says he also doesn’t want to worry about owning a home in Washington or sending his children to school in Washington, and would rather focus his attention on the needs of his constituents.

“I believe [sleeping on the couch] makes me a better member, makes sure I continue to listen, it makes sure I can do a better job,” he added.
