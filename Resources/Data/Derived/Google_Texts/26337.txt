AIPAC goes after Senate Democrats

With Anna Palmer and Cate Martel

AIPAC FURIOUSLY LOBBYING SENATE DEMOCRATS: From POLITICO’s John Bresnahan and Burgess Everett: “In a bid to head off a Democratic filibuster, AIPAC — the powerful pro-Israel group — is frantically lobbying Senate Democrats to allow an up-or-down vote on a resolution disapproving of the Iran nuclear deal. … AIPAC had as many as 1,000 supporters lobbying lawmakers on Wednesday, according to Capitol Hill sources, and representatives of the group met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to plot strategy on a cloture vote, which would end debate on the disapproval measure and tee it up for a final passage vote. ‘On an issue of this significance to the national security of the United States, the American people deserve a direct up or down vote on the agreement,’ said Marshall Wittmann, AIPAC's spokesman.” The group has spent more than $20 million into TV ads and a grassroots lobbying effort designed to convince Democrats to reject the deal. http://politico.pro/1IZSNTg

STRONG WORDS ON OIL EXPORT DEAL: Republicans might prefer to wait until after the 2016 elections to pass a bill allowing crude oil exports, when they won’t have to compromise with Democrats. From POLITICO’s Andrew Restuccia and Elana Schor: “Even if a package of green incentives — such as an extension of perennially embattled tax credits for wind and solar — were to win 60 votes for a bill ending crude exports, the deal would face significant resistance among House conservatives who want to see the ban removed without sweeteners for the left. ‘Republicans would have to be morons to agree to that deal’ marrying oil exports to renewables and climate language, GOP energy lobbyist Mike McKenna said in an interview. ‘We may have a Republican president in 16 months. Making a deal in 2017 may be a necessity. Making a deal now is not a necessity.’” http://politico.pro/1JXdIKK

Sherrod Brown, the American Bankers Association, Credit Union National Association, Independent Community Bankers Association, and National Association of Federal Credit Unions wrote that community banks and credit unions, ‘are forced to hire new compliance staff, instead of loan officers, and to adjust or eliminate the type of services that they can provide in their communities,’ due to post-Dodd-Frank regulatory architecture on capital and lending for financial institutions.”

** A message from the National Retail Federation: Retail is more than great products, or the sound of a cash register. More than a storefront, or a website. It’s working together as a community, creating the things people want, today. It’s the smile at the end of every transaction and the effort and innovation that customers don’t see. Retail businesses – 98% of which are small businesses – are at the heart of many towns and neighborhoods nationwide. That’s why when retail thrives, communities thrive. Think you know retail?
