Now, a major university is getting into the act.\n\nDavid Skorton, the president of Cornell University, has sent an email to students announcing a $350 fee for students who opt out of the school\u2019s health care plan.\n\nSkorton writes: \u201cAlthough introducing a new fee is never desirable, moving to a model that includes a health fee \u2014 a standard in college health nationwide \u2014 will make student costs more predictable and encourage students to seek the care they need.\u201d It goes into effect this upcoming academic year.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nSkorton expects that 70 percent of undergrads, 10 percent of grad students, and 30 percent of professional students will be affected, netting the University an estimated $3.9 million. It turns out that Gannett Health Services, which services the needs of students, has been operating at a deficit.\n\nUnlike Obamacare, students who get \u201cfined\u201d will be eligible for a $10 co-pay covering most Gannett visits.\n\nNews of the fee resulted in a sit-in Monday, but the president had already made up his mind. He told protestors that nothing can be done about the fee.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIt\u2019s not a bad deal for the university, which charges students $2,352 to opt in this year. If they opt out, the school will soon charge $350. It makes you wonder if that kind of model would work for a college cafeteria \u2014 charging a higher fee for students who eat in the dining hall and a lower fee for students who eat off campus.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "News of the fee resulted in a sit-in Monday.", "author": "Steve Eastman", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "News of the fee resulted in a sit-in Monday.", "title": "University Announces Fee For Students Who Opt Out Of Its Health Plan", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shutterstock_250682986.jpg", "height": 668}, "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/university-announces-fee-students-opt-health-plan/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "News of the fee resulted in a sit-in Monday.", "title": "University Announces Fee For Students Who Opt Out Of Its Health Plan", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shutterstock_250682986.jpg", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-02-10T11:14:42-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Expose Obama", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2015-02-10T11:14:42-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "cornell university, david skorton, , education, health, obamacare, politics, nation, religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeed5\"", "article_summary": "David Skorton, the president of Cornell University, has sent an email to students announcing a $350 fee for students who opt out of the school\u2019s health care plan.\nIt turns out that Gannett Health Services, which services the needs of students, has been operating at a deficit.\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues belowIt\u2019s not a bad deal for the university, which charges students $2,352 to opt in this year.\nIt makes you wonder if that kind of model would work for a college cafeteria \u2014 charging a higher fee for students who eat in the dining hall and a lower fee for students who eat off campus.\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues belowSkorton expects that 70 percent of undergrads, 10 percent of grad students, and 30 percent of professional students will be affected, netting the University an estimated $3.9 million."}
