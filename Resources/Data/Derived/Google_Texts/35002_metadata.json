There are some surprising character revelations, some of which are disappointing.\n\nHannah rushes into the offices of Millstreet Press in a typical Hannah way: very late and fumbling about. In a twist of fate that could only happen to Hannah, it turns out that the man she\u2019s meeting, her editor David, is late because he\u2019s dead. Hannah is understandably freaked out as she recounts the ordeal to Jessa, but of course Jessa\u2019s take is \u201cit happens, it\u2019s like jury duty.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t tell if Jessa and Adam actually dislike each other or just like to make fun of each other\u2019s (pointless?) lives. Either way, their exchange is awesome.\n\nAdam is much more sympathetic to Hannah\u2019s \u201cDavid is dead\u201d story until Hannah expresses more concern for her e-book than for David\u2019s death/family/anything other than herself. Adam and Hannah further disagree when she uses Gawker as her main resource for details on David\u2019s death and he winds up yelling, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you mourning quietly?\u201d\n\nIt turns out Adam isn\u2019t actually \u201cmad\u201d at Hannah, he\u2019s scared of what her reaction would be if something serious happened to them. Scenario: What if Adam died? Would Hannah be upset or worry about how she\u2019d make rent? (Where does Adam get his money from? Has anyone else wondered this?) Hannah says if Adam died, she\u2019d be extremely disoriented, very sad and yes, would wonder how she could make rent. Adam is not pleased \u2014 if Hannah died the world would blur. The scene ends with Hannah throwing up her hands, \u201cI think about you dying all the time.\u201d\n\nWhen Hannah tells Ray that she lost someone, Ray automatically thinks that \u201cMarnie decided to throw in the towel.\u201d (So how are things REALLY going between those two? This hints that things aren\u2019t going as rosy as we have been led to believe\u2013or at the very least there\u2019s still underlying tension). It seems that Hannah loves recounting the details to Ray and she\u2019s able to openly admit that she \u201cliterally feels nothing.\u201d Ray\u2019s reaction is similar to Adam\u2019s \u2014 that Hannah is callous and unfeeling and selfish. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s highly odd that I feel worse than you do now? And the one time I met this dude he hurled me across the room into a small table?\u201d\n\nHannah even tells Laird about \u201closing a close friend\u201d and blurts out \u201cI really don\u2019t care.\u201d Laird, still weird as ever, says everyone he knows has died, including his turtle, which he is holding in a glass jar. Oh, Caroline is still there and the three of them go on what can only be described as a very weird walk. Caroline points out that Hannah hasn\u2019t asked about Adam\u2019s ex\u2019s and that makes her secure\u2026before making a beeline for the cemetery across the street. They run and dance and do somersaults, very appropriate, right?\n\nThere are some serious parts though: Hannah and Caroline talk about how medication messes with your head. Hannah admits that now that she\u2019s better and can see outside herself, she\u2019s not sure if that\u2019s a good thing or not. \u201cAdam\u2019s going to figure out what I\u2019m naturally like and there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to like it.\u201d She\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to get bored being with \u201csomeone who can\u2019t match his strength of emotion.\u201d\n\nCaroline tells Hannah about their cousin, Margaret, who died of muscular dystrophy when she was 12. Adam would visit Margaret every day and instead of taking his girlfriend to their prom, he granted Margaret\u2019s wish, which was to go to a high school dance before she died. Again, not the reaction one would expect: Hannah\u2019s main question focuses on why the dress was tiny \u2014 was it because the disease made Margaret tiny or because she herself was tiny? Caroline\u2019s response: \u201cI made it up, and you didn\u2019t even shed a tear\u2026What is wrong with you?!\u201d But Caroline is more amused than Adam or Ray were. Meanwhile, Laird is crying and sniffling away.\n\nIn other news, Marnie has thrown herself into exercising like a crazy person, making gross smoothies and listening to \u201cinspirational\u201d books on tape. She also works at Grumpy\u2019s. (This isn\u2019t her new successful job, right?). And she\u2019s still upset about that autotuned version of Edie Brickell\u2019s \u201cWhat I Am.\u201d that video Charlie posted on YouTube. I actually don\u2019t think the music video is awful (see: Wrecking Ball), but I understand that things you do in private aren\u2019t meant for the public eye. Ray says it\u2019s a \u201cbold and pioneering form of self expression\u201d and he and Hermie (love you Colin Quinn!) do a wonderful conversation on the lyrics. \u201cIt\u2019s about knowing\u2026 what you are \u2026 and about me knowing what I am, and asking if you are what you are\u2026 or what.\u201d Marnie\u2019s meltdown continues as she tells Ray that nobody wants to work at the restaurant because it sucks and that \u201cfancy people want to work with me so I\u2019m going to give them that pleasure and I\u2019m going to work with them.\u201d\n\nJessa wants to visit Season\u2019s tomb. But she can\u2019t because Season isn\u2019t dead. She\u2019s very much alive, with a nice brownstone and a beautiful baby and \u201ccool-looking husband.\u201d Season sent Jessa an invitation to a fake funeral (which of course Jessa didn\u2019t attend) because she wanted to start fresh and make a new life. She saw Jessa as an enabler. Jessa, never the positive one and always the one to cast the first stone, storms out, claiming that Season\u2019s new life won\u2019t work out.\n\nHannah arrives home to Adam on the stoop, and she tells him that she was shocked about how random life can be and how one day you can just be walking around, talking\u2026the next day you\u2019re face down in the river and nobody has a good explanation. \u201cIt always takes me a while to process my emotions,\u201d she says, and admits she liked David and was grateful for his support. It\u2019s hard that \u201cher champion is gone.\u201d\n\nAnd then the scene is ruined because Hannah uses Caroline\u2019s story as her own and tells Adam that SHE had a cousin named Margaret who died of muscular dystrophy who wanted to go to senior prom so Hannah took her. I know WHY Hannah did that, but it makes me think everything Hannah said about David and processing emotions and her thoughts on death were completely fake and a ploy to get closer to Adam and to make sure he doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s an unfeeling person. It\u2019s actually quite manipulative.\n\nI was excited for the new season, but the last three episodes have disappointed me. The girls aren\u2019t interacting much and I feel like they\u2019re floundering again. Each girl is so wrapped up in her own head that she can\u2019t reach out and REALLY be there for the others. I\u2019ve never disliked Hannah, I just found her mildly annoying. After this episode I can actually say that I don\u2019t like her.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Broadly speaking, the theme of this episode of \"Girls\" is death and how the characters use it to process their own feelings and how they project themselves to each other.
