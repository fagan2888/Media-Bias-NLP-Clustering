Among those enumerated in the legislation:\n\n\u25cf Attempting to subvert fundamental laws and introduce arbitrary power. \u25cf Attempting to usurp the power of the other branches of government. \u25cf Discourteous conduct toward certain persons.\n\nThe Kansas impeachment measure applied only to judges when it was first introduced. The version that passed the Kansas Senate would apply to the governor, attorney general and other statewide executive branch offices. The Senate passed the measure 21-19 on Tuesday.\n\nThe debate in the statehouse focused on the implications for the court. One opponent charged that it \u201cblatantly seeks to muzzle our Kansas Supreme Court.\u201d Supporters said it aims to guard against judicial tyranny.\n\nThe advancement of the bill is the latest front in the outright hostilities between Kansas lawmakers and some justices on the state\u2019s high court. At one point, as Law Blog wrote about earlier, lawmakers came close to defunding the state court system over a dispute about who picks the state\u2019s chief judges.\n\nThe Wichita Eagle has more on what\u2019s driving the new legislative effort:\n\nSen. Mitch Holmes, R-St. John, said he voted yes to keep judges from having absolute power to the detriment of democracy. \u201cWe live in an era where people believe independent courts and absolute power are synonymous,\u201d Holmes said. In debate Monday, Holmes cited two examples from the 2014 election of what he sees as impeachable offenses: the decision by the Supreme Court to allow a Democratic candidate off the ballot without forcing the party to name a replacement, and a justice allowing her husband to hold a political fundraiser at their home, which she did not attend. Lawmakers have said the court has overstepped its bounds on the always-contentious issue of school finance.\n\nRepublicans control a large majority of seats in the Kansas Senate and House, in addition to the governorship. The state high court is bluer. Four out of the seven current justices are appointees of former Democratic Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, who previously worked in the Obama administration overseeing the Obamacare rollout. The other justices were appointed by GOP governors, including current Gov. Sam Brownback.\n\nSponsors of the bill said it honors the original meaning of the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d impeachment standard in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe term, mentioned in Article II, Section 4, isn\u2019t defined. It encompasses ordinary crimes. Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers indicated that it could also apply to acts of misconduct that violate the public trust but not necessarily the law.\n\nA fiscal note attached to the Kansas bill says that if lawmakers seek to remove a judge, the judicial branch is on the hook for any extra costs to handle the judge\u2019s workload during the impeachment proceedings.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Kansas Supreme Court justices could be impeached for behaving discourteously in the courtroom or for trying to \"usurp\" legislative power under a bill approved by the state Senate on Tuesday.", "title": "Judicial-Impeachment Bill Advances in Kansas", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/03/22/judicial-impeachment-bill-advances-in-kansas/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IM795_KANSAS_G_20150519164000.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Judicial-Impeachment Bill Advances in Kansas", "description": "Kansas Supreme Court justices could be impeached for behaving discourteously in the courtroom or for trying to \"usurp\" legislative power under a bill approved by the state Senate on Tuesday.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Jacob Gershman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Law Blog Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Law Blog", "article.summary": "Kansas Supreme Court justices could be impeached for behaving discourteously in the courtroom or for trying to \"usurp\" legislative power under a bill approved by the state Senate on Tuesday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-03-22T20:38:07-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/03/22/judicial-impeachment-bill-advances-in-kansas/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-LB-53405", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Kansas Supreme Court justices could be impeached for behaving discourteously in the courtroom or for trying to \"usurp\" legislative power under a bill approved by the state Senate on Tuesday.", "title": "Judicial-Impeachment Bill Advances in Kansas", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/03/22/judicial-impeachment-bill-advances-in-kansas/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IM795_KANSAS_G_20150519164000.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Law Blog", "article.id": "BL-LB-53405", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-03-22T20:39:13-04:00"}, "article_summary": "One opponent charged that it \u201cblatantly seeks to muzzle our Kansas Supreme Court.\u201d Supporters said it aims to guard against judicial tyranny.\nThe version that passed the Kansas Senate would apply to the governor, attorney general and other statewide executive branch offices.\nRepublicans control a large majority of seats in the Kansas Senate and House, in addition to the governorship.\nThe advancement of the bill is the latest front in the outright hostilities between Kansas lawmakers and some justices on the state\u2019s high court.\nThe proposal, now under consideration by the Kansas House, specifies various \u201ccrimes and misdemeanors\u201d that would constitute impeachable offenses."}
