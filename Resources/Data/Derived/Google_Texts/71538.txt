They say that with a stroke, “time lost is brain lost” – so when a stroke happens, each second counts to stave off further brain damage. Seattle-area startup Cerevast Therapeutics is developing a device that emits ultrasound waves meant to quickly dislodge stroke-causing blood clots in the brain.

And company just raised $10 million, according to a regulatory filing.

The company’s head-worn device, called the ClotBust ER, is made up of a number of ultrasound transducers that are placed in regions where the majority of vessel occlusions in the brain are known to occur, Cerevast says.



This fall, Cerevast announced the first interim results of its ongoing Phase 3 trial. This initial bit analyzed the 90-day functional recovery of 250 randomized patients.

The study’s being conducted at 60 stroke centers in 14 countries.

The company’s Clotbust ER trial is currently enrolling patrients.
