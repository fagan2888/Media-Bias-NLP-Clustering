(Win Mcnamee/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s winding path on same-sex marriage reached a major new milepost Friday when his administration told the Supreme Court that the Constitution does not allow states to prohibit gay couples from marrying.\n\nThe filing\u2019s bold language \u2014 \u201cthese facially discriminatory laws impose concrete harms on same-sex couples and send the inescapable message that same-sex couples and their children are second-class families\u201d \u2014 captures the enormous shift Obama has made since he first sought the presidency in 2007.\n\nAfter endorsing same-sex marriage nearly two decades ago, and then rejecting that idea eight years later, Obama has made expanding LGBT rights a hallmark of his domestic policy agenda. Casting it as the next chapter of the civil rights movement, the president has used language to reframe the public debate over sexual orientation and gender identity and his executive authority to expand federal benefits and protections for these Americans.\n\nBut the president\u2019s legal strategy has been more complicated. His administration announced in 2011 that it would not defend the constitutionality of the key section of the Defense of Marriage Act that excluded gay couples from federal marriage benefits. In a 5-to-4 decision in 2013, the Supreme Court agreed.\n\nAt the same time, the administration stopped short of asking the justices to strike down all state prohibitions on same-sex marriage. That is the question the court will decide this term, with oral arguments scheduled for April 28.\n\nThe government\u2019s brief this time is unequivocal that all state restrictions must end. It says that restrictions on gay marriage violate the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and calls on the court to recognize that sexual orientation is a characteristic \u2014 like race or gender \u2014 that deserves special protection.\n\n\u201cIn Loving v. Virginia, this court applied the \u2018most rigid scrutiny\u2019 under the Equal Protection Clause to invalidate state laws banning interracial marriage,\u201d said the brief filed by Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. \u201cThere is similarly no reason to water down the otherwise appropriate level of scrutiny here.\u201d\n\nThe brief draws heavily on the court\u2019s DOMA decision, U.S. v. Windsor. The reasoning of that decision has led courts across the country to strike state bans on gay marriage. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit disagreed and upheld restrictions in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. It is that decision the Supreme Court will review.\n\nSince taking office, the president has repealed the U.S. military\u2019s practice of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d which allowed for the expulsion of service members based on their sexual orientation; banned discrimination against LGBT Americans in the federal civilian workforce and among federal contractors; and has advanced the legal understanding that prohibitions on sex discrimination also apply to acts based on an individual\u2019s gender identity.\n\nWhite House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, who has played a key role in shaping the administration\u2019s approach to gay rights, said in an interview before the filing, \u201cWe fight discrimination in every way we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are delighted with the fact that when the president took office, same-sex marriage was legal in two states, and it is now legal in 37 states and the District of Columbia,\u201d she said.\n\nObama has consistently advocated for greater legal rights for same-sex couples, although he has changed his position on same-sex marriage at points in his career. As an Illinois state senate candidate, he endorsed the idea in a 1996 questionnaire with an LGBT Chicago newspaper, a comment his aides later said was written by a campaign aide and not representative of his views. While running for U.S. Senate in 2004, Obama said marriage should be between only a man and a woman.\n\nBy December 2010, the president said his opinion on the matter was \u201cconstantly evolving,\u201d and in May 2012, days after Vice President Biden surprised the White House by declaring that he was \u201cabsolutely comfortable\u201d with same-sex marriage, Obama publicly endorsed it as well.\n\nMost of the president\u2019s allies had suspected for years that he backed the concept of same-sex marriage but was hesitant to embrace it in public for fear of losing support among African Americans.\n\nObama told BuzzFeed in an interview last month that he had made a distinction between his personal feelings and policy position. \u201cI always felt that same-sex couples should be able to enjoy the same rights, legally, as anybody else, and so it was frustrating to me not to, I think, be able to square that with what were a whole bunch of religious sensitivities out there.\u201d\n\nBoth he and Michelle Obama used the phrase that everyone \u201cshould be able to marry the person they love\u201d in their stump speeches, a line that former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau said \u201coften got some of the biggest applause\u201d on the 2012 campaign trail.\n\nOn a more practical level, the administration has expanded benefits and safeguards for members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community. Regardless of where they live, legally married same-sex spouses are now recognized for most federal and military benefits and can receive health-care coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nObama has appointed a record number of LGBT Americans to key senior administration posts, has nominated eight openly gay individuals to serve as U.S. ambassadors and has seated 11 openly-gay judges on the federal bench.\n\nThe administration\u2019s brief was one of more than 70 filed with the Supreme Court supporting the couples in the four states and urging the justices to find that same-sex marriage should be available nationwide.\n\nAmong the supporters were GOP officeholders, religious leaders and more than 300 of the nation\u2019s largest companies \u2014 including the Super Bowl champions New England Patriots and the World Series-winning San Francisco Giants.\n\nBriefs on behalf of the states defending their laws and of their supporters will be filed in coming weeks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The administration\u2019s legal strategy has been unequivocal in saying that restrictions violate the Constitution.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The administration\u2019s legal strategy has been unequivocal in saying that restrictions violate the Constitution.", "title": "Obama\u2019s words in same-sex marriage filing to court is a major shift for him", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obamas-words-in-same-sex-marriage-filing-to-court-is-a-major-shift-for-him/2015/03/06/83940fa0-c339-11e4-9271-610273846239_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/06/National-Politics/Images/465378292.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scotusreporter"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obamas-words-in-same-sex-marriage-filing-to-court-is-a-major-shift-for-him/2015/03/06/83940fa0-c339-11e4-9271-610273846239_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obama gay marriage, obama same-sex marriage, supreme court gay marriage, obama supreme court gay marriage filing, LGBT rights, DOMA, U.S. v.
