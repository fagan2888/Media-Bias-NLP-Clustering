But the justices heard arguments Monday in another case with potentially major implications for the country\u2019s proper functioning: a dispute over whether voters can break the self-serving system in which state politicians manipulate voting districts to their own and their party\u2019s benefit.\n\nThe case concerns an amendment to the Arizona constitution that empowered a nonpartisan committee to create district maps \u2014 without input from or the approval of state lawmakers. Voters went over the heads of state legislators, limiting politicians\u2019 regularly abused power to manipulate the political system. That\u2019s the problem, Arizona\u2019s legislature argues. The U.S. Constitution stipulates that \u201cthe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.\u201d\n\nDefenders of the reform argue that election procedures must emerge from a legislative process \u2014 which includes voter initiatives \u2014 not necessarily from the legislature itself. State legislatures\u2019 control over federal electoral procedure has never been impervious to direct popular intervention. Voters through the years have imposed all sorts of procedural changes without their legislatures\u2019 consent, and the court isn\u2019t going to strike all of those down.\n\nPaul D. Clement, the Arizona legislature\u2019s attorney, didn\u2019t have a great answer to why voters could do an end-run around state lawmakers in some instances of election reform but not in others. Yet he might have swayed the justices when he argued that the Constitution\u2019s words, if they mean anything, preclude voters from \u201cthe most extreme case\u201d of stripping state legislatures of their power to draw district lines, pretty much irreversibly. If the court agrees, Arizona\u2019s lawmakers could go back into the business of distorting election results by aggregating and dividing voters into contorted districts, and the movement to fix the nation\u2019s elections would be dealt a big setback.\n\nEven such a decision, though, shouldn\u2019t end reform. Partisan redistricting is not the only problem with American democracy, but it\u2019s undeniably harmful. For proof, look at the nakedly, repugnantly partisan electoral maps that Republicans drew in North Carolina and Democrats drew in Maryland. Statehouse majorities carefully sliced up their states to magnify the partisan tilt of their representation in Washington. The result is a deep and unjustifiable insult to the principle of one man, one vote.\n\nIf the Arizona legislature wins the case, then the question will be how much election reforms must acknowledge and include state legislatures in their new processes. One possibility that came up Monday would have a redistricting commission submit a few electoral map proposals to the legislature, which could choose one. Or a commission could draw one map, on which state lawmakers could vote up or down. Perhaps reformers could demand that a supermajority of lawmakers be required to reject a commission redistricting plan.\n\nThere are many possibilities. The only one that should be off the table is doing no more to combat gerrymandering.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The justices consider whether the power to redraw voting districts lies solely with politicians.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The justices consider whether the power to redraw voting districts lies solely with politicians.", "title": "Election reform is on the line at the Supreme Court", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/arizonas-election-reforms-are-on-the-line-in-a-supreme-court-case/2015/03/06/dcdd6188-c393-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/02/National-Politics/Images/Supreme_Court-Arizona_Redistricting-05d6c-3437.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "postopinions"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/arizonas-election-reforms-are-on-the-line-in-a-supreme-court-case/2015/03/06/dcdd6188-c393-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "arizona, supreme court, arizona districts, legislative districts, redistricting, redistricting reform, arizona redistricting, arizona legislature, gerrymandering, arizona gerrymandering", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions"}, "eomportal-uuid": "dcdd6188-c393-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "arizona, supreme court, arizona districts, legislative districts, redistricting, redistricting reform, arizona redistricting, arizona legislature, gerrymandering, arizona gerrymandering"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc655\"", "article_summary": "Or a commission could draw one map, on which state lawmakers could vote up or down.\nState legislatures\u2019 control over federal electoral procedure has never been impervious to direct popular intervention.\nPartisan redistricting is not the only problem with American democracy, but it\u2019s undeniably harmful.\nPaul D.
