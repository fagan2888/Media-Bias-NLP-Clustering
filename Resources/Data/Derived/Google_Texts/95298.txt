LOS ANGELES – For more than six decades, Alice Harris has lived on a block deep in the heart of Watts, a neighborhood long troubled by segregation, unemployment and low access to basic services, including health care.

“If you got shot, by the time the ambulance got here and takes you over to Torrance, California, downtown, you was already dead,” she said.

In 1965, after years of rising racial tensions and resentment over scarce public services, the streets around her went up in flames as residents destroyed their own community.

“They needed jobs, and they needed medical facilities in this area,” said Harris, who added that several children died from asthma-related symptoms, simply because the closest medical care facility was too far away. “If you want to kill a community, kill the medical care; that kills the community.”

A 101-page investigation on the riots, commissioned by the governor, noted that insufficient and inaccessible medical care were among the causes. Harris remembers Gov. Pat Brown traveling to Washington to help Watts get a hospital.

“That’s how we got Martin Luther King Hospital,” she said.

In March 1972, Martin Luther King, Jr. Hospital opened its doors to a long-neglected community that had seen too much suffering – and too little care.

“The children didn’t have to suffer no longer,” Harris said. “Whatever happened, if you get to Martin Luther King Hospital, you’re going to live. We had the best trauma center in the world. And it saved lives.”

The opening of the hospital was a point of pride for an area that desperately needed it.

“The Martin Luther King Hospital was a very important step forward,” said Mark Ridley-Thomas, who sits on the county board of supervisors and represents 2 million people in South LA, including Watts.. “It was a way of saying that the Watts uprising was, frankly, something that could have been – and should have been – avoided.”
