In Phoenix, doctors have alleged that some 40 veterans died as their names languished on secret waiting lists while officials misrepresented wait-time data to meet targets for bonus compensation.\n\nThe controversy led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki in late May.\n\nWith time winding down before Congress begins a five-week recess on Friday, pressure has been building to reach a deal on a measure aimed at eliminating long waiting lists at VA hospitals and clinics.\n\nNegotiations on the measure had broken down last week as Sanders and Miller rolled out competing proposals with a $15 billion gap between them.\n\nThe proposal introduced by Sanders on Thursday would provide less than $25 billion in new funds for VA healthcare, with $3.3 billion offset by other savings in the department's budget.\n\nMiller came back with a plan for $10 billion in emergency funds, with other budget needs to be settled in the fiscal 2015 VA spending bill later this year.\n\n(Reporting by Peter Cooney; Additional reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Andrea Ricci)\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Veterans Affairs Secretaries Veterans Affairs Secretaries\n\n1 of 9 Eric Shinseki Took office: Jan. 21, 2009 Left office: May 30, 2014 U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki addresses the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans May 30, 2014 in Washington, D.C.
