They didn\u2019t like that at all,\u201d Moenchengladbach midfielder Granit Xhaka said.\n\nStindl hit the post in the 11th, five minutes before Wolfsburg had a penalty appeal turned down when Andre Schuerrle went down under light contact from reserve goalkeeper Tobias Sippel. There was a brief flare-up between players before referee Felix Zwayer intervened.\n\nZwayer handed yellow cards to \u2018Gladbach\u2019s Xhaka and Fabian Johnson as tempers frayed again before the break.\n\nWolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking was sent to the stands in the second half as his side slipped to seventh.\n\n\u2018Gladbach\u2019s interim coach Andre Schubert is the first at the club to start with three league wins.\n\n\u201cAch, the record,\u201d Schubert said. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m thinking of is what the players delivered, how they ran. It was incredible.\u201d\n\nHertha Berlin striker Vedad Ibisevic scored twice in as many minutes to seal a 3-0 win over Hamburger SV.\n\nSolomon Kalou opened the scoring in the 17th, eluding Johan Djourou and firing inside the left post before Ibisevic sealed Hertha\u2019s third straight win at home in the 79th.\n\n\u201cIt was a win for a day of celebration,\u201d Hertha coach Pal Dardai said referring to 25 years of German reunification. \u201cGreat crowd, great weather and a great win.\u201d\n\nHertha, based in the west of the city, displayed banners saying \u201cWe unite east and west because Hertha stands for all of Berlin.\u201d\n\nSalif Sane\u2019s 59th-minute header was enough for Hannover to beat Werder Bremen 1-0 for its first win. Celebrating his 37th birthday, Bremen substitute Claudio Pizarro was unable to prevent his side\u2019s fifth loss.\n\nTimo Werner equalized in the last minute for Stuttgart to salvage a 2-2 draw at Hoffenheim.\n\nHoffenheim forward Kevin Volland scored a penalty in the 33rd and then cancelled out Jan Kliment\u2019s 64th-minute equalizer with a wonderful chip over the goalkeeper, before Werner headed into the left corner for the draw. Despite the point, injury-hit Stuttgart slipped bottom.\n\nStuttgart captain Christian Gentner, Filip Kostic and striker Daniel Ginzcek were all ruled out before the game, the latter until 2016 with a cervical spine injury.\n\n\u201cThat was a big shock for us,\u201d Stuttgart coach Alexander Zorniger said of Ginzcek\u2019s injury.\n\nAlso, Ingolstadt defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 for its first home Bundesliga win.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always capable of creating chances. We rewarded ourselves today and I\u2019m delighted for everyone,\u201d Ingolstadt coach Ralph Hasenhuettl said.\n\nFrankfurt sporting director Bruno Huebner was watching as his son Benjamin hit the post for Ingolstadt.\n\n\u201cAt least he\u2019s happy,\u201d the senior Huebner said about his son\u2019s win.\n\nBayern Munich hosts Borussia Dortmund as the top two clash on Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Borussia Moenchengladbach defeated Bundesliga runner-up Wolfsburg 2-0 at home Saturday to cap a remarkable turnaround after its dismal start to the season.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Borussia Moenchengladbach defeated Bundesliga runner-up Wolfsburg 2-0 at home Saturday to cap a remarkable turnaround after its dismal start to the season.", "title": "\u2018Gladbach beats Wolfsburg 2-0 to cap Bundesliga turnaround", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/3/gladbach-beats-wolfsburg-2-0-to-cap-bundesliga-tur/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/03/b40b479d6df3c62c830f6a706700ae62.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/03/b40b479d6df3c62c830f6a706700ae62.jpg", "description": "Borussia Moenchengladbach defeated Bundesliga runner-up Wolfsburg 2-0 at home Saturday to cap a remarkable turnaround after its dismal start to the season.", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Gladbach beats Wolfsburg 2-0 to cap Bundesliga turnaround"}, "Author": "CIARAN FAHEY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking was sent to the stands in the second half as his side slipped to seventh.\nBERLIN (AP) - Borussia Moenchengladbach defeated Bundesliga runner-up Wolfsburg 2-0 at home Saturday to cap a remarkable turnaround after its dismal start to the season.\n\u201cThat was a big shock for us,\u201d Stuttgart coach Alexander Zorniger said of Ginzcek\u2019s injury.\nStindl hit the post in the 11th, five minutes before Wolfsburg had a penalty appeal turned down when Andre Schuerrle went down under light contact from reserve goalkeeper Tobias Sippel.\nAlso, Ingolstadt defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 for its first home Bundesliga win."}
