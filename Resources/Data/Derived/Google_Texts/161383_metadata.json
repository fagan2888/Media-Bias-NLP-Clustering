And 93 percent of them are subsidized.\n\nRubio started pushing his vision well before Barack Obama entered the White House and began work on what would become the Affordable Care Act. But by the time Florida Health Choices launched post-Obamacare, the response by Floridians was tepid. The newly declared GOP presidential candidate didn\u2019t include it in his campaign\u2019s vision for how to repeal and replace the federal law. Nor did he mention it in a recent Fox News op-ed headlined \u201cMy three part plan for the post-Obamacare era.\u201d\n\nBy the Feb. 15 Obamacare enrollment deadline, Florida Health Choices had signed up 56 individuals, and as of the middle of this week it had gained 24 more, CEO Rose Naff said in an interview. The state has set aside $2.4 million for the exchange since 2008 \u2014 an initial $1.5 million infusion that year and $900,000 in 2013.\n\nRubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said the senator continues to support a \u201ctrue free-market exchange,\u201d and she blamed Obamacare\u2019s subsidies for luring buyers away from Florida Health Choices.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in Obamacare is neither free-market or truly an exchange,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is unfortunate that this disastrous health care law is impacting the Florida Health Choices program, which is exactly the kind of consumer-based health care solution Americans are looking for.\u201d\n\nBut critics say the struggles of the Florida plan illustrate the vast hurdles that Rubio and other Republican presidential candidates would face in seeking to replace Obamacare with a market-oriented plan \u2014 their usual answer to how they would cover the millions of people now insured under the Affordable Care Act. The Florida plan may be voluntary. It may be an easy way to shop online, either for health insurance or smaller dental or vision policies. But it doesn\u2019t subsidize low-income or middle-class families the way Obamacare does.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense that he doesn\u2019t talk about it right now,\u201d Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group that supports Obamacare, said of Rubio. Referring to the subsidies, Pollack added, \u201cThe notion of promoting coverage in a way that does not enable people to get one of the significant benefits of the Affordable Care Act \u2026 is really harmful and would cause millions of people to be far worse off than they are today.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s Naff has a different perspective, saying, \u201cI know the numbers seem small, but it\u2019s been steady.\u201d She added, \u201cThere is really no rational comparison between HealthCare.gov and Florida Health Choices. We\u2019re not giving it away.\u201d\n\nObamacare\u2019s been big in Florida, which has signed up more people than any other state. And that happened even though Republican Gov. Rick Scott and the Legislature have refused to set up a state exchange that meets ACA requirements or expand Medicaid.\n\nRubio included Florida Health Choices in his 2006 book, \u201c100 Innovative Ideas for Florida\u2019s Future.\u201d In the state Legislature, he clashed over it with then-Gov. Charlie Crist, who Rubio would go on to defeat in the 2010 Senate race. A report from Rubio\u2019s office when he was Florida House speaker said his plan relied on \u201csound market principles\u201d and \u201cchallenges the way health care is currently financed and purchased.\u201d\n\nExchanges as a concept have garnered backing from Republicans for years. In Massachusetts, then-Gov. Mitt Romney built the state\u2019s health care reform plan around exchanges in a system that was the precursor to Obamacare. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour pushed for his state to create an exchange before Obama was in the White House. Utah also had a version for small businesses.\n\nBut that backing of exchanges didn\u2019t translate into support for Obamacare. To the contrary, conservatives saw the ACA exchanges as a corruption of their idea, too heavily regulated, too filled with mandates.\n\nRubio has long called for repeal of the Democrats\u2019 health law, and he stressed that again as he formally announced his 2016 presidential run in Miami on Monday evening. He has also pitched broad outlines of a \u201creplace\u201d plan, drawing on ideas often floated by conservatives like letting people buy insurance across state lines. But his outline doesn\u2019t make any mention of incorporating exchanges, even a slimmed-down version akin to Florida Health Choices.\n\nIn the Fox News op-ed, Rubio called for \u201cadvanceable, refundable tax credits that all Americans can use to purchase health insurance.\u201d He also suggested he would target the current tax breaks for job-based insurance and set up high-risk pools to help people with costly pre-existing medical conditions get coverage.\n\nObamacare will almost certainly still be an issue in the 2016 campaign. But how it plays out five years after passage, and what kind of detail voters will be seeking from candidates, is not yet clear.\n\nJamie Burnett, a Republican strategist based in the crucial primary state of New Hampshire, said Obamacare will still resonate in the campaign, but health care will likely be talked about in the broader context of the economy rather than a singular battle cry.\n\nState Sen. Aaron Bean, who played a large role in creating the Florida exchange. | AP Photo\n\n\u201cI think people will want to talk about where things stand today. Is this really what we should have done, and is there a better way to get at it while preserving some common things that people agree on?\u201d Burnett said. If a Republican candidate doesn\u2019t have a clear and compelling message for moving beyond the Affordable Care Act, he added, \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be very problematic for them and their candidacy.\u201d\n\nA Democratic nominee could potentially use the low enrollment figures from Florida Health Choices against Rubio should he secure the nomination, but the state-focused issue may not matter to most voters, Burnett said.\n\nOther Republicans in Florida say they aren\u2019t worried about the low enrollment figures.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m selling hamburgers, and across the street they\u2019re selling hamburgers for free or subsidized, I know my outlook is not going to be as good,\u201d said state Sen. Aaron Bean, who played a large role in creating the Florida exchange. \u201cBut who knows where [the ACA\u2019s] going to end up.\u201d\n\nIronically, some health care experts think the Rubio-envisioned state exchange could be Obamacare\u2019s salvation in Florida if the Supreme Court rules against the Obama administration in King v. Burwell \u2014 which would result in 34 states, including Florida, being cut off from the law\u2019s subsidies.\n\nThat would mean the subsidies could flow only through state exchanges. Florida Health Choices could pave the way for that state-run exchange, but not without some pretty big changes.\n\n\u201cIt is a base state exchange that the state could work from or use as a rapid contracting vehicle,\u201d said Cindy Gillespie, a senior managing director at McKenna Long & Aldridge who worked on the Massachusetts exchange. But Florida would need to pass legislation to make it fully compliant with the ACA, she said.\n\nSome Florida lawmakers, like Bean, have no intention of doing that.\n\n\u201cThis gives us our independence,\u201d he said of the current program. \u201cThis is Florida\u2019s version.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Obamacare, which Rubio wants to repeal, covers 1.6 million in Florida alone.", "title": "Rubio-backed insurance market covers 80 people", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/marco-rubio-florida-insurance-market-117055.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/04/16/lede_150414_marco_rubio_2_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Florida Health Choices,Marco Rubio,Florida,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Obamacare, which Rubio wants to repeal, covers 1.6 million in Florida alone.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Story Continued BelowFlorida Health Choices, which finally opened last year, now covers 80 people.\nBut by the time Florida Health Choices launched post-Obamacare, the response by Floridians was tepid.\nBut his outline doesn\u2019t make any mention of incorporating exchanges, even a slimmed-down version akin to Florida Health Choices.\nRubio pushed his no-mandate health insurance exchange, dubbed Florida Health Choices, through the state Legislature that year.\nRick Scott and the Legislature have refused to set up a state exchange that meets ACA requirements or expand Medicaid."}
