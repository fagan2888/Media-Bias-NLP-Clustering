A BASE jumper who went missing in the Superstition Mountains was found dead Saturday morning, the Pinal County Sheriff's Office said.

The victim's name is 25-year-old Brian Head, Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said at a news briefing. His body was found at around 8:15 a.m. on the side of a cliff face near Syphon Draw.

"Technical Rescue Teams had to rappel down the side of the mountain to recover his body," Babeu said. "When they reached Brian, his parachute harness was not on him and his parachute was never deployed. Investigators believe, Brian fell from the side of the cliff to his death late Thursday afternoon."

Head was an avid skydiver and base jumper.

"Our hearts go out to his family and friends," Babeu said.

The man's mother called in from Dallas Friday to report that her son, who lives in Phoenix, had gone hiking in the Superstition Mountains on Thursday and didn’t return home.

Deputies located the man's vehicle near the Mining Camp Restaurant.

Search and Rescue teams from PCSO and MCSO had been searching for him on the ground.

The Mesa Police Air Unit and DPS Ranger also assisted in the search.
