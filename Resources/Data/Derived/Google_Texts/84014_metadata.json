They include five metro Atlanta hospitals purchased from Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare for $661 million, including debt, and a partnership with West Georgia Health in LaGrange.\n\nAt an event celebrating the new hospitals, WellStar President and CEO Candice Saunders was decidedly vague about the network's plans to grow. She didn't rule out the possibility of more mergers down the line.\n\n\u201cOur board's direction is that we will continue to look at partnerships,\u201d she said.\n\nSaunders also left open the possibility that WellStar could look to once again get back into the health insurance market with its own plan.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to look at all options. As you look around the country, we continue to learn from each other,\u201d Saunders said.\n\nBoth avenues are major trends in health care right now as hospitals look to keep their costs down, improve quality and negotiate better deals with insurance companies, which are also consolidating. The consolidation of health systems is largely tied to the Affordable Care Act, as they grapple with increasing changes to reimbursements for care.\n\nNorthwestern Kellogg School of Management\u2019s Leemore Dafny recently co-authored some new research that found when health systems expand to different markets in the same state, like in the WellStar deal, prices tend to go up.\n\nHer study looks at about 500 hospital mergers from 2000 to 2012.\n\n\u201cThe acquiring system's prices go up by 6 to 10 percent, which is not trivial,\u201d Dafny said, adding patients are also paying more out of pocket for health care in the way of higher premiums and deductibles.\n\nDafny said those are the sorts of price bumps that tend to concern regulators like the Federal Trade Commission, but there\u2019s been a lack of evidence to prove cross-market mergers could create anti-trust concerns. She said health care observers have assumed prices go up with these kinds deals, but her research puts a number on it.\n\nSaunders of WellStar said the health system will continue to \u201cmake sure health care is affordable,\u201d but didn't elaborate.\n\nBut to Dafny, \u201cIf the objective of size is to counterbalance the market powers of insurers, that means they would like to increase prices.\u201d\n\nWellStar isn\u2019t the only Georgia hospital system that\u2019s looking to get bigger. Piedmont Healthcare is in discussions with Athens Regional Health System for a possible merger, and the six-hospital system recently joined with Newton Medical Center. Northside Hospital and Gwinnett Medical Center have also announced merger plans.\n\nAs for whether WellStar will attempt to roll out its own insurance plan, Dafney said WellStar's 11 hospitals make it big enough to consider that kind of venture on its own.\n\nLast year, WellStar folded a Medicare Advantage Plan it operated with Piedmont.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local", "description": "Though Marietta-based WellStar Health Systems is now the largest health care network in the state of Georgia, it still has eyes on future growth.
