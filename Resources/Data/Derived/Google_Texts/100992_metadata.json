That includes millions in lost productivity and millions more spent on health care, social services and the criminal justice system, according to a 2012 McDowell Group report.\n\nShame and stigma can make it difficult to get help for substance abuse. But a group of Juneau residents is out to change that. They organized last weekend\u2019s Recovery Fest to celebrate those seeking to overcome addiction.\n\nDownload Audio:\n\nIt\u2019s a sunny afternoon at Sandy Beach in downtown Douglas, and a crowd is gathering around a dunk tank filled with several gallons of cold water. Dusty Dumont, a parole officer for the state Department of Corrections, sits on a platform above the water, dry for now. Then someone throws a ball that\u2019s right on target and Dumont splashes into the water as the crowd lets out a cheer.\n\n\u201cI did get dunked quite a few times,\u201d Dumont says later, wrapped in a towel and standing next to a picnic shelter.\n\n\u201cFor a good cause,\u201d she adds with a laugh.\n\nThe cause she\u2019s talking about is addiction recovery. Programs like 12 step, Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous, professional counseling and peer-to-peer treatment.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the people on my case load are struggling with addiction, and I would love to see more of this so that people feel like they belong and are part of a strong community that\u2019s sober,\u201d Dumont says.\n\nKara Nelson is one of the people on Dumont\u2019s case load. The 40-year-old mother of three spent more than half her life abusing drugs and alcohol before sobering up in 2011.\n\n\u201cI never really had a drug of choice,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cWhatever you had I\u2019ll take, whatever\u2019s going to get me out of my right mind right now.\u201d\n\nLike a lot of addicts at Recovery Fest, Nelson says no one event led to her getting clean. Rather, it was a series of what she calls \u201cbottoms.\u201d She says her family, friends and members of her church help her stay sober. She also credits peer-to-peer therapy, where former users support each other.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re like me, I don\u2019t like to feel like anyone is trying to tell me what to do,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, I already have so much shame on me. So when I\u2019m with someone who\u2019s already been through that, I definitely can identify, and work through things a little better and get to that humbled spot that we need to get to to move forward.\u201d\n\npushed to get addiction services included in the Affordable Care Act as a Washington, D.C. lobbyist for treatment organizations. She\u2019s also been in recovery for drug and alcohol abuse for 16 years.\n\n\u201cThe thing that was my biggest mark of shame is now my biggest asset,\u201d McDaid says.\n\nA frequent guest speaker at events around the country, she talks about putting a face on addiction recovery.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re out here today. So that people don\u2019t have to think we\u2019re these people under bridges swigging out of brown bags,\u201d McDaid says. \u201cWe are tax paying, loving members of our family, and members of our community that add rather than detract. And I think if we do that enough, we will show that there\u2019s a benefit to doing it.\u201d\n\nKatie Chapman, executive director of theNational Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence Juneau Chapter, is celebrating four and a half years sober. NCADD helps organize the weekly Juneau Recovery Community meetings, where the idea for Recovery Fest first took shape. Chapman says the group hopes to hold more public events that shine a light on recovery and reduce the stigma for those struggling to overcome addictions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to do that here today,\u201d Chapman says. \u201cI\u2019m proudly wearing a shirt that says \u2018I got recovery\u2019 on the back of it, because I do and I\u2019m proud of it. It\u2019s something to be proud of.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "Alcohol and drug abuse cost Alaska\u2019s economy more than $1 billion every year.
