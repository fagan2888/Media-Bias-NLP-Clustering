The healthcare providers either foot the bill or reap the savings if the cost goes respectively higher or lower, Tedino said.\n\n[Also: Complete liste of Medicare ACOs]\n\n\u201cOur promise to Boeing is to deliver value. We\u2019re on the hook for the promise,\u201d said Joe Gifford, chief executive for Providence-Swedish Health Alliance.\n\nOpen enrollment began Jan. 1 for the estimated 27,000 eligible employees in the Puget Sound-area, along with about 3,000 retirees. Employees had the option of the new Preferred Partnership plan, a PPO, or a high-deductible plan.\n\nWhile Boeing does not release enrollment figures, sign-up for the Preferred Partnership exceeded enrollment targets, according to Tedino.\n\n\u201cThis new plan was popular with our employees in Puget Sound,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nEnrollment was about evenly divided between Providence and UW Medicine, he said.\n\nAn estimated 9,000 employees selected UW Medicine, according to Johnese Spisso, chief health systems officer and vice president for Medical Affairs.\n\n\u201cIt exceeded expectations, it surprised everybody,\u201d Gifford said.\n\nBeyond lower paycheck deductions, employees were attracted to a plan that had, in many cases, no copays for primary care visits and full coverage for generic drug prescriptions.\n\nServices include same-day appointments, concierge privileges by phone or e-mail and mobile access for scheduling primary care appointments and reviewing test results.\n\nVirtual care is reimbursed, something not done under the traditional method of payment.\n\nProviders coordinate appointments and treatment across their network of doctors, clinics and hospitals. Patient data is shared with providers, allowing doctors to have a record of whether a patient followed through with a prescribed plan.\n\nBenchmarks are tied to costs, including hospital readmissions and the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re meeting and exceeding service standards. We just had a great experience working collaboratively with Boeing for the triple aim,\u201d said Spisso.\n\nMeanwhile, Gifford said he predicts market expansion in the five states in which Providence provides care.\n\n\u201cSouthern California has got employers we\u2019ve been talking to actively,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile it helped that Boeing is such a large company, Gifford said he is working on ways to offer ACO benefits to smaller employers in partnership with insurers.\n\nProvidence-Swedish Health Alliance also partners with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and was approved as a Medicare ACO in 2013.\n\nThere were more than 600 ACOs nationwide at the start of the year, and they are being touted as a key strategy for curbing U.S. health-care costs as doctors and hospitals are reimbursed for value of care, rather than fee-for-service.\n\n\u201cThe track is to take care of communities directly,\u201d Gifford said. \u201cIt does require us to spend money on innovative care. The framework we\u2019re putting in place, this is a model for the future of healthcare. By our ability to coordinate care better for a population, we feel we can reduce the cost of care through better care coordination. Everyone is interested across the U.S. Our phone is ringing from employers.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/how-two-accountable-care-organizations-and-boeing-are-testing-value-based-care", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/boeing-healthcare-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Workers at Seattle's largest employer signing up in droves for health plans that pair workers with these networks.", "title": "How two accountable care organizations and Boeing are testing value-based care"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/boeing-healthcare-feature.gif"}, "title": "How two accountable care organizations and Boeing are testing value-based care", "description": "Workers at Seattle's largest employer signing up in droves for health plans that pair workers with these networks.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "A new partnership between two accountable care organizations and Seattle\u2019s largest employer hopes to become a model for value-based care.&#13; The Providence-Swedish Health Alliance and UW Medicine have entered into separate and direct contracts with Boeing, among the first ACOs in the country to create a tailor-made healthcare plan with a private employer.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf177\"", "article_summary": "A new partnership between two accountable care organizations and Seattle\u2019s largest employer hopes to become a model for value-based care.\nThe healthcare providers either foot the bill or reap the savings if the cost goes respectively higher or lower, Tedino said.\nBy our ability to coordinate care better for a population, we feel we can reduce the cost of care through better care coordination.\nEmployees had the option of the new Preferred Partnership plan, a PPO, or a high-deductible plan.\nWhile Boeing does not release enrollment figures, sign-up for the Preferred Partnership exceeded enrollment targets, according to Tedino."}
