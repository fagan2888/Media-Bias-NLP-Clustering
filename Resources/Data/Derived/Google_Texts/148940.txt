Rep. Trey Gowdy told Fox News' Megyn Kelly Monday the White House’s insistence that paper ObamaCare applications are a solution to those struggling with the glitch-filled website is a “façade,” as all application options end up in the same queue.

New documents released by the House Oversight and Reform Committee reveal that as President Obama was encouraging Americans to turn to paper or phone applications to sign up, the administration knew all the applications would end up in the same place.

“It’s a façade, it’s one of several facades,” Gowdy said on “The Kelly File." “And, you know, the president already has a Nobel Prize for peace; I think he’s shooting for one in fiction. To send people to the mail instead of the website when you know that you’re going in exactly the same queue is a façade.”

Gowdy, R-S.C., said the refusal to admit when they’ve “made a mistake” is part of the reason politicians suffer low approval ratings.

“Instead of saying we made a mistake, even we made an intentional misstatement we need you to forgive us, the response is to evade,” Gowdy said.
