Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n\nBen Carson\u2019s brand is \u201cnice.\u201d \u201cCarson has the bedside manner of the physician he is,\u201d says the Christian Science Monitor. \u201cBen Carson doesn\u2019t shout,\u201d writes Adam C. Smith for the Tampa Bay Times. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t throw zingers, and he rarely disparages rival presidential candidates. In a period when Donald Trump\u2019s bluster dominates the 2016 presidential race, Carson seldom says anything provocative enough to generate TV news coverage.\u201d\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nOn Sunday, in an interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, that changed. \u201cDo you believe that Islam is consistent with the Constitution,\u201d asked Chuck Todd, after Carson said a president\u2019s faith only matters if it\u2019s inconsistent with the country\u2019s values. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t, I do not,\u201d answered Carson. He continued: \u201cI would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that.\u201d The Council on American-Islamic Relations slammed the retired neurosurgeon, who with Donald Trump leads the Republican presidential pack. \u201cMr. Carson clearly does not understand or care about the Constitution, which states that \u2018no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office,\u2019 \u201d said the group\u2019s national executive director in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe Carson campaign wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201c[Mr. Carson] has great respect for the Muslim community,\u201d said spokesman Doug Watts, \u201cbut there is a huge gulf between the faith and practice of the Muslim faith, and our Constitution and American values.\u201d Despite the reality of the American Muslim community, which is as loyal and patriotic as any group of Americans, Carson\u2014the soft-spoken, genial doctor who runs on his religious faith\u2014believes they are unqualified for high public office and that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with \u201cAmerican values.\u201d\n\nCarson is a creature of deep suspicion and conspiratorial thinking.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t shocking. Of course Carson believes in the disloyalty of American Muslims. His genial reputation conceals a deep commitment to paranoid politics, honed over years of conservative activism and deployed in speeches, op-ed columns, and now a presidential campaign. At the Values Voter Summit in 2013, for example, he compared the Affordable Care Act\u2014President Obama\u2019s signature health care law\u2014to chattel slavery. \u201cYou know Obamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d said Carson in his remarks to the conservative gathering. \u201cIt is slavery in a way because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care. It was about control.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question this is outrageous. But it pales next to the reactionary paranoia of much of his other rhetoric. \u201cI mean, [our society is] very much like Nazi Germany,\u201d he said last year, in a rant against \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d \u201cYou know, you had a government using its tools to intimidate the population. We now live in a society where people are afraid to say what they actually believe.\u201d\n\nIf political correctness is akin to German fascism, then it\u2019s no shock the doctor thinks the IRS is a bona fide secret police. \u201cYou know, we live in a Gestapo age, people don\u2019t realize it,\u201d he said, in reference to the federal tax agency. He believes that President Obama might suspend elections in 2016, that Democrats want immigrants to increase the welfare population and keep themselves in power, and that\u2014as he explained in the first Republican presidential debate this year\u2014Hillary Clinton and \u201cthe progressive movement\u201d are \u201ctrying to destroy this country\u201d by driving up the national debt and stepping \u201coff the stage as a world leader.\u201d\n\nCarson, the doctor, is a brilliant pediatric neurosurgeon. Carson, the candidate, is a crank\u2014a creature of deep suspicion and conspiratorial thinking, who gives the mainstream a rare glimpse into the American Negative Zone of far-right fear and fetid fever dreams. There, anti-Muslim prejudice is common and unapologetic while Carson\u2019s claim\u2014that Islam is inherently anti-American\u2014is axiomatic. Given his political background, his remarks were typical, if not even expected. (It almost goes without saying that there\u2019s an irony in Carson\u2019s bigotry: When he was a child, his ideological antecedents attacked civil rights activists with the same anger and contempt.)\n\nIf his comments surprised, it\u2019s because of his style. Carson\u2019s gentle affect is his greatest asset; it soothes listeners and obscures the degree to which he\u2019s the most extreme candidate in the race. With that said, he\u2019s a Kessel Run away from the Republican nomination. Barring the catastrophic collapse of every other \u201cestablishment\u201d or conventional candidate, he has little chance of becoming the GOP nominee, much less president. But that\u2019s no consolation.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "His genial reputation conceals a deep commitment to paranoid politics, honed over years of conservative activism.", "fb-share": "Carson, the doctor, is a brilliant pediatric neurosurgeon.
