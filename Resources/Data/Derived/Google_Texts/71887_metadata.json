California Chrome\u2019s loss extended the longest drought without a Triple Crown champion.\n\nCalifornia Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn was bitter about horses skipping the first two legs and then stealing the Belmont. Six of the last eight Belmont winners did just that.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the coward\u2019s way out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to these horses that have been in the game since day one. If you don\u2019t make enough points to get into the Kentucky Derby, you can\u2019t run in the other two races. It\u2019s all or nothing.\u201d\n\nCoburn thought the other 10 horses ganged up on California Chrome, who was second early, dropped to fourth and then fifth before dead-heating for fourth.\n\n\u201cOur horse had a target on his back,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a horse, run him in all three. I\u2019ll never see, and I\u2019m 61 years old, another Triple Crown winner in my lifetime because of the way they do this.\u201d\n\nCoburn had voiced a similar complaint after the Preakness, saying only the 20 horses that run in the Kentucky Derby should be eligible to run in the other two legs. He also believed that horses skipping the Preakness should not be allowed to return in the Belmont.\n\nCoburn had been in a festive mood earlier in the day, waving his cream-colored cowboy hat to fans and signing items they tossed to him in his box seat.\n\nBut the mood turned ugly after the race.\n\nThree tough races in five weeks proved too demanding for California Chrome, who was sent off as the heavy 4-5 favorite. Affirmed remains the most recent Triple Crown winner in 1978.\n\nThe raucous crowd was silenced when it became obvious that California Chrome lacked his usual punch in the stretch.\n\nJockey Victor Espinoza realized long before then that his chestnut colt wasn\u2019t up to the grueling 1 1/2-mile trip around the track\u2019s sweeping turns.\n\n\u201cAs soon as he came out of the gate, he wasn\u2019t the same,\u201d Espinoza said.\n\nAlan Sherman, the son and assistant to trainer Art Sherman, agreed.\n\n\u201cWhen Victor started to squeeze on him, he didn\u2019t respond,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was wore out, I think. Victor seemed to think he handled the surface fine, and he seemed to come back fine.\u201d\n\nOnce the official result was posted, fans sat in stunned silence before heading to the exits.\n\nPenny Chenery, the 92-year-old owner of 1973 Triple Crown champion Secretariat, had been ready to welcome a new member to the exclusive club. She and others with ties to previous Triple Crown winners came to watch what they hoped would be California Chrome\u2019s big day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed that we didn\u2019t have a Triple Crown winner, but I\u2019m happy for the winners,\u201d she said.\n\nTonalist, the fifth wagering choice at 9-1 odds, was a fresh and rested horse making his debut on the Triple Crown trail. He last ran and won the Peter Pan Stakes over the same Belmont dirt on May 10.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit upset about California Chrome,\u201d said Joel Rosario, who rode the winner.\n\nTonalist beat Commissioner, another newcomer to the Triple Crown, by a head. Those two horses finished in the same order in the Peter Pan. Tonalist ran the distance in 2:28.52 and paid $20.40, $9.60 and $7.\n\nCommissioner returned $23.20 and $13.20, while Medal Count was another length back in third and paid $13.20 to show.\n\nSamraat was sixth, followed by General a Rod, Matterhorn, Commanding Curve, Matuszak and Ride On Curlin.\n\nCalifornia Chrome broke quickly but was pressed immediately by Commissioner and General a Rod. Espinoza eased California Chrome back into third along the rail.\n\nApproaching the final turn, California Chrome was maneuvered to the outside. He angled four-wide turning for home, just to the outside of Tonalist, who was close to the pace the entire race. Espinoza started whipping left-handed in the lane but California Chrome had no response.\n\n\u201cI thought he was gaining ground, but he didn\u2019t have it in him, apparently,\u201d Coburn said.\n\nTonalist joined the growing list of Triple Crown spoilers, making California Chrome the 12th horse since Affirmed to lose his Triple try in the Belmont, the longest race in the series.\n\nTrained by Frenchman Christophe Clement, Tonalist was making just his fifth career start.\n\n\u201cWe actually thought he finished second, but we got lucky, he won,\u201d Clement said. \u201cIt was great.\u201d\n\nThe defeat snapped California Chrome\u2019s six-race winning streak. His rise from a humble pedigree and his working-stiff owners resonated with sports fans who rarely take an interest in horse racing.\n\nCalifornia Chrome\u2019s owners spent $8,000 on a mare they bred to a stallion for $2,500, and were called \u201cdumb asses\u201d by a trainer for buying a mare who gave no indication that she could produce a standout offspring who could run fast.\n\nConditions seemed aligned for the Triple Crown drought to end. California Chrome thrived during his three-week stay at Belmont Park. His chestnut coat gleamed and he gained weight after the Preakness on May 17. His owners, trainer and jockey oozed confidence.\n\nBut this fairy tale didn\u2019t have a happy ending.\n\nEspinoza lost his second chance at a Triple Crown. He was aboard War Emblem in 2002, when that colt stumbled at the start of the Belmont and lost all chance.\n\n\u201cThe horse tried, that\u2019s all I can ask for. He took me on the ride of my life, I\u2019ll always have that in my heart for that horse,\u201d trainer Art Sherman said.\n\nCoburn, who with Perry Martin formed Dumb Ass Partners to race their one-horse stable, had vowed that California Chrome \u201cwould go down in history.\u201d\n\nIt just wasn\u2019t the kind they wanted to make.", "article_metadata": {"description": "That finish meant Affirmed in 1978 remains the most recent Triple Crown winner.
