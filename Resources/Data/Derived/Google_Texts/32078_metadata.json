(Photo: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nUnitedHealthcare plans to join New Jersey\u2019s Obamacare health insurance exchange and sell policies that would go into effect in 2015, the company said Monday.\n\nThe move would give consumers more choices in a state whose insurance premiums are among the nation\u2019s highest.\n\n\u201cJust having another (insurer) could make it cheaper for people,\u201d said Beatriz Patino, health exchange coordinator for Ocean Health Initiatives Inc., a Toms River-based health center that helped consumers sign up for insurance through the exchange. \u201cThat\u2019s what I hope for our next open enrollment.\u201d\n\nMinneapolis-based UnitedHealthcare previously sold insurance in New Jersey, but not on the exchange, the marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act for consumers who aren\u2019t insured through employer plans.\n\nNew Jersey is one of 36 states nationwide that opted to use a federal exchange instead of their own. A report released last week found New Jerseyans buying insurance on the exchange paid an average of $465 a month if they did not qualify for tax credits and $148 a month if they did. By comparison, the average premium for all states using the federal exchange was $346, or $82 after tax credits.\n\nObservers said it reflected New Jersey\u2019s high cost of living, but they also wondered if the lack of competition played a part. Just three insurers \u2013 AmeriHealth NJ, Health Republic of New Jersey and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey \u2013 sold plans on New Jersey\u2019s exchange last year. Meanwhile, 16 insurers in New York sold plans on its exchange.\n\nThere was little difference in average prices between the two states. But New Yorkers had far more choices, and the prices of the insurance companies\u2019 policies varied widely.\n\nUnitedHealthcare has been under fire from consumers in New Jersey and nationwide for reducing its provider network. For example, its Medicare Advantage plan recently dropped Meridian Health, the Shore\u2019s biggest hospital network, after the two sides couldn\u2019t agree on a new contract. But the insurer has said it is making the moves to slow down the rising cost of health care.\n\nUnitedHealthcare still needs approval from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which operates the federal exchange, to sell policies on the New Jersey marketplace.\n\nMichael L.
