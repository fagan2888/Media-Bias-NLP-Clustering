"And this was just horrible," Becky Ransdell said.

People at a community car show say they're in shock tonight after what they saw at the Salvation Army.

Melvin Holmbect was showing off his restored car when the unthinkable happened. Multiple witnesses say this van hit at least one person, pinning them to a tree. Holmbect ran to help.

"I seen her between a van and a tree and her legs were up. She was moving, but she passed away after that," Melvin Holmbeck said.

"How that happened, I don't, the chances of that happening, how the van ended up parked, it's just, it's crazy," Brian Schaefer said.

Witnesses say the driver of the van came through the car show parking lot. They say she was driving erratically, and going up to 40 miles per hour. People here told her to slow down, and that's when she left the parking lot and ended up over by the trees.

"Just swerved just out of control and then all of a sudden we heard the crash, and it was like she went faster," Becky Ransdell said.

"She hit the lady in the lawn chair head on," Brain Schaefer said.

Police tell KELOLAND they're still investigating exactly what happened. Tonight, they're asking the dozens of witnesses for help putting the pieces together.

"It's like horrible, and I'm telling the police this, and I still got chills. And, it was awful," Becky Ransdell said.
