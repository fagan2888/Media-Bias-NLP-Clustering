(WPRI) \u2014 Rhode Island residents looking to enroll or re-enroll in HealthSource RI will need to do so by December 23 to be covered for January 1.\n\nKaren Biastre of Middletown was outraged when she went to re-enroll at HealthSource RI and astonished to see how much higher rates would be in 2015 for the same plan. Her complaints were echoed by many others who assumed what they were paying last year for health insurance would stay the same in 2015.\n\n\u201cI started questioning information I knew about the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Biastre said. \u201cWe were promised that affordable healthcare would be provided to us at no cost above 8% of what your income is.\u201d\n\nBiastre questioned HealthSource RI about the change and was told the government bases a family\u2019s income off of what they can afford for eight people, though she only has a family of three.\n\nConsumer Reporter Susan Hogan brought Biastre\u2019s concerns to Christine Ferguson, the Director of HealthSource RI.\n\n\u201cWe have talked with congressional delegation, I\u2019ve been to D.C. and talked to administration and congress about the fact that this is a problem,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nFerguson encourages customers to look at the plan comparisons and not just at the deductibles, but at the maximum out of pocket expenses.\n\nOpen enrollment ends on February 15, 2015.
