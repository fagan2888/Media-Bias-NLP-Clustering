RIO GRANDE VALLEY--La Union Del Pueblo Entero (LUPE) is helping migrant workers who don't have proper documentation file their taxes.

You can still file your taxes even if you don't have a social security number.

Office manager Carmen Limas says a lot of times there are roadblocks for these clients.

"Some of them don't have a social security number, so we help them get the i-10 number which is an individual tax identification number," Limas said.

The IRS needs original documents like passports and IDs in some cases. Limas says if you don't have that, go to the Mexican consulate before you do your income taxes.

Bertha De La Fuente is a migrant farm worker who gets help from LUPE,

"I'm new to this country, I don't know a lot of english, nor do I understand the questions that are being asked. I don't know how the process with all steps that have to be taken. The workers here tell me this is what I'll need to bring, this is what I'll need to get," she said.

This tax season you need to show your paperwork with the affordable care act. If you can't find it, you will be penalized $695.

LUPE has locations in San Juan, Alton and Mercedes. They are open Monday-Friday from 9 a.m to 5:30. Make sure to bring your social security card if you have one, your W-2, ID and proof of insurance.

Taxes are due Monday, April 18th.
