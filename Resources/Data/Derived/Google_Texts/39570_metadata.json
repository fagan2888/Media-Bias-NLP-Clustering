It was just kind of a gut feeling.\"\n\nSo, the Samatas' search for another Chicago-based charity for youth to pass their $500,000 endowment to led them to By The Hand Club for Kids. What made the organization stand out from several others considered was founder Travis, one of Chicago Magazine's 2012 Chicagoans of the Year.\n\n\"She is such a dynamic person and an amazing leader,\" Samata said.\n\nWhen Samata called Travis with the good news, the By The Hand founder was ecstatic.\n\n\"She said, 'Do you mind if I scream?' And she let out this big scream, and then we talked about it, and she said, 'Pat, do you mind if I scream just one more time?' \" Samata said, laughing. \"She's just got so much life and enthusiasm, and I just thought, 'Yep, this is the right person, this is the right group.' \"\n\nHalf of the gift \u2014 $250,000 \u2014 will go toward the organization's newly opened $6 million facility at 415 N. Laramie Ave. in Austin, and the other $250,000 will go to the group's own endowment for its operating costs in coming years, Travis said.\n\nBut the By The Hand Club for Kids is carrying on more than just the Evan's Life Foundation's endowment \u2014 it's carrying on its legacy.\n\nBy The Hand will etch a message about Evan's life and his foundation in the window of the new Austin facility, Travis said. And Samata said she knows she and many Evan's Life supporters will be volunteering with and donating to the By The Hand Club for Kids.\n\nTravis has an idea of her own for Evan's memory \u2014 the By The Hand kids will be encouraged to reflect on their legacies, something she thought up after hearing Samata say this about Evan:\n\n\"He was only on this Earth for 2\u00bd years, but through his foundation, he probably accomplished more than somebody who lived to be in their 70s in terms of giving back,\" Samata said. \"I guess, more than anything, it\u2019s a good demonstration of how something good can come out of a tragedy.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "description": "The Evan&#39;s Life Foundation is giving $500,000 to By The Hand Club for Kids.", "application-name": "DNAinfo", "og": {"url": "https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20140101/austin/evans-life-foundation-ends-but-gives-another-kids-charity-huge-gift", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/chicago_photo/2013/12/evan-samata-13885332979690.jpg/extralarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "site_name": "DNAinfo Chicago", "description": "The Evan&#39;s Life Foundation is giving $500,000 to By The Hand Club for Kids.", "title": "Evan's Life Foundation Ends, But Gives Another Kids Charity a Huge Gift"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"site": "@DNAinfoCHI", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "DNAinfo", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-70x70px.png", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "54902139,1379988119,575522805,108424,5519941,48600120,112261,662865465", "app_id": 153948644632011}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Austin,Englewood,Old Town,South Deering,Business & Economy,CHI Kids,Donnita Travis,Evan Samata,Greg Samata,Pat Samata,By The Hand Club for Kids,Evan's Life Foundation", "google-site-verification": "AYA-4dHbK-igtSqpqIYyKuCbHO3o3KourjkrAnfCeZc", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-150x150.png", "googletag": {"topic": "business-economy,chi-kids", "tags": "by-hand-club-for-kids,evans-life-foundation", "people": "donnita-travis,pat-samata,greg-samata,evan-samata"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd34f\"", "article_summary": "And Samata said she knows she and many Evan's Life supporters will be volunteering with and donating to the By The Hand Club for Kids.\nBut the By The Hand Club for Kids is carrying on more than just the Evan's Life Foundation's endowment \u2014 it's carrying on its legacy.\nThe Evan's Life Foundation helped the Samatas cope with their loss, and the foundation supplied grants for more than 10,000 at-risk kids in Chicago during its 20 years, the Samatas said in a letter to supporters.\nBy The Hand will etch a message about Evan's life and his foundation in the window of the new Austin facility, Travis said.\nSo, the Samatas' search for another Chicago-based charity for youth to pass their $500,000 endowment to led them to By The Hand Club for Kids."}
