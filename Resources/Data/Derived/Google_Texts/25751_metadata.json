It\u2019s only a matter of time, according to Bezos, before Amazon\u2019s faux-pelicans will be dropping packages at your door (and hopefully not on your head), speeding up deliveries and bringing instant gratification one step closer. No one thought to ask the obvious \u2013 what happens to all those redundant delivery folks?\n\nThe constant replacement of humans by machines presents policy makers with a looming crisis \u2014 not enough jobs to go around. It also destroys the easy confidence with which many on the left argue for higher minimum wages. Incomes aren\u2019t stuck because employers are hard-hearted so-and-sos, which is the recurring accusation of those who, like Paul Krugman, have never actually had to compete in the real world. Wages are stuck because so many individuals can be replaced by competitors overseas who earn far less or by machines, which earn nothing.\n\nRELATED: MINIMUM WAGE AND WHAT IT BUYS YOU: 1950s TO NOW\n\nKrugman recently issued another pie-in-the-sky endorsement of raising the nation\u2019s minimum wage. He zeros in on retail workers whose pay he says has dropped nearly 30 percent since 1973 in real terms \u2014 adjusted for inflation. About 16 percent of minimum wage workers are in retail, while a little more than half are in \u201cleisure and hospitality,\u201d mostly food service. Krugman notes that since those jobs can\u2019t be exported, the low pay cannot be excused by foreign competition.\n\nHe neglects to mention that jobs in traditional stores are vulnerable to pressure from online retailing. No industry is more cost-conscious currently than brick-and-mortar retailers, many of whom are downsizing stores and laying off people. Department stores and mom-and-pop outlets alike are under fire from online competitors who operate without the costs of rent, burdensome inventories and\u2026without workers helping customers and manning the cash registers.\n\nThis past Thanksgiving weekend brick and mortar retail sales are reported to have dropped about 3 percent, surprising and disappointing the industry. (The actual numbers won\u2019t be known for some time.) Though analysts estimated that more people went shopping, they concluded that per person spending was down. Most important was that the crowd turned out mainly for so-called door-buster items that were heavily discounted to attract shoppers. The combination of lower overall sales and big discounts will hurt the bottom line.\n\nThe winner for the weekend\u2013again \u2014 was online sales, estimated to have climbed 17 percent. Though shopping on the web still only accounts for some 14 percent of total retail spending, the pressure it puts on traditional stores is intense. Among other things, shoppers now frequently go online to compare prices before they hit the mall. Woe is the retailer that doesn\u2019t match bargains online. Because our government has been slow off the mark to respond to this new developing industry, e-vendors have an automatic price advantage in most states \u2014 they charge no sales tax.\n\nRELATED: FAST-FOOD WORKER STRIKES\u2014WHAT GOOD WILL THEY DO?\n\nThe retail industry is just one in which workers are at risk. It\u2019s hard to find many jobs that are not threatened by automation, by Internet expansion or by overseas competition. That includes people working in the fast food industry \u2014 where union organizers are currently pushing for a big jump in minimum pay. They should not assume that burger joints won\u2019t eventually automate. Last year, Momentum Machines in San Francisco previewed an apparatus that created 360 burgers an hour. Noting that the fast food industry spends $9 billion a year on wages, the company predicted a lively reception for its space- and cost-saving machine.\n\nCompanies and workers successfully competing against all these forces must rely on the right combination of productivity and price. Purposefully jeopardizing workers\u2019 livelihoods by driving wage costs higher is risky and in the end unproductive. Add to the mix uber-low interest rates, which tilts investment towards capital and away from labor, and those urging a higher minimum wage are not on the side of workers.\n\nIn any event, numerous studies have concluded that raising the minimum wage is not the most effective anti-poverty approach, since the families of two-thirds of workers in that category have incomes 150 percent above the poverty line. That\u2019s because over half all those in the U.S. earning the minimum wage are under the age of 25; 60 percent of that group is enrolled in school.\n\nTwo-thirds of minimum wage workers are employed part-time. These statistics point to the reality that for most, working at minimum wage is an entry point to the work force, or an opportunity to work part-time. President Obama has endorsed raising the federal minimum wage so that \u201cno one who works full-time should have to live in poverty.\u201d If only it were so easy.\n\nThere is no simple answer to the jobs and wage dilemma facing the nation. Americans in theory favor higher pay across the board, until the price of their chicken nuggets jumps 10 percent. They are never asked if they would favor higher wages in return for a higher cost of living. We are a bargain-hungry nation, used to enjoying discounts and cheap prices.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason why it\u2019s 18 percent more expensive to live in London than in New York and 43 percent more costly in Paris than in Chicago . In Munich , a meal at a McDonald\u2019s equivalent runs 45 percent more than in Houston; eggs are 62 percent more expensive and domestic beer costs 54 percent more. There are many factors that influence prices, including tariffs and taxes, but wage levels are also important. Will raising the minimum wage hurt or help our economy? It\u2019s not clear.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In a recent \u201c60 Minutes\u201d piece, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos proudly displayed his compan", "title": "Why Raising the Minimum Wage Is a Fantasy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/12/05/Why-Raising-Minimum-Wage-Fantasy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/robot-restaurant-3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/12/05/Why-Raising-Minimum-Wage-Fantasy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/robot-restaurant-3.jpg", "creator": "@lizpeek", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In a recent \u201c60 Minutes\u201d piece, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos proudly displayed his compan", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb19c\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: MINIMUM WAGE AND WHAT IT BUYS YOU: 1950s TO NOWKrugman recently issued another pie-in-the-sky endorsement of raising the nation\u2019s minimum wage.\nWill raising the minimum wage hurt or help our economy?\nPresident Obama has endorsed raising the federal minimum wage so that \u201cno one who works full-time should have to live in poverty.\u201d If only it were so easy.\nIt also destroys the easy confidence with which many on the left argue for higher minimum wages.\nTwo-thirds of minimum wage workers are employed part-time."}
