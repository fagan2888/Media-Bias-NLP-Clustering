These rate projections are delivered alongside the policy statement at 2pm, often referred to as the \u201cdots.\u201d\n\nThese dots anonymously map out where each Fed official sees the policy rate over the coming years \u2014 and they could soon become the clearest way investors and economics can gauge the timing of the first rate hike.\n\nThe current forward guidance is clear cut, but not expected to last. The Fed currently uses \u201cthresholds\u201d to explain it won\u2019t consider raising rates until the unemployment rate hits 6.5%, so long as inflation expectations remain under 2.5%. But with the jobless rate at 6.7%, many Fed official agree the current communication tactic needs revamping \u2014 likely to a broader, more-qualitative assessment of the economy.\n\n\u201cIt will place the onus of forward guidance squarely on the Fed\u201d and its projections, says TD Securities\u2019 rate strategy team. \u201cThe appeal of this approach is basically the flexibility it affords policymakers in adjusting their Fed funds expectations without unduly confining that view to the performance of a single indicator.\u201d\n\nTD expects the Fed this Wednesday to drop its 6.5% jobless-rate threshold and link future policy more closely to the median projection of the dots.\n\nSo where are the dots? As of December, two Fed officials projected the policy rate being increased some time in 2014. Goldman Sachs believes St. Louis Fed President James Bullard represents one of those dots, and will likely shift to the 2015 camp. The firm believes Chicago Fed President Charles Evans was in the 2015 camp, but will move his dot out to 2016.\n\nGoldman also believes new Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen holds one of the 2016 dots, which if true, could persuade some of the Fed governors to shift from 2015 to 2016.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "For Federal Reserve watchers this Wednesday, \u201cdots\u201d could become the new \u201cthresholds.\u201d", "title": "Follow the Fed\u2019s Shifting Dots", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/03/17/follow-the-feds-shifting-dots/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BY436_dots_P_20140317123728.jpg"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "Follow the Fed\u2019s Shifting Dots", "description": "For Federal Reserve watchers this Wednesday, \u201cdots\u201d could become the new \u201cthresholds.\u201d", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Cynthia Lin", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "For Federal Reserve watchers this Wednesday, \u201cdots\u201d could become the new \u201cthresholds.\u201d", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-03-17T16:44:20-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/03/17/follow-the-feds-shifting-dots/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-23875", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "For Federal Reserve watchers this Wednesday, \u201cdots\u201d could become the new \u201cthresholds.\u201d", "title": "Follow the Fed\u2019s Shifting Dots", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/03/17/follow-the-feds-shifting-dots/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BY436_dots_P_20140317123728.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-23875", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-17T16:44:20-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc202\"", "article_summary": "The current forward guidance is clear cut, but not expected to last.\nAs of December, two Fed officials projected the policy rate being increased some time in 2014.\nGoldman Sachs believes St. Louis Fed President James Bullard represents one of those dots, and will likely shift to the 2015 camp.\n\u201cIt will place the onus of forward guidance squarely on the Fed\u201d and its projections, says TD Securities\u2019 rate strategy team.\nThe firm believes Chicago Fed President Charles Evans was in the 2015 camp, but will move his dot out to 2016."}
