Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) speaks during a campaign stop at Charlie\u2019s Steakhouse in Carroll, Iowa, on Monday. (Mark Kauzlarich/Reuters)\n\nDonald Trump says lots of ridiculous and offensive things. One suspects, however, he is sincere but has not bothered to educate himself on matters of public policy and is not much of a deep thinker. (Being an aggressive businessman who inherited enormous wealth does not take much brains.) Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), however, has no such excuse, and he\u2019s starting to sound even more ridiculous than the man whom is he chasing for the nomination.\n\nSometimes Cruz spews catchwords that have virtually no meaning. \u201cThe Washington cartel is panicking because conservatives are uniting, he proclaims. Huh? The debate champ with two Ivy League degrees should know that this is nonsensical. Cartel? The most feasible definition in the political context is \u201ca combination of political groups for common action.\u201d Who exactly is in such a cartel? House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who wants to repeal Obamacare and enact conservative tax reform? He has been uniting conservatives for months. Unifying conservatives is his goal. Who else could be on Cruz\u2019s list? There are the other 53 Republican senators. Not many (do any?) like Cruz, but they are also united on conservative goals, such as approving the Keystone XL pipeline, repealing Obamacare, blocking the Iran nuclear deal, etc.\n\nIn fact, Cruz likes to posit himself as the only real conservative, with everyone else in the GOP on the same side as the Democrats. This is more than self-serving; it\u2019s false. In fact, conservatives are united on many things \u2014 beefing up the National Security Agency surveillance program, voting for the National Defense Authorization Act in wartime, etc. It is Cruz who is the odd man out, largely due to pandering to stray libertarian elements in the party.\n\nInstead of making coherent arguments for his positions and explaining how he\u2019d accomplish them, Cruz often resorts to meaningless phrases as he paints himself as the solitary victim. It might be more correct to say, \u201cSome conservatives are worried he might get the nomination \u2014 and lose overwhelmingly to Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nWell, you say, every candidate is allowed some hyperbole. Perhaps, although one also expects serious policy ideas from someone who posits himself as the smartest man in every room. Instead, we get gibberish (make the sand \u201cglow\u201d).\n\nHis latest bit of political thinking concerns immigration:\n\nThe Texas senator, who is leading the field of Republican presidential candidates in Iowa according to the latest polls, was asked by a man in the state if, like Trump, he believed that all undocumented immigrants should be deported. Cruz replied, \u201cAbsolutely yes.\u201d \u201cAnd in fact, look, there\u2019s a difference,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cHe\u2019s advocated allowing folks to come back in and become citizens. I oppose that.\u201d\n\nActually Trump has not advocated letting them back into become citizens, but Cruz is now adopting the view that mass deportation of millions of people \u2014 no matter how long they\u2019ve been here, no matter if they are productive members of society, no matter what their educational level and no matter what public service they are engaged in \u2014 will be tracked down, removed by force and never allowed back in.\n\nCongratulations, Mr. Trump, you are no longer the most outlandish and offensive candidate on immigration. Cruz certainly knows better \u2014 as he does on NSA, fighting the Islamic State and shutting down the government \u2014 but he says these things because he imagines his audiences are simpletons, easily led around by the nose. So much for civil liberties. (How\u2019s he going to find these people, and what\u2019s he going to do with American-born children?) So much for fiscal conservatism. (How many billions will this cost, and what would the economic damage be from rounding up 11 to 12 million consumers, workers and payers of sales and payroll taxes?).\n\nIt is because of this sort of posturing on everything from the shutdown to immigration to national security that serious, mainstream conservatives who care about advancing conservative goals and getting elected think so poorly of Cruz. More so than Trump, he\u2019s a demagogue ready to say things he knows to be nonsense \u2014 and to be contrary to conservative principles \u2014 for the sake of self-advancement. And it\u2019s why his support rests on a narrow slice of the electorate unrepresentative of the party as a whole, let alone the country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz is a demagogue who says things he knows to be nonsense, just for the sake of self-advancement.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Cruz is a demagogue who says things he knows to be nonsense, just for the sake of self-advancement.", "title": "Donald Trump is ignorant.
