Rapid City, SD

The South Dakota School of Mines & Technology is hosting nearly 150 elementary and middle school students Saturday as they send their Lego robots into competition.



Fifteen teams of students ages 9-14 have registered to compete in the regional FIRST Lego League contest. Eight teams will qualify to advance to the state finals in Sioux Falls in January.



The teams have been working together for six weeks learning to build and program competitive autonomous robots, which must do various tasks on their own within a given time to earn points. Results of research projects are presented to judges, and students will compete in teamwork activities to earn additional points.



This is the third year the School of Mines has hosted the competition.



The competition runs 1 p.m. to 6 p.m.
