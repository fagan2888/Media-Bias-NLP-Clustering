Once completed, the state-of-the-art facility will provide Islanders and visitors with improved access to noncritical health care \u2014 and an alternative to walking into the emergency room, or seeking an appointment with a primary-care doctor.\n\n\u201cThis is a need in the community that we needed to service,\u201d hospital CEO Tim Walsh told The Times Monday. \u201cIt closes a hole in our delivery system that was being filled by others.\u201d\n\nMonday morning, Mr. Walsh took The Times on a tour of the gutted and rebuilt 4,800-square-foot hospital wing that will accommodate the walk-in clinic and separate offices for two new primary-care doctors.\n\nA crew of a dozen tradesmen from Columbia Construction of North Reading were installing a complex labyrinth of wiring, piping, and air exchange ducts, which will eventually be hidden by the new ceiling. Two carpenters were installing a curved desk in the reception area.\n\n\u201cThe clinic will be staffed by nurse practitioners and physician\u2019s assistants, similar to the other walk-in clinics on the Island,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. \u201cAnd there will always be a doctor available.\u201d\n\nMr Walsh said the clinic is expected to be completed in April, and will be fully functional by summer. Hours of operation have yet to be determined, and will be somewhat dependent on demand.\n\nMr. Walsh said the one of the few remaining challenges is finding staff parking for the summer months, which will most likely mean offsite parking within walking distance of MVH in order to open up parking spaces in front of the clinic. The last step before the clinic can open will be passing the Department of Public Health final inspection.\n\nThe clinic will have five exam rooms, several nursing stations, a lab area, a reception area, and an expansive waiting area. Mr. Walsh said he expects to hire at least one new primary-care doctor before he retires in mid-May.\n\nIn a previous interview with The Times, Dr. Jeffrey Zack, chief of emergency medicine, said the walk-in clinic will reduce costs for patients and also ease the demand on emergency services. \u201cAll too often patients utilize the ER because they may not have a primary-care doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cEmergency medicine is here for the sickest of the sick, yet over the past 10, 20 years we\u2019ve started to take care of everybody. We do a lot of primary care, especially here on the Island. It isn\u2019t the most cost-effective way to deliver quality care. This [walk-in clinic] fills that need of \u2018not too sick but can\u2019t wait for an office visit in a week.\u2019\u201d\n\nDr. Zack said that the walk-in clinic will also help manage the surge in patients when there\u2019s an outbreak of the flu or a virus. \u201cHistorically this overflow would go into the ER, which diverts resources and is a costly way to practice medicine. But up until now, there\u2019s been very little option for folks on the Island,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Walsh said that the walk-in clinic will also help the hospital adjust to the new conditions of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. \u201cThey want to do global payments in the future, so they can say, \u2018We\u2019ll give you $25,000 a year for this patient; you figure out the health care,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where a walk-in clinic can save money.\u201d\n\nMr. Walsh said people with more serious symptoms, such as chest or abdominal pains, should still go to the ER. \u201cIf you have a sinus infection, you go to the walk-in clinic. But if you have chest pains or belly pain, you should go straight to the ER,\u201d he said.\n\nThe walk-in clinic is the latest addition to the expanding continuum at MVH in recent years that includes inpatient care overseen by hospitalists, oncology services, and electronic medical record keeping, under the umbrella of the hospital\u2019s parent organisation, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which also provides the Vineyard hospital with radiology and anesthesiology services.\n\nMr. Walsh said that Partners HealthCare, which MVH became affiliated with in 2007, is also investing $1.2 billion in Epic, a new software system that will provide caregivers across the Partners HealthCare system with improved access to medical records. He expects MVH to be using Epic by this time next year.\n\n\n\nBeset with delays\n\nOriginally, the walk-in clinic was due to open at the beginning of last summer, but the renovation was plagued with delays. Problems arose right out of the gate when the beleaguered building revealed more damage than was expected, primarily the result of a notoriously leaky roof.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been quite a feat,\u201d MVH director of facilities John Murray said about the top-to-bottom renovation. \u201cIt was a very challenging building.\u201d\n\nWork was also delayed when a problem arose with an air exchange unit in the main hospital, which required $700,000 worth of repairs.\n\nPermitting hurdles were frequent. A good deal of work had already been done before Mark Barbadoro came aboard as the Oak Bluffs building inspector in 2014. The more exacting standards that come with hospital building codes were not being met, in his opinion. There was also a difference of opinion on whether the walk-in clinic was considered a \u201chospital,\u201d which would have required enormous changes. Once it was determined that it did not have to fit hospital codes, there were still significant issues to be resolved.\n\n\u201cThe initial problem was that in their haste, they gutted the place,\u201d Mr. Barbadoro told The Times in an earlier interview. \u201cI guess they thought they could just knock down 5,000 square feet of the building without consequence, but they really weren\u2019t prepared in terms of having an actual functional plan.\u201d Mr. Barbadoro said as an example, the wiring from the emergency generator was not up to code. \u201cCritical branch wiring has to be fire-rated, and it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThey literally had to dig it all out \u2026 I was trying to push them to a higher standard, and caught them off-guard a little bit.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Martha's Vineyard Times", "description": "Years in the making, the new facility will provide an ER alternative for non-life-threatening injuries and maladies.", "title": "Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital walk-in clinic nears completion - Martha's Vineyard Times", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.mvtimes.com/mvt/uploads/2016/03/IMG_5855_1.jpg", "height": 853}, "updated_time": "2016-03-16T18:09:19-04:00", "url": "http://www.mvtimes.com/2016/03/16/marthas-vineyard-hospital-walk-clinic-nears-completion/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Featured", "published_time": "2016-03-16T17:29:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-16T18:09:19-04:00"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Barry Stringfellow"}, "article_summary": "The transformation of the former emergency room at Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital (MVH) into a new walk-in clinic is in its final stages.\nThis [walk-in clinic] fills that need of \u2018not too sick but can\u2019t wait for an office visit in a week.\u2019\u201dDr. Zack said that the walk-in clinic will also help manage the surge in patients when there\u2019s an outbreak of the flu or a virus.\nBeset with delaysOriginally, the walk-in clinic was due to open at the beginning of last summer, but the renovation was plagued with delays.\nThere was also a difference of opinion on whether the walk-in clinic was considered a \u201chospital,\u201d which would have required enormous changes.\n\u201cIf you have a sinus infection, you go to the walk-in clinic."}
