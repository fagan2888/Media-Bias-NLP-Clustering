The inquiry\u2019s terms of reference include making recommendations aimed at making high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable.\n\nAt the Hasa conference, Anthony Norton, director at law firm Nortons Inc, said the commission should shy away from making recommendations about regulating prices, because such regulations could have unintended consequences.\n\nThe Competition Commission should be seen to be impartial and should maintain its institutional independence, he says.\n\nPrice regulation is generally the responsibility of specific entities such as the National Energy Regulator of South Africa or the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa, Norton says.\n\nBonakele told the conference that the aim of the inquiry is to understand the forces that prevent, distort or restrict competition in the private healthcare sector, and how these forces affect you, the healthcare consumer.\n\nThe extent of competition and the way in which it works in the private healthcare sector are unclear, and the commission wants to understand how factors \u2013 such as the imbalance of information between healthcare providers and consumers, and relationships between consumers and intermediaries, including brokers and certain providers \u2013 distort or restrict competition, Bonakele says.\n\nMinister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi asked the Competition Commissioner earlier this year to conduct the inquiry.\n\nMotsoaledi told the conference that he does not, as is rumoured, have a secret agenda, and the intention of the inquiry is not to destroy the private healthcare sector.\n\nThe intention is to improve the public and the private healthcare sectors so that both sectors will able to provide everyone with quality and affordable health care, he says.\n\nBonakele told the conference that information published by the Council for Medical Schemes on the amounts that medical schemes pay to providers shows a huge increase in the cost of private hospitals and specialists since 2000. This increase is out of proportion to the cost increases in other sub-sectors, he says.\n\nThe acting commissioner says he is aware that the source of this information has been contested, but the information is in the public domain and people are asking questions about the escalation in the cost of private hospitals and specialists. The commission expects the inquiry to address these questions, he says.\n\nBonakele told the conference that there has been much criticism of the Competition Commission\u2019s decision in 2003 that the annual negotiations between medical schemes and healthcare providers on the tariffs that providers would charge for their services constituted collusion and were therefore in contravention of the Competition Act.\n\nMedical schemes represented by the Board of Healthcare Funders, Hasa and the South African Medical Association paid fines as a settlement of these contraventions, and there have been no further collective negotiations on tariffs.\n\nThe Competition Commission\u2019s decision has been criticised for enabling healthcare providers to implement higher-than-inflation tariff increases, resulting in a widening gap between what providers charge and what medical schemes pay for their services. Members have to make up the shortfall out of their own pockets.\n\nBonakele says the commission is certain that its decision was correct in law, but it wants to see what the impact of its decision has been and is not afraid to debate how the decision may have contributed to rising prices.\n\nThe commission received many responses to the draft terms of reference of the inquiry, which were published in May and has considered them seriously, Bonakele says.\n\nThe final terms of reference, which will be published before the end of this year, are likely to broaden the scope of the inquiry, he says.\n\nThe commission understands that there is a certain level of mistrust and misapprehension about the inquiry, and it has therefore decided to appoint an independent panel to conduct it, Bonakele says.\n\nThe panel of eminent people, who will have an appropriate mix of skills, will be announced before the end of this year, he says.\n\nThe inquiry should begin early next year, and the aim is to publish a draft report by September 2015 and a final report by the end of 2015, he says.\n\nAlthough the date is \u201cnot cast in stone\u201d, because inquiries tend to take on a life of their own, the commission is determined to finalise the inquiry as soon as possible, because many issues, such as investment in the private healthcare sector, are hanging on the outcome of the inquiry.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "browserconfig.xml", "description": "undefined", "og": {"url": "http://www.iol.co.za/business/personal-finance/healthcare-inquiry-will-recommend-regulated-tariffs-if-necessary-1601038", "image": "http://classic.iol.co.za/polopoly_fs/pf-iol-magnifyingglass2-1.1601037!/image/1106287766_gen/derivatives/box_600/1106287766", "site_name": "IOL", "description": "undefined", "title": "Healthcare inquiry will recommend regulated tariffs \u2018if necessary\u2019 | IOL"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "IOL", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "YmiNpvzQrHdqXOi__ytAIEQM_vjpAQvum7AZW5rs1xE", "viewport": "width=device-width,height=device-height, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f24\"", "article_summary": "The Competition Commission should be seen to be impartial and should maintain its institutional independence, he says.\nThe Acting Competition Commissioner does not want to say whether an inquiry into the private healthcare sector will recommend that medical tariffs be regulated, but he says the inquiry is free to make any recommendation it deems fit based on the evidence before it.\nThe intention is to improve the public and the private healthcare sectors so that both sectors will able to provide everyone with quality and affordable health care, he says.\nMotsoaledi told the conference that he does not, as is rumoured, have a secret agenda, and the intention of the inquiry is not to destroy the private healthcare sector.\nBonakele told the conference that the aim of the inquiry is to understand the forces that prevent, distort or restrict competition in the private healthcare sector, and how these forces affect you, the healthcare consumer."}
