PSP Investments, one of Canada's largest institutional investors, will own 39 percent and an infrastructure fund run by India's IDFC Alternatives will hold 10 percent.\n\nThe two plants, located close to each other in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, have a combined generating capacity of 1,391 megawatts, and are near another Indian hydroelectric plant in which TAQA acquired a stake last year.\n\nAlong with a lignite power plant owned by TAQA, the latest deal will bring TAQA's combined generating capacity in India to 1,741 MW. The deal, which needs regulatory and third-party approvals, is expected to close in 2014, TAQA said.\n\nShares in Jaiprakash Power jumped 12 percent on Friday in anticipation of the deal; Reuters reported early last month that it was close to being signed. On Friday, the Indian company said its board would meet on Saturday to consider recommendations for cutting debt and boosting shareholder value.\n\nLike many power and infrastructure companies in India, Jaiprakash Power and its parent Jaiprakash Associates have suffered from large debts and weakness in the Indian economy over recent months.\n\nIncluding subsidiaries, Jaiprakash Associates had total debts of 550 billion to 560 billion rupees ($8.9-9.0 billion) in September, which it planned to cut by 150 billion rupees through sales of assets including cement and power plants during the current fiscal year through March.\n\nJaiprakash Power reported a widening of its net loss to 1.53 billion rupees in the three months to December, while its shares are down about 40 percent in the past 12 months.\n\nJaiprakash Associates last year sold its cement plant in Gujarat state to UltraTech Cement for around $594 million including debt.
