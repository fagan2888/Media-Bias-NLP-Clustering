And there were moments of shock such as the instance an older gentleman yanked dentures from his mouth, saying he had lost his teeth at the hands of violent police officers.\n\nEventually, though, a theme emerged at the first of four planned meetings for public input on reforming the sheriff\u2019s department.\n\nThe deputies who use excessive force against inmates need to be punished, including with criminal charges, people said over and over.\n\n\u201cThere is zero tolerance for violence from inmates,\u201d said Mandy Koss, who has worked for more than 20 years in the criminal justice system. \u201cThere should be zero tolerance for violence from deputies.\u201d\n\nUnder the current system, punishment comes slowly and lightly for those who abuse inmates. As a result, no one takes it seriously, Koss said.\n\n\u201cIf they see their fellow deputies get charged criminally, they may think twice about what they do,\u201d Koss said.\n\nStephanie O\u2019Malley, executive director of the Denver Safety Department, said she knows the use-of-force policy needs to be changed.\n\n\u201cIt keeps coming up in all conversations related to the Denver Sheriff Department,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big one.\u201d\n\nThis year, an excessive-force case cost the city $3.25 million after it settled a lawsuit against former inmate Jamal Hunter. Another lawsuit over excessive force over the death of a homeless street preacher inside the jail is set for trial this month. And a third former inmate has filed a $5 million suit against the city after he was slammed against a metal window frame in a courtroom.\n\nSeveral people spoke about mental health treatment for inmates, including interim Sheriff Elias Diggins who, when asked what he would do if money and resources were unlimited, mentioned he would do more for the mentally ill.\n\nRobert Giron, a former city employee, suggested deputies be cross-trained in social service skills so they can help rehabilitate the people they guard all day.\n\n\u201cThey need to understand they are taking in our sons, our sisters, our uncles, our family,\u201d he said. \u201cUnderstand they are human.\u201d\n\nBut some in the crowd did not appear convinced that their opinions were being heard. They criticized city leaders for being tone deaf after a Denver Police Department bomb squad truck, motorcycle and several police cars were parked outside the building.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t get it,\u201d said Darren O\u2019Connor, who removed his Guy Fawkes protest mask to speak.\n\nThe equipment was on display as a public-relations effort for Mayor Michael Hancock\u2019s Cabinet in the Community events also being held at the school.\n\nBut Rosemary Rodriguez, a member of the reform effort\u2019s executive steering committee, agreed.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw it, my stomach fell,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we try to do as a committee is to be approachable.\u201d\n\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/Noelle_Phillips\n\nUpcoming\n\nMore community meetings on Denver Sheriff Department:\n\nSept. 13: 9:30 to 10:30 a.m., Highland Senior Center, 2880 Osceola St.\n\nSept. 20: 10 to 11 a.m., Eisenhower Recreation Center, 4300 E.
