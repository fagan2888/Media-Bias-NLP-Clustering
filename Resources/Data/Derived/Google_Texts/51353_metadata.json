Growing occurrence of autoimmune diseases along with the presence of helpful initiatives, such as Affordable Care Act, undertaken by the government is projected to positively impact the market.\n\nSlow turnaround period and presence of fewer diagnostic tests catering to almost 80 disease types and the resulting increase in the lab automation prices are projected to drive the market growth over the forecast period (2014\u20132020). Lab automation is projected to enable doctors with the ability to perform various diagnostic tests simultaneously with rapid & accurate results. Also, technological developments, such as the development of portable diagnostic point-of-care equipment, are projected to boost process volume.\n\nBrowse to access In-depth research report on Global Autoimmune Disease Diagnostics Market with detailed charts and figures: http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/autoimmune-disease-diagnostics-industry\n\nSystemic autoimmune disease diagnostics is the most profitable sector of the market.
