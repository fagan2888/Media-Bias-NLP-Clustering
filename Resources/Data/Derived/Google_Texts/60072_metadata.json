And so that\u2019s the message the president will deliver tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe government estimates that just 10 million Americans will sign up for plans on the health care exchanges for next year, a small increase over the 9 million-plus enrollees it attracted for 2015 and far short of the 21 million that budget analysts initially projected.\n\nHHS says roughly 10.5 million people remain eligible for exchange coverage, so it is virtually impossible to reach the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimate, which had assumed firms would dump workers off company plans and into the exchanges.\n\nThe administration still wants to gobble up as many eligible customers as they can, however, noting eight in 10 enrollees qualify for tax credits and that seven in 10 customers could get covered for under $75 per month, once those subsidies are applied.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you come in,\u201d Mr. Obama told the assisters. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get that information out.\u201d\n\nThe law continues to face headwinds on Capitol Hill, however, where Republicans say the Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t living up to its name.\n\nA pre-enrollment analysis said premiums on important mid-tier, or \u201cbenchmark\u201d plans, will rise by an average of 7.5 percent, although individuals could see sharper rate hikes \u2014 or even decreases in their premiums \u2014 depending on where they live.\n\nCongressional critics also want to know why more than half of Obamacare\u2019s co-op plans, which were supposed to give consumers a leg up in a marketplace, have been forced out of the exchanges and risk default on taxpayer loans.\n\nTwelve of the initial 23 co-op plans have been forced out of the marketplace, with Michigan becoming the latest to announce it will not offer plans for next year.\n\nTogether, the failed co-ops received about $1.2 billion in startup loans and served more than 750,000 people, who must now scramble to find new plans on the exchanges.\n\nAnd a fight over Obamacare is brewing in Kentucky, where Republican businessman Matt Bevin was elected governor late Tuesday on a platform that included rolling back the 2010 law\u2019s footprint in the Bluegrass State.\n\nMr. Bevin has called for disbanding its state-run insurance exchange, Kynect, and transferring residents to the federal HealthCare.gov portal. More significantly, he hinted at changes to the Medicaid expansion program that\u2019s covered 400,000-plus residents in the state.\n\nMr. Earnest said if Mr. Bevin wants to condition the expanded coverage on certain reforms, as other GOP leaders states have done, it\u2019s likely the administration \u201cwould engage in that kind of discussion with him.\u201d\n\nOn the exchange side, Mr. Earnest said Kynect has \u201cperformed quite well, and it\u2019s served the people of Kentucky quite well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are dozens of states across the country that have either by request or by their own refusal to go through the work of setting up this system, have the federal government come in to operate these marketplaces,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so if necessary, I\u2019m confident that\u2019s something we can do in Kentucky as well. \u2026 We wait for a formal request from the governor\u2019s office and, you know, he\u2019s not even in office yet.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Dave Boyer contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama kicked off a media campaign in support of his signature health law Wednesday by cheering on \"navigator\" groups tasked with rooting out the millions of Americans who failed to sign up during the first two rounds.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama kicked off a media campaign in support of his signature health law Wednesday by cheering on \u201cnavigator\u201d groups tasked with rooting out the millions of Americans who failed to sign up during the first two rounds.", "title": "Obama kicks off media blitz for health law", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/4/obama-kicks-media-blitz-health-law/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/01/63474645187f7d31860f6a706700771c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/01/63474645187f7d31860f6a706700771c.jpg", "description": "President Obama kicked off a media campaign in support of his signature health law Wednesday by cheering on \"navigator\" groups tasked with rooting out the millions of Americans who failed to sign up d", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama kicks off media blitz for health law"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Josh Earnest"}, "article_summary": "On Thursday, Mr. Obama will conduct radio interviews with outlets in five markets the administration is targeting for higher enrollment, according to White House press secretary Josh Earnest.\nMr. Obama\u2019s media blitz comes a few days into the law\u2019s third round of signups, which lasts until Jan. 31.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you come in,\u201d Mr. Obama told the assisters.\n\u201cAnd these markets have been identified as communities where there are a substantial number of people who have not yet availed themselves of the opportunity to get health insurance through their marketplace.\nPresident Obama kicked off a media campaign in support of his signature health law Wednesday by cheering on \u201cnavigator\u201d groups tasked with rooting out the millions of Americans who failed to sign up during the first two rounds."}
