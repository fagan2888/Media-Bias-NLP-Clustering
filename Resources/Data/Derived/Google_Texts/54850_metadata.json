Nestled among the photos of Abergil and her friends during their army service and labeled \u201cThe army . . . best time of my life\u201d were shocking trophy shots depicting Abergil mocking blindfolded Palestinian detainees during Operation Cast Lead in Gaza.\n\nIn one photo, a uniformed but heavily made-up and coiffed Abergil pouts for the camera while three older Palestinian men sit behind her on concrete blocks, their eyes blindfolded and their hands bound with plastic ties. One of the prisoners appears to be straining with discomfort, as his hands are tied behind his back.\n\nAbergil\u2019s best army buddy, a young woman named Shani Cohen, commented on the photo: \u201cLOL all my loves in one picture!!! My heart is pumping hard!!!\u201d In another shot, Abergil appears seated inches from the man whose hands were bound behind his back. He is a pathetic sight, rail thin, slumped forward, and completely unaware that Abergil was blowing mocking kisses at him. A comment thread below the photo read:\n\nAdi Tal: You\u2019re the sexiest like that . . .\n\nEden Abergil: Yeah I know lol mummy what a day it was look how he\n\ncompletes my picture, I wonder if he\u2019s got Facebook! I have to tag him in the picture! lol\n\nShani Cohen: LOL you psycho. . . . I wonder who\u2019s the photographerrrrr\n\nShani Cohen: Eden . . . he\u2019s got a hard-on for you . . . lol for sure!!!\n\nEden Abergil: Lol no honey he\u2019s got a hard-on for youuu this is why you took that picture lol you took my picture!!!!\n\nHours after a blogger discovered the photos, Abergil\u2019s name appeared in headlines across the Israeli and international media. The Israeli Army Spokesperson\u2019s Unit attempted to dismiss Abergil as an isolated bad apple, whose actions represented \u201ca serious violation of our ethics and moral code.\u201d In her initial reaction, Abergil played down her behavior, claiming, \u201cThere\u2019s no violence. . . . There\u2019s no contempt.\u201d But former soldiers knew that such sadism was common across the ranks of the military. After all, what did anyone expect heavily armed teenagers to do when placed in control of a largely defenseless population that had been presented to them throughout their lives as a murderous enemy?\n\nAbergil\u2019s photos prompted the editor-in-chief of Ha\u2019aretz, Aluf Benn, to detail his own military experience for the first time. \u201cThe photographs of the female soldier Eden Abergil on Facebook with the young, bound Palestinians did not \u2018shock\u2019 me, as did the automatic responses of people on the left who complained, as usual, about the corrupting occupation and our moral deterioration,\u201d Benn wrote. \u201cInstead, the photos brought back memories from my military service. Once, I was also Eden Abergil: I served in a Military Police unit in Lebanon whose mission was to take prisoners from the Shin Bet\u2019s interrogation rooms to the large holding camp of Ansar. I covered many eyes with pieces of cloth, I bound many wrists with plastic cuffs.\u201d\n\nDespite having knowingly shuttled men from Shin Bet torture chambers to a prison notorious for its brutal conditions, Benn insisted that he and members of his unit emerged with their liberal, democratic values intact: \u201cThe occupation did not \u2018corrupt\u2019 me or any of my colleagues in the unit. We didn\u2019t return home and run wild in the streets and abuse helpless people. Coming-of-age problems preoccupied us a lot more than our prisoners\u2019 discomfort. Our political views were also not affected.\u201d\n\nThe editor-in-chief \u2019s remarkable claim shocked his colleague, Gideon Levy, who many Israeli leftists regarded as the conscience of Ha\u2019aretz. In an editorial response, Levy accused Benn of having lost his moral bearings as soon as he joined the invasion of Lebanon. \u201cYou didn\u2019t return home to riot in the streets and abuse innocent people, you write, and that\u2019s all very well. But you were silent,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou were a complete accomplice to the crime, and you don\u2019t even have a guilty conscience.\u201d\n\nBreaking the Silence, the Israeli veterans\u2019 organization that published harrowing testimonies from the soldiers who maintained Israel\u2019s occupation, echoed Levy, insisting that army culture had corrupted an entire generation. \u201cThis norm is wide-ranging and was created as result of the occupation and the daily control over the civilian population,\u201d Breaking the Silence cofounder Yehuda Shaul remarked. \u201cEvery soldier becomes used to seeing cuffed and blindfolded Palestinians as a matter of routine, and by seeing it so often, these troops become blind to the fact these are human beings.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, well before Israeli society was forced to reckon with the phenomenon of trophy photos, Breaking the Silence collaborated with filmmaker Tamar Yarom in the production of a documentary film about the experiences of six female Israeli soldiers who served in the occupation. Entitled \u201cTo See If I\u2019m Smiling,\u201d the film opened with one of the ex-soldiers, Meytal Sandler, peering into an album of photos she took during her service in the West Bank during the Second Intifada. The contents of the album are not revealed until the documentary\u2019s final scene, when Sandler returns to find a photo she had avoided gazing at for years, drowning her memories of the army in alcohol abuse and chain smoking. In the photo, she is seen posing next to the nude corpse of a Palestinian man with an erection brought on by rigor mortis. And she is smiling from ear to ear. \u201cHow the hell did I think I\u2019d ever be able to forget about it?\u201d Sandler muttered in horror.\n\nIn the days after the Abergil scandal, Breaking the Silence and a handful of Israeli bloggers released dozens of Facebook photos that depicted scenarios at least as shocking as anything that appeared on Abergil\u2019s page. Among the disturbing shots culled from Facebook pages belonging to young Israelis was a photo of four smiling troops towering over a blindfolded preadolescent Palestinian girl kneeling at the point of their machine guns; a pretty female soldier smiling winsomely beside a blindfolded Palestinian man cuffed to a plastic chair; two soldiers posing triumphantly above a disheveled corpse lying in the street like a piece of discarded trash; a soldier pumping his rifle in the air directly behind an older Palestinian woman tending to pots on her kitchen stove; a soldier defacing the walls of a home in Gaza by spray-painting a star of David and the phrase, \u201cBe Right Back\u201d; troops in the Gaza Strip playing with and posing beside corpses stripped half nude in acts of post-mortem humiliation; a young soldier mockingly applying makeup from a Palestinian woman\u2019s dresser. The Facebook pages were so replete with documents of humiliation, domination, and violence it seemed that army basic training had been led by Marquis de Sade.\n\nGraphic trophy photos are, of course, a common feature of modern military conflict. But the images of fresh-faced Israeli kids smiling beside corpses reflected much more than the dehumanization of the enemy in the \u201cfog of war.\u201d These photos were documents of a colonial culture in which Jewish Israeli youth became conditioned to act as sadistic overlords toward their Palestinian neighbors, and of a perpetual conquest that demanded indoctrination begin at an early age and continue perpetually throughout their lives. The young soldiers provided a perfect example of cognitive dissonance, in which chants of \u201cAm Yisrael Chai!\u201d (\u201cThe People of Israel Live!\u201d) alternated easily with \u201cDeath to Arabs!\u201d\n\nIn March 2011, months after her photos drew international attention and widespread condemnation, Abergil began uploading other soldiers\u2019 trophy shots to her Facebook page. She captioned one upload with the increasingly common refrain:", "article_metadata": {"description": "They have posted wildly offensive text and imagery online", "title": "For Israeli soldiers, social media has become a showcase of horrors", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "They have posted wildly offensive text and imagery online", "title": "For Israeli soldiers, social media has become a showcase of horrors", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/13/for_israeli_soldiers_social_media_has_become_a_gallery_of_horrors/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/israeli_soldiers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "They have posted wildly offensive text and imagery online", "title": "For Israeli soldiers, social media has become a showcase of horrors", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/israeli_soldiers.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Max Blumenthal", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Conflict, Goliath, Internet Culture, Israel, Middle East, Palestinians, Social Media, Writers and Writing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda498\"", "article_summary": "Eden Abergil: Lol no honey he\u2019s got a hard-on for youuu this is why you took that picture lol you took my picture!!!!\nHours after a blogger discovered the photos, Abergil\u2019s name appeared in headlines across the Israeli and international media.\nNestled among the photos of Abergil and her friends during their army service and labeled \u201cThe army .\nAbergil\u2019s best army buddy, a young woman named Shani Cohen, commented on the photo: \u201cLOL all my loves in one picture!!!\nbest time of my life\u201d were shocking trophy shots depicting Abergil mocking blindfolded Palestinian detainees during Operation Cast Lead in Gaza."}
