This is a plan in which employees may elect a portion of their paycheck to go into an account earmarked for retirement. They receive a tax deduction for the amount that is saved and will realize the taxes when the money is withdrawn during retirement.\n\nSaving is hard for most of us, but it's not the tax deduction that makes the 401(k) so attractive. The real beauty of the 401(k) is that the money is yanked out of one's paycheck before the worker has a chance to spend it.\n\n(Read more: Plan for independence, not retirement)\n\nIf you work for a Fortune 500 company, odds are you have a decent 401(k) plan and Obama's budget won't have much impact on you.\n\nHowever, if you are like the millions of Americans who work for a small company, this budget may kill your chance for any sort of financial independence during retirement.\n\nObama's 2015 budget would reduce the tax incentive for business owners to establish and maintain a 401(k) plan. Currently, all employees can participate in a 401(k) plan, and all employees are able to avoid current taxation on the money they place into the plan.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Obama's proposed 2015 budget, reducing tax incentives for small businesses to offer retirement plans to employees, may harm Americans' savings plans.", "author": "Scott Hanson, Special to CNBC.com", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Obama's proposed 2015 budget, reducing tax incentives for small businesses to offer retirement plans to employees, may harm Americans' savings plans.", "title": "Obama's budget plans bad for some 401(k) savers", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/18/obamas-budget-bad-for-401k-savers.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/03/18/101504626-476660397.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama's proposed 2015 budget, reducing tax incentives for small businesses to offer retirement plans to employees, may harm Americans' savings plans.", "title": "Obama's budget bad for 401(k) savers", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/18/obamas-budget-bad-for-401k-savers.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/03/18/101504626-476660397.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Return on Retirement, Special Reports, Return on Retirement, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-03-19T09:00:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Return on Retirement", "modified_time": "2014-03-20T09:00:23-0400", "tag": "Return on Retirement"}, "pageNodeId": 101504549, "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, 401(k) plan, financial adviser, financial advisor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07d9\"", "article_summary": "Obama's 2015 budget would reduce the tax incentive for business owners to establish and maintain a 401(k) plan.\nThe largest retirement-savings vehicle in the U.S. is the defined contribution plan\u2014namely, the 401(k) plan.\n(Read more: Plan for independence, not retirement)If you work for a Fortune 500 company, odds are you have a decent 401(k) plan and Obama's budget won't have much impact on you.\nCurrently, all employees can participate in a 401(k) plan, and all employees are able to avoid current taxation on the money they place into the plan.\nSaving is hard for most of us, but it's not the tax deduction that makes the 401(k) so attractive."}
