Overall, 17 states saw increases in injury-related deaths, 24 remained stable, and nine saw decreased rates. Other states that have high death rates from injuries include New Mexico (92.7 deaths per 100,000 people), Oklahoma (88.4 deaths per 100,000 people), and Montana (85.1 deaths per 100,000 people).\n\nDrug overdoses have become the leading cause of injury in 36 states, including in California where they surpassed vehicle-related deaths. Across the nation, drug overdose deaths have more than doubled in the past 14 years, amounting to 44,000 deaths a year, with half of those deaths coming from prescription drugs.\n\nPrescription drug monitoring programs are a key way to prevent injury-related deaths in these at-risk populations. The program employs a database that doctors can use to record and track patients\u2019 prescriptions, and can help identify patients who travel to different doctors trying to get more prescriptions drugs, according to the report.\n\nThe report offers a number of options that will help prevent injuries and subsequent deaths, including implementing policies requiring sobriety checkpoints, seat belts, wearing bike helmets, and more comprehensive prescription drug monitoring programs.\n\nResearchers analyzed these accidents and injuries, both intentional and unintentional, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia from 2011 to 2013. Nearly 193,000 people in the country died from injuries, which is roughly 50 deaths per 100,000 people yearly. By contrast, West Virginia had 98 deaths from injuries per 100,000 people.\n\n\u201cInjuries are not just acts of fate. Research shows they are pretty predictable and preventable,\u201d said Jeffrey Levi, executive director of TFAH, in the report. \u201cThis report illustrates how evidence-based strategies can actually help prevent and reduce motor vehicle crashes, head injuries, fires, falls, homicides, suicides, assaults, sexual violence, child abuse, drug misuse, overdoses and more. It\u2019s not rocket science, but it does require common sense and investment in good public health practice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "injury, related, death, rate, highest, among, those, 44, and, younger, and, drug, abuse, one", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Injury-related deaths have risen across the country, with drug overdoses becoming the leading cause of injury in over 36 states.", "title": "Which State Has The Highest Injury-Related Death Rate?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/injury-related-death-rate-highest-among-those-44-and-younger-and-drug-abuse-one-338946", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/18/america.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Injury-related deaths have risen across the country, with drug overdoses becoming the leading cause of injury in over 36 states.", "title": "Which State Has The Highest Injury-Related Death Rate?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/injury-related-death-rate-highest-among-those-44-and-younger-and-drug-abuse-one-338946", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/18/america.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/18/america.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-18T17:08:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-18T17:08:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Injury-related deaths have risen across the country, with drug overdoses becoming the leading cause of injury in over 36 states."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd47f0\"", "article_summary": "Drug overdoses have become the leading cause of injury in 36 states, including in California where they surpassed vehicle-related deaths.\nInjuries are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 1 to 44, and are responsible for nearly 193,000 deaths per year.\nPrescription drug monitoring programs are a key way to prevent injury-related deaths in these at-risk populations.\nOther states that have high death rates from injuries include New Mexico (92.7 deaths per 100,000 people), Oklahoma (88.4 deaths per 100,000 people), and Montana (85.1 deaths per 100,000 people).\nOverall, 17 states saw increases in injury-related deaths, 24 remained stable, and nine saw decreased rates."}
