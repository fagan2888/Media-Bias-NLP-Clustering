The federal government, led by President Obama and an army of bureaucrats at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is radically transforming how Americans use and consume energy. Meanwhile, well-funded environmental groups have convinced a clear majority of the country that the environment is only in fair or poor condition. As a result, Americans are increasingly willing to accept government regulations, subsidies, and mandates that make energy more expensive and diminish their quality of life.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: The national environmental lobby\u2019s doom-and-gloom narrative is false.\n\nThe environment isn\u2019t getting worse\u2014it\u2019s rapidly improving, even as our economy grows and our energy use increases. The EPA recently released new data on air quality showing that total emissions of the six major air pollutants have dropped by 68 percent since 1970. This is all the more impressive considering that during this same period, America\u2019s population has grown by 54 percent, we\u2019re using 44 percent more energy, we\u2019re driving 168 percent more miles in our cars, and our economy has grown by 238 percent.\n\nIt goes from impressive to astounding when you consider that natural gas, coal, and oil have driven this growth. Technological innovations have made obtaining these energy sources smarter, safer, and more efficient than ever before.\n\nIn other words, we don\u2019t have to wreck our economy to save the planet\u2014an important realization which casts the green lobby\u2019s preferred policies in a new light. There\u2019s also the very real possibility that such policies would provide very little environmental benefit and even harm the environment.\n\nEnvironmentalists Hurt the Planet Several of President Obama\u2019s climate policies will do exactly that. The most important example is the EPA\u2019s sweeping new regulations for power plants. These regulations attempt to reduce carbon dioxide by 30 percent by the year 2030, which could shutter enough power plants to provide electricity to 80 million Americans while raising electricity rates.\n\nThe administration\u2019s policies will merely move the energy industry to countries with weaker environmental standards. By curtailing energy production and use in the United States, along with the jobs they support, the administration\u2019s policies will merely move this industry to countries with weaker environmental standards, including China and India. Less stringent standards in these countries are already causing pollution from China to cross the Pacific Ocean, negatively affecting the West Coast. The administration\u2019s environmental agenda would worsen these problems.\n\nSadly, the EPA pending regulations aren\u2019t the only examples of government pursuing policies in the name of environmental protection that actually hinder environmental progress.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s failure to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline is another. It means that more oil will be transported by rail and barge, both of which have higher spill rates and produce more greenhouse gas emissions than pipelines. Ethanol mandates at the federal and state level actually increase smog and greenhouse-gas emissions. Despite its name, the Endangered Species Act has failed to save many species\u2014in fact, environmental activists who sue the federal government in the name of protecting endangered species actually divert resources away from species recovery.\n\nEven the cash for clunkers program hurt the environment. Among its numerous unintended consequences, it focused on shredding the cars instead of recycling them, wasting resources that could have been used for other purposes.\n\nThis points to a simple conclusion: Across the board, the federal government has proven to be an inept and even counterproductive environmental steward.\n\nHow People Are Saving the Planet So where should we look to for good environmental stewardship? Perhaps outside of Washington is a good place to start. Individuals and entrepreneurs, through private-sector innovation, have proven effective at improving the environment\u2014and our lives.\n\nAmerican businesses and families are leading the charge to address environmental challenges. We can see this all around us. Commercial drone developers are working to equip farmers with drones that can fly over fields to better spot diseases and pests. That could soon allow farmers to target and treat smaller areas of land, resulting in less insecticide use while saving farmers money.\n\nPrivate-sector innovation has also made accessing natural gas and oil more environmentally friendly. For example, directional drilling allows companies to drill multiple wells from a single well pad, minimizing overall surface disturbance while extracting more energy.\n\nBusinesses aren\u2019t the only ones innovating. Individuals are also a driving force, making us more energy efficient than ever. Products like the Nest thermostat allow us to adjust the heating and cooling of our homes from our mobile phones. Apps like FuelGood calculate the potential savings of more efficient fuel usage, claiming that users can save up to two months\u2019 worth of fuel per year. The Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) in Montana has started an Enviropreneur Institute to highlight individuals who are using innovation and market principles to save businesses money and improve environmental outcomes.\n\nThese examples only scratch the surface of the innovation boom that\u2019s facilitating America\u2019s environmental progress. And consumers and businesses are embracing these tools and tactics without government mandates.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 07:23:02 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "We don\u2019t have to wreck our economy to save the planet.", "title": "It\u2019s Time To Reclaim The Planet From Environmentalists", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutterstock_57802567.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-30T07:26:49+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/03/27/its-time-to-reclaim-the-planet-from-environmentalists/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "We don\u2019t have to wreck our economy to save the planet.", "title": "It\u2019s Time To Reclaim The Planet From Environmentalists", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutterstock_57802567.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Environmentalism", "tag": "Earth,environmental protection agency,environmentalism,environmentalists,Keystone XL,Keystone XL Pipeline", "published_time": "2015-03-27T07:23:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-30T07:26:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "We don\u2019t have to wreck our economy to save the planet."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce6a\"", "article_summary": "Environmentalists Hurt the Planet Several of President Obama\u2019s climate policies will do exactly that.\nThe administration\u2019s policies will merely move the energy industry to countries with weaker environmental standards.\nHow People Are Saving the Planet So where should we look to for good environmental stewardship?\nThere\u2019s also the very real possibility that such policies would provide very little environmental benefit and even harm the environment.\nThe environment isn\u2019t getting worse\u2014it\u2019s rapidly improving, even as our economy grows and our energy use increases."}
