It\u2019s set for Tuesday.\n\n\u201cRepublicans really need to stop this unnecessary attack and focus on issues that pertain to moving this country forward,\u201d said Congressman Donald Payne Jr.\n\nEarlier this month President Obama vetoed a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act. Next week\u2019s vote aims to override that veto.\n\nThe movement\u2019s been gathering steam since a pair of anti-abortion activists shot an undercover video last summer purporting to show a Planned Parenthood official trying to sell fetal tissue for profit. A Texas grand jury indicted those two undercover activists and cleared Planned Parenthood earlier this week.\n\n\u201cSometimes the good guys do win, but the battle still continues,\u201d said Roslyn Rogers Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan New Jersey.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Metropolitan New Jersey served almost 17,000 people among five Essex and Passaic County health centers in 2015. That\u2019s 25,000 visits, ranging from cancer screenings to STI testing and contraceptive care.\n\nThe northern New Jersey chapter is one of 59 nation-wide. It receives about half its revenue through federal funding. Federal dollars may not be used to fund abortions.\n\nPlanned Parenthood says abortions make up just three percent of its services nationally and that it provides life-saving services, like breast and cervical cancer screenings and is often the only place its low income clients get medical care.\n\n\u201cEighty-eight percent of the patients who come through our doors are at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines,\u201d Collins said.\n\n\u201cWhat would we do without Planned Parenthood? Where would these women go?\u201d Payne asked.\n\nIt takes a two-thirds majority of the House and Senate to override a presidential veto. While Congressional Republicans don\u2019t have the votes, House Speaker Paul Ryan says it\u2019s about sending a message to President Obama and teeing up a campaign issue in this election year.\n\nThis exchange took place during last night\u2019s Republican presidential debate between Bret Baier and Gov. Chris Christie:\n\nBaier: Can you name even one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all?\n\nChristie: Yeah. You want one?\n\nBaier: Yeah, I want one.\n\nChristie: How about one that I\u2019ve done in New Jersey for the last six years and that\u2019s get rid of Planned Parenthood funding for the United States of America.\n\n\u201cHe just continues to embarrass the state of New Jersey,\u201d Payne said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to be president, so we don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s first test comes Monday, as Iowa caucus-goers kick off the nomination season.\n\nFollow @ErinDelmoreNJTV", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "pubdate": 20160129, "og": {"site_name": "NJTV News", "description": "There is a congressional vote to override President Obama's veto of a bill that would defund Planned Parenthood set for Tuesday.
