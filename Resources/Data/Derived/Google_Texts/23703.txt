« 2014 is going to be a pivotal year for the implementation of energy policy. » David Sparby, senior vice president and group president for Xcel Energy

About Sparby: Born in Duluth, he earned a B.A. at the College of St. Scholastica, an MBA at the University of St. Thomas and a law degree at William Mitchell College of Law. His first law job was in utility regulation for the Minnesota attorney general. He joined Xcel in 1982 as a staff attorney, rising through a series of posts including corporate CFO. He became senior vice president in 2011, and added the regional CEO for Minnesota role this year.

Personal file: Sparby likes to be well prepared. He says he may have only one chance to make the company's point and wants to get it right. He's friendly and down-to-earth one-on-one, and has a native Minnesotan's feel for the state.

What's big in 2014: Xcel seeks rate increases for its 1.2 million Minnesota electric customers in 2014 and 2015, and must convince regulators that it prudently invested $665 million in its nuclear reactor in Monticello, Minn. Xcel's 1970s-era coal-burning generators in Becker, Minn., also are on the regulatory agenda.

The decision to retain or retire the two Sherco units after 2020 hinges partly on proposed federal greenhouse gas regulations coming next year.

Final word: "There's probably as many issues to be decided in 2014 as I can remember."
