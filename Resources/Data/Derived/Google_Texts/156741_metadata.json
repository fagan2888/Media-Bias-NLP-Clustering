So if Manning gave me $4 million today, I\u2019d be on my rental helicopter tomorrow, bound for the Kootenay Rockies in British Columbia to ski as many vertical feet of fresh powder as my old legs could handle.\n\nHooch: There isn\u2019t a \u201cBrewster\u2019s Millions\u201d catch to this four mil, right? OK, $4 million should get me the following: The \u201cBack to the Future\u201d DeLorean, the cast of \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d as the groomsmen and bridesmaids at my wedding, a round of golf at Bushwood, lunch with Paul McCartney, a snack with Ringo Starr, my picture on the wall at Don\u2019s Club Tavern and my own table for life at The Cherry Cricket (as well as a burger on the menu named \u201cThe Hooch,\u201d featuring a cheeseburger with Klondike bars as the buns).\n\nKiz: In the NFL, $4 million is a haircut, not a serious pay cut. It\u2019s a lot of money to a guy with a mortgage and two kids in college, but it can\u2019t buy an NFL team one player that\u2019s likely to make the difference between winning and losing the Super Bowl. As my friend Shannon Sharpe told me: \u201cNo. 18 had all the leverage. Elway wasn\u2019t trying to win the Super Bowl with Brock Osweiler in 2015.\u201d\n\nHooch: Still, John Elway had some need to get the $4 million to spend, or else he wouldn\u2019t have told a Hall of Famer to take a pay cut. We\u2019ve known the importance of a nose tackle in a 3-4 defensive scheme ever since 1977, when the Broncos\u2019 Rubin Carter stared down America on the cover of Sports Illustrated (and the headline read: \u201cThe case for the 3-4 defense\u201d). The money should be spent on Terrance Knighton or another DT, hopefully also with a fun nickname.\n\nKiz: Along with the $4 million, here\u2019s hoping Manning also handed Elway a shopping list. At the top of the wish list for Manning should be protection for his 39-year-old body. It will cost far more than $4 million for the Broncos to land Kansas City center Rodney Hudson in free agency. But $4 million would make for a nice down payment.\n\nHooch: Speaking of down payment, I think I\u2019ll have enough left in my $4 million to use as a down payment on the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d car.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hochman vs. Kiszla: How would you spend the $4 million Peyton Manning took as cut?", "title": "Hochman vs. Kiszla: How would you spend the $4 million Peyton Manning took as cut?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/07/hochman-vs-kiszla-how-would-you-spend-the-4-million-peyton-manning-took-as-cut/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150218_041351_manning-elway.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150218_041351_manning-elway.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-07T23:20:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T17:19:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Peyton Manning"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7478\"", "article_summary": "Kiz: In the NFL, $4 million is a haircut, not a serious pay cut.\nKiz: Along with the $4 million, here\u2019s hoping Manning also handed Elway a shopping list.\nHooch: Speaking of down payment, I think I\u2019ll have enough left in my $4 million to use as a down payment on the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d car.\nIt will cost far more than $4 million for the Broncos to land Kansas City center Rodney Hudson in free agency.\nAt the top of the wish list for Manning should be protection for his 39-year-old body."}
