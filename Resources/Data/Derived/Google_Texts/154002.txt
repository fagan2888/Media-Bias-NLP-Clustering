“But hey, when has reality ever stood in the way of Senator Ted Cruz,” mocks Wagner

MSNBC host Alex Wagner had a bone to pick with Houston conservatives on Friday when she called out Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX).

In 2010, Houston became the largest city to elect an openly gay mayor. This May the city approved the “equal rights ordnance,” which bans discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation in businesses that serve the public. However, a petition that included several pastors was submitted to strike down the ordnance due to the “perceived threat of male sexual predators dressed in drag entering women’s restrooms.”

On “Now With Alex Wagner,” the anchor reported that Sen. Cruz entered into the conversation when he expressed the concern that the pastors would be prevented from preaching their sermons as part of the legal battle. At this point the city has not made any mention of censoring the pastors’ speech.

Cruz had some lofty language in response to the apparently trumped up religious freedom “scandal,” noting that “Caeser has no jurisdiction over the pulpit.” He received a hearty cheer from the conservative crowd.

Wager made clear that Cruz’s response had little to do with the issue at hand.
