EPB spokesman John Pless said the same thing, even though public utility officials previously hired Lobo to write four similar studies.\n\nLobo\u2019s familiarity with EPB\u2019s broadband is one of the reasons the utility asked him to write yet another study, Pless said.\n\nTennessee Watchdog asked Lobo if he knows whether new people would have come to Chattanooga regardless of EPB broadband.\n\n\u201cOther people are looking into that\u201d was all Lobo would say.\n\nTennessee Watchdog then asked whether he knows if many of the new people, usually high-tech-savvy Millennials, plan to stay.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really hard to measure,\u201d Lobo said, without offering specifics.\n\nLobo also said EPB\u2019s ultra-high-speed Internet hasn\u2019t brought enough benefits to other sectors of Chattanooga\u2019s economy, including health care and education.\n\n\u201cIn my study, it\u2019s just not there yet,\u201d Lobo said. \u201cBut it\u2019s possible that down the road we\u2019ll see larger impacts of high-speed Internet on schools.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Colorado professor Ronald Rizzuto, who has already evaluated EPB\u2019s plans for the Tennessee Cable Association, said many of Lobo\u2019s findings make too many assumptions and are \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo say that all these jobs and all this investment in Chattanooga was due to EPB is a statement beyond the facts of the case,\u201d Rizzuto said. \u201cIf I were profiling those companies, then I at least would have asked them, \u2018Did you come to Chattanooga because of the telecom system? If so, how many jobs did you create?\u2019\u201d\n\nRizzuto said Lobo should have used data from sources other than EPB and the Chamber of Commerce, particularly U.S. Census data.\n\n\u201cIn the end, this is nothing but a public relations piece for EPB, and no one should treat it as an economic study,\u201d Rizzuto said.\n\nRizzuto also said Chattanooga\u2019s economic development plan, including expansion of its Volkswagen factory, which produces automobiles, is \u201cvery aggressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo attribute all that growth to telecom alone is nuts,\u201d Rizzuto said.\n\nOriginally published in Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Looking at the findings from a new study.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Looking at the findings from a new study.", "title": "Was Chattanooga's Taxpayer-Funded High-Speed Internet Worth the Cost?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/1023internet.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/203l73s"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Looking at the findings from a new study.", "title": "Was Chattanooga's Taxpayer-Funded High-Speed Internet Worth the Cost?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/1023internet.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "government waste", "published_time": "2015-10-23T16:13:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "chattanooga,tennessee,high-speed internet,chamber of commerce"}, "article_summary": "Lobo also said EPB\u2019s ultra-high-speed Internet hasn\u2019t brought enough benefits to other sectors of Chattanooga\u2019s economy, including health care and education.\nChattanooga\u2019s EPB put out a new study proclaiming that its government broadband is worth more than what it costs taxpayers and ratepayers.\nTennessee Watchdog asked Lobo if he knows whether new people would have come to Chattanooga regardless of EPB broadband.\n\u201cIn the end, this is nothing but a public relations piece for EPB, and no one should treat it as an economic study,\u201d Rizzuto said.\nLobo\u2019s familiarity with EPB\u2019s broadband is one of the reasons the utility asked him to write yet another study, Pless said."}
