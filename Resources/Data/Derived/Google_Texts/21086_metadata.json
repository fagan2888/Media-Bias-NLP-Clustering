Local chef Jon Wise learned this the hard way when he was sent a bill for more than $62,000 after having his appendix removed last month.\n\n\u201cI was enraged. I had two choices: die or have surgery,\u201d Wise said. \u201cSo I chose surgery.\u201d\n\nWise is one of many Richmonders without health insurance. Almost one in five Richmond residents lacks health insurance \u2013 the highest uninsured rate among the more populous localities in Virginia, according to new data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe bureau recently released 2014 findings from the American Community Survey for localities with populations greater than 65,000. The data tracks, among other things, how many people have health insurance coverage.\n\nMany analysts had been eagerly awaiting the statistics to see if they would reflect the impact of the federal Affordable Care Act, which requires Americans to get health insurance or pay tax penalties.\n\nFor supporters of the law, often dubbed Obamacare, the data offered good news: Nationwide, the rate of uninsured people dropped from about 13 percent in 2013 to 10 percent in 2014.\n\nHowever, Richmond saw only a dip in its uninsured rate: It fell from 19.1 percent in 2013 to 18 percent last year. The current uninsured rate is higher than the 16.6 percent reported in 2012.\n\nThe surrounding counties of Chesterfield and Henrico had uninsured rates of about 9 percent last year. Virginia as a whole was on par with the national average at about 10 percent.\n\nLinda Wilkinson, CEO of the Virginia Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, said poverty is one of the main reasons why the uninsured rate is high in Richmond.\n\n\u201cIf you have minimal education and are only skilled at a particular type of job \u2013 let\u2019s say landscaping, which is a respectable job but most likely won\u2019t offer seasonal workers benefits \u2013 then you\u2019re not going to have insurance,\u201d Wilkinson said.\n\nMany of the unskilled jobs with benefits have moved as corporations shifted to the suburbs, and there\u2019s no limited public transportation options for poor people living in the city to get there, she said.\n\nWilkinson said free clinics in Richmond are working with Enroll Virginia, a community outreach program focused on educating patients about the ACA Marketplace insurance options.\n\n\u201cPeople living in poverty aren\u2019t engaged in policy matters and are unaware that Obamacare exists,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cImagine multiple generations of your family have been living in poverty for 50, 60, 70 years and never had insurance and have no idea how it works.\u201d\n\n2014 was the first year tax penalties for not having health insurance were enforced under the ACA. H&R Block tax preparer Johanna Garg said she believes many people were unaware of the penalty last year.\n\n\u201cAlmost everyone I did taxes for last year didn\u2019t have health insurance unless their job provided it,\u201d Garg said. \u201cMost people didn\u2019t realize the government was going to enforce the penalty, so they just ignored it.\u201d\n\nFor the 2014 fiscal year, the penalty was 1 percent of a household\u2019s income or a flat rate of $95, whichever amount was higher. The penalty will increase each year until 2016, when it will be either $695 or 2.5 percent.\n\nGarg said she thinks many people haven\u2019t taken the time to look into the ACA and don\u2019t know about their insurance options.\n\n\u201cA lot of people can get quality insurance for $50 a month,\u201d she said. \u201cTechnically it\u2019s more than paying the penalty if your income is low and you\u2019re only subject to the flat fee. But imagine if you really hurt yourself or got sick.\u201d\n\nWise agreed that having insurance would have paid off when he had his appendix removed.\n\n\u201cIt was life or death, and afterwards [sic] I still feel like I could have held out longer if I had known how expensive it would be,\u201d Wise said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably never be able to pay my hospital bill off.\u201d\n\nThe data for this story is at http://tinyurl.com/uninsured-va\n\nEditor\u2019s note: By VCU graduate student Maureen McNabb\n\nStudents in the graduate program at VCU\u2019s Robertson School of Media and Culture, writing under the supervision of Associate Professor Jeff South, submitted news stories in a partnership with WTVR.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health insurance can be expensive, but the cost of not having it can be crippling.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "Health insurance can be expensive, but the cost of not having it can be crippling.", "title": "Richmond\u2019s high uninsured rate leads state, national averages", "url": "http://wtvr.com/2015/11/03/richmonds-high-uninsured-rate-leads-state-national-averages/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/uninsured.png", "height": 456}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@cbs6", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 572089813, "iphone": 572089813}}, "image": {"src": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/uninsured.png?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cbs6"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=572089813", "fb": {"pages": 6860957425}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e5f8555355860d96f4528b85609455b?s=16", "application-name": "WTVR.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr", "published_time": "2015-11-03T21:29:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-03T21:29:25+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr"}, "keywords": "local,", "google-site-verification": "xp-vKfdwBt7bllcG4eSrgb2mL-O45aD7dIeyF4EmMF8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u00d7 Richmond\u2019s high uninsured rate leads state, national averagesRICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Health insurance can be expensive, but the cost of not having it can be crippling.\nHowever, Richmond saw only a dip in its uninsured rate: It fell from 19.1 percent in 2013 to 18 percent last year.\nThe current uninsured rate is higher than the 16.6 percent reported in 2012.\n\u201cAlmost everyone I did taxes for last year didn\u2019t have health insurance unless their job provided it,\u201d Garg said.\nBut imagine if you really hurt yourself or got sick.\u201dWise agreed that having insurance would have paid off when he had his appendix removed."}
