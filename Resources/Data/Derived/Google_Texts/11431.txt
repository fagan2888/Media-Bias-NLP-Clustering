A Tampa woman has been arrested in the death of her 3-year-old granddaughter.

Carida Lissettes Cobb, 41, of 7213 S. Juanita, was arrested Friday night on charges of first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse.

Yanelli J. Vasquez, 3, died Dec. 13 and an autopsy was performed.

Cobb was arrested after the results of the autopsy did not match her account of the incident, Tampa police said. Police said the girl was found in a bathtub and “appeared to have been beaten and drowned.”

Police said that before autopsy results were released, Cobb attempted suicide by taking a large amount of pills. Police arrested Cobb after she was released from a hospital.

Cobb was being held in the Hillsborough County Jail and without bail.
