(Rachel Alexander / Fort Morgan Times)\n\nCristian Garcia served as the class's speaker at the event.\n\n\"In the past, each of us have had our own troubles that brought us to Lincoln,\" he said. \"And during this time together, we have learned more than just civics, more than just math and more than how to write a speech. We have discovered what we're capable of and that is being able to accomplish our goals.\"\n\nThe class had invited Mike Gross, the health and physical education teacher at Fort Morgan High School, to give the commencement address during their ceremony.\n\nGross based his speech on lyrics from the class song \"Fly Like an Eagle\" by the Steve Miller Band \u2014 \"Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin' into the future.\"\n\n\"Tonight one leg of your journey through life ends, but another begins,\" he said. \"Believe it or not you have the world by the tail and you can accomplish anything you set your mind to.\"\n\nHe said the fact that the students were at graduation was proof of their will power.\n\n\"For one reason or another, the traditional way of getting to graduation did not work for you and that's why you're graduating from Lincoln,\" Gross said. \"However, I believe that it is a bigger accomplishment for you than traditional students because you persevered.\"\n\nMike Gross, health and physical education teacher at Fort Morgan High School, gives the commencement address \"Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin' into the future\" during Lincoln High School's graduation ceremony Friday in the Fort Morgan Middle School while school board president Roger Segura and Superintendent Ron Echols look on. (Rachel Alexander / Fort Morgan Times)\n\nGross reminded the students that from this moment on they are in charge of their own lives.\n\n\"With that being said, your happiness is dependent on your level of responsibility,\" he said. \"You are the future generation that has the ability to literally change the room.\"\n\nHe told the graduates that Facebook was started in the dorm room of guys who never graduated college, while Apple and Disney were started in garages.\n\n\"You don't have to be rich to change the world,\" he said.\n\nHe gave advice that he said would help the graduates change world, including eat well, exercise, meet people from around the world, read things they don't agree with and know why they don't agree, find ways to enjoy life and teach children not to be bullies.\n\nThe Lincoln High School class of 2014 chats on stage after processing into the Fort Morgan Middle School auditorium during their graduation Friday.
