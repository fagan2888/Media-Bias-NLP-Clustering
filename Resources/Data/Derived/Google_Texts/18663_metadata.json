(Photo: Submitted) Story Highlights Increasingly frequent extreme weather events are magnifying the risks of waterfront development.\n\nThe risks of a proposed new rock quarry near Old Hickory Dam could be catastrophic.\n\nRepurposing existing quarries as floodwater reservoirs could help Nashville withstand a future flood.\n\nMy wife and I are among the many fortunate Yankees lured to Nashville more than 30 years ago by wonderful job opportunities and Nashville\u2019s charm. Coming as we did from the major metropolises of the Northeast, life here seemed like a dream, with plenty of room and relatively few competing interests. There was concern about preservation of historical structures such as the Ryman Auditorium, but the infrastructure appeared much newer than the areas where we once lived, and it was certainly not stressed.\n\nDuring nearly 30 years with Ingram Barge Company, my primary concern was always the safety of our associates and, nearly as often, our country\u2019s aging waterways, which have become old, dangerous, congested and increasingly vulnerable to disruption.\n\nOur business approach kept this in mind: We were focused first on a nonnegotiable commitment to a zero-harm safety culture, and then to be nimble both operationally and financially. We didn\u2019t call it resilience, but that\u2019s what it was.\n\nLast year, I had the wonderful good fortune to join the faculty in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Vanderbilt University and a team that has been researching and advancing the science of risk, reliability and resilience.\n\nToday more than ever, these concepts must inform our community\u2019s decisions about future development and infrastructure investment if we are to keep our spot as an \u201cit\" city.\n\nExtraordinary development is enveloping us and much is happening in all the right places, such as downtown, but also in more challenging places like our waterfront, where forces totally beyond us, such as more frequent extreme weather events, are quickly magnifying the risks of such development.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a resilience lens and see how it can inform us. Resilience is a powerful concept for making systems of all types better, and it has four main elements: (1) anticipate harmful events; (2) reduce vulnerability when it is possible to do so; (3) resist/absorb/adapt when something harmful occurs; and (4) transform to a better state to prevent harm the next time.\n\nIf we look at a prominent, current development/infrastructure issue through this lens, the best path forward can come into focus.\n\nA new rock quarry has recently been proposed that is located close to Old Hickory Dam and just a few miles above downtown Nashville.\n\nWe know the dam is old, we know that quarries involve blasting and vibration to the surrounding area, we know that limestone is plentiful throughout Middle Tennessee, and we know a failure would be catastrophic, and its impact severity would inevitably grow as riverfront development continues.\n\nSo the first two elements of our resilience lens \u2014 anticipate harmful events and reduce vulnerability \u2014 should direct us to build such a quarry elsewhere.\n\nIn another example of good \u201cresilience thinking\u201d that also concerns quarries, Congressman Jim Cooper proposed after the 2010 flood that we consider temporarily repurposing several of the existing quarries in the region that might be able to serve as temporary holding reservoirs for floodwaters when we experience the next 1,000-year flood.\n\nThis is a terrific example of actions that might help our community resist and absorb such an event in the future.\n\nThese concepts aren\u2019t rocket science, though some of the mathematics behind the calculations certainly can be.\n\nWhat it does urge us to do as a community is to inform our decision-making with a lens peering through the windshield in front of us and not using the rearview mirror.\n\nCraig Philip is director of the Vanderbilt Center for Transportation and Operational Resilience (VECTOR) and a research professor of civil and environmental engineering.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1SIfseU", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The proposed quarry would put Nashville's downtown riverfront at unnecessary risk.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "The proposed quarry would put Nashville's downtown riverfront at unnecessary risk.", "title": "Proposed Old Hickory quarry fails 'resilience' test", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/04/02/proposed-old-hickory-quarry-fails-resilience-test/82441074/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The proposed quarry would put Nashville's downtown riverfront at unnecessary risk.", "title": "Proposed Old Hickory quarry fails 'resilience' test", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/abe99028acffd6547af8b453831bbc8cd396252e/c=806-0-2726-1920&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/30/Nashville/Nashville/635949530714800290-Craig-Philip.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html;
