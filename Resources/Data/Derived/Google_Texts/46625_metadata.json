He is instead fighting openly with the top strategist for the super PACs that were set up to spend the money.\n\nThe man at the center of the fight, Toby Neugebauer, is a close friend of Cruz and his wife, Heidi. Neugebauer and his own wife have vacationed with the Cruzes, and he still counts himself a major supporter. But he has refused to spend $9 million of the $10 million he put into a super PAC.\n\n\u201cHe was going to go up with ads in October or November. That came and went, and then he said he\u2019s saving it for Super Tuesday,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, who oversees a network of super PACs supporting Cruz.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s having a $10 million party in Cleveland, or what. It became apparent almost immediately that his money wasn\u2019t really there.\u201d\n\nNeugebauer, though, said he was alarmed by the profligate spending of other super PACs that spent vast sums on candidates who flamed out. He said he is relieved to have set up a strategy where he and two other major donors dictate how their money is spent.\n\n\u201cHow we set up in these big PACs was a response to how unhappy people were in 2012,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cTrust me, all the other big donors wish their PACs were set up the same way.\u201d\n\nAfter Citizens United and other court decisions opened the door to nearly unlimited campaign donations, many donors became frustrated with the control they surrendered to campaign consultants, who blew through millions of dollars on TV ads in a fruitless effort to elect Mitt Romney in 2012. This year, an outside group supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush spent more than $100 million from big donors in a disastrous endeavor that saw Bush falter as soon as the first primary voters went to the polls.\n\nSee more of our top stories on Facebook >>\n\nTo counter the risk of a repeat of 2012, Neugebauer, the son of Texas Rep. Randy Neugebauer, helped set up three super PACs last year to support Cruz, each using a variation of the name Keep the Promise \u2014 one for each major donor. The groups, forbidden by law to communicate with the Cruz campaign, planned to divvy up responsibilities for aiding his candidacy.\n\nBut that strategy proved unwieldy, and the super PACs united in early March under the name Trusted Leadership PAC to raise more money. Neugebauer, however, has yet to come aboard. He complained that the political consultants remain addicted to buying negative television ads, a strategy that has proven particularly ineffective against the star power of front-runner Donald Trump. Neugebauer said he has instead pressed for positive ads placed in social media, but has been rebuffed.\n\n\u201cThere were some political consultants, especially the establishment\u2019s favorites, who didn\u2019t know they were extinct,\u201d Neugebauer said. \u201cPeople are going to be looking for a completely fresh set of talent.\u201d\n\nNeugebauer said he would not start spending money on Trump during the primary but declined to disparage Trump\u2019s credentials for office, as many other Cruz backers have done.\n\n\u201cTed and I are close friends. I am going to support the nominee. I\u2019m not 'Never Trump,'\" he said, referring to the effort among some Republicans to deny Trump the nomination. \"I think all that talk is just disgusting and shows a complete lack of understanding of what the middle class is going through in America. I want those voters for Ted in November.\u201d\n\nIf the other two donors are frustrated that the man who helped recruit them to the effort appears to be bailing on it, they have not said so publicly. Neither Robert Mercer, who has donated $13.5 million to help Cruz, nor Farris Wilks, who along with his family donated $15 million, agreed to be interviewed or responded to written questions submitted to their representatives. The Cruz campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nConway said the division of labor among the funders was \u201cbaked in the cake from the beginning\u201d and that Neugebauer knew his money was to be used for television ads. The other super PACs, she said, were concentrating on contacting voters directly, sending direct mail, radio ads and digital advertising campaigns.\n\n\u201cThe guy could be a hero,\u201d Conway said. \u201cHe could be a white knight right now.\u201d\n\nElection 2016 | Live coverage on Trail Guide | Track the delegate race | Sign up for the newsletter\n\nThe separate super PACs raised eyebrows from political consultants and other campaigns, who wondered whether it made sense to hand over so much control to donors.\n\nBut Cruz\u2019 former communications advisor Rick Tyler said the $38 million infusion from the big three was critical to establishing Cruz\u2019s bona-fides as a serious presidential contender, disproving early doubts that he could compete with establishment candidates.\n\n\u201cOne of them was \u2018Cruz might be able to raise grass-roots money, but he\u2019ll never be able to raise big money,\u2019\u201d Tyler said. \u201cIt was important for people to understand this was a well-funded campaign, and it was balanced.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Cruz's faltering campaign shows the risks of depending on a few wealthy donors", "Description": "Ted Cruz, in his outsider's bid for the White House, has depended heavily on the largesse of just three wealthy donors to establish credibility and stay afloat", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Ted Cruz , in his outsider\u2019s bid for the White House, has depended heavily on the largesse of just three wealthy donors to establish credibility and stay afloat amid a chaotic nominating process that killed off most of his rivals.", "title": "Cruz's faltering campaign shows the risks of depending on a few wealthy donors", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-cruz-donors-20160502-snap-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-572761b3/turbine/la-na-cruz-donors-20160502-snap", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/87021576", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-05-02", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "The groups, forbidden by law to communicate with the Cruz campaign, planned to divvy up responsibilities for aiding his candidacy.\nThe Cruz campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nHe is instead fighting openly with the top strategist for the super PACs that were set up to spend the money.\nThe other super PACs, she said, were concentrating on contacting voters directly, sending direct mail, radio ads and digital advertising campaigns.\nThat came and went, and then he said he\u2019s saving it for Super Tuesday,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, who oversees a network of super PACs supporting Cruz."}
