Print it out, share it, and read it during the rabbi\u2019s sermon. Well, except the Christmas stuff. That would be awkward.\n\n* UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh has written an extensive but accessible treatise on the religious freedom challenges to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate. If you enjoyed Yishai Schwartz\u2019s post on this topic earlier this week, this is a great way to understand its stakes and nuances.\n\n* Walter Russell Mead of Bard College is running his annual Yule blog series, in which he explains the historical origins and contemporary resonance of Christmas. If, like most Jews, you don\u2019t know the difference between the Virgin Birth and the Immaculate Conception (hint: they\u2019re different things), and you\u2019ve always had questions about Christianity that you were too embarrassed to ask, this is a good place to start. Here are the first three installments: \u201cChristmas Gift!,\u201d \u201cRolling the Credits,\u201d and \u201cBorn of a What?\u201d\n\n* Over at Mosaic Magazine, Bar Ilan University\u2019s Joshua Berman tries to explain why it has become difficult for Orthodox halakha to change and how it might adapt once more. He is challenged by the Conservative movement\u2019s Rabbi David Golinkin, Villanova\u2019s Prof. Chaim Saiman, and Rabbi Gil Student.\n\n* Lastly, Foreign Policy reports on a surprising development that will doubtless cause geopolitical shockwaves in the weeks ahead: it turns out that Canada has been naming its warships after U.S. defeats.\n\nShabbat Shalom!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/157588/your-shabbat-reading-2", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.tabletmag.com/wp-content/files_mf/shabbatreading620.png", "site_name": "Tablet Magazine", "title": "Your Shabbat Reading: Christmas, the Contraception Mandate, and Jewish Law"}, "fb": {"admins": 218101514, "app_id": 172479889593604}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=320,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As we close out an eventful week, here's some of the most insightful material we've come across.
