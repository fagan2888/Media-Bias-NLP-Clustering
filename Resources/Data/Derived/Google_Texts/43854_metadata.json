Lori Saine said she was \u201csaddened to see this completely partisan law, widely considered unenforceable by sheriffs across Colorado, cause Magpul to leave our state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe magazine ban did not garner one Republican vote in the House or Senate, and now as a result of this one-sided, Democrat-sponsored law, more than 200 people will lose their jobs and their ability to provide for their families,\u201d said Ms. Saine in a statement. \u201c[T]his move will cost the state of Colorado over $80 million a year in revenue.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: SEE YA: Top gun company splits from Colorado, costing state $85 million\n\nOfficials at Magpul, which makes polymer firearms accessories, announced Thursday that the company will move its corporate headquarters to Texas and its manufacturing facility to Wyoming. Both are now based in Erie, Colo.\n\nThe relocation comes as a result of a measure signed by Gov. John Hickenlooper in March that limits ammunition-magazine capacity to 15 rounds. Magpul is among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against the law.\n\nPrior to the signing, Magpul officials told state officials that the company contributes more than $85 million annually to Colorado\u2019s economy. The company employs 200 people and supports another 400 supply-chain jobs.\n\nA year ago, the rapidly expanding firm was preparing to build a state-of-the-art facility in Broomfield, but pivoted after the gun-control bills gained steam. Magpul was founded in 1999 by CEO Richard Fitzpatrick in the basement of his home in Longmont, Colo.\n\nThe company plans to keep a small presence in Colorado in order to continue to fight the ammunition-magazine law.\n\n\u201c2013 began with Magpul planning expansion in Colorado, now 2014 begins with the announcement that Magpul will move 92 percent of its operation to Wyoming and Texas,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Greg Brophy in a statement.\n\nSo far no Democratic lawmakers, including Mr. Hickenlooper, have commented publicly on Magpul\u2019s decision to leave Colorado, although several Democrats have said that job growth is their top priority for 2014.\n\nHouse Speaker Mark Ferrandino said at a press briefing Friday that he would not support a Republican-led effort to repeal the magazine law, adding he did not want to \u201crehash the same fights we had last year,\u201d according to the Denver Post.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Bill Cadman noted Friday that the three gun-control bills approved and signed in March were passed by the state legislature with no Republican votes.\n\n\u201cDemocrats got what they wished for yesterday when Magpul Industries announced it would be leaving Colorado and taking over 200 jobs with them,\u201d said Mr. Cadman in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that Democrats willingly chased a quality business like Magpul Industries out of Colorado for no reason other than petty politics. It\u2019s even more unfortunate for the over 200 Coloradans who will be losing their jobs and falling behind on their bills as a direct result of irresponsible legislation from Democrats in Denver.\u201d\n\nThe issue has already become fodder for this year\u2019s gubernatorial race. Mr. Brophy and former Rep. Tom Tancredo, who are seeking the Republican nomination, blasted Mr. Hickenlooper for pushing Magpul out the door.\n\n\u201cThis announcement is a stark reminder of the damage that this governor has done, and continues to do, to Colorado,\u201d said Mr. Tancredo in a statement. \u201cHickenlooper gladly signed anti-gun legislation, with full knowledge that his actions would alienate and demonize law-abiding citizens, and job-creating businesses such as Magpul.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats came under heavy criticism Friday for driving Magpul Industries out of Colorado by pushing an aggressive gun-control agenda, a move that could cost the state more than $80 million annually.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Democrats came under heavy criticism Friday for driving Magpul Industries out of Colorado by pushing an aggressive gun-control agenda, a move that could cost the state more than $80 million annually.", "title": "Colo.
