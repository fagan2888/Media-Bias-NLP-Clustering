The foul underbelly of medical history exposed here makes it the gritty antecedent to \u201cER\u201d; the brilliant but flawed man of science at its core is the even more perverse screen ancestor to \u201cHouse.\u201d\n\nOverall, \u201cThe Knick\u201d is more akin to \u201cDeadwood\u201d than to \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d\n\nSurgeons arrive at the Knickerbocker Hospital by horse-drawn carriage, track dirt and manure into surgery, pause to wash their hands or dip a beard into disinfectant, then work, without gloves, on patients in a theater full of collegial onlookers.\n\nSoderbergh (\u201cTraffic,\u201d \u201cOceans Eleven\u201d) opens our eyes to a realistic view of blood and innards from a time when syphilis was rampant and corruption was the norm.\n\nStarring Clive Owen (\u201cCloser,\u201d \u201cHemingway & Gellhorn\u201d) as the genius, drug-addicted surgeon John Thackery, \u201cThe Knick\u201d is as much a tour of antique surgical equipment and early medical knowledge as it is an upstairs/downstairs view of American society at the time, with special attention to the common racist attitudes of the day.\n\nWhen an educated, refined black surgeon who studied in Paris and was treated as an equal in European medical circles, arrives at The Knickerbocker, he is denigrated by the exclusively white physicians on staff. Only when forced to hire Dr. Algernon Edwards (played by Andre Holland), in exchange for installing electricity in the hospital, do the doctors comply. Barely.\n\n\u201cI am certainly not interested in an integrated hospital staff,\u201d Thackery (Owen) declares.\n\nWe begin in the thick of it: following Thackery from his regular overnight stay in a Chinese whorehouse to his morning regimen of shooting cocaine between his toes and briskly onward to a bloody surgery.\n\nTo Thackery, \u201cthe astounding modern world in which we live is a time of endless possibility.\u201d It\u2019s also a time of blackmail for the health inspector, widespread fear of immigrants who are accused of spreading disease, a scheming, thieving ambulance driver, second-class citizenship for women, back-alley abortions, and stiff competition, as it were, among hospitals seeking cadavers for surgical experiments.\n\nThackery\u2019s mentor, Dr. J.M. Christiansen (a fun turn by Matt Frewer), lured him to The Knick with a promise of legitimizing surgery, bringing it \u201cout of the barbershop\u201d and into a proper hospital. Now the realities of dragging medical care out of the superstitious past and into the antiseptic future seem overwhelming.\n\nSoderbergh\u2019s use of electronic music is a jarring anachronistic touch; this is a modern take on the period, after all. But the careening moods sometimes feel forced, as if we\u2019re meant to experience Thackery\u2019s feverish state along with him.\n\nOwen is riveting, whether pouring sweat or delivering glib pronouncements. Frewer is a comic distraction, and Juliet Rylance is initially rather wooden as the daughter of the hospital owner and an emerging force on the board of directors. She takes time to warm up, but the rest of the colorful supporting characters are more credible.\n\nOverall, \u201cThe Knick\u201d is a sublimely addictive ride for which viewers will want to scrub up.\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u201cThe Knick\u201d star Clive Owens makes surgical rounds", "title": "\u201cThe Knick\u201d star Clive Owens makes surgical rounds", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/06/the-knick-star-clive-owens-makes-surgical-rounds/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140806__20140808_C4_AE08TVOSTROWp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140806__20140808_C4_AE08TVOSTROWp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-06T17:15:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:06:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2b8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI am certainly not interested in an integrated hospital staff,\u201d Thackery (Owen) declares.\nOverall, \u201cThe Knick\u201d is a sublimely addictive ride for which viewers will want to scrub up.\nSoderbergh\u2019s use of electronic music is a jarring anachronistic touch; this is a modern take on the period, after all.\nNow the realities of dragging medical care out of the superstitious past and into the antiseptic future seem overwhelming.\nShe takes time to warm up, but the rest of the colorful supporting characters are more credible."}
