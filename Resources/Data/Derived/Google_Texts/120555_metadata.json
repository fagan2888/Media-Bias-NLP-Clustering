But that didn\u2019t stop local businesses from throwing parking-lot parties before the big Luke Bryan/Florida Georgia Line country music concert.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly what I need,\u201d said Cody Schletty, 23, of Dodge Center, in the parking lot of ValU Liquors, a chip shot from the stadium. \u201cI was banking on having some drinks and a good time.\u201d\n\nSchletty, a pipeline operator in a stars-and-stripes straw cowboy hat, was standing with his three buddies next to a win-this, orange Ram 1500 pickup truck, which was part of the parking lot party.\n\nHe was amped to see Florida Georgia Line, the duo that has made a splash with \u201cCruise,\u201d \u201cThis Is How We Roll\u201d and \u201cDirt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big FGL fan,\u201d Schletty said. \u201cThey get drunk on stage. They have fun. They\u2019re a riot.\u201d\n\nBut plenty of the 45,000 fans at the five-act marathon had Luke Bryan on their bucket list. He\u2019s the king of bro-country music, the style that peppers its songs with lyrics about trucks, beer, babes, tailgating, dirt roads and any kind of partying. His hits include \u201cCrash My Party,\u201d \u201cWe Rode In Trucks\u201d and \u201cDrunk on You.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to see Luke Bryan,\u201d said Jacob Smith, 10, of Brainerd, Minn.\n\n\u201cI really like his music,\u201d explained his sister, Emily, 13.\n\nThis is their first concert, noted their father, Jared Smith, 37.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re Luke Bryan fans. I\u2019m spending time with my kids,\u201d said Smith, a health care supervisor, as they waited to enter the stadium.\n\nHe\u2019s had experience in going to concerts because of loved ones; he mentioned going to New Kids on the Block with his then-wife. His own tastes have taken him to shows by Neil Diamond, Dixie Chicks, Martina McBride and Nickelback.\n\nBryan has a special meaning to Stephanie Lesniak and E.J. Wirtz \u2014 it was their first date. Saturday was their fourth time seeing the country superstar together.\n\nThey\u2019re wondering if Bryan might be available to be their wedding band on Aug. 8 at the Grand View Lodge near Nisswa. \u201cI wish,\u201d said Wirtz, 27, a survey technician from Oak Grove.\n\nLesniak, 26, a 2011 University of Minnesota graduate, is used to going to TCF Bank Stadium for football games.\n\n\u201cI love the stadium,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she was excited to be seeing the first country concert in the venue that has been the site of huge rock concerts by the Rolling Stones, U2 and Imagine Dragons.\n\nShe figured Stub & Herb\u2019s, the long-standing U bar near the stadium, was the place for a little pregame, um, preconcert lubrication.\n\n\u201cWe came here \u2019cause I know they have a variety of beers,\u201d said Lesniak, a distribution coordinator.\n\nBut she ended up in a parking-lot party, getting her fair skin scorched in the sun. Like many of the young women going to the concert, she was sporting cowgirl boots, short shorts and a tank top. Cowgirl hats were plentiful but guys were definitely favoring ball caps \u2014 just like Luke Bryan.\n\nAt the parking-lot parties and outside the stadium, whether wearing a ball cap, Twins T-shirt or sundress, fans were singing a common refrain: \u201cWhere\u2019s the beer at?\u201d\n\nGee, it sounds like it should be the punchline of a Bryan song.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "There was no tailgating allowed in the parking lots near TCF Bank Stadium on Saturday.
