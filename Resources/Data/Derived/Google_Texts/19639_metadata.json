Pop was there (Berlin) and did that (co-writing and recording his best albums, \"The Idiot\" and \"Lust for Life,\" with Bowie).\n\nThe nine-track \"Post Pop Depression,\" his 17th solo studio album, also has some of Pop's best lyrics. \"Chocolate Drops\" has unique insights about being in the pits: \"When your love of life is an empty beach, don't cry, when your enemy has you in his reach, don't die.\" On \"American Valhalla,\" Pop tackles mortality \u2014 \"I have no plans, I have no debts ... I've nothing but my name\" \u2014 and sees a chance that his life's work will get him in.\n\nClosing track \"Paraguay\" starts idyllically, with intentions of living in \"a compound under the trees, with servants and bodyguards who love me,\" but ends as ornery as Clint Eastwood in \"Gran Torino,\" letting you know exactly how he feels about you and your \"evil and poisonous intentions.\"\n\nIn the end, if this is really his last album, Pop goes out on top and just like he came in all those years ago \u2014 ranting, raving, misbehaving and throwing it back in our faces with a cantankerous grin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Review: Iggy Pop's 'Post Pop Depression' rocks and shocks - AP News: Iggy Pop, \"Post Pop Depression\" (Loma Vista/Concord)Iggy Pop rocks and .05/27/2016 5:58:35AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Iggy Pop, \"Post Pop Depression\" (Loma Vista/Concord)Iggy Pop rocks and shocks on \"Post Pop Depression,\"", "title": "AP News - Review: Iggy Pop's 'Post Pop Depression' rocks and shocks", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/health/2016/03/18/review-iggy-pops-post-pop-depression-rocks-and-shocks-n2135896", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\78\\48c92ae4-40c0-4257-939e-187acafefe06.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Iggy Pop, \"Post Pop Depression\" (Loma Vista/Concord)Iggy Pop rocks and shocks on \"Post Pop Depression,\"", "title": "AP News - Review: Iggy Pop's 'Post Pop Depression' rocks and shocks", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/health/2016/03/18/review-iggy-pops-post-pop-depression-rocks-and-shocks-n2135896", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/78/48c92ae4-40c0-4257-939e-187acafefe06.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Review: Iggy Pop's 'Post Pop Depression' rocks and shocks, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Iggy Pop, \"Post Pop Depression\" (Loma Vista/Concord)Iggy Pop rocks and shocks on \"Post Pop Depression,\" evoking his 1977 peak achieved with David Bowie but enhanced by all he's gone through since.\nThe nine-track \"Post Pop Depression,\" his 17th solo studio album, also has some of Pop's best lyrics.\nPop was there (Berlin) and did that (co-writing and recording his best albums, \"The Idiot\" and \"Lust for Life,\" with Bowie).\nIn the end, if this is really his last album, Pop goes out on top and just like he came in all those years ago \u2014 ranting, raving, misbehaving and throwing it back in our faces with a cantankerous grin.\nOn \"American Valhalla,\" Pop tackles mortality \u2014 \"I have no plans, I have no debts ..."}
