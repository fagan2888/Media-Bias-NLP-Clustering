Below are some of the highlights from separate interviews with the candidates.\n\nThe 4th District includes 12 counties: Butte, Colusa, Del Norte, Glenn, and parts of Nevada, Placer, Shasta, Siskiyou, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity and Yuba.\n\nCJ Jawahar\n\nA software engineer/educator from Roseville, Jawahar, said he is running for 4th District State Senate because \"community organizing is my passion.\"\n\nHe has worked in community youth programs, a police forum, helped with anti-bullying efforts and spent five years teaching computer science at a community college.\n\nIn 2011 he joined the transportation commission for the city of Roseville, including service as chairman.\n\nHe is a proponent of high-speed rail as a way to connect people quickly from city-to-city. With better transportation, high-tech companies could relocate more readily to Northern California, he said.\n\nAs for the budget, the candidate said he believes when the state is doing well, debt should be paid back rather than passed along to the next generation.\n\nOn the Bay Delta Conservation Program, Jawahar said he is against the twin tunnels. Building storage, including Sites Reservoir and groundwater storage, can better capture water in wet years, he said.\n\nHe's also opposed to the tunnels because it would eliminate farm land, he said.\n\nJawahar's grandfather in India was a farmer, and \"at the end of the day we need food on the table.\"\n\nOn the topic of prison realignment, Jawahar said the state cannot continue \"spending a pot of money on the prison system,\" but needs to focus at the root cause of crime.\n\nJawahar said education is where he would focus the state's recent budget increase.\n\nMore specifically, teaching at a community college showed him how difficult it is for students to save money for tuition, which he would like to see lowered or eliminated at the community college level.\n\nWhen asked about hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, for oil and gas extraction, Jawahar said the technology is not a fit for California. The practice uses too much water and water is at a deficit, he said.\n\nIf it was just water, it would be one thing, but when mixed with chemicals the water cannot be reused, he said.\n\nAs for marijuana laws, Jawahar said the state needs to move forward, and look to changes in Colorado and Washington to \"learn lesson.\"\n\nJim Nielsen\n\nNielsen said his highest concern is \"assisting the citizens of the 4th Senate District.\"\n\nMost of the workload of his staff is to \"go to bat with citizens dealing with issues\" particularly \"heavy-handed\" government agencies such as the Department of Labor, Fish and Wildlife, the Employment Development Department and others.\n\n\"We have a policy that almost every contact gets some kind of attention or response.\"\n\nWhen asked, Nielsen said he is most proud of is work for a crime victims bill of rights in the 1980s and continued efforts to ensure \"someone who does something wrong has to face consequences.\"\n\nHe said the recent prison realignment program results in \"destruction of justice.\"\n\nHe said he understands how the justice system works, and how the correction works, and strives for the protection of public safety.\n\nOn water issues, Nielsen said he is opposed to the state \"usurping local control of groundwater,\" the use of which he said is a private property right.\n\nHe said one of his \"greatest accomplishments is area of origin language for the 2009 Water Plan,\" which he was able to have written into the law.\n\nThe highest priority for water is humans, which includes agriculture, Nielsen said. \"If we deny farmers the ability to produce agricultural commodities and milk, then you are compromising human rights to survive.\"\n\nAnother important issue is health care, and Nielsen is a member of the state health committee.\n\nThe \"future of medicine must ensure the doctor/patient relationship,\" Nielsen said. The result of Obamacare will be rationed care, he said, \"more expensive care and diminished care.\"\n\nNielsen also opposes tax increases, supports smaller government and wants to improve the business climate.\n\nHe has authored legislation to reform the state welfare system and is currently working to limit the government's ability to seize private property through eminent domain.\n\nNielsen, who lives in Gerber, was a state senator from 1978-1987 and served on the state Board of Parole and Prison Terms from 1990-2007. From 2008-2012 he was a state assemblyman, and in January 2013, he became a state senator.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 4th District State Senate race has software engineer and educator CJ Jawahar versus Jim Nielsen, who has a long history in state politics.", "title": "Jawahar, Nielsen vie for 4th District State Senate", "og": {"url": "http://www.chicoer.com/article/ZZ/20140524/NEWS/140529478", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.chicoer.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/chicoer.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Jawahar, Nielsen vie for 4th District State Senate"}, "twitter": {"domain": "chicoer.com", "description": "The 4th District State Senate race has software engineer and educator CJ Jawahar versus Jim Nielsen, who has a long history in state politics.", "title": "Jawahar, Nielsen vie for 4th District State Senate", "url": "http://www.chicoer.com/article/ZZ/20140524/NEWS/140529478", "image": {"src": "http://local.chicoer.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/chicoer.png?052016"}, "site": "@chicoer", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id509310750?mt=8", "iphone": "id499663248?mt=8", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.chicoenterpriserecord"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "News, Chico news, CA news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Chico news, CA news, US news, world news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb09b\"", "article_summary": "The 4th District State Senate race has software engineer and educator CJ Jawahar versus Jim Nielsen, who has a long history in state politics.\nCJ JawaharA software engineer/educator from Roseville, Jawahar, said he is running for 4th District State Senate because \"community organizing is my passion.\"\nJim NielsenNielsen said his highest concern is \"assisting the citizens of the 4th Senate District.\"\nThe 4th District includes 12 counties: Butte, Colusa, Del Norte, Glenn, and parts of Nevada, Placer, Shasta, Siskiyou, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity and Yuba.\nNielsen, who lives in Gerber, was a state senator from 1978-1987 and served on the state Board of Parole and Prison Terms from 1990-2007."}
