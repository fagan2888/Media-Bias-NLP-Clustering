Criminal justice reform is an issue that impacts all Americans, no matter which part of the country they live in.\n\n>>> After 15 Years in Prison, One Drug Offender\u2019s Search for Meaning\n\nThe RNC\u2019s official position supporting prison reform was one of 10 resolutions announced to committee members today during the national GOP organization\u2019s spring meeting in Hollywood, Fla.\n\nOther resolutions include one calling for sanctions against Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and another asking the Senate to wait until after the presidential election to consider a nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat.\n\nEach resolution is voted on by nine committee members, including RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.\n\nCriminal justice reform is thought to be one of the few areas where Congress and President Barack Obama can work together to enact a substantive law during a contentious election year.\n\n>>> Conservatives Make Their Case for Criminal Justice Reform\n\nBoth the Republican-led House and Senate judiciary committees have advanced legislation that would shorten prison sentences for low-level nonviolent drug offenders and allow well-behaved inmates to earn time off their prison terms.\n\nBut on the Senate side, some conservatives have argued that the Judiciary Committee\u2019s proposal would allow violent felons the chance to be released from prison early.\n\nThe bill\u2019s authors, including Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Mike Lee, R-Utah, have fought that characterization. They recently made revisions to the legislation to satisfy critics.\n\nMark Holden, a top lawyer at Koch Industries, one of the biggest proponents of criminal justice reform on the conservative side, says he hopes the Republican National Committee\u2019s resolution pushes skeptical conservatives in Congress to support the effort.\n\n\u201cThe RNC position makes it clear that Republicans can and should continue to lead on this critically important issue as they have for the past several years,\u201d Holden told The Daily Signal in an emailed statement, adding:\n\nHopefully, Republicans in the Senate and the House will follow the lead of Senators Grassley, Cornyn, Lee, Speaker [Paul] Ryan, Chairman [Bob] Goodlatte, and others, and pass comprehensive criminal justice reform at the federal level this year. The federal legislation is based on the same reforms that have worked so well in the states to reduce crime rates and safely reduce incarceration rates.\n\n>>> After Obama Grants Clemency, a Federal Prisoner Rebuilds His Life\n\nIn its resolution, the RNC notes that the federal prison population, over which Congress has jurisdiction, increased 734 percent from 1980 to 2015, while taxpayer dollar spending on the prison system spiked 595 percent in that same period.\n\nThe resolution states that taxpayers \u201care not receiving the public safety return they deserve because lengthy prison terms increase recidivism rates for low-level offenders.\u201d\n\nIn addition to supporting treatment options for drug addicts, and other policies to reduce the number of re-offenders, the RNC calls for \u201cmens rea\u201d reform. That would require prosecutors to prove that certain criminal suspects knowingly intended to break the law.\n\n>>> How Overcrowding Forced Alabama to Confront Its Prison Problem", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThis is the Republican Party coming together and saying criminal justice reform is an issue that needs to be addressed,\" an RNC spokesman says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cThis is the Republican Party coming together and saying criminal justice reform is an issue that needs to be addressed,\" an RNC spokesman says.", "title": "Republican Leaders Put Weight Behind Prison Reform", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/CJReformRNC.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-22T18:46:05+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1VNmcMk"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cThis is the Republican Party coming together and saying criminal justice reform is an issue that needs to be addressed,\" an RNC spokesman says.", "title": "Republican Leaders Put Weight Behind Prison Reform", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/CJReformRNC.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "crime", "published_time": "2016-04-22T18:07:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T18:46:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "criminal justice reform, prison reform, RNC, Republican National Committee, prison population, sentencing, drug offenses, Reince Priebus"}, "article_summary": "Criminal justice reform is an issue that impacts all Americans, no matter which part of the country they live in.\nCriminal justice reform is thought to be one of the few areas where Congress and President Barack Obama can work together to enact a substantive law during a contentious election year.\nThe Republican National Committee today adopted a resolution in support of reforming the nation\u2019s criminal justice laws, in a significant sign of bipartisan consensus to undo mass incarceration in America.\nMark Holden, a top lawyer at Koch Industries, one of the biggest proponents of criminal justice reform on the conservative side, says he hopes the Republican National Committee\u2019s resolution pushes skeptical conservatives in Congress to support the effort.\n>>> Conservatives Make Their Case for Criminal Justice ReformBoth the Republican-led House and Senate judiciary committees have advanced legislation that would shorten prison sentences for low-level nonviolent drug offenders and allow well-behaved inmates to earn time off their prison terms."}
