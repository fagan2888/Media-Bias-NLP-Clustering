The decision in North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade Commission isn\u2019t a victory for economic liberty, and it won\u2019t do much to reduce corruption and rein in abusive regulations.\n\nWhat it will do is undermine federalism and state sovereignty, disrupt the state\u2019s ability to protect its citizens, and weaken the democratic process by putting more distance between voters and bureaucrats who make policy decisions about everyone\u2019s health and well-being.\n\nStates Have Immunity from Antitrust Laws Since Parker v. Brown in 1943, certain forms of state action have been protected from antitrust liability because, out respect for federalism, the court recognized that states have the right and duty to pass laws with anticompetitive results for the public\u2019s welfare. Unlike a private entity, each state can decide how commerce is regulated and how those regulations should be enforced.\n\nIn the 1950s only 5 percent of professions were licensed by the state; that has shot up to nearly 30 percent today, including florists and African hair braiders. A common example is the medical profession. Only doctors can practice medicine because letting anyone hand out prescriptions or perform surgery is a threat to public safety. An individual, therefore, must be licensed by the state to practice medicine. Anyone who isn\u2019t licensed can\u2019t go crying to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that he\u2019s being unfairly shut out from the market. That\u2019s because the state is acting within its power as a sovereign entity to police the medical profession.\n\nThis is true for many professions\u2014too many, actually (in the 1950s only 5 percent of professions were licensed by the state; that has shot up to nearly 30 percent today, including florists and African hair braiders). While people across the political spectrum agree our country needs serious occupational licensing and regulatory reform, this is not what\u2019s at issue in the dental board case. Despite the Supreme Court ruling, states will still pass anticompetitive laws and impose needless regulations on the public.\n\nAre State Boards Part of Government? The question in this case is, are state boards with active market participants (practicing dentists) the same as the state itself and free to enjoy immunity without active supervision by the state, or are they more like a private entity that requires more oversight? Until now, professional licensing boards have received immunity as long as they abide by clearly articulated anticompetitive statutes. The courts have not required active supervision.\n\nUntil now, professional licensing boards have received immunity as long as they abide by clearly articulated anticompetitive statutes. They haven\u2019t needed active state supervision because their actions are the \u201cstate\u2019s own.\u201d They were created by the state, and they enforce regulations according to state policy. They are not like private entities (e.g., trade associations) that have to receive active state supervision to make sure they\u2019re complying with statutes and not abusing their authority.\n\nIn this case, the court affirmed the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision that state boards with active market participants should be treated like a private entity. They must, therefore, meet the two-test requirement for immunity that is given to private entities: a clearly articulated anticompetitive statute and active supervision by the state. Professional licensing boards\u2014boards with certified public accountants, lawyers, dentists, doctors\u2014are now considered \u201cquasi-government\u201d bodies that need another layer of bureaucracy to keep them politically accountable.\n\nWhile this might not seem like a big deal, it has sweeping implications regarding federal intrusion into state governance and public safety.\n\nIt All Started With Teeth Whitening Before we get to that, let\u2019s look at how we got here. Some non-dentists in North Carolina were offering teeth-whitening services at much cheaper rates than those dentists charged. The dentists complained to the NC Dental Board, which is composed mostly of dentists, that non-dentists shouldn\u2019t whiten teeth because it is a dental procedure. The board, which the state legislature has vested with the \u201cfull power and authority to enact rules and regulations governing the practice of dentistry within the State,\u201d agreed.\n\nThe board sent cease-and-desist letters to non-dentists who were offering teeth whitening services. After all, dentistry, by NC statute, includes removing \u201cstains, accretions or deposits from the human teeth.\u201d The statute isn\u2019t clear whether this applies to all teeth-whitening procedures, but this is how the board interpreted the law. As a result, the board sent cease-and-desist letters to non-dentists who were offering teeth whitening services.\n\nEnter the FTC. When the FTC found out about the threatening letters, it investigated and brought a complaint against the board for unlawful restraint of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and unfair competition under the FTC Act. The complaint said the \u201cactions of the Dental Board prevent and deter non-dentists from providing or expanding teeth whitening services, increase prices and reduce consumer choice without any legitimate justification or defense, including \u2018state action\u2019 defense.\u201d\n\nThe NC Dental Board filed to dismiss, claiming its conduct complied with clearly articulated anticompetitive statutes and was protected by state antitrust immunity. The FTC responded by saying the board, which is controlled by market participants and not public officials, didn\u2019t qualify for immunity because it hadn\u2019t received \u201cactive supervision\u201d by the state when it decided to send out the cease-and-desist letters.\n\nThe board disagreed, saying that because it was a state agency, empowered by the state and acting as the \u201cstate\u2019s own,\u201d it didn\u2019t require state supervision. The Fourth Circuit didn\u2019t see it that way and denied the board\u2019s petition for review of the FTC\u2019s order. In a 6-to-3 decision, the Supreme Court affirmed the Fourth Circuit, holding that the dental board is not immune from antitrust laws.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s Licensing Decision Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the opinion for the court, said, \u201cWhile the Sherman Act confers immunity on the States\u2019 own anticompetitive policies out of respect for federalism, it does not always confer immunity where, as here, a State delegates control over a market to a non-sovereign actor. State agencies are not simply by their governmental character sovereign actors for purposes of state-action immunity.\u201d He then referenced Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar: \u201cThe fact that the State Bar is a state agency for some limited purposes does not create an antitrust shield that allows it to foster anticompetitive practices for the benefit of its members.\u201d\n\nState agencies can\u2019t just engage in anticompetitive activities carte blanche. They have to be compelled by state policy. The court\u2019s reference to Goldfarb is problematic because it doesn\u2019t apply in this case. The issue in Goldfarb was that the state agency did not have a clearly articulated anticompetitive policy. State agencies can\u2019t just engage in anticompetitive activities carte blanche. They have to be compelled by state policy. That wasn\u2019t happening in the Goldfarb case. This was a point made by Hashim Mooppan who spoke on behalf of the dental board in oral arguments. \u201cThe question in this case, unlike in Goldfarb, is whether a board that has public\u2014that has market participants on it\u2014is entitled to immunity even when enforcing a clearly articulated policy of displaced competition.\u201d\n\nJustice Samuel Alito said the board is entitled to immunity, and the court, by concluding otherwise, will spawn confusion. Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas agreed and joined Alito\u2019s dissent. \u201cWhen the States first created medical and dental boards, well before the Sherman Act was enacted, they began to staff them in this way,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cUnder Parker, the Sherman Act (and the Federal Trade Commission Act) do not apply to state agencies; the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners is a state agency; and that is the end of the matter.\u201d\n\nRulings in the Fifth and Ninth Circuits support Alito\u2019s view. In Earles v. State Board of Certified Public Accountants of Louisiana (1998), the Fifth Circuit recognized that the State Board of CPAs, which was \u201ccomposed entirely of CPAs who compete in the profession they regulate\u201d and who were chosen by their peers, did not require \u201cactive supervision.\u201d In Hass v. Oregon State Bar (1989), the Ninth Circuit found that the board did not require supervision because \u201cthose members of the public who are interested parties, the members of the Oregon State Bar, do have the ability to \u2018check\u2019 the actions of the Board by the electoral process.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to ignore these rulings and treat state agencies as nonsovereign entities that require more oversight by even more bureaucrats will create practical problems and have \u201cfar-reaching effects on the States\u2019 regulation of professions,\u201d Alito wrote.\n\nUnqualified Public Officials Will Replace Experts Practitioners have always staffed licensing boards, so this is nothing new. There\u2019s an obvious reason for this. The best people to regulate technical professions are the people in those professions. \u201cStaffing the State Board of Dental Examiners with certified public accountants would certainly lessen the risk of actions that place the well-being of dentists over those of the public,\u201d Alito wrote, \u201cbut this would also compromise the State\u2019s interest in sensibly regulating a technical profession in which lay people have little expertise.\u201d\n\nCan someone withdraw from his profession for a short time to serve on a board? What is the scope of the market in which a board member may not participate? As a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, states will most likely need to change the composition of their boards to avoid litigation. There are also questions about who is an actual market participant. Can someone withdraw from his profession for a short time to serve on a board? What is the scope of the market in which a board member may not participate? These are the questions Alito asks, and no doubt they will be questions states ask as they try to avoid litigation.\n\nIn addition, it might prove difficult for states to find practitioners who will serve on boards because they\u2019ll be afraid of lawsuits. Who will want to take time out of their private lives to serve on a board with the FTC breathing down their necks?\n\nInstead of states being primarily concerned about protecting the public through licensing and regulations (as broken as that system is), they will be more concerned about avoiding costly antitrust litigation.\n\nSome might think this is a good thing. The fewer regulations, the better. The less licensing, the more freedom for people to break into the marketplace. While regulatory reform is necessary, this is the wrong way to go about it. That\u2019s because while bad regulations come out of these boards, good regulations do, too. Wouldn\u2019t it be better for a board to license healthcare professionals who are qualified instead of licensing people who aren\u2019t simply because the board is afraid the FTC will bring an antitrust lawsuit against it? By inserting itself into the regulatory process in this way, the FTC will influence decisions that should be left solely to states.\n\nUndermining State Sovereignty The NC Dental Board must now comply with strict FTC orders. If the board exercises its authority to regulate dentistry in any way that violates the FTC\u2019s order, it will face civil penalties of up to $10,000 for each violation. As stated in an amicus brief, \u201cThis is precisely the kind of interference with decisions of legislatively-created state regulatory agencies that this Court has held to be outside the purview of the federal antitrust laws in a system of dual sovereignty.\u201d Parker v. Brown was very clear that antitrust laws do not \u201crestrain a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature.\u201d\n\nIf a federal agency with no connection to a particular profession can invalidate regulatory and licensing decisions, that agency becomes the final authority on matters of public health and safety. If a federal agency with no connection to a particular profession can invalidate regulatory and licensing decisions, that agency becomes the final authority on matters of public health and safety. No longer is the state responsible for the welfare of its citizens. The federal government is.\n\nThis is a dangerous precedent. If the federal government basically becomes the final authority in licensing professions\u2014albeit indirectly\u2014then the federal government, not 50 different states, will decide who can be doctors. In light Obamacare causing individuals to lose the freedom to pick their own doctor and get the healthcare they want, the next step of having the federal government decide who can and cannot practice medicine is a profound loss of liberty for the American people.\n\nUntil now, the democratic process checked state boards, as imperfect as it is. If they did something wrong or if the state passed intolerable anticompetitive laws, voters could deal with it at the ballot box or in the state courts. The state legislature and agencies would get the message and make appropriate changes. However, if boards make decisions based on what the FTC wants and not on what is best for the public, elections won\u2019t matter. State actors will answer to bureaucrats and federal agencies, not the people of the state.\n\nFederal agencies will also promote uniform standards across all states, chilling diversity and making it difficult for each state to do what\u2019s best for its citizens. Regulations that work for California might not be appropriate for West Virginia or Texas. States need to be free to do what\u2019s best for their citizens specifically without being indirectly or directly forced to comply with the uniform standards of a centralized government.\n\nActive State Supervision This decision may also force states to be more involved in the affairs of each board, which will cost money and time. FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen recently said at the Heritage Foundation that people don\u2019t need to worry about excessive oversight of the boards. \u201cThe state\u2019s supervision need not entail day-to-day involvement in an agency\u2019s operations or micromanagement of its every decision,\u201d she said. \u201cRather the critical inquiry is whether the State\u2019s review mechanisms provide \u2018realistic assurance\u2019 that a nonsovereign actor\u2019s anticompetitive conduct \u2018promotes state policy, rather than merely the party\u2019s individual interests.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe need change more than ever, but it should be done through the political process\u2014as slow as that is\u2014and not by federal agencies strong-arming states through the courts. Ohlhausen said that while she understands the concerns of those who oppose the ruling, state boards have viable options for avoiding antitrust liability. \u201cThese options should not be terribly onerous to implement and should help states retain individuals with sufficient relevant expertise on their regulatory boards.\u201d Ohlhausen hopes that, at the very least, states will become \u201cmore cognizant of, and hopefully minimizing, the competitive effects of a board\u2019s regulatory decisions. That would go a long way toward eliminating any antitrust exposure.\u201d\n\nTo put it simply, Ohlhausen said, \u201cIf a board is not engaging in conduct that is a violation of the antitrust laws, it need not even address the issue of active supervision.\u201d\n\nBut the court said the reason these boards need active supervision is because they include market participants, not because corruption is necessarily happening. Regulatory capture, after all, is hard to prove. Ohlhausen\u2019s comment also sounds a lot like the response we get about the National Security Agency spying on innocent Americans. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. If you\u2019re not doing anything wrong, you don\u2019t need to worry!\u201d\n\nThis is the point. These boards, by their very nature, engage in anticompetitive activities. That\u2019s why they need immunity in the first place. Notice, Ohlhausen didn\u2019t say boards don\u2019t need to worry about litigation as long as they properly enforce the state\u2019s anticompetitive statutes, which is what they should be doing. Instead, she says boards don\u2019t need to worry as long as they don\u2019t violate any antitrust laws. This speaks volumes about the meddlesome and manipulative nature of federal involvement in state issues and its undermining of state sovereignty.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 07:31:33 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Even though it knocked a dental cartel, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent licensing decision is no victory for economic liberty.", "title": "Don\u2019t Rejoice At The Supreme Court\u2019s Licensing Decision", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutterstock_142427935.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-17T07:56:21+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/04/15/dont-rejoice-at-the-supreme-courts-dental-licensing-decision/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Even though it knocked a dental cartel, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent licensing decision is no victory for economic liberty.", "title": "Don\u2019t Rejoice At The Supreme Court\u2019s Licensing Decision", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutterstock_142427935.jpg"}, "creator": "@McAllisterDen", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Government", "tag": "Federal Trade Commission,licensing,N.C.
