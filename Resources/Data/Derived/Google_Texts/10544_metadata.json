The Kering group overall posted 2.724 billion euros in first-quarter sales, below expectations in a Reuters poll that predicted 2.767 billion euros. \"Kering's solid first-quarter 2016 performance in a challenging market environment is testimony to our focus on driving organic growth,\" Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, Kering's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said in a statement. \"We are confident that we can extend our growth trajectory over the full year thanks to our multi-brand model, our continued strict operating and financial discipline, and the top-quality work of all our teams.\" Kering is among the last of luxury groups to report first-quarter sales. Rivals Prada , LVMH , Richemont and Burberry have all said they were suffering from weaker demand since the start of the year. Analysts say that adding to their woes, their troubles also stem from consumers, particularly in the United States and Asia, increasingly suffering from mega-brand fatigue, preferring instead smaller, more up-and-coming and innovative brands.
