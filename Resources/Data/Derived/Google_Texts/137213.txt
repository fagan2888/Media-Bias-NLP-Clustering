CBS 2 Chicago reporter charged with DUI, battery

hello

Dave Savini, a WBBM-Channel 2 investigative reporter, has been charged with driving under the influence, endangering the life of a child and battery after an early morning accident Saturday in Naperville.

CBS 2 Chicago investigative reporter Dave Savini was arrested Saturday in Naperville and now faces misdemeanor charges including battery, driving under the influence of alcohol, and endangering the life of a child after he left the scene of a minor traffic accident, officials said.

Savini, who lives in Naperville, was arrested about 12:20 a.m. after a minor accident that took place in the parking lot of Taco Bell at 75th Street and Rickert Drive, Naperville police said.

The driver of the other vehicle told police that he wanted to report the collision to police, but Savini refused, Cmdr. Lou Cammiso said. The driver said Savini pushed him when he took a photograph of Savini's license plate with his phone, Cammiso said.

Naperville Police Sgt. Ken Gettemy said police identified Savini by his vehicle's license plate, and arrested him near the intersection of Saratoga and Plainfield Naperville roads.

Savini had two children under age 18 in the car, hence the endangering charge, Gettemy said. "I can't confirm whether or not either, or both, were his kids," he said.

Savini was released on $3,000 bond shortly after 4 a.m. on the charges, which include a misdemeanor hit-and-run charge, Gettemy said.

A message left for a Naperville number listed under Savini's name was not returned Saturday afternoon.

CBS 2 Chicago representatives declined to comment.

A native of Chicago, Savini started at CBS 2 Chicago in July 2004, according to information on the station's website. He was awarded a 2008 Alfred I. du Pont-Columbia University Award for his investigation exposing gaping holes in security at O'Hare International Airport, the website states.
