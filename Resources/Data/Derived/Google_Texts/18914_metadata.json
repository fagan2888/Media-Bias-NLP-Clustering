Rowling, Entertainment News\n\nThis article originally appeared on AlterNet\n\nJK Rowling is just like you, aspiring author. She wrote a great story, pushed it out to publishers despite initial rejection and got a series of movies and a theme park. Then she did it all over again under a different name (Robert Galbraith) and got a book deal on her crime novel The Cuckoo\u2019s Calling without her editor knowing she had those movies and that theme park. When it was revealed that Galbraith was actually the hugely successful author of the Harry Potter series, there was interest in the meaning of the male-gendered pseudonym from those who cared about such things.\n\nThis is a story of a woman\u2019s talent and persistence paying off despite the adversity of being a woman writer in a sea of successful men, right?\n\nNot exactly. Take a closer look at the tweet she sent today of publishers that rejected the proposal sent by \u201cMr. Robert Galbraith\u201d that has gone viral thanks to bibliophiles:\n\nBy popular request, 2 of @RGalbrath\u2018s rejection letters! (For inspiration, not revenge, so I\u2019ve removed signatures.) pic.twitter.com/vVoc0x6r8W \u2014 J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) March 25, 2016\n\nThere\u2019s nothing scathing in those letters, nothing saying, \u201cWell if you had a sales history of writing Harry Potter, maybe we\u2019d give you a shot.\u201d No editor said, \u201cSorry, Robert, but your writing is too feminine-sounding, and you know that just doesn\u2019t fly off the shelves in the airport bookstores.\u201d As far as rejection letters go, these are actually pretty tame and generic.\n\nIn fact, what no one seems to have picked up on yet is that the letter on the right is more of an announcement of a publishing company\u2019s being absorbed by a larger company and, as a result, being full up to its ears in quality proposals to publish. Sorry, every writer not already working with us, but we must have a blanket policy to seek new writers. Without naming any specifics about Rowling\u2019s submission, it\u2019s possible they may not have even read the proposal before rejecting it. That\u2019s nothing against the publisher, which is actually publishing some really cool books. This happens all the time at publishing houses and literary agencies, and has a long history. In fact, it is a credit to publisher Cr\u00e8me de la Crime that they had a template rejection and may not have read the proposal, for they may have recognized the talent and offered a book deal then and there.\n\nBut the larger issue here is that it\u2019s so hard for female and diverse voices to be heard in an industry that is a publisher\u2019s market. There are fewer publishers, and they have no motivation to shake their industry\u2019s long history of exclusivity and favoring of white male voices for their projected award winners or bestsellers.\n\nRowling/Galbraith\u2019s website addresses the sexism openly and without judgment:\n\nWhen I \u2018unmasked\u2019 myself to my editor David Shelley who had read and enjoyed The Cuckoo\u2019s Calling without realising I wrote it, one of the first things he said was \u2018I never would have thought a woman wrote that.\u2019 Apparently I had successfully channeled my inner bloke!\n\nFeminists may take offense at this. First she went from Joanne to JK. Now, she\u2019s Robert? Isn\u2019t this the age where readers won\u2019t put down a book when they see it was written by a woman? After all, this is why Mary Ann Evans took up the pen name George Eliot and Amantine-Lucile-Aurore Dupon went by George Sand! Today, a woman is the frontrunner in a presidential election, andGloria Steinem is in commercials for a most excellent late-night talk show host who is a woman (shout out to Samantha Bee!). Rowling should not be a Bronte sister! Aren\u2019t we beyond this, JK, asked outlets such as Bustle.\n\nBut the issue isn\u2019t just the perception of sexism in the tightly guarded gates of publishing houses. It is tied to that very same history that caused those women to publish with male pseudonyms, and even further back when slave memoirs were not given authority without front matter penned by white abolitionists (see: Frederick Douglass\u2019s memoir\u2019s preface by William Lloyd Garrison to disprove those who doubted a slave was capable of such a literary feat as hisNarrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass). Publishing has a bad history of not giving minority writers their due, and today\u2019s market is making it hard for publishers to act on promises to give more book deals to writers of color (see the We Need Diverse Books campaign for a look into that commendable intention). Publishers have rejected plenty of writers from the white male canon of conservative American English literature classes and the New York Times bestseller list alike: Stephen King, Ernest Hemingway, Herman Melville (\u201cFirst, we must ask, does it have to be a whale?\u201d). They are a hoot to read, and one of the biggest fears of any intern going through the slush pile to end up in an article of a triumphant EL James or Stephanie Meyers. Kindly, when Rowling tweeted the rejection letters to Galbraith, she covered up the names of the editors who signed them since her intention was \u201cinspiration, not revenge.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Harry Potter\" author calls them \"inspiration\" but for whom?
