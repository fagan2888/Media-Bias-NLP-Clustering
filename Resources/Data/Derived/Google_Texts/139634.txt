Nuggets guard Gary Harris played his first NBA game Friday, against the Pacers, scoring 13 points on 6-of-10 shooting in about 18:30 minutes in the Denver victory. After missing the first seven games of the season because of an injury, Harris got to put on a show in his home state (he’s from Fishers, about 20 miles northeast of Indianapolis), and his mom was in the stands to see it all.

Well, most of it anyway.

With about 10:20 to go in the fourth quarter, he drove to the bucket and completely posterized 6-foot-11 Ian Mahinmi. NBA cameras caught every angle, but his mother, Joy Harris, a former WNBA player for the Detroit Shock, didn’t catch one.

Thank goodness for YouTube.

Ok yes I missed the dunk live but I've watched the replay 100 times now. — Joy Harris (@jharris40) November 15, 2014
