Jurors are scheduled to hear testimony in the trial of an eastern Kansas man accused of killing four people, including an 18-month-old girl.

The Kansas City Star reports opening statements start Monday in the capital murder trial of 30-year-old Kyle Flack, who is charged with killing 31-year-old Kaylie Bailey and her infant daughter, Lana, on May 1, 2013.

He also is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the shotgun deaths of 30-year-old Andrew Stout and 31-year-old Steven White, who were killed days earlier.

The three adults were found at a farmhouse outside Ottawa, and the baby was found a week later inside a suitcase floating in a rural creek.

The trial in Franklin County District Court in Ottawa is expected to last several weeks.
