In one direction, the gleaming towers of the insurance industry, the aerospace firm United Technologies, and Republican-leaning suburbs and rural areas beyond; in the other, the immigrant neighbourhood of Frog Hollow, where glassy-eyed men loll on street corners, and other Democrat-leaning neighbourhoods.\n\nLess than a mile away in the basement of the state armoury, Democrat governor of Connecticut Dannel Malloy could be found answering questions about a Yale student undergoing tests for Ebola in a local hospital. The issue offered Malloy TV time to reinforce his crisis-leadership credentials, but it cost him the one thing he may need to win re-election next month: a campaign visit from President Barack Obama.\n\nIt\u2019s rare for anyone to need Obama nowadays. Languishing at 40% approval ratings, he\u2019s been virtually absent from the midterm election season. Yet there are a few places where he is needed, and one of them is here in the blue-collar heartlands of Connecticut, where Malloy is tied in the polls with the Republican challenger and former US ambassador to Dublin, Tom Foley.\n\nWas this postponement, as the White House said, because Obama needed time to craft a response to the unfolding health crisis with his cabinet or, as Republicans like to gossip, to shield Malloy from the president\u2019s unpopularity? If so, it would be a dramatic turnaround from 2010, when the president\u2019s visit to Bridgeport in the waning days of the campaign was credited with squeezing out a half-percentage point win over Foley.\n\nThe public is believed to be largely apathetic to the midterm elections on 4 November but their outcome could be crucial to the remaining years of the Obama administration \u2013 and to the US in a post-Obama era. Republicans stand a better than even chance of winning control of the Senate, and there are another dozen competitive governors\u2019 contests.\n\nFollowing a TV debate in New London on Thursday, Malloy \u2013 down by six percentage points as recently as two weeks ago \u2013 told the Observer that he had no misgivings about a visit from the president \u2013 to the contrary, in fact. \u201cThere\u2019s appreciation in Connecticut for his support of the middle class, support of education and housing, and acknowledgement that we implemented Obamacare better than any other state. All of those things I\u2019ve done with help from Washington \u2013 and I\u2019m happy to share that message with the president.\u201d\n\nStill, the president\u2019s travel docket includes visits to just five gubernatorial races \u2013 contests considered less sensitive to national political mood-swings \u2013 and only a single appearance, in Michigan, at a Senate or congressional race.\n\n\u201cWhether the president of the United States comes here or not is not going to make a lot of difference,\u201d considers Foley. \u201cPeople are going to vote on Malloy\u2019s record.\u201d\n\nA defeat for Malloy next month in this typically blue northeastern state would set a frightening precedent for Democrats in 2016. But shifting demographics suggest they stand a chance of winning in the so-called \u201cnew coalition\u201d of typically Republican states in the south-east. Conversely, if Republicans can\u2019t win in blue states now, with low voter turnout typical of midterm elections, when will they?\n\nNo surprise, then, that the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, are beating a path to Connecticut. So too are members of the Republican leadership, including governors Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Chris Christie of New Jersey.\n\nThe Malloy-Foley rematch stands out in its own right. It\u2019s an unusually bitter contest even by contemporary political standards, with candidates trading accusations of electoral fraud and tax dodging, political manipulation of state financial records, and with the parents of children killed in the Newtown shooting drawn into the debate over gun control. Then there\u2019s the issue of a luxury yacht named Odalisque that\u2019s become a symbol of the extreme divide between rich and poor in the state.\n\nRepublicans argue that Malloy\u2019s record is one of high taxation, stagnant economic growth and missed opportunities. In the wake of Newtown, they claim, gun owners have been punished by new restrictions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Barack Obama arrives for lunch with Connecticut governor Dan Malloy in March.

Foley says the state, once a leader in industry and education, is falling behind; Malloy claims 60,000 jobs have been created in his term. \u201cIf you think Tom Foley has a plan, you\u2019re probably foolish enough to vote for him,\u201d counters Malloy.\n\nIn public debates they\u2019ve jabbed and taunted each other. Foley raised the issue of a corruption investigation into $505,000 of building work on Malloy\u2019s holiday home. (The governor was exonerated.) Malloy raised the question of a night Foley spent in jail after a car crash in the Hamptons in 1981 (police dropped an assault charge) and contrasted Foley\u2019s record as a taxpayer with his evident wealth. \u201cI\u2019m talking about his record, about how poorly the economy is doing,\u201d Foley says. \u201cHe\u2019s a prosecutor, so it\u2019s in his personality, but his ads have been unfair.\u201d\n\nMalloy, who overcame dyslexia to become a successful Brooklyn prosecutor, portrays Foley, a private equity investor who was rewarded with a diplomatic post after serving on a President Bush-appointed board advising on the economic reconstruction of Iraq, as a tax-dodging, yacht-owning rich guy who axed thousands of jobs at the companies he managed and is out of touch with the common man.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re defending their constituencies in an evenly divided race,\u201d says Gary Rose, a scholar of Connecticut political history at Sacred Heart University. \u201cDemocrats are defending the cities and the minority vote, and the Republican challenger is depending on rural and suburban areas.\u201d\n\nIn Connecticut, with its rivers and coastline, boats count. Even Malloy has one \u2013 a 28ft powerboat he says hasn\u2019t been in the water in two years.\n\nBut Foley\u2019s 116ft yacht Odalisque, which flies the flag of the Marshall Islands and is moored in Palm Beach, Florida, provides an indelible image of what life must be like in the Gatsby-esque mansions of Greenwich. \u201cThe world must look different from a $5m yacht,\u201d announces one Malloy TV ad, as pictures of the vessel flash on the screen.\n\nCritics have asked why Foley, who owns two British fighter jets, paid no income tax between 2011 and 2013. Losses from other investments offset his income, Foley said. But that did not prevent Malloy from quipping in the debate: \u201cI don\u2019t own a $10m house, a $5m yacht, a $1m plane and not pay taxes.\u201d\n\nRose said: \u201cThe governor is waging class warfare by trying to mobilise animosity against this millionaire that\u2019s challenging him. It\u2019s distressing how low the bar is.\u201d\n\nStill, the question of wealth, or its distribution, cuts through Connecticut politics. Attitudes appear to be hardening. \u201cOur country was built on capitalism,\u201d commented an audience member at the TV debate. \u201cYou work for it, you earn it, and you should not be penalised. If you don\u2019t work, don\u2019t expect a handout.\u201d\n\nOn Hartford\u2019s Farmington Street, residents said they\u2019d noticed it, too. \u201cObama\u2019s delivered. He\u2019s kept his promises,\u201d said Lloyd Horton. \u201cBut the rich are still getting richer. The poor, poorer. So what do they expect? A revolt?\u201d\n\nWith less than three weeks to go, Obama will be back on the campaign trail, albeit on safe ground including his home state of Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Maine and Michigan. A rescheduled stop in Connecticut should help Malloy, who needs votes in Bridgeport, New Haven and Hartford to win. Perhaps, in his last round of campaigning, he\u2019ll be able to touch the electioneering highs he reached in his momentous campaign for the presidency in 2008.\n\n\u201cI am not on the ballot this fall,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cBut make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot \u2013 every single one of them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "The race for governor between Dan Molloy and Tom Foley has been dominated by jibes about tax avoidance and corruption, writes Edward Helmore", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Edward Helmore", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "The race for governor between Dan Molloy and Tom Foley has been dominated by jibes about tax avoidance and corruption, writes Edward Helmore", "title": "Barack Obama avoids bitter midterm battle exposing growing US wealth divide", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/18/obama-avoids-midterm-connecticut-governor-dan-malloy", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/18/1413645714278/A-homeless-man-walks-the--014.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=d6a7f3bbfebe29dd7e7882bfe1500e13", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2014/oct/18/obama-avoids-midterm-connecticut-governor-dan-malloy?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/18/obama-avoids-midterm-connecticut-governor-dan-malloy", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2014/oct/18/obama-avoids-midterm-connecticut-governor-dan-malloy?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/18/1413645714278/A-homeless-man-walks-the--014.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2014/oct/18/obama-avoids-midterm-connecticut-governor-dan-malloy?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US politics,US news,Obama administration,US economy,Economics,Business", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2014-10-18T19:54:34.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/edwardhelmore", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T21:42:01.000Z", "tag": "US politics,US news,Obama administration,US economy,Economics,Business"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/18/1413645714278/A-homeless-man-walks-the--014.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=47fe1b211ff9aa762a60258ba31258ef", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US politics,US news,Obama administration,US economy,Economics,Business"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd561\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe world must look different from a $5m yacht,\u201d announces one Malloy TV ad, as pictures of the vessel flash on the screen.\nFrom the gold cupola of the Connecticut state house one can sketch a picture of a divided America on the eve of the final elections of the Obama era.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Barack Obama arrives for lunch with Connecticut governor Dan Malloy in March.\nA rescheduled stop in Connecticut should help Malloy, who needs votes in Bridgeport, New Haven and Hartford to win.\nConversely, if Republicans can\u2019t win in blue states now, with low voter turnout typical of midterm elections, when will they?"}
