“This is something that we see with other legal industries/products, so it's not surprising that we're seeing it with the emerging marijuana industry,” said Mason Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project.

“So far our investments have been real estate centered, meaning that we work with licensed operators who need to expand their physical operations but are constrained in their ability to do so because traditional avenues of financing are closed to them," said Jake Schrader of Articulated Investors, a private pool of investor capital entirely focused on the legal cannabis industry. "We acquire real estate they have identified and then lease it back to them. We would not rule out a direct investment into a licensed business, but so far we have not come to terms with any of those who we were interested in.”

Shrader predicts that for the next few years there will be a state by state action and then potentially in the 2020 election cycle something happening at the federal level. He thinks California will be the next domino to fall to the recreational legalization trend.

Addressing that reality as a business opportunity is part of cultivating the sector responsibly. Douglas Leighton, another ArcView member and co-founder and principal partner of Boston-based Dutchess Capital, has focused the past two years on unique investment opportunities within the legalized cannabis sector.
