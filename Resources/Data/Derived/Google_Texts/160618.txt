But he questioned the faith of his 2016 pick: Donald Trump

Elko, Nevada (CNN) Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said he is a "big fan" of Jerry Falwell Jr., but questioned the faith of the evangelical leader's 2016 pick: Donald Trump.

Asked by reporters Tuesday in Elko, Nevada, if Bush believes that Trump is a Christian, the former Florida governor expressed some doubt.

"I don't know what he is. I just don't think he has the kind of relationship that he says he has if he can't explain it in any way that shows he's serious about it," Bush said.

"Accepting the fact that we make mistakes and seek forgiveness, that's one of the tenants of Christianity that everybody can agree on," he added. "We're all sinners. Some more than others."

Falwell, president of Liberty University -- the world's largest evangelical university -- said in a statement he's supporting the GOP front-runner because he is a "successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again."
