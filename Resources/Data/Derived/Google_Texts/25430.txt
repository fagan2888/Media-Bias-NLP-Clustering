Chronic diseases could cost the United States more than $42 trillion in medical care spending and losses in employment productivity over the next 15 years, according to a new white paper released today by the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease.

The study, which also looks at the spending burdens on individual states, finds that health care costs are concentrated on people with multiple of chronic diseases. The number of people with three or more chronic diseases will increase from 31 million to 83 million by 2030, the report says.

The group says the country’s health care system needs to prioritize the prevention and management of chronic diseases and needs to improve access to recommended care.

“This research quantifies what we face on our current path and demonstrates how healthy behaviors and better treatments can reduce that toll — potentially preventing 169 million cases of costly chronic disease and saving 16 million lives,” Ken Thorpe, the group’s chairman, said in a statement.
