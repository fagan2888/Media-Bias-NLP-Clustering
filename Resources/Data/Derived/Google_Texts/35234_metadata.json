DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said the U.S. should bar refugees from war-torn Syria because they are \"infiltrated\" with Muslim extremists who seek to harm America.\n\nThe comments come as Carson has taken an increasingly aggressive stance toward Muslims, and after rival Donald Trump pledged he would support deporting Syrian Muslims from the U.S.\n\n\"To bring into this country groups infiltrated with jihadists makes no sense,\" Carson told about 150 people at the Des Moines Rotary Club. \"Why would you do something like that?\"\n\nInstead, Carson recommended that the U.S. help settle Syrian refugees in the Middle East, in places such as Turkey. In Carson's view, the U.S. could assist financially but not open its doors. He did not explain how U.S. aid could be steered to innocent refugees without falling into the hands of the extremists he believes are among them.\n\n\n\nTo see more of Carson on the campaign trail, see the photos below:\n\n\n\nRepublican hopeful Carson says no to Syrian refugees in US Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson gestures while speaking during a town hall at Abundant Life Ministries in Jefferson, Iowa, Monday, Jan. 11, 2016.

Carson now finds himself among the top contenders in national Republican preference polls. Carson reported raising an impressive $20 million for his campaign in the third quarter of the year.\n\nCarson has also launched a petition challenging the tax exempt status of the largest Muslim advocacy group, part of an escalating rift with the U.S. Muslim community.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations last month called for Carson to quit the presidential race after he said a Muslim should not serve as president. He has since clarified his position, stating he wouldn't support a radical Muslim who did not support the Constitution. He says the same standard should apply to a Supreme Court justice.\n\nDespite anxiousness among some Republicans about the appearance of intolerance in a party trying to reach more minority voters, Carson's team has said his approach works to his advantage in segments of the GOP electorate, especially in Iowa.\n\n\n\nMore from AOL.com:\n\nU.S., allies demand Russia halt Syria strikes outside IS areas\n\nVatican upends Davis affair with news of audience with gays\n\n'Hurricane Joaquin batters Bahamas; ship missing in storm\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.aol.com/assets-3af9d6a02a9854da3646959922f4fe0c/images/favicon/browserconfig.xml?v=Kmmv6Rgb5o", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said the U.S. should bar refugees from war-torn Syria.", "author": "AOL Staff", "og": {"site_name": "AOL.com", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said the U.S. should bar refugees from war-torn Syria.", "title": "Republican hopeful Carson says no to Syrian refugees in US", "url": "http://www.aol.com/article/2015/10/03/republican-hopeful-carson-says-no-to-syrian-refugees-in-us/21244407/", "image": "http://www.blogcdn.com/slideshows/images/slides/378/624/1/S3786241/slug/l/aptopix-gop-2016-carson-1.jpg", "app_id": 183146218394780, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.aol.com", "account_id": 66237835, "title": "Republican hopeful Carson says no to Syrian refugees in US", "image": "http://www.blogcdn.com/slideshows/images/slides/378/624/1/S3786241/slug/l/aptopix-gop-2016-carson-1.jpg", "creator": "@AOL", "site": "@AOL", "card": "summary", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said the U.S. should bar refugees from war-torn Syria."}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3399ff", "robots": "index,follow", "publish-date": "October 3, 2015", "p": {"domain_verify": "96bae1739d3231d21abe59a638021d5d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183146218394780}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.aol.com/assets-43dafc02cf4f3bf4849e499b04c0aa82/images/favicon/mstile-144x144.png?v=Kmmv6Rgb5o", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/aol"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3050\"", "article_summary": "(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) Republican presidential hopeful Sen.
