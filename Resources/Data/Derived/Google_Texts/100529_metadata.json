When there is a failure on the part of the president to faithfully execute the law, the House has the authority to challenge this failure in the Judicial Branch by filing suit in Federal Court in situations in which: There is no one else who can challenge the president\u2019s failure, and harm is being done to the general welfare and trust in faithful execution of our laws;\n\nThere is no legislative remedy; and\n\nThere is explicit House authorization for the lawsuit, through a vote authorizing the litigation against the president\u2019s failure.\n\nEverything asserted here is either untrue or abject nonsense:\n\nIf no one is in a position to \u201cchallenge the president\u2019s failure\u201d to follow the law, that is because no one has suffered a concrete personal injury that would provide the standing necessary for a court case \u2014 judges are not there to resolve power disputes between the political branches.\n\nThere is an institution that \u201ccan challenge the president\u2019s failure\u201d to execute the laws faithfully: It is the Congress.\n\nAnd there is a legislative remedy: Congress has the power to defund executive-branch activities and impeach lawless executive-branch officials, including the president himself.\n\nEither of those responses would stop the president\u2019s lawlessness in its tracks.
