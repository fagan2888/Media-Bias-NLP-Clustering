Iran says that Israel is the source of all woe, Syria is whining that it\u2019s going to take time and cost real money to break down their chemical weapons stash, and Venezuela thinks that Spider-Man is behind the wave of violence plaguing the country.\n\nSpider-Man. Friendly-Neighborhood Spider-Man.\n\nLook, we get it. There are a lot of problems in the world right now. Heck, we have so many problems just here in America that we can\u2019t seem to figure out who caused them and who has made them worse through the deeply partisan rhetoric.\n\nIn fact, right this instant there\u2019s a huge debate going on in our nation\u2019s capital about whether or not to shut down the entire federal government because the Affordable Care Act (our controversial public health legislation, we\u2019re a bit behind) was sloppily thrown together and haphazardly funded, which is the fault of the GOP who are trying to stop it because the Democrats had to force it through Congress during President Obama\u2019s first term, and nowthedebtceilinghastogoup because we can\u2019t balance our checkbook and so let\u2019s just gut good social service programs to solve our problem and on, and on, and on, and on.\n\nSee what I mean about the rhetoric? And that\u2019s still not counting all of the problems out there in the world that we\u2019ve managed to get ourselves wrapped up in. Pakistan, Egypt, Syria, *HNNNNNNG*.\n\nBut you know what? Thank God we live in America. Not because we have freedoms, fast food, more porn than we know what to do with, and the iPhone 7\u2026 but because no matter how stupid and frustrating our politicians are, they:\n\nDon\u2019t blame a neighboring country for our own glaring human rights abuses Don\u2019t complain about the burden of destroying chemical weapons they just used on us last week. Don\u2019t blame Spider-Man.\n\nBecause No. 1 is what\u2026\n\n\u2026 Hassan Rouhani, Iran\u2019s new president, is doing. Some are saying that his recent interview with NBC News is a sign that Iran is finally cooling off after decades of tense negotiations with the West. Heck, he even said that Iran isn\u2019t planning on developing nuclear weapons, and we have no reason not to believe him because we\u2019ve never heard that before from an Iranian leader.\n\nStill, though Rouhani optimistically called his comments \u201csubtle and tiny steps for a very important future,\u201d with the West, communication is probably going to break down yet again when it comes to the U.S.\u2019 strongest, and really our sole consistent ally in the Middle East, Israel.\n\nIsrael, a country that Rouhani really doesn\u2019t care for.\n\nIf you watch Rouhani\u2019s interview, it\u2019s nothing but vague and ambiguous intelligent-sounding platitudes, hence why many in the mainstream media haven\u2019t really batted an eye at it (because that\u2019s how President Obama talks), but we have to give props to Ann Curry, who pressed the Iran prez on the issue of Israel.\n\nThough he led with an admirable \u201cWe are seeking peace and stability among all the nations in the region,\u201d he resorted to describing Israel as \u201can occupier and usurper government\u201d that \u201cdoes injustice to the people of the region, and has brought instability to the region, with its warmongering policies,\u201d and describing Bibi (Netanyahu) a \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d\n\nThough he touted Iran as a country that believes \u201cin the ballot box,\u201d he said that Israel should STFU about \u201ca democratically and freely elected government\u201d without a hint of irony.\n\nMoving on\u2026\n\nNo. 2 is what\u2026\n\n\u2026 Syria\u2019s president, Bashar Assad, is griping about. Even though Russian President Vladimir Putin swooped in shirtless on horseback at the last minute to prevent trigger-happy United States from wiping Syria\u2019s chemical weapon stockpile off the map like a blob of ketchup, Assad is not happy to have inherited such a pricey, time-consuming chore.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News conducted by former U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, Assad maintained that the chemical attack that killed 1,400 Syrians was conducted by terrorists, but he\u2019s more than happy to destroy his own chemical weapon stockpile on Russia\u2019s advice. He was especially clear of that. He\u2019s only doing it because Russia just randomly said \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you destroy your chemical weapons?\u201d It had nothing to do with the U.S.\u2019 giant, drone-shaped ketchup-removing thumb. Not at all.\n\nYeah, it doesn\u2019t add up. But even if we take him at his word, Assad still complained that destroying his chemical weapon stockpile, which again, he agreed to do out of charity, not because he\u2019s being pressured, is going to cost over $1 billion, and could take up to a year to accomplish. What a headache.\n\nBut not nearly as bad as the headache brought on by sarin gas (followed by uncontrollable muscle spasms and suffocation), which both the U.S. and the UN are pretty damn convinced was dropped on 1,400 innocent Syrians by Assad himself.\n\nSide note: Grow a real mustache or don\u2019t even try, dude.\n\nNo. 3 is what\u2026\n\n\u2026 Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is arguing. Sure, his predecessor Hugo Chavez made his own fair share or bizarre claims during his tenure, but we\u2019re pretty sure El Commandante never blamed a fictional superhero for his problems.\n\nParticularly, Venezuela is seeing a spike in violence lately, especially among the nation\u2019s youth. According to Maduro, this all has to do with superhero idolization.\n\n\u201cThis kid, at 14 years old, carries a 9mm with a mind filled by thousands of hours of shows where people are killed,\u201d he said. \u201cI start to think how many thousands of hours of violence that kid will have consumed, in the end, stimulated by consumerism and violence when he grabs a 9 mm and goes to kill.\u201d\n\nAnd this all dawned on him after he had a movie date at home with his wife this week. The film? Spider-Man 3.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the trouble, from the beginning until the end there are more and more dead. And that\u2019s one of the series small children love most\u2026 because it\u2019s attractive, it\u2019s from comics that are attractive, the figure, the colors and movements\u2026 so much so that we finished watching it at four in the morning.\u201d\n\nSo yeah. Things in America suck right now, and our leaders seem confused, immature and kind of stupid. But at least they don\u2019t blame Spider-Man for our problems.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It has been a busy week for world leaders blaming everyone but themselves for their problems.
