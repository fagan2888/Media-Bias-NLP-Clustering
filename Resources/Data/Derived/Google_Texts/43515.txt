While walking with the French president at Monticello, President Obama was heard saying, “That’s the good thing about being president: I can do anything I want.” Although said in jest, the offhanded comment reveals something about his mindset.

To find the most recent examples of Obama’s cavalier attitude, look no further than the newest change to the Affordable Care Act and the easing of restrictions to immigrants with terror contacts — both done without congressional approval.

Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked her guest, Fox Senior legal analyst Andrew Napolitano Monday, “Is it legal?” The short answer: no.

“It seems to be getting worse and worse,” Napolitano told Kelly.

On Monday, the Obama administration announced that it was once again delaying the employer mandate for businesses with 50 to 99 employees. In order to take advantage of the delay, companies would have to prove they didn’t cut their workforce in order to fall within the range, according to The Hill.

House Republican Leader Eric Cantor,R-Va., said the new delay meant that employees of medium-sized businesses wouldn’t feel the pain until “after Election Day.”

Coincidence? As FDR noted many years ago, there are no coincidences in politics.

Cantor later tweeted his comparison of Obamacare’s failure to that of the opening ceremony of the Sochi Olympics, saying:

“And, once again, the president is rewriting law on a whim,” Boehner said in his statement. “If the administration doesn’t believe employers can manage the burden of the law, how can struggling families be expected to?”

But what Boehner fails to realize is that Obama is the president — he can do anything he wants.
