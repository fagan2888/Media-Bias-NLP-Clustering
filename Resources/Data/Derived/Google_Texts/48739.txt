The deal follows e-commerce deals from Tritium Partners and FedEx

Volition Capital has made a $15 million investment in Insite Software, picking up a minority stake.

Insite Software provides business-to-business e-commerce platforms and services to manufacturers and distributors. The investment should help the company expand its product offerings, says Tony Abena, Insights CEO.

Boston-based Volition is a growth equity firm. The groups other investments include chewy.com, an e-retailer that sells pet food, and iPipeline, which provides sales distribution software.

Roger Hurwitz, a Volition managing partner, is joining Insites board of directors.
