A United Kingdom-based organization, however, wants to curb its prevalence with an app they say will put friends and family of the depressed on notice.\n\nOnce downloaded, the app touted as Samaritans Radar will send alerts to users\u2019 email addresses when their Twitter followers tweet phrases designated as words commonly used in difficult times \u2014 like \u201chelp me,\u201d \u201ctired of being alone,\u201d \u201chate myself,\u201d or \u201cneed someone to talk to.\u201d Samaritans Radar will also help users contact anyone they\u2019re concerned about at any time.\n\n\u201cSamaritans Radar is in its infancy and won\u2019t get it right every time,\u201d the organization said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not good at sarcasm or jokes yet! But there\u2019s a way for you to give feedback on whether a Samaritans Radar alert was correct, so the service improves for everyone.\u201d\n\nIn the mental health field, there\u2019s no relationship more conspicuous than that of depression and suicide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 90 percent of people who take their own lives often suffer from depression, proving it harmful if not treated immediately. Traumatic events and the stresses of change can bring forth depressive disorders, ultimately distorting one\u2019s feelings, actions, perceptions and triggering a mental disorder.\n\nFor teenagers and adolescents, who may stand to benefit the most from an app like Samaritans Radar, the stakes are even higher. Suicide counts as the third leading cause of death among that group, according to a January CDC report, and more than 10 percent of adolescents develop a depressive disorder before the age of 18. On college campuses, which are working to improve mental health services for students, suicide rises to the top cause of death.\n\nSamaritans Radar has elements of the collaborative care model, a mental health care strategy that connects family members of the depressed with mental and physical health services. That\u2019s especially important considering the fact that a persistent stigma surrounding mental health issues prevents many people from feeling like they can talk about it or seek help.\n\nThe new tool comes on the heels of other innovations that tackle depression and provide people with the tools needed to improve their mental health. One Pennsylvania city, for example, installed a mental health kiosk in grocery stores that allows people to screen for potential issues by using a touch screen. Some researchers have found that regular text messages can help people manage their chronic mental health conditions. And some therapeutic video games can help people cope with negative emotions.\n\nIssues of depression and suicide made national headlines earlier this year, after comedian Robin Williams committed suicide. His death helped bring more attention to the public health issue; calls to crisis hotlines have increased, and more people have offered to volunteer as mental health advocates.\n\nThere has also been some recent progress in connecting more people to the care the need. The health care industry has seen a significant increase in the use of mental health services among young people who stayed on their parents\u2019 insurance as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf you need help, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24 hours a day at 800-273-8255.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A United Kingdom-based organization has developed a tool to put friends and family of the depressed on notice.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A United Kingdom-based organization has developed a tool to put friends and family of the depressed on notice.", "title": "This App Could Help Friends And Family Prevent Suicides", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/29/3585974/how-one-app-will-help-prevent-suicide/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_154131002.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A United Kingdom-based organization has developed a tool to put friends and family of the depressed on notice.", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_154131002-321x214.jpg", "title": "This App Could Help Friends And Family Prevent Suicides", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_154131002.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_154131002.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-29T12:01:17+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health This App Could Help Friends And Family Prevent Suicides CREDIT: ShutterstockMore than 800,000 people around the world commit suicide each year, according a United Nations report released last month.\n\u201cSamaritans Radar is in its infancy and won\u2019t get it right every time,\u201d the organization said in a statement on Wednesday.\nSamaritans Radar has elements of the collaborative care model, a mental health care strategy that connects family members of the depressed with mental and physical health services.\nFor teenagers and adolescents, who may stand to benefit the most from an app like Samaritans Radar, the stakes are even higher.\nOn college campuses, which are working to improve mental health services for students, suicide rises to the top cause of death."}
