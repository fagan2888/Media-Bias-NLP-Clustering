(AP) - Down a country lane, not far from where interstate traffic whips past Williamsburg, the giant heads of 42 American presidents appear to sprout from a weedy field - a scene that\u2019s nothing if not surreal.\n\nRemember those big heads? The massive presidential busts that had such a hard time finding a home a decade or so ago?\n\nThey were sculpted Texas-size by a Houston artist and trucked east to create Presidents Park, a $10 million attraction near Water Country USA.\n\nBut zoning issues - and outcries of \u201ctoo tacky\u201d - held things up, causing the first shipment of sculptures to wander the countryside on flatbeds for a while.\n\nSix found temporary refuge at Norfolk Botanical Garden until Presidents Park opened in 2004.\n\nIt closed in 2010, unable to reliably draw enough visitors to cover the mortgage. The land - 10 acres - wound up occupied by an Enterprise car rental outfit, which wanted the sculptures gone. Two years ago, Enterprise turned to Howard Hankins, a road builder and developer whose company had worked on the original park.\n\nWhen asked to demolish the busts - once appraised at $100,000 each - Hankins \u201cjust couldn\u2019t see breaking them up.\u201d\n\nSo he offered to take the presidents off the company\u2019s hands.\n\nTo move them, he had to punch a hole in the concrete head of each commander in chief so a chain could be dropped inside its hollows, attached to its steel frame, then hooked to a crane. The sculptures were rocked to break them free from their pedestals. Most cracked around their necklines the moment the crane started to lift.\n\nHankins isn\u2019t sure how much the monuments weigh. Stories from back in the day put them at 7,500 pounds apiece, but he thinks they\u2019re a lot heavier: His crane is rated for 26,000 pounds, and \u201cit could barely pick them up.\u201d\n\nHeight was another problem. Originally shipped in two pieces, with heads separate from shoulders, they range from 16 to 20 feet tall in the assembled state Hankins had to deal with.\n\nTrial and error - the back of Lincoln\u2019s skull took a terrible bashing - combined with careful measuring of overpass clearances and a week\u2019s worth of hauling ultimately landed the sculptures at Hankins\u2019 400-acre farm, 10 miles from the park.\n\nThere, he placed the presidents - from George Washington to George W. Bush - in a field behind the house, hoping to someday return them to the spotlight.\n\nA nearby shipping container is stuffed with other items: biographical signs for each president, dresses and photos of first ladies, a small model of the bust intended for Barack Obama before the park turned off its lights.\n\nSurrounded by corn crops and piles of logs in various stages of mulching - a Hankins side business - the presidents are looking pretty rough. Paint peels, hornets build nests in mammoth nostrils, stains run like tears down colossal cheeks.\n\nHankins says all can be restored, once the sculptures find a real home. He\u2019s looking for investors to help build another monument park. He says he\u2019s in negotiations for possible locations in Williamsburg, Richmond, even Virginia Beach.\n\nIn the meantime, the big heads wait, an Easter Island-like mirage in the middle of nowhere. Letters arrive now and then from people asking to visit. A bride wanted to hold her wedding next to Lincoln.\n\nHankins has to say no. His property isn\u2019t zoned for a roadside attraction.\n\nIt\u2019s enough that - at least for now - Howard Hankins has saved the presidents.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Virginian-Pilot, http://pilotonline.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Down a country lane, not far from where interstate traffic whips past Williamsburg, the giant heads of 42 American presidents appear to sprout from a weedy field - a scene that's nothing if not surreal.", "Author": "JOANNE KIMBERLIN", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/20/the-heads-at-presidents-park-find-new-home/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Down a country lane, not far from where interstate traffic whips past Williamsburg, the giant heads of 42 American presidents appear to sprout from a weedy field - a scene that\u2019s nothing if not surreal.", "title": "The heads at Presidents Park find new home"}, "twitter": {"title": "The heads at Presidents Park find new home", "description": "Down a country lane, not far from where interstate traffic whips past Williamsburg, the giant heads of 42 American presidents appear to sprout from a weedy field - a scene that's nothing if not surrea", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17c4\"", "article_summary": "They were sculpted Texas-size by a Houston artist and trucked east to create Presidents Park, a $10 million attraction near Water Country USA.\nSix found temporary refuge at Norfolk Botanical Garden until Presidents Park opened in 2004.\nTwo years ago, Enterprise turned to Howard Hankins, a road builder and developer whose company had worked on the original park.\nA nearby shipping container is stuffed with other items: biographical signs for each president, dresses and photos of first ladies, a small model of the bust intended for Barack Obama before the park turned off its lights.\nSurrounded by corn crops and piles of logs in various stages of mulching - a Hankins side business - the presidents are looking pretty rough."}
