a Beijing-U.S. one reached in September forbidding economic espionage against one another\u2019s companies, The Guardian reports.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe two nations have signed a \u201chigh-level security dialogue\u201d regarding cybercrime that is intended to halt hacks on companies either to acquire intellectual property or to disable computer systems, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after an American research firm accused China of breaking its agreement with the U.S. almost immediately.\n\n\u201cThe very first intrusion conducted by China-affiliated actors after the joint Xi-Obama announcement at the White House took place the very next day \u2014 Saturday, Sept. 26,\u201d CrowdStrike CEO Dmitri Alperovitch wrote in a Monday blogpost.\n\nSeven of the recently hacked companies were technology or pharmaceutical firms, \u201cwhere the primary benefit of the intrusions seems clearly aligned to facilitate theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, rather than to conduct traditional national-security related intelligence collection, which the agreement does not prohibit,\u201d Alperovitch wrote.\n\nSome security experts caution that the research firm\u2019s claims should be taken with a grain of salt because the company has not opened up its research methods to independent verification.\n\nAlperovitch cautioned that the report doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that the agreement has been a failure, noting that it might take some time for China to dismantle its espionage apparatus.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there is some time delay between agreement and execution is not entirely unexpected,\u201d Alperovitch wrote. \u201cBut, we need to know the parameters for success, and whether the parties to the agreement discussed a timeframe for implementation or, instead, expected it to be immediate.\u201d\n\nThe agreement is seen as significant because it marks the first time that China has drawn a distinction \u2014 at least nominally \u2014 between hacking for traditional intelligence-gathering purposes and hacking for commercial gain.\n\nWhile the U.K. has been less vocal on the subject of Chinese hacking, Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters has reported a \u201cdisturbing\u201d number of cyberattacks on British firms, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe agreement is the first time that the U.K. and China have worked together on cybersecurity issues.\n\nThe two nations also announced a \u201cglobal comprehensive strategic partnership\u201d that includes a \u00a367-billion investment in the first British nuclear power plant in a generation.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The agreement pledges that neither country will conduct economic espionage against one
