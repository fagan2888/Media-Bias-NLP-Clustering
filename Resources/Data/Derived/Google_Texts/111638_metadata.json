Among other things, it proposed charity care at a level below regional averages, and the state questioned some of Cascade\u0092s financial assumptions.Cascade was one of three for-profit companies hoping to add psychiatric units in Snohomish County. It has 28 days to file an appeal. Michael Uradnik, chief executive of Cascade Behavioral Health, declined to comment.There\u0092s only one place currently offering adult, in-patient psychiatric services to serve the county\u0092s 745,913 people: a 23-bed unit at Swedish/Edmonds hospital. Most people who need in-patient psychiatric care have to leave the county to get it.Ken Stark, director of the Snohomish County Human Services Department, said he was surprised by the state\u0092s decision to turn down Cascade\u0092s proposed 80-bed unit. \u0093We know the need is there,\u0094 but no one knows exactly how many more beds are needed, he said.Despite the Department of Health\u0092s veto of the Bothell facility, two other in-patient psychiatric units are still planned, for Monroe and Smokey Point, and a third is about to open. Fairfax Hospital of Kirkland is scheduled to open a 30-bed adult psychiatric unit at Providence Regional Medical Center Everett If the Monroe and Smokey Point proposals are approved, the total number of psychiatric beds in the county could increase to 212 over the next few years.Fairfax is seeking permission to open a second unit, with 34 beds, at Valley General Hospital in Monroe at a cost of $2.2 million. It would provide services to adults with severe psychiatric and medical issues as well as to geriatric populations. US HealthVest received state Department of Health approval in January to open an $18.8 million, 75-bed unit in Smokey Point, but that decision is being challenged by two competitors, Cascade and Fairfax. Hearings on the challenge are scheduled in October.US HealthVest also is asking for state approval to add another 50 psychiatric beds at a proposed Smokey Point facility at an additional cost of $3.28 million.The competition to open in-patient psychiatric services is spurred in part by additional money available for mental health services through the federal Affordable Care Act.Sharon Salyer: 425-339-3486; salyer@heraldnet.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bothell, Smokey Point, Providence Regional Medical Center Everett, Swedish/Edmonds, Valley General Hospital, Mental health,", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Herald", "description": "The battle among providers to establish more in-patient psychiatric beds in Snohomish County is down to two players \u0097 at least for now.The state......", "title": "Bid for new psychiatric hospital denied - HeraldNet.com", "url": "http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20140811/NEWS01/140819862", "image": "http://www.heraldnet.com/images/hnet/logos/HNet_Facebook_default_200x200.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.heraldnet.com/images/hnet/logos/HNet_Facebook_default_200x200.gif", "description": "The battle among providers to establish more in-patient psychiatric beds in Snohomish County is down to two players \u0097 at least for now.The state......", "site": "@everettherald", "card": "summary", "title": "Bid for new psychiatric hospital denied - HeraldNet.com"}, "robots": "INDEX", "keywords": "Bid for new psychiatric hospital denied,  Bothell, Smokey Point, Providence Regional Medical Center Everett, Swedish/Edmonds, Valley General Hospital, Mental health, Local News", "fb": {"app_id": 1458930781088413}, "msvalidate.01": "F6D828FCC49535DAACD4E719D15E0554", "google-site-verification": "zueLynmKVJrbO8M8Ov9Tu5dNocx_-LoWGbnVq3H-KAE", "description": "The battle among providers to establish more in-patient psychiatric beds in Snohomish County is down to two players \u0097 at least for now.The state..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb80c\"", "article_summary": "Michael Uradnik, chief executive of Cascade Behavioral Health, declined to comment.There\u0092s only one place currently offering adult, in-patient psychiatric services to serve the county\u0092s 745,913 people: a 23-bed unit at Swedish/Edmonds hospital.\nIt would provide services to adults with severe psychiatric and medical issues as well as to geriatric populations.\nMost people who need in-patient psychiatric care have to leave the county to get it.Ken Stark, director of the Snohomish County Human Services Department, said he was surprised by the state\u0092s decision to turn down Cascade\u0092s proposed 80-bed unit.\nAmong other things, it proposed charity care at a level below regional averages, and the state questioned some of Cascade\u0092s financial assumptions.Cascade was one of three for-profit companies hoping to add psychiatric units in Snohomish County.\nFairfax Hospital of Kirkland is scheduled to open a 30-bed adult psychiatric unit at Providence Regional Medical Center Everett If the Monroe and Smokey Point proposals are approved, the total number of psychiatric beds in the county could increase to 212 over the next few years.Fairfax is seeking permission to open a second unit, with 34 beds, at Valley General Hospital in Monroe at a cost of $2.2 million."}
