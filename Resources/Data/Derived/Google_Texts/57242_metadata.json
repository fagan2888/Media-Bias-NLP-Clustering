Since the brutal murder, Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a proclamation and asked the community to wear blue as well as turn on their flashing lights on Friday at 11 a.m.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies along the border including Brownsville, Harlingen, Laredo, Cotulla, Rio Grande City and others held simultaneous events honoring Goforth and other fallen deputies.\n\nIn the border city of Edinburg, a police vehicle from each agency lined out outside of the courthouse as the fire department used their ladder to hoist up a massive U.S. Flag. Right at 11 a.m. two law enforcement helicopters flew over flashing their lights as the nearly 30 patrol vehicles on the ground flashed their police lights while they observed a minute of silence.\n\n\u201cWe are a brotherhood. When an officer is killed we come together as brothers as friends as counterparts to honor our fallen officers,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe are all a family regardless of where we are from. We have to show the community that we as officers do have families do have lives and it hurts if one of our officers is killed in the line of duty providing a service to the community.\u201d\n\nThose who wear a badge come together as a close community because they all work together to provide a service to the community.\n\n\u201cRegardless of threats that we receive, regardless of what we are going through, we have an obligation to work together and provide a service to the community,\u201d Lopez said.\n\nPhotos by Ildefonso Ortiz.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas you can follow him on Twitter and on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sheriff\u2019s deputies, police officers, federal agents, constables, game wardens, state troopers and first responders gathered at courthouses, police stations and other government buildings along the Texas border to honor a fallen comrade.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Sheriff\u2019s deputies, police officers, federal agents, constables, game wardens, state troopers and first responders gathered at courthouses, police stations and other government buildings along the Texas border to honor a fallen comrade.", "title": "Texas Border Cops Join in Honoring Fallen Houston Area Deputy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Goforth-Funeral-HCSO-Honor-Guard.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-04T17:52:35-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/09/04/texas-border-cops-join-in-honoring-fallen-houston-area-deputy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sheriff\u2019s deputies, police officers, federal agents, constables, game wardens, state troopers and first responders gathered at courthouses, police stations and other government buildings along the Texas border to honor a fallen comrade.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Goforth-Funeral-HCSO-Honor-Guard.jpg", "title": "Texas Border Cops Join in Honoring Fallen Houston Area Deputy", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "#BlueLivesMatter, Breitbart Texas, Darren Goforth,Breitbart Texas,Houston Area Deputy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-09-04T17:21:23-07:00", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "modified_time": "2015-09-04T17:52:35-07:00", "tag": "Darren Goforth", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce00b\"", "article_summary": "When an officer is killed we come together as brothers as friends as counterparts to honor our fallen officers,\u201d Lopez said.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cToday is when law enforcement came together to honor our fallen officers specifically our deputy that was ambushed and killed in the Houston area,\u201d said Hidalgo County Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief Deputy Mario Lopez to Breitbart Texas.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEREDINBURG, Texas \u2014 Sheriff\u2019s deputies, police officers, federal agents, constables, game wardens, state troopers and first responders gathered at courthouses, police stations and other government buildings along the Texas border to honor a fallen comrade.\nLopez was referring to Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Darren Goforth, who was executed on August 28 while fueling his vehicle.\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas you can follow him on Twitter and on Facebook."}
