FLAGLER COUNTY, Fla. - An 18-year-old man was shot in the neck after handing over his AK-47 to a friend. The friend pulled the trigger, thinking it wasn't loaded, according to the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies responded to a home on Parkview Drive in Palm Coast Tuesday afternoon to investigate a report of a shooting. They found Shane Huber, 18, conscious and alert with a single gunshot wound to the neck.

Huber was flown to Halifax Medical Center in Daytona Beach. His condition was unknown.

Detectives said Huber was showing his Romania .762x39mm AK-47 rifle to his 18-year-old friend, Brandon Williamson.

Huber handed the rifle to Williamson. Williamson didn't believe the rifle was loaded and pulled the trigger, striking Huber, according to FCSO.

Detectives believe the incident was accidental. No one else was in the home at the time.

No charges have been filed.
