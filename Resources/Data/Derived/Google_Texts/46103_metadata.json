Chris Smith.\n\nAccording to Smith, a co-chair of the House Pro-Life Caucus, the availability of elective abortion coverage to Members and their staff amounts to taxpayer funding of the procedure, as members and staffers\u2019 coverage is set to be subsidized by the government.\n\n\u201cIn the run-up to passage of Obamacare, Americans were repeatedly told and reassured by President Obama himself, including in a speech to a joint session of Congress in October 2009, that \u2018under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortion.\u2019 Obama even issued the infamous Executive Order that claimed, \u2018the Act maintains current Hyde Amendment restrictions governing abortion policy and extends those restrictions to newly created health insurance exchanges,\u2019\u201d Smith said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOnce again we see those promises ring hollow \u2014 what the President said simply isn\u2019t true today. In the most recent example, 103 of the 112 insurance plans that Members of Congress and congressional staff are being directed to INCLUDE ELECTIVE ABORTION coverage. Only nine plans offered exclude elective abortion,\u201d he added, emphasis Smith\u2019s.\n\nA Smith staffer explained to The Daily Caller that the office reached the conclusion that 103 of 112 plans would cover abortions by looking at the 112 plans available to members and staff \u2014 the 112 Gold level plans available through the D.C. Health Link\u2019s system for employer-sponsored health insurance \u2014 and determined which plans did no cover abortion via the D.C. Health Link\u2019s FAQ section.\n\n\u201cHealth plans that do not provide coverage for elective abortions include all Aetna health plans, as well as the multi-state plans (MSP) offered by CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield (only the plans that include \u2018Multi-State Plan\u2019 in their name). All health plans offered by Kaiser Permanente, United Healthcare, and CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield plans that do not include \u2018Multi-State Plan\u2019 in their name include coverage for elective abortions,\u201d the FAQ, posted on October 30, explains.\n\nThe FAQ answer was subsequently confirmed during a November 7 congressional staff briefing on Members and staff obtaining health insurance through the D.C. Health Link.\n\nAccording to Smith\u2019s office, there are eight Aetna plans and one CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield multistate plan \u2014 or nine plans that do not cover abortions among the plans available to Members and staff. Or nine minus 112 equals 103.\n\nSmith\u2019s office further highlighted that an amendment offered by the congressman 30 years ago, known as the Smith Amendment that prohibits abortion funding in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Programs, remains law.\n\nThe pro-life Susan B. Anthony List slammed the Obama administration over the potential abortion funding, calling on President Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to address the issue.\n\n\u201cThe Obama Administration is clearly breaking longstanding federal law by offering Members of Congress and congressional staff health care plans that include abortion on demand,\u201d SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, said in a statement. \u201cThis is just another example of how Obamacare expands taxpayer funding of abortion, and is sadly another instance of how the President and his Administration misled the American people when Obamacare was being debated by Congress.\u201d\n\nFollow Caroline on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caroline May", "description": "Of the 112 plans available to members of Congress and their staff, 103 cover elective abortion, according to a recent analysis released by New Jersey Republican", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Of the 112 plans available to members of Congress and their staff, 103 cover elective abortion, according to a recent analysis released by New Jersey Republican Rep.
