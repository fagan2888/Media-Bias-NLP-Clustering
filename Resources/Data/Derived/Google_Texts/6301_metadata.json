Peter Voghel, HEALTHPURE\u2019s Chairman states, \u201cWith the advent of competitive shopping for health coverage and the tremendous amount of upheaval in the market brought on by the launch of the Affordable Care Act this year, we knew the time was right to launch a consumer targeted tool and sought an investment partner that saw the same opportunity.\u201d\n\nHEALTHPURE is now partnered with Linden Growth Partners, a targeted venture capital and private equity firm with deep experience investing in Biotechnology, Healthcare and Wellness companies. \u201cTo date, the bulk of our portfolio investments have been in companies that target other businesses.\n\nHEALTPURE\u2019s approach really addresses a void in the marketplace and we knew the timing was right to invest in a consumer-oriented company offering solutions to very real market-driven problems\u201d says Paul Coviello, Managing Director for Linden Growth Partners.
