Yet close scrutiny of these 20 agreements shows that dramatically different lessons need to be learned to gauge the wisdom of the president\u2019s Pacific Rim and European Union trade initiatives.\n\nThe data make clear that, in a highly diverse global economy, trade success depends on choosing partners with which mutually beneficial trade is plausible in the first place. They reveal that a cookie-cutter approach to dealing with countries varying widely in economic structures and priorities can backfire badly on the United States. And they indicate that the President\u2019s proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in particular contains too many problematic current and likely members to serve U.S. interests.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmerica\u2019s current free trade partners are a hodgepodge ranging from large, high-income free market-oriented democracies like next-door neighbor Canada and distant Australia; to Korea and its state-directed, export-oriented economy; to the small, impoverished states of Central America. Accurately assessing these deals\u2019 effects means taking these differences into account.\n\nTwo kinds of distinctions are paramount. The first is between Canada and the rest of the FTA countries. The second is among countries with highly industrialized economies, countries lacking globally competitive manufacturing, and countries that appeal to multinational businesses as sites for offshored production. The non-Canada categories have the virtue of recognizing how dog-eat-dog worldwide competition still shapes world trade flows (especially important in an era of slow global growth), and how multinational companies\u2019 drive to find ever lower-cost, less-regulated locations for their factories \u2013 whether at home or abroad \u2013 has fueled America\u2019s recent trade diplomacy.\n\nAccurately evaluating free trade agreements also requires leaving out trade in energy \u2013 which has been unaffected by these deals. And focusing on manufacturing highlights a sector that has not experienced major price swings (like energy), as well as one that still dominates U.S. trade flows and thus has attracted special attention from President Obama.\n\nIgnoring the wide differences among America\u2019s free trade partners yields the numbers trade enthusiasts have touted. From 2007 through 2013 \u2013 a period including a deep U.S. recession and a painfully slow economic recovery \u2013 the chronic U.S. manufacturing trade deficit with the world as a whole shrank by 15.6 percent. But at just under $450 billion last year, it remained huge. During this period, however, the U.S. manufacturing trade balance with free trade agreement countries changed from a $35 billion deficit to a $58.8 billion surplus.\n\nThe FTA effect looks big both during the 2007-2009 downturn and the ongoing recovery. The recession saw the global manufacturing trade shortfall shrink by nearly 40 percent, as international commerce of all kinds took a much bigger hit than domestic economic activity. But the U.S. balance with the FTA countries became a $20.48 billion surplus. As economic growth has resumed, so has the worsening of the U.S. global manufacturing deficit \u2013 by 40.6 percent through the end of 2013. But the U.S. manufacturing surplus with the FTA countries has nearly tripled.\n\nLeave out Canada, though, and the numbers change dramatically \u2013 which makes perfect sense given Canada\u2019s unique combination of proximity to America, largely free market economic system, openness to trade, and affluence. As a result, Canada alone accounted for more than 53 percent of the improvement in America\u2019s trade balance with the FTA countries, with a $400 million deficit in 2007 turning into a $49.7 billion surplus by 2013.\n\nAfter Canada, the most successful U.S. free trade agreements have been those reached with countries that simply don\u2019t have much manufacturing, or whose industry can\u2019t hope to compete with America\u2019s. Australia, Chile, and Panama unquestionably fall into this category, and the U.S. manufacturing trade balance improvement with this trio came to $20.3 billion between 2007 and 2013 \u2013 nearly 22 percent of the total gain.\n\nYet agreements have done nothing to improve America\u2019s trade performance with countries that have boasted impressive manufacturing before the deals were signed. This group includes Korea, Israel, and Singapore, and from 2007 through 2013, America\u2019s manufacturing deficit with these countries has actually worsened by just over $3 billion.\n\nThe free trade agreement record has been mixed when the target countries have had little world-class manufacturing, but have been seen as potential manufacturing and exporting sites for multinational companies. The most commonly used set of trade statistics shows that between 2007 and 2013, America\u2019s manufacturing deficit narrowed with Mexico \u2013 an archetype foreign export platform \u2013 by $16.6 billion, but widened with the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic by a total of $3.3 billion.\n\nAt the same time, America\u2019s trade with these countries doesn\u2019t all consist of the exchanges of finished goods that dominate popular conceptions of international commerce. As much as half is made up of parts and components and materials that travel back and forth across borders in complex corporate supply chains. In order to avoid double-counting, tricky intra-corporate pricing practices, and other distortions, it\u2019s best to measure U.S. trade with these countries using narrower categories of imports and exports.\n\nThis more realistic methodology produces strikingly different results, especially for Mexico. Rather than shrinking by more than $16 billion between 2007 and 2013, the U.S. manufacturing deficit grows by $8.3 billion. The shortfall with the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic increases by some $3.9 billion rather than by $3.3 billion.\n\nJust as important, a substantially new picture of U.S.-Canada trade emerges, too. The American manufacturing deficit also swings from deficit to surplus. But because so much bilateral commerce consists of this intra-industry trade as well, especially in automotive products, the improvement is considerably smaller -- $35.3 billion instead of just over $50 billion.\n\nAmerica\u2019s lagging free trade results with fully industrialized partners sound an especially loud warning about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Its current members include countries like manufacturing-heavy Japan and Malaysia, whose mercantile policies have long presented big trade problems for the U.S. economy. Knocking on the door are equally difficult Korea \u2013 whose manufacturing trade surplus with the United States has continued growing since its own free trade agreement with the United States went into effect in 2012 \u2013 Taiwan, and China. President Obama\u2019s trade team vows it will hold Beijing to the highest free trade standards before agreeing to its TPP entry, but its record of coddling predatory Chinese practices like currency manipulation, and China\u2019s deep integration into Asian manufacturing networks, justifies major skepticism.\n\nMore broadly, trade enthusiasts\u2019 portrayal of free trade deals as a major success violates a fundamental rule of sound analysis: distinguish between apples and oranges. Until the President develops a credible strategy for cracking the world\u2019s toughest trade nuts as well as for grabbing the lowest-handing fruit, Congress should put his proposed agenda on ice.\n\nTonelson is a research fellow at the U.S. Business and Industry Council, which represents nearly 2,000 small and medium-sized domestic U.S. manufacturers, and author of The Race to the Bottom (Westview Press, 2002).", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The data make clear that, in a highly diverse global economy, trade success depends on choosing partners with which mutually beneficial trade is plausible in the first place.", "description": "The data make clear that, in a highly diverse global economy, trade success depends on choosing partners with which mutually beneficial trade is plausible in the first place.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The data make clear that, in a highly diverse global economy, trade success depends on choosing partners with which mutually beneficial trade is plausible in the first place.", "title": "Apples, oranges, and free trade deals", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/206510-apples-oranges-and-free-trade-deals", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/206510-apples-oranges-and-free-trade-deals", "dcterms.date": "2014-05-20T11:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Alan Tonelson", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-20T11:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/206510-apples-oranges-and-free-trade-deals", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The data make clear that, in a highly diverse global economy, trade success depends on choosing partners with which mutually beneficial trade is plausible in the first place.", "card": "summary", "title": "Apples, oranges, and free trade deals"}, "dcterms.title": "Apples, oranges, and free trade deals"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2656\"", "article_summary": "More broadly, trade enthusiasts\u2019 portrayal of free trade deals as a major success violates a fundamental rule of sound analysis: distinguish between apples and oranges.\nAccurately evaluating free trade agreements also requires leaving out trade in energy \u2013 which has been unaffected by these deals.\nIgnoring the wide differences among America\u2019s free trade partners yields the numbers trade enthusiasts have touted.\nDuring this period, however, the U.S. manufacturing trade balance with free trade agreement countries changed from a $35 billion deficit to a $58.8 billion surplus.\nClaims that a 25-year long string of free trade agreements has greatly improved America\u2019s trade performance are staples of the case for similar deals sought by President Obama, and for legislation that would \u201cfast track\u201d them through Congress."}
