I already know I walk about five miles a day, in addition to my daily swim. My weight is stable within a range of two pounds. I prefer to remain accountable only to myself, not to a gadget.\n\nBut several of my peers swear by their fitness trackers and experts say that older adults are among those who could benefit most from such devices.\n\nElise Bloustein, a 62-year-old Brooklynite, calls the Fitbit she\u2019s worn daily since last Christmas \u201cmy little health whisperer\u201d that asks, \u201cHave you walked today?\u201d It has made her \u201chungry for walking,\u201d she said, prompting her to triple her daily mileage, improve her diet and shed 13 unwanted pounds she\u2019d carried around since her first child was born.\n\nBy syncing the device with her iPhone via a free app and recording the foods she eats, she\u2019s learned to balance calorie input with output and to eat more fruits, vegetables and fiber. She also uses the device to monitor the quantity and quality of her sleep as she strives for seven solid hours of shut-eye a night.\n\n\u201cAs a lawyer,\u201d she explained, \u201cI spend the day sitting at my desk on the computer or the phone. I had read that the longer you sit, the sooner you\u2019ll die. The Fitbit encourages me to get up and move. I now average 40 to 43 miles a week just walking.\u201d\n\nMs. Bloustein got her sister, a 61-year-old high school social worker in San Francisco, hooked on the tracker as well. Instead of driving to do errands, her sister now walks to reach the number of steps she sets as her daily goal.\n\nThe main motivator for those who love a fitness tracker seems to be the pat on the back it gives them when goals are achieved. As my friend Fran Saunders put it, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of cool when it buzzes because you\u2019ve reached your 10,000 steps, especially when that happens early in the day.\u201d\n\nThis surging industry of wearable technology \u2014 the Fitbit now has plenty of competition, including devices from Jawbone, Garmin, Nike and Misfit \u2014 has enjoyed brisk sales, particularly among young adults \u201cmotivated enough to want a device and be able to afford it,\u201d Dr. Mitesh S. Patel and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania wrote in the medical journal JAMA.\n\nAlas, the experts noted, these are the people who least need a technological push to improve their health. \u201cThe individuals who might have the most to gain from these devices are likely to be older and less affluent,\u201d they wrote, including those who are currently sedentary or have a chronic ailment that could benefit from more activity.\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Patel said in an interview, for most people to sustain a health-promoting change in behavior, \u201cit must be combined with effective engagement strategies,\u201d like social reinforcement from family members, friends or colleagues, or financial incentives from employers.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, employers can use part of employees\u2019 health insurance dollars to fund workplace wellness programs, enabling them to underwrite some or all of the cost of wearable devices. But for workers to benefit from them, \u201cthey need to have skin in the game and perhaps get some kind of reward at the end of the month if goals are reached,\u201d Dr. Patel said.\n\nHe and his colleagues at Penn\u2019s Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics are now doing clinical trials to determine what strategies can best sustain changes in health behaviors induced by fitness trackers.\n\nMs. Bloustein said it definitely helps to be a compulsive person. \u201cAt night if I see I haven\u2019t met my goals, I\u2019ll take a nice walk through the neighborhood until I hit my five miles,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a personality thing \u2014 my colleagues said the tracker made them claustrophobic.\u201d\n\nBut her college-age daughter, who like the rest of the family also wears a Fitbit, is now walking 25,000 steps a day, five times the amount of the average American.\n\nFactors beyond pure calories-in/calories-out can affect a person\u2019s weight. Some have reported online that wearing a fitness tracker was counterproductive, resulting in weight gain instead of loss. Korie Mulholland, a 24-year-old tutor in Chicago, wrote that \u201csince I was walking 10 to 15 miles a day at my stand-up desk, it told me I could eat 2,200 to 2,400 calories a day.\u201d But instead of losing weight, she gained, and after six months she abandoned the tracker.\n\nMs. Mulholland is not alone among tracker dropouts. In a survey of 6,223 individuals, Endeavor Partners, a research firm, found that more than half who bought a fitness tracker had stopped using it, with one-third abandoning the tracker within six months.\n\nDifferent folks need different strokes. Those motivated by competition, for example, might enjoy mileage contests with fellow workers or with participants in anonymous web-based groups.\n\nThe Penn team suggested that users might \u201cform teams that provide peer support and promote a sense of accountability\u201d to maintain the new behavior, \u201cperhaps aiming for everyone to achieve a minimum amount of activity rather than simply rewarding the power walkers.\u201d\n\nTwo researchers, Rikke Duus and Mike Cooray, both based in Britain, recently conducted a study of 200 women Fitbit users, 89 percent of whom wore the device almost constantly. In The Conversation, a nonprofit online news site, they reported that the device \u201chad a profound impact on the women\u2019s decision-making in terms of their diet, exercise and how they traveled from one place to another,\u201d often taking longer routes to reach their destinations. Three-fourths of the users, half of whom were Americans, also began eating healthier food, smaller portions and less takeout.\n\nNonetheless, Ms. Duus, a professor at University College London, said in an interview that there is a dark side to the tracker.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning it was a very helpful friend, but after a while, many felt quite controlled by the device, feeling pressured to reach their daily targets and feeling guilty when they failed to do so,\u201d she said. \u201cIt became more about reaching goals than doing what\u2019s good for you.\u201d\n\nWhen the women weren\u2019t wearing the tracker, they felt \u201cnaked\u201d and that any activity they did was wasted, the researchers said. If it couldn\u2019t be recorded, why bother doing it at all?\n\nMr. Cooray, a professor at the Ashridge-Hult Business School, said, \u201cPeople need to manage their relationship with the technology and not become dependent on it. You have to develop your own sense of what\u2019s good and the ability to follow through on it.\u201d\n\nWearable fitness trackers vary in price \u2014 from about $49 to $250 \u2014 and technical accuracy. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think of the Fitbit as 100 percent accurate,\u201d Ms. Bloustein said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s accurate or not, it keeps me in a place I want to be.\u201d\n\nFor those interested in saving money, a University of Pennsylvania study, published in February in JAMA, found that most smartphone applications were just as accurate as a wearable device in tracking someone\u2019s physical activity.\n\n\u201cCompared with the 1 to 2 percent of adults in the U.S. that own a wearable device, more than 65 percent of adults carry a smartphone,\u201d making the latter a more widely accessible and affordable way to monitor health behaviors, Dr. Patel said.\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151116072613, "BN": "well", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/well/move", "hdl_p": "Tracking Activity When Years Add Up", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/well/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 16, 2015", "keywords": "Elderly,Exercise,Featured,Move,Personal Health,Wired Well", "GBLC": "Featured;Move;Personal Health;Wired Well", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/well/Assessing the Fitness of Wearable Tech ( 20151116 )", "description": "Older adults are among those who could benefit most from fitness trackers, but some experts caution that the devices may have a dark side.", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jane E.
