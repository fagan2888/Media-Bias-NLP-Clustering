(Republican Eagle photo by Joe Brown)\n\nNORTHFIELD \u2013 At first glance, the Red Wing boys cross-country team fell short of its goal for the Class 2A state championship by finishing in 13th place, down from last year\u2019s 12th-place total.\n\nBut considering that the Wingers had a tighter pack (40.2 seconds in 2014 compared to 58.2 last year) while running just three seconds slower than last year with a younger lineup, nobody for Red Wing was disappointed after Saturday\u2019s race at St. Olaf College.\n\n\u201cOur pack was pretty good today,\u201d said George Nemanich, who had a team-best time of 16 minutes, 45.4 seconds that ranked 84th individually. \u201cWe had some guys in the back step up. \u2026 I think we ran quite a bit better from last year.\u201d\n\nWingers head coach Jesse Nelson chimed in, \u201cWe ran well \u2026 a lot better than last year. You can\u2019t control what the other teams do.\u201d\n\nWayzata went on to win its second straight 2A title by scoring 47 points, holding off Hopkins (87), Stillwater (87), St. Michael-Albertville (153) and Chaska (180). Rochester Century, the Section 1AA champion, placed ninth with 263.\n\nCompared to last year\u2019s state meet, Nemanich managed nearly 20 seconds off his 2013 time of 17:04.2.\n\n\u201cI liked my position. In the middle of the race, it kind of slowed down a bit on the open part, and on that last loop, I passed quite a few people,\u201d Nemanich said. \u201cI ran fairly well up until those last 100 meters, then I got passed by some guys. What\u2019s done is done.\u201d\n\nA trio of Red Wing seniors \u2013 Marcus Warrington (120th, 17:09.4), Meyer Beckner (122nd, 17:11.5) and Philip Mitchell (141st, 17:19.4) \u2013 ran within 10 seconds of each other to take the two-through-four spots. Asa Beckner claimed the last scoring spot for the Wingers, placing 146th with a time of 17:25.6.\n\n\u201cWe came up here (Friday) and our strategy was that last mile. We divided (the race) up into sections and we were focused on that last section,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe just replayed it in our minds and our feet followed.\u201d\n\nForest Evanson (154th, 17:33.5) and Tom Nemanich (170th, 17:53.7) also crossed the finish line for the Wingers. While several spots can be decided by fractions of a second, the strength of the Wingers\u2019 pack gave the team a needed lift.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no better feeling than when you can see the red wings on the back of the jersey in front of you,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nGirls\n\nJasmyn Armstrong had aspirations of finishing in the top 10 of Class 2A, and teammate Kianna Stewart wanted to be near the top 50 heading into Saturday\u2019s state championship.\n\nEverything went according to plan for the Winger duo as Armstrong took All-State honors with a 10th-place finish (14:19.1) while Stewart had a strong state debut by taking 56th (15:06.8).\n\n\u201cThey went right in line with what we were hoping,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cWe figured third-through-10th were in (Armstrong\u2019s) range, and for Kianna if you look at the results there are 20 runners in a 10-second span. A lot can change in a group like that.\u201d\n\nBack at state for the second straight year, Armstrong shaved 70.6 seconds off her 80th-place finish from 2013.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super happy (with the results). I was trying and get closer to fifth. That\u2019s what I was ranked and that\u2019s how the times had been at sections,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cI\u2019m happy with 10th. I feel like I had a good race and felt good the whole time, but some of the other girls ran really good today.\u201d\n\nThe race was ultimately won by Megan Hasz of Alexandria, who held off her twin sister, Bethany, with a state championship-record time of 13:40.9. Bethany finished in 13:44.4.\n\n\u201cIn that first mile we wanted her to be in the top group. Then coming out of the woods, she was still with them,\u201d Nelson said of Armstrong. \u201cThe last stretch, when it became a foot-speed race, that\u2019s where she fell behind a little bit.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Stewart tried to keep Armstrong in her sights per her usual race routine. But the mass of runners made that hard to keep up with.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot different because everybody is so fast. It was weird, but it was still fun,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI\u2019m really happy I got to run with such good competition.\u201d\n\nThat competition also helped Stewart stay near her goal of finishing in the top 50.\n\n\u201cThe faster somebody went, I tried to keep up with \u2018em,\u201d Stewart said, \u201cthen the next one would come and I\u2019d keep up with them. They kept me at a good pace the whole time.\u201d\n\nIn the team competition, Wayzata won its third straight title with 65 points, followed by Edina (94), Willmar (96), East Ridge (119) and Marshall (168).\n\nBoth Armstrong and Stewart return for next season, and the big-meet experience can only bode well for the Wingers.\n\n\u201cIt was a good meet for Jasmyn; she\u2019s already learned from it and wants to get better for next year,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAs for Kianna, she made her decision late (to join cross-country) so she didn\u2019t run much with us this summer. I\u2019m looking forward to see what she can do next year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,wingers,cross-country,Red Wing", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Joe Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "NORTHFIELD \u2013 At first glance, the Red Wing boys cross-country team fell short of its goal for the Class 2A state championship by finishing in 13th place, down from last year\u2019s 12th-place total.\r\n\r\nBut considering that the Wingers had a tighter pack (40.2 seconds in 2014 compared to 58.2 last yea...", "title": "Cross-Country: Winger boys 13th; Armstrong nabs All-State ho...", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/content/cross-country-winger-boys-13th-armstrong-nabs-all-state-honors", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/George%20Nemanich_3.jpg?itok=oQcG3XAW", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NORTHFIELD \u2013 At first glance, the Red Wing boys cross-country team fell short of its goal for the Class 2A state championship by finishing in 13th place, down from last year\u2019s 12th-place total.\r\n\r\nBut considering that the Wingers had a tighter pack (40.2 seconds in 2014 compared to 58.2 last yea...", "title": "Cross-Country: Winger boys 13th; Armstrong nabs All-State ho...", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/content/cross-country-winger-boys-13th-armstrong-nabs-all-state-honors", "image": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/George%20Nemanich_3.jpg?itok=JRb4_RGU", "site": "republicaneagle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 243322109167890}, "keywords": "sports,wingers,cross-country,Red Wing", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/redwingrepublicaneagle", "tag": "sports,wingers,cross-country,Red Wing", "modified_time": "2014-11-01T19:44:34-05:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Red Wing junior George Nemanich nears the finish of the Class 2A state cross-country championship meet Saturday at St. Olaf College in Northfield.
