Reid, a former Washington Post reporter who is working with ColoradoCareYES, the group that spearheaded the ballot initiative campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s broad appeal here.\u201d\n\nConservative opponents, though, are panning the model as an even bigger government intrusion into health care that would require unsustainable tax increases.\n\n\u201cPeople can say it\u2019s a repeal of Obamacare all they want, but it\u2019s not repealing Obamacare,\u201d said Jonathan Lockwood, executive director of the free market group Advancing Colorado. \u201cIt\u2019s giving a higher dosage of the same failed prescription that Coloradans have no interest in.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has tried to tie Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet to the plan as he runs for re-election. In October, the group wrote that because of his support of Obamacare, \u201ca Bennet-backed single-payer health care plan is no stretch for the imagination.\u201d\n\nBennet, who hasn\u2019t yet commented on the initiative, brushed aside questions when approached in a Senate hallway by a POLITICO reporter on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m focused on this today,\u201d he said, referring to an unrelated vote.\n\nThe ballot initiative could attract a national audience and boost Colorado voter turnout on both sides \u2014 Democrats unhappy about the compromises made to pass Obamacare, as well as conservatives fearful that Obamacare is a stepping stone to a government-run single-payer system.\n\nBernie Sanders, the first major Democratic presidential candidate to advocate for single-payer since California Gov. Jerry Brown in 1992, isn\u2019t weighing in on the Colorado measure. His campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nColorado is an unlikely place for the battle over providing universal health care to residents, an approach far to the left of the Affordable Care Act. It was expected that a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d push would take hold in a state like liberal Vermont, which was the most visible trailblazer until Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin pulled the plug on his plan last year because of cost.\n\nThe dynamics in Colorado are starkly different. Besides being a 2016 presidential swing state, this is a place where Republican congressman Cory Gardner unseated Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Udall last year in a race that focused on reproductive rights. Gov. John Hickenlooper is a Democrat, as was his predecessor, Bill Ritter, who was preceded by a Republican.\n\nSupporters say the elements that sank Vermont\u2019s plan don\u2019t apply in Colorado. Unlike Vermont, advocates are taking their case for \"ColoradoCare\" directly to voters for the 2016 ballot instead of trying to push it through a messy legislative process. Advocates also say Colorado\u2019s plan has more details.\n\nMost of the money to finance the model would come from a new payroll tax estimated to bring in $25 billion per year. Employers would pay two-thirds of the cost and workers would pay one-third. The state is also counting on $11.6 billion in annual federal funding it would otherwise receive through Medicaid and Obamacare.\n\nReid argues the new system would lead to lower administrative costs, more generous coverage without exorbitant deductibles and copays, and insure the people Obamacare has failed to cover \u2014 including undocumented immigrants.\n\nA board of trustees would govern operations, be responsible for setting provider reimbursement rates and could negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical companies. Yet similar to Vermont\u2019s defunct plan, certain populations, including Medicare beneficiaries, are excluded from ColoradoCare. It wouldn\u2019t abolish private insurance companies, who could still sell competing coverage.\n\nFor those reasons, the Colorado system isn\u2019t \u201ctrue\u201d government-run single-payer, said David Himmelstein, the co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program, a leading voice for the single-payer model.\n\nHimmelstein, also a professor of public health at the City University of New York, said the plan is a \u201cbig advance\u201d for the single-payer movement, but advocates have a heavy lift to get the measure passed.\n\n\u201cAny time someone says to a voter, \u2018Vote for this, you\u2019re raising taxes by $25 billion,\u2019 that\u2019s a tough one,\u201d he said.\n\nColorado would need to rely on a piece of Obamacare to do the new plan \u2014 the so-called \"Section 1332\" waivers, which let states develop their own reforms as long as they insure the same number of people with benefits at least as comprehensive as what the ACA provides.\n\nUltimately, such a waiver would need to be approved by the federal government and couldn\u2019t take effect until 2017. ColoradoCare supporters are aiming for the system to begin in January 2019.\n\nLaura Chapin, a Colorado-based Democratic strategist, said the ballot measure will provoke a discussion about health care in the state. \"But the more interesting thing is whether or not the opponents of it try to use it as a political organizing tool,\u201d similar to how conservatives have used Obamacare to boost turnout. However, she cautions, getting a ballot measure approved in Colorado \u201ctakes a whole lot of money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a very wide gulf between getting something on the ballot and getting something passed,\u201d Chapin said.\n\nSingle-payer supporters in Colorado needed 98,492 signatures to get an initiative on the ballot, and the Colorado secretary of state projected they had collected 109,134 valid signatures. ColoradoCareYES had received more than $330,000 in contributions as of the end of September, the most recent state filings show.\n\n\u201cI cannot make predictions,\u201d Chapin said of the measure\u2019s fate. \u201cI just know that getting \u2018yes\u2019 on a ballot measure means pushing a rock up a hill. And it\u2019s been done but it\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nJennifer Haberkorn contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Colorado will vote on the plan long favored by liberals, bringing a big health care fight to the swing state.", "title": "One state\u2019s unlikely Obamacare replacement plan: Single-payer", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/obamacare-colorado-single-payer-health-care-215780", "image": "http://static.politico.com/4f/a9/e57dc5014b23b6636e968965e1a8/colorado-health-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Colorado will vote on the plan long favored by liberals, bringing a big health care fight to the swing state.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| AP Photo Health Care One state\u2019s unlikely Obamacare replacement plan: Single-payer Colorado will vote on the plan long favored by liberals, bringing a big health care fight to the swing state.\n\u201cI just know that getting \u2018yes\u2019 on a ballot measure means pushing a rock up a hill.\n\u201cThere\u2019s broad appeal here.\u201dConservative opponents, though, are panning the model as an even bigger government intrusion into health care that would require unsustainable tax increases.\nLaura Chapin, a Colorado-based Democratic strategist, said the ballot measure will provoke a discussion about health care in the state.\nColorado is an unlikely place for the battle over providing universal health care to residents, an approach far to the left of the Affordable Care Act."}
