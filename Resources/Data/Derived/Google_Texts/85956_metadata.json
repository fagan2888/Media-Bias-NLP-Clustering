Laurence D. Fink, the chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, one of the largest money management firms, is worried about those worries.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean to consumer behavior?\u201d Mr. Fink said during DealBook\u2019s Opportunities for Tomorrow Conference on Tuesday. Healthcare.gov, the website where consumers can buy health coverage on the new consumer exchanges, has been something of a black eye for the Obama administration. Only a few hundred people reportedly signed up for coverage on the first day the site was up and running.\n\nBut Mr. Fink told the audience that the financial implications of the act were potentially more significant than the \u201cnoise about whether the website works or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality is, health care represents 18 percent of our economy,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Fink also said he was disappointed by the announcement in September by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that the government would not yet taper its bond buyback program, adding that he thought it should begin doing so \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\nMr. Fink said he didn\u2019t think the market would be \u201cthat upset\u201d if the Fed began a $5 billion or $10 billion \u201cthematic\u201d tapering from its $85 billion a month program.\n\nPhoto", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131112142601, "twitter": {"description": "Laurence Fink, the chief of BlackRock, said the financial effect of the Affordable Care Act was potentially more significant than the \u201cnoise about whether the website works or not.\u201d", "title": "Fink Worries About Implications of Health Care Law", "url": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/fink-worries-about-implications-of-health-care-law/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/13/business/dbpix-dbconf-fink/dbpix-dbconf-fink-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@dealbook", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000002548268, "CLMST": "Rachel Abrams", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "Hedge Funds", "published_time": 1384284361, "modified_time": "2013-11-13T13:38:10-05:00", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp"}, "keywords": "Fink Laurence D,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Quantitative Easing,BlackRock Inc,Federal Reserve System,HealthCare.gov,DealBook Conference,Financial Services,Healthcare,Hedge Funds", "GBLC": "DealBook Conference;Financial Services;Healthcare;Hedge Funds", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/dealbook/Fink Worries About Implications of Health Care Law ( 20131112 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Rachel Abrams", "SCG": "Dealbook", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/dealbook", "per": "Fink, Laurence D", "byl": "Rachel Abrams", "BN": "dealbook", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/dealbook/post", "description": "Laurence Fink, the chief of BlackRock, said the financial effect of the Affordable Care Act was potentially more significant than the \u201cnoise about whether the website works or not.\u201d", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 12, 2013", "org": "BlackRock Inc;Federal Reserve System;HealthCare.gov", "ticker": "BlackRock Inc|BLK|NYSE", "utime": 20131113133810, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20131112, "pdate": 20131112, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Quantitative Easing", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/13/business/dbpix-dbconf-fink/dbpix-dbconf-fink-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "DealBook", "description": "Laurence Fink, the chief of BlackRock, said the financial effect of the Affordable Care Act was potentially more significant than the \u201cnoise about whether the website works or not.\u201d", "title": "Fink Worries About Implications of Health Care Law", "url": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/fink-worries-about-implications-of-health-care-law/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/13/business/dbpix-dbconf-fink/dbpix-dbconf-fink-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/fink-worries-about-implications-of-health-care-law/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Fink Worries About Implications of Health Care Law", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/13/business/dbpix-dbconf-fink/dbpix-dbconf-fink-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 12, 2013"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb77\"", "article_summary": "Many Americans are worried about how their health care will change under the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cWhat does that mean to consumer behavior?\u201d Mr. Fink said during DealBook\u2019s Opportunities for Tomorrow Conference on Tuesday.\nLaurence D.
