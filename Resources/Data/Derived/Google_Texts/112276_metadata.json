But lately, he\u2019s got a lot to complain about. Excessive government regulations are making it harder and harder for him to earn a living. And he\u2019s not sure what he can do about it.\n\nHernandez is not an energy executive being hassled by the EPA, a banker trying to cope with Dodd-Frank, or a doctor getting nickel-and-dimed by HHS and Obamacare; he\u2019s a long-haul trucker. And his story is one all Republicans running for office should know, because it personifies our government\u2019s war against a large category of middle-class workers who make our economy hum.\n\nReaders of the Wall Street Journal met Hernandez in his truck somewhere on Interstate 10 between El Paso and Los Angeles, thanks to a superb piece of reporting by Betsy Morris last week. This first sentence caught every reader\u2019s attention: \u201cManuel Hernandez is one of a vanishing breed: a professional long-haul trucker.\u201d\n\nLong-haul truckers are vanishing? Is there someone protecting this endangered species? God knows we have enough people fighting for the survival of the dunes sagebrush lizard.\n\nWe soon learned why this breed of middle-class worker is vanishing, and we learned more about the 50-year-old Hernandez, too. Like many truckers, he loves what he does, especially squeezing his 18-wheeler into tight spaces. He\u2019s a guy who doesn\u2019t get his fashion tips from GQ and never once dreamed of landing that big corner office. His office is the rig he works in every day, accompanied by a whole lot of horsepower and thousands of miles of open road.\n\nHernandez\u2019s story got more interesting a bit farther down in the article, as we learned how public policy dictated by bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., was affecting his life \u2014 and the lives of all long-haul truckers \u2014 for the worse: \u201cLately, though, Mr. Hernandez\u2019s patience has been worn thin by a confusing tangle of rules, efficiency directives, and electronic devices that cap his speed, log his every move, and practically try to autopilot his truck. Magnifying the stress are more federal rule changes that took effect in July and are now roiling the industry.\u201d\n\nThe federal agency that is doing all this is the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), an agency within a bigger agency, the Department of Transportation.\n\nUnder a revised rule by the FMCSA\u2019s trucking czars, the average workweek for men and women who make a living carting around America\u2019s stuff was shortened to 70 hours from 82. But that wasn\u2019t the only change. It turns out the required 34-hour break between workweeks must now extend over two nights, including the hours between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., according to Betsy Morris\u2019s article.\n\nThe micromanaging of what truckers can and can\u2019t do is nothing new, but adding this new set of rules to lots of old rules \u2014 particularly one that limited truckers to no more than eleven hours of driving in a day, with a required rest of ten consecutive hours \u2014 has cost Hernandez and truckers like him dearly.\n\nWhy the changes? Has there been a spike of trucking accidents involving sleepy drivers?\n\nActually, no. Crashes involving large trucks declined 26 percent between 2000 and 2011. It turns out that the rule changes were the result of a decade of litigation against the FMCSA by safety advocates and plaintiff lawyers pushing for tougher driving laws.\n\nWhat was supposed to be the upside to the changes foisted by the FMCSA on already-overregulated truckers like Manuel Hernandez? The agency predicts the new rules will prevent about 1,400 crashes and 560 injuries and save 19 lives a year.\n\nWhat do the folks who run trucking businesses think about the new edicts issued from D.C. for their own health and safety? Costs are already up, and business is down \u2014 in some places by as much as 5 percent.\n\nBut no federal bureaucrat ever lost a minute of sleep worrying about declining business or rising costs.\n\nWhat about those 19 lives the bureaucrats say will be saved each year? The irony of all these rules designed to protect Americans from reckless truck drivers \u2014 and protect truck drivers from themselves \u2014 is this: They might actually make our roads more dangerous, because they put more trucks on the road during rush hours. And worse, the rules force truckers to sleep when they might not be sleepy, and drive when they might be tired.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of rule-making only a Washington, D.C., bureaucrat could dream up.\n\nOne thing is certain: The new rules are pushing turnover among long-haul truckers, which was already high, even higher. That\u2019s a great way to improve safety: Drive experienced truckers out of the business and bring in less-experienced drivers to fill the void.\n\nThese new rules are a big deal to Americans because trucking is a $642 billion industry, and truckers cart nearly 70 percent of all the nation\u2019s freight. When costs go up, that\u2019s money out of all of our pockets \u2014 and in this case, for no real reason.\n\nAnd the new rules are a big deal for truck drivers like Manuel Hernandez. As Morris\u2019s story pointed out, Hernandez is a hard-core long-hauler, with average trips of two to three weeks. But he is also a serious family man, and his goal with every trip is to drive as many miles as possible and return home to El Paso to spend his 34-hour break with his wife of 30 years, Teresa.\n\nYou\u2019d think that would be incentive enough to drive safely \u2014 the desire to stay alive, get paid, and get home to your wife. But it isn\u2019t enough to satisfy the whims of Washington.\n\nThe new FMCSA rules have already had a huge impact on Hernandez. Since they took effect in July, he has been stranded on the open road five times; his 70 on-duty hours had run out before he could get back home. On one such occasion, as Morris reported, he dropped a load in Dallas and then drove to a truck stop on Interstate 20 to park and simply wait until the rules allowed him to drive again. \u201cThere was nothing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be a nightmare of having to sit for 48 hours, tired, when all you want to do is get home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho made up these rules?\u201d he asked Morris. \u201cDid they have any experience in driving truck, and traffic, and dealing with customers?\u201d\n\nWhat a silly question; doesn\u2019t he know bureaucrats don\u2019t have customers?\n\nIt turns out that Hernandez and truckers like him are required to take those ten consecutive hours of rest because it supposedly promotes their circadian-rhythm sleep cycle. That\u2019s right; our nation\u2019s bureaucrats know better than the truckers themselves when they should and should not sleep.\n\nThese rules aren\u2019t just stupid, they are hitting Hernandez and other drivers where it hurts most: their wallets. Pay for experienced drivers has plunged to about $50,000 a year from $65,000, Hernandez said.\n\nThings have gotten so bad, and the industry so riddled with regulations, that many drivers are calling it quits. \u201cSometimes I think they\u2019re trying to choke out the trucking industry,\u201d Hernandez lamented.\n\nThis is a real war story all Americans should know about: the war the administrative state is waging against industry upon industry. And all Americans should meet the real-life working-class victims of that war.\n\nForget the fake war on women; let\u2019s start talking to Americans about the war our government is waging against our long-haul truckers.\n\nLet\u2019s tell the very real story of Manuel Hernandez.\n\nAnd see how it stacks up against the fake story of Sandra Fluke.\n\n\u2014 Lee Habeeb is the vice president of content at Salem Radio Network and a senior adviser to AmericaStrong.

When costs go up, that\u2019s money out of all of our pockets \u2014 and in this case, for no real reason.\n\nAnd the new rules are a big deal for truck drivers like Manuel Hernandez. As Morris\u2019s story pointed out, Hernandez is a hard-core long-hauler, with average trips of two to three weeks. But he is also a serious family man, and his goal with every trip is to drive as many miles as possible and return home to El Paso to spend his 34-hour break with his wife of 30 years, Teresa.\n\nYou\u2019d think that would be incentive enough to drive safely \u2014 the desire to stay alive, get paid, and get home to your wife. But it isn\u2019t enough to satisfy the whims of Washington.\n\nThe new FMCSA rules have already had a huge impact on Hernandez. Since they took effect in July, he has been stranded on the open road five times; his 70 on-duty hours had run out before he could get back home. On one such occasion, as Morris reported, he dropped a load in Dallas and then drove to a truck stop on Interstate 20 to park and simply wait until the rules allowed him to drive again. \u201cThere was nothing to do,\u201d he \u00a0said. \u201cIt can be a nightmare of having to sit for 48 hours, tired, when all you want to do is get home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho made up these rules?\u201d he asked Morris. \u201cDid they have any experience in driving truck, and traffic, and dealing with customers?\u201d\n\nWhat a silly question; doesn\u2019t he know bureaucrats don\u2019t have customers?\n\nIt turns out that Hernandez and truckers like him are required to take those ten consecutive hours of rest because it supposedly promotes their circadian-rhythm sleep cycle. That\u2019s right; our nation\u2019s bureaucrats know better than the truckers themselves when they should and should not sleep.\n\nThese rules aren\u2019t just stupid, they are hitting Hernandez and other drivers where it hurts most: their wallets. Pay for experienced drivers has plunged to about $50,000 a year from $65,000, Hernandez said.\n\nThings have gotten so bad, and the industry so riddled with regulations, that many drivers are calling it quits. \u201cSometimes I think they\u2019re trying to choke out the trucking industry,\u201d Hernandez lamented.\n\nThis is a real war story all Americans should know about: the war the administrative state is waging against industry upon industry. And all Americans should meet the real-life working-class victims of that war.\n\nForget the fake war on women; let\u2019s start talking to Americans about the war our government is waging against our long-haul truckers.\n\nLet\u2019s tell the very real story of Manuel Hernandez.\n\nAnd see how it stacks up against the fake story of Sandra Fluke.\n\n\u2014 Lee Habeeb is the vice president of content at Salem Radio Network and a senior adviser to AmericaStrong.
