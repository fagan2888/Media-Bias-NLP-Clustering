(WOOD) \u2014 Everyone in Michigan who has health insurance through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan saw a rate increase on premiums of about 9% this year, but depending on who is insured, that increase could be even higher.\n\nJoanne Bruxvoort, 64, got a letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan last week that said she could keep her insurance plan, but she would have to pay an additional about $100 a month to cover the premium increase.\n\nHer monthly premium for 2014 was $220 a month, but the letter she received said the premium would increase to $318 a month.\n\n\u201cI just have to now drop to a lower type of care for my insurance, and I still would be paying $20 more,\u201d said Bruxvoort.\n\nThere are four levels of health care: catastrophic, bronze, silver and gold. Bruxvoort currently has a silver plan. With the premium increase, she will pay more per month starting in January even if she drops down to a bronze plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just frustrating because now your life is revolving \u2014 which mine is now \u2014 around medical, and medical bills, and insurance, and Obamacare and Blue Cross, and it has been ever since I signed up,\u201d Bruxvoort said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act \u2014 more generally referred to as Obamacare \u2014 said insurance companies have to explain why their premium rates go up if they\u2019re hiked by 10% or more. Blue Cross, Blue Shield of Michigan increased premiums across the board by 9%.\n\nRick Notter, the director of Individual Business for BCBSM, said that premium rate increases are mostly reliant on \u201cincreasing health care costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a variety of factors that go into rate increases each year,\u201d Notter said in a phone interview. \u201cA lot of that has to do with the underlying medical costs and the trend in medical costs that cause things to increase from year to year. The Affordable Care Act tried to [level] some of that and keep premiums from going up faster than they have in the past, but those rising medical costs are the biggest factors in terms of premiums increasing year to year.\u201d\n\nThe law also allows insurance companies to hike premiums based on special factors like age, geographic location and tobacco use.\n\nThat means people like Bruxvoort may see a 28% increase, or even higher.\n\nYounger people are paying more, too.\n\n\u201cThis difference is lower than what it was previous to the Affordable Care Act. In the past, you can have as much as a five-to-one or six-to-one difference between someone who\u2019s 21 and someone that\u2019s age 64. Now the maximum difference is a three-to-one factor,\u201d said Notter.\n\nSsince the law says that older people can\u2019t be charged more than three times the price of younger clients, insurance companies hiked the price for younger clients instead of lowering older people\u2019s insurance rates.\n\nNotter said that some older clients may have seen a slight decrease in premiums after the ACA went into effect.\n\n\u201cWhere do you go? You\u2019re stuck. You have to pay. You have to have health coverage so you\u2019ve got to pay it, and it just gets worse,\u201d said Bruxvoort.\n\nEveryone from BCBSM officials to those at Cherry Street Health Services who help with enrollment said that if you aren\u2019t happy with costs or coverage, the best thing to do is to shop around and check HealthCare.gov to see if there\u2019s a better plan to meet your needs.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nOnline:\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan\n\nHealthCare.gov\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nMore\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Everyone who has health insurance through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan saw a rate increase on premiums of about 9%.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488527284", "og": {"site_name": "WOODTV.com", "description": "Everyone who has health insurance through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan saw a rate increase on premiums of about 9%.", "title": "BCBS of Michigan increases premiums", "url": "http://woodtv.com/2014/11/17/bcbs-of-michigan-increases-premiums/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/bcbs-2015-plan.jpg", "height": 370}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Everyone who has health insurance through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan saw a rate increase on premiums of about 9%.", "title": "BCBS of Michigan increases premiums", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/bcbs-2015-plan.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@woodtv", "site": "WOODTV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Grand Rapids, MI news, weather, sports and traffic", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wood", "fb": {"pages": 20114386235}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://woodtv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/28c7d45e6d62506344f0aad2af937984?s=16", "application-name": "WOODTV.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/woodtv", "published_time": "2014-11-17T23:38:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-17T23:38:37+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "nqHTbbkW32A8Ssjvec6oDik57M8cANvAMyR0LzfR1to", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Blue Cross, Blue Shield of Michigan increased premiums across the board by 9%.\nBYRON CENTER, Mich.
