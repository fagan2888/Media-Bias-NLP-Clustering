PE-Backed American Safety Adds to Wave of E-Learning Deals

The online course provider bought the Online Traffic School, which provides driver safety instruction

Private equity-backed American Safety Council has acquired the Online Traffic School, adding to a recent wave of e-learning M&A.

The Online Traffic School, headquartered in Camarillo, California, provides 45 driver safety and driver improvement courses in 28 states. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

The acquisitions expands American Safety's footprint. The Orlando, Florida, company provides e-learning and training services for transportation, workplace safety, testing, medical continuing education and other groups. American Safety is backed by Falfurrias Capital, which acquired it in May.

Falfurrias, a Charlotte, North Carolina private equity firm, was founded by former Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) CEO Hugh McColl Jr., and the former Bank of America CFO Marc Oken. In March, the firm agreed to buy Advanced Control Systems, which makes products that control power distribution.

Several companies have purchased e-learning businesses lately. In December, the Riverside Co. invested in Mintra Trainingportal AS, an Oslo, Norway-based learning-management system that provides training for oil and gas employees. Also in December, Bertelsmann SE agreed to buy online-course provider Relias Learning. For more, see E-Learning Providers Eager to Expand.
