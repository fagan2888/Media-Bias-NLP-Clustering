Since then he has won 24 World Cup races, five World Cup giant slalom titles, an Olympic gold medal in GS (2014), four world championships gold medals including three in 2013 and a world champs bronze.\n\nAt the world championships today he will be the strongest U.S. hope in the alpine combined, which consists of a downhill run this morning and one run of slalom this afternoon. He is the defending world champion in the event.\n\nLigety\u2019s toughest challenge today may come from Alexis Pinturault of France.\n\n\u201cHe probably is a better slalom skier than me, definitely a better slalom skier than me on most days,\u201d Ligety said. \u201cIn downhill, hopefully I can put some time on him.\u201d\n\nLigety, Pinturault and Marcel Hirscher of Austria have ruled giant slalom for years. Hirscher could contend in today\u2019s combined, but he\u2019s not good in downhill.\n\n\u201cMarcel is so far off in downhill that it could be a tough battle for him,\u201d Ligety said. \u201cAlexi is really good in downhill and he\u2019s good in slalom.\u201d\n\nLigety used to be really good in slalom, but his slalom is \u201chit or miss \u2026 Some days it\u2019s really good, some days it\u2019s a struggle.\u201d\n\nThe combined downhill is scheduled for 10 a.m., with the slalom run scheduled for 2:15 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Alex Pinturault,Park City,ted ligety,World Cup Skiing", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "Beaver Creek -- Ted Ligety first came to the attention of the American public in 2006 when he won a surprise gold medal in combined at the Torino Olympics.", "title": "All eyes on Ted Ligety today in combined event at world champs", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2015/02/08/eyes-ted-ligety-today-combined-event-world-champs/27416/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2015/02/blogs.denverpost.com-Ted-Ligety-in-super-G-1-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Beaver Creek -- Ted Ligety first came to the attention of the American public in 2006 when he won a surprise gold medal in combined at the Torino Olympics.", "title": "All eyes on Ted Ligety today in combined event at world champs", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2015/02/08/eyes-ted-ligety-today-combined-event-world-champs/27416/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2015/02/blogs.denverpost.com-Ted-Ligety-in-super-G-1-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@johnmeyer", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Beaver Creek -- Ted Ligety first came to the attention of the American public in 2006 when he won a surprise gold medal in combined at the Torino Olympics."}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe probably is a better slalom skier than me, definitely a better slalom skier than me on most days,\u201d Ligety said.\nSince then he has won 24 World Cup races, five World Cup giant slalom titles, an Olympic gold medal in GS (2014), four world championships gold medals including three in 2013 and a world champs bronze.\nAt the world championships today he will be the strongest U.S. hope in the alpine combined, which consists of a downhill run this morning and one run of slalom this afternoon.\nBeaver Creek \u2014 Ted Ligety first came to the attention of the American public in 2006 when he won a surprise gold medal in combined at the Torino Olympics.\n\u201cMarcel is so far off in downhill that it could be a tough battle for him,\u201d Ligety said."}
