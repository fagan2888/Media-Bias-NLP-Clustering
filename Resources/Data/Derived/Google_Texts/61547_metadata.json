Food, drinks and music the weathers awesome hey why not,\" said Schooners General Manager, Michael Whitmer.\n\nThe party is for a good cause. The toy drive benefits the local chapter of the Children's Home Society. Everyone who attends is encouraged to bring a new, unwrapped toy for a child in need.\n\n\"Last year we got a big box out front where the toys get dropped and last year we filled that up a couple of times and I anticipate we will again this year and it ends up being quite a haul and it's pretty cool when you think that those toys are gonna go to somebody that might not have got anything for Christmas,\" said Whitmer.\n\n\"I really like that they incorporated because instead of just coming out and hanging out with each other you can do something and give back to all the kids who won't get any presents this year for Christmas so I think it's awesome,\" said Olivia Quave.\n\nSchooners will continue the party Saturday night. Live music and entertainment will start at 10:30.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We made it through Thanksgiving, but now the winter holidays are right around the corner, and Schooners didn't waste any time spreading holiday cheer.", "language": "english", "author": "Kelly Baumgarten", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Schooners-hosts-holiday-party--toy-drive-356401741.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/schooners.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "We made it through Thanksgiving, but now the winter holidays are right around the corner, and Schooners didn't waste any time spreading holiday cheer.", "title": "Schooners hosts holiday party & toy drive"}, "twitter": {"description": "We made it through Thanksgiving, but now the winter holidays are right around the corner, and Schooners didn't waste any time spreading holiday cheer.", "title": "Schooners hosts holiday party & toy drive", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Schooners-hosts-holiday-party--toy-drive-356401741.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/schooners.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Schooners hosts holiday party & toy drive", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Schooners hosts holiday party"}, "article_summary": "Friday was the first night of Schooners' holiday party and toy drive.\nGuests enjoyed live music by a bonfire on the beach and kids got free hot chocolate and s'mores, and Santa Claus himself even made an appearance.\nLive music and entertainment will start at 10:30.\nSchooners will continue the party Saturday night.\nWe made it through Thanksgiving, but now the winter holidays are right around the corner, and Schooners didn't waste any time spreading holiday cheer."}
