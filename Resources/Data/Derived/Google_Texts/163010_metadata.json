The children\u2019s mother, Shaunna Broadway, has now shared disturbing images of the boys\u2019 injuries to warn others about the dangers of sunburn in children.\n\nWhen Broadway picked up her sons from \"Happiness is a Learning Center,\" she was shocked to see the severity of their sunburn.\n\n\u201c[The employees] were actually making fun of my older son, because both boys got sunburns, but he was being a \u2018baby\u2019 and crying about it,\u201d Broadway told BuzzFeed.\n\nThe boy's mother applied cream to soothe the pain caused by the severe sunburn. Photo courtesy of Facebook/ Amanda Harvey\n\nBy Saturday, the burns had developed into painful blisters all over the young boys' bodies. Worst of all, Broadway\u2019s eldest son, who had received the worst burns, began to complain of chest pain. After a local hospital told the mother-of-two that they could do nothing for the boys, she took them to Hillcrest Medical Center in Tulsa to have the blisters lanced off. By Sunday, Broadway\u2019s eldest\u2019s chest pain worsened and the boys were flown to Shriners Hospital for Children in Galveston, Texas.\n\nAccording to Broadway, the children are now in stable condition, although she remains upset with the day care center.\n\n\u201cIt was common sense that they shouldn\u2019t have been out in the sun all day, even if they wore their clothes,\u201d Broadway said. \u201cThe heat index was 118 degrees in Vinita that day. The news was telling us not to be outside.\u201d\n\nPolice are now looking into whether or not charges of child neglect or abuse can be brought up against the day care.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "oklahoma, brothers, admitted, hospital, after, severe, sunburn, injuries, water, park, trip", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Two Oklahoma brothers suffered second- and third-degree burns from their sun exposure at a water park.", "title": "Young Boys With Severe Sunburn Land In Hospital [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/oklahoma-brothers-admitted-hospital-after-severe-sunburn-injuries-water-park-trip-345000", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/07/28/sunburn-1.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two Oklahoma brothers suffered second- and third-degree burns from their sun exposure at a water park.", "title": "Young Boys With Severe Sunburn Land In Hospital [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/oklahoma-brothers-admitted-hospital-after-severe-sunburn-injuries-water-park-trip-345000", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/07/28/sunburn-1.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/28/sunburn-1.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-28T15:55:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-28T16:07:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Two Oklahoma brothers suffered second- and third-degree burns from their sun exposure at a water park."}, "article_summary": "Two Oklahoma brothers suffered second- and third-degree burns from their sun exposure at a water park.\nPhoto courtesy of Facebook/ Amanda HarveyTwo boys, aged 5 and 7, suffered second- and third-degree sunburn while on a day care trip to a water park in Vinita, Okla., last Friday.\nThe children\u2019s mother, Shaunna Broadway, has now shared disturbing images of the boys\u2019 injuries to warn others about the dangers of sunburn in children.\nBy Sunday, Broadway\u2019s eldest\u2019s chest pain worsened and the boys were flown to Shriners Hospital for Children in Galveston, Texas.\nThe boy's mother applied cream to soothe the pain caused by the severe sunburn."}
