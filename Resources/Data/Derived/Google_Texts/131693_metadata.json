No one challenged any of their counterparts or even openly disagreed on the issues.\n\nThere was near 100 percent consensus on a variety of topics including jobs, border security, government spending, Obamacare, the role of the EPA, the VA health care system and the treatment of veterans in general.\n\nSix of the eight Republicans running for the open seat attended the forum at Central Lutheran Church, hosted by the Western Pinal County chapter of the Arizona Republican Assembly. About 75 people attended the event.\n\nIn Casa Grande, familiar faces included Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, former Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett and rancher and oilman Gary Kiehne. Three others, perhaps not as well known in Casa Grande, also participated, including state Sen. Carlyle Begay, R-Ganado, retired Air Force Col. Wendy Rogers and Navajo businessman Shawn Redd.\n\nTwo others running for the seat did not attend; Arizona Speaker of the House David Gowan was at the Legislature working on finalizing a budget. Thomas Whipple, a network security engineer and the most recent candidate to enter the race, was also not present.\n\nWith much consensus, one had to look a bit harder for qualities that set the candidates apart from each other. Although the forum lacked drama, Redd took a veiled jab at Begay \u2013 who is also Navajo \u2013 by saying he\u2019d always been a Republican.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Republican,\u201d Redd said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I just came to recently.\u201d\n\nBegay was appointed as a Democrat to Legislative District 7 in 2013 following the resignation of Democrat Jack C. Jackson Jr. In 2014, Begay won the election for his LD7 seat as a Democrat.\n\nLast November, Begay, known for a conservative voting record, switched from Democrat to Republican.\n\nThe eloquent and soft-spoken Begay said growing up on the reservation, one is expected to be a Democrat, no questions asked. He said his faith guides him, and he found his principles fit the Republican Party. He also spoke of his affinity and respect for working hard and earning everything.\n\n\u201cMy parents taught me that nothing is free,\u201d he said.\n\nBabeu touted his commitment to border security as sheriff and also said he will fight for 2nd Amendment rights \u2013 he had his campaign chairman hold up a large photo of Babeu attending a town hall in Washington, D.C., to speak to President Barack Obama about guns.\n\nBennett, the quintessential budget wonk, said his main objective is to balance the federal budget. He said that may seem like an impossible task but added he could do it in three years. He said a \u201cpenny plan\u201d would have the federal government cut 1 percent a year from its budget for three years.\n\nBennett proposed a \u201ctwo penny plan,\u201d where the budget would be cut by 2 percent a year for three years. He said he wouldn\u2019t run for re-election if he couldn\u2019t deliver that promise in Washington.\n\nRogers talked about her personal touch \u2013 meeting with voters all across the sprawling district by riding her bicycle door-to-door. If elected, she said her top priority would be national defense.\n\n\u201cThese are dangerous times we live in,\u201d she said, adding a lack of funding to the military, specifically the Marines, was \u201ccriminal.\u201d\n\nKiehne railed against the EPA, saying the agency is \u201cshutting down our power plants, shutting down our businesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overkill, folks,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to kill this monstrosity of overreach.\u201d\n\nRedd spent the majority of his talking time emphasizing the importance of bringing the CD1 seat back to the Republican Party. The seat is currently filled by U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-AZ, but she isn\u2019t running for re-election because she\u2019s challenging Republican John McCain for his U.S. Senate seat.\n\nRedd said the district, which includes parts of 12 Native American tribes, is gerrymandered heavily toward Democrats, who he said have a 10 percent voter registration advantage in the district. He wants to flip the district red, and he said he\u2019s the one who can do it.\n\n\u201cWe are sitting in a district controlled and owned by the Democratic Party,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to lose \u2026 we need to fragment the Democrat base, which is the Navajo Nation.\u201d\n\nOther noteworthy comments made during the evening:\n\nBabeu on the debt ceiling and passing a balanced budget: \u201cI would vote against raising the debt ceiling \u2026 No one, as a congressman, can convince me that we can\u2019t cut spending.\u201d\n\nBegay, educated at Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University and owner of a degree in molecular and cellular biology, on his career path: \u201cSo as you can see, I wanted to be a state senator someday.\u201d\n\nRogers, after describing her pilot training in the Air Force as the most difficult time in her life: \u201cI\u2019m no shrinking violet. In Congress, you have to stand up to people and stay true to what you believe.\u201d\n\nKiehne, who\u2019s never served as an elected official, on sending career politicians to Washington: \u201cWe need people there with dirt under their nails and who have balanced their own checkbook.\u201d\n\nRedd on whether or not Apple should have allowed the federal government to unlock the cellphone of the San Bernardino, California, shooter: \u201cI strongly believe Apple was right to refuse access. We can\u2019t trust our federal government (not to abuse that power) \u2026 it\u2019s a slippery slope.\u201d\n\nBennett on his 23 years of experience running a business prior to entering the public sector: \u201cWe need people in Washington who sign the front of a paycheck and not just the back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"url": "http://www.trivalleycentral.com/coolidge_examiner/news/congress-hopefuls-hold-forum-in-cg/article_e98039d8-0c03-11e6-a751-17988ffc122d.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "trivalleycentral.com", "description": "CASA GRANDE \u2014 Familiar and not so familiar faces made their case to be the next Republican representative in Congressional District 1 on Monday night.", "title": "Congress hopefuls hold forum in CG"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "CASA GRANDE \u2014 Familiar and not so familiar faces made their case to be the next Republican representative in Congressional District 1 on Monday night.", "fb": {"admins": "<266179467961>", "app_id": 266179467961}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "pnob7A_ZlKDY1isdeDLyU6W1kqaqdp1JUZJ3eDCa61w", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "Bennett, the quintessential budget wonk, said his main objective is to balance the federal budget.\nAlthough the forum lacked drama, Redd took a veiled jab at Begay \u2013 who is also Navajo \u2013 by saying he\u2019d always been a Republican.\nSix of the eight Republicans running for the open seat attended the forum at Central Lutheran Church, hosted by the Western Pinal County chapter of the Arizona Republican Assembly.\nWith much consensus, one had to look a bit harder for qualities that set the candidates apart from each other.\nHe said a \u201cpenny plan\u201d would have the federal government cut 1 percent a year from its budget for three years."}
