In filling the void left by left guard Orlando Franklin, the Broncos are looking at a player with local ties.

Shelley Smith, a former standout at Colorado State who was released by the Miami Dolphins on Tuesday, is scheduled to visit with the Broncos on Friday. However, the Seattle Seahawks will get the first crack at Smith; he was on his way to Seattle Wednesday night with a full visit scheduled for Thursday.

Smith was drafted by the Houston Texans in 2011, when Gary Kubiak was coach, and is familiar with the zone-blocking scheme the Broncos will employ in 2015.

Tamme, Unrein return? The Broncos opened discussions with tight end Jacob Tamme and defensive tackle Mitch Unrein with hopes of re-signing the veterans.

If Tamme returns, the Broncos would not be signing free-agent James Casey, who visited the team last week. Unrein could be well suited to play for new defensive line coach Bill Kollar at defensive end.

Elway also mentioned trying to sign a free-agent defensive tackle to join Sylvester Williams and Marvin Austin. Broncos’ free-agent defensive tackle Terrance Knighton visited Washington on Wednesday.

Draft picks. The Broncos expect to receive three or four compensatory picks on top of the six they already have for the 2015 draft that will be held April 30-May 2.

“We’re going to have 10 draft picks. And we only have 53 spots,” Elway said.

And the Broncos still have a backlog of draft picks they’ve had trouble getting on the field.
