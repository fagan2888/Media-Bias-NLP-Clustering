Shutdown brings out Paul's soft side\n\nRand Paul is no wacko bird. Just ask Lindsey Graham.\n\n\u201cRand Paul\u2019s been incredibly responsible,\u201d Graham (R-S.C.), who has clashed with Paul in the past, said just before the Senate voted to end the government shutdown. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a side of Rand I haven\u2019t seen before. That\u2019s one of the pluses of this whole deal. He\u2019s been great.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAccording to many moderate GOP observers, the Kentucky Republican and likely 2016 contender has deftly maneuvered the past several weeks of shutdown politics, toeing the conservative line without alienating the rest of the party \u2014 especially compared to his frequent sidekick, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\n\nA key challenge for Paul if he runs would be to make himself acceptable to \u2014 if not win over \u2014 traditional Republicans. His low-key approach to the shutdown and debt limit drama could help that cause.\n\n( WATCH: 7 defining quotes from Rand Paul)\n\n\u201cHe was a reasonable voice in a very difficult time for the party,\u201d said one top national GOP strategist. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t as strident as Cruz. When he recognized there was no real end game in sight, he recoiled. He wasn\u2019t on the tip of the spear. I think that did him a lot of good with a lot of Republicans, a lot of conservatives.\u201d\n\nEven Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) \u2014 whose budding presidential campaign is predicated upon taking on Paul and the tea party wing of the GOP \u2014 had kind words for how the Kentuckian has acquitted himself.\n\nPaul is \u201ca gentleman,\u201d King said. In contrast, \u201cTed Cruz is totally different,\u201d he continued. \u201cI consider him to be a demagogue. \u2026 I\u2019d say by comparison, Sen. Paul has gotten better. I have real problems with Sen. Paul\u2019s positions, but Ted Cruz is in a class by himself.\u201d\n\n( QUIZ: Do you know Rand Paul?)\n\nPaul was deemed a \u201cwacko bird\u201d in March by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) \u2014 who later apologized and told POLITICO their relationship is \u201ccordial\u201d \u2014 and he isn\u2019t reincarnating himself as a moderate. The Kentuckian was one of 19 senators to vote with Cruz on a cloture vote concerning a spending measure that set the government shutdown in motion, and he opposed the final deal. But it was Lee who was leading the charge with Cruz on the procedural cloture vote, in which Obamacare funding was a key sticking point \u2014 not Paul.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Cruz talked for 21 hours against a spending measure that eventually moved forward with the GOP leadership\u2019s support; refused to condemn threats to wage primary challenges against his GOP colleagues; and generally urged Republicans to not budge in the face of a government shutdown. The Texan was widely seen, among Democrats and Republicans alike, as leading the party into a unwinnable battle over Obamacare and leaving the GOP with a big black eye that party hands can only hope will heal before next year\u2019s midterms.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Many moderate GOP observers say the Kentucky Republican has deftly maneuvered the shutdown.", "title": "Shutdown brings out Paul's soft side", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/rand-paul-shows-softer-side-during-shutdown-98495.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/17/131017_rand_paul_smile_605_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Government Shutdown (815),Senate Republicans (397),Rand Paul", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Many moderate GOP observers say the Kentucky Republican has deftly maneuvered the shutdown.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2658\"", "article_summary": "Shutdown brings out Paul's soft sideRand Paul is no wacko bird.\nI have real problems with Sen.
