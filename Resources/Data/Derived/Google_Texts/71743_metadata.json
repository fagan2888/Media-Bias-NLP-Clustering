But his differences didn\u2019t make him stand out academically or athletically.\n\n\u201c[In] the second grade, I remember being pulled out by my teacher, saying that I can\u2019t return to school until I start wearing girl\u2019s clothes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the first time I realized there\u2019s something wrong with me.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe world saw me as a girl. What I saw was \u2026 I didn\u2019t know what I saw. I just know that it was not that.\u201d\n\nConfused and ashamed, Thai spent the next 16 years struggling to find a sense of self that fit. It wasn\u2019t until 2012, when Thai came out as transgender, that he began to feel whole. A few months later, he says he knew it was time to change his outer appearance to match his inner person.\n\nBut little did he know that his journey would mean confronting a medical system ill prepared and often unwilling to embrace transgender patients.\n\nIn fact, a Web search reveals just how few American doctors specialize in performing complicated surgeries to change physical and sexual characteristics as part of some people\u2019s gender transitions. TSSurgeryGuide.com lists fewer than 30 physicians who offer sexual reassignment surgery, mostly located on the coasts.\n\nWhile a few more surgeons might not have been listed, that number is probably in the ballpark, according to medical professionals who told America Tonight that people who are transgender are dangerously underserved by the medical system, especially when it comes to surgical specialties.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Only a small number of surgeons can take on the high volume of Americans wanting sex reassignment surgery", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/articles/2015/8/28/transgender-doctor-shortage-surgery-america.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/dam/ajam/images/articles_2015/08/transgender_surgery.jpg", "height": 913}, "type": "article", "description": "Only a small number of surgeons can take on the high volume of Americans wanting sex reassignment surgery", "title": "Transgender Americans face dearth of sexual reassignment surgeons"}, "LastModifiedDate": "Fri, 28 Aug 2015 21:46:51 GMT", "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/dam/ajam/images/articles_2015/08/transgender_surgery.jpg", "description": "Americans seeking sexual reassignment surgery have found that specialists are few and far between", "card": "summary", "title": "Transgender Americans face dearth of sexual reassignment surgeons"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Transgender, Gay Rights, America Tonight, U.S., Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But little did he know that his journey would mean confronting a medical system ill prepared and often unwilling to embrace transgender patients.\nFrom the age of 7, Jayden Thai knew he was different.\nWhat I saw was \u2026 I didn\u2019t know what I saw.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2012, when Thai came out as transgender, that he began to feel whole.\nA few months later, he says he knew it was time to change his outer appearance to match his inner person."}
