But they\u2019re real \u2026 and they\u2019re fabulous.\n\n1. Desert rain frog\n\n(calphotos.berkley.edu/Arie van der Meijden)\n\nThis adorable species of frog is native to South Africa and Namibia. As a mating call, the frog can emit a very high-pitched whistle, making it look and sound like some kind of squeak toy. They are currently considered vulnerable, with their population experiencing a decline due to extensive mining.\n\n2. Prehensile-tailed porcupine\n\n(Flickr/Eric Kilby)\n\nhttps://www.thedodo.com/rhino-horn-trade-spike-crime-873580449.html Like the desert rain frog, the prehensile-tailed porcupine has a uniquely adorable squeak (this guy sounds like a bicycle horn). Found throughout South America, these amazing critters have muscular, prehensile tails that allow them to move through trees.\n\n3. Solenodon\n\n(Mongabay.com/Jeremy Hance)\n\nContrary to his appearance, the solenodon is not a rat or a shrew who\u2019s had his nose pinched too hard; they belong to their own genus, and were discovered way back in 1833. The solenodon can survive on a number of different foods including worms, reptiles and insects.\n\n4. Beelzebub\u2019s tube-nosed bat\n\n(Wikimedia/PumpkinSky)\n\nLooking more like a fuzzy refrigerator magnet than an agent of Satan, the Beelzebub\u2019s tube-nosed bat is a relatively new discovery who was found in Vietnam in 2011. Although the bat usually shies away from humans, he can get pretty feisty when confronted with a predator!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Strange but true: The Venezuelan poodle moth, pictured here, was originally believed to be an Internet hoax", "title": "7 little-known animals that are delightfully weird", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Strange but true: The Venezuelan poodle moth, pictured here, was originally believed to be an Internet hoax", "title": "7 little-known animals that are delightfully weird", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/14/7_little_known_animals_that_are_delightfully_weird_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/980x-e1418424103442.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Strange but true: The Venezuelan poodle moth, pictured here, was originally believed to be an Internet hoax", "title": "7 little-known animals that are delightfully weird", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/980x-e1418424103442.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Aaron Rodriques", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Poodle Moth, Prehensile-Tailed Porcupine, The Dodo, Venezuela", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Poodle Moth, Prehensile-Tailed Porcupine, The Dodo, Venezuela, Life NewsThis piece originally appeared on The DodoThese animals are not well-known.\nPrehensile-tailed porcupine(Flickr/Eric Kilby)https://www.thedodo.com/rhino-horn-trade-spike-crime-873580449.html Like the desert rain frog, the prehensile-tailed porcupine has a uniquely adorable squeak (this guy sounds like a bicycle horn).\nDesert rain frog(calphotos.berkley.edu/Arie van der Meijden)This adorable species of frog is native to South Africa and Namibia.\nBut they\u2019re real \u2026 and they\u2019re fabulous.\nAlthough the bat usually shies away from humans, he can get pretty feisty when confronted with a predator!"}
