Simply stated, a convoluted tax code, bloated budget, and regulatory morass create endless opportunities for well-connected insiders to obtain unearned and undeserved wealth.\n\nIs this evidence that Washington is broken?\n\nIn a column for Real Clear Politics., Mike Needham of Heritage Action suggests that the conventional wisdom is wrong. Washington actually works very well, but not for the American people.\n\nWashington isn\u2019t broken. It is a well-oiled machine that works for the well-connected and responds to the well-heeled. This corrupt nexus of favoritism and cronyism tends to leave hardworking Americans behind. \u2026as we\u2019ve seen with Obamacare, the bigger the government, the bigger the Bigs become.\n\nIs he right? Well, let\u2019s look at some evidence. We already know ObamaCare has been a boon for hacks from the Democratic Party.\n\nBut did you know that lots of GOP insiders also are cashing in because of ObamaCare?\n\nLet\u2019s not limit our analysis to Obamacare.\n\nThere are many other examples of how the folks in Washington live on Easy Street at our expense. For instance, they enjoy lavish junkets. Here\u2019s what theWashington Post reported back in September.\n\nAs Congress returned Tuesday\u2026, some 14 House members were resting up from a week-long trip to Hawaii. \u2026It sounded like a fine journey via military jet (business class) to stay at the oceanfront Sheraton Waikiki in Honolulu. Dinners were planned at the famous Hy\u2019s Steak House \u2014 the superb porterhouse is always worth the $88.95 \u2014 and the upscale Roy\u2019s Hawaii with its great fusion menu. (We hope they tried the lobster pot stickers.) \u2026The schedule thoughtfully included substantial \u201cexecutive time\u201d in the afternoons. This, as Loop Fans know, is often a thinly veiled euphemism for some fine lounging at the pool, or exploring beautiful Hawaii.\n\nThis boondoggle was especially irksome to me since I was in Hawaii at the same time. But I had to pay my own way! And my hotel was right next to Hy\u2019s Steak House, which had a very appealing menu, but I didn\u2019t go because taxpayers weren\u2019t financing my meals.\n\nSpeaking of integrity in D.C., here\u2019s a story from the Washington Post that belongs in the is-anyone-actually-surprised category.\n\nThe Honest Tea firm, which makes organic iced tea, set up a stand offering bottles of its tea at 27 cities throughout the country, including D.C., and used the honor system by asking people to leave $1 in a box when they took a tea. But in the District\u2019s Dupont Circle neighborhood, someone stole money from the box. Executives at Honest Tea wouldn\u2019t say exactly how much was in the box but said it ranged between $5 to $20. The theft happened in the early morning, officials believe, and they did not report it to police. It was the first time in the six years that the company has been doing its experiment that someone has actually stolen money from the collection box, officials with Honest Tea said.\n\nBy the way, Dupont Circle is a ritzy part of town, not a low-income ghetto.\n\nI\u2019m guessing the thief is a lobbyist or bureaucrat, someone who already has a track record of taking other people\u2019s money.\n\nBut if you really want to see Washington at its most unseemly, the Clinton machine symbolizes the corrupt nexus of big government and cronyism. Here are some passages from a report by Politico.\n\nA spring 2012 email to Hillary Clinton\u2019s top State Department aide, Huma Abedin, asked for help winning a presidential appointment for a supporter of the Clinton Foundation, according to a chain obtained by POLITICO. The messages illustrate the relationship between Clinton\u2019s most trusted confidante and the private consulting company that asked for the favor, Teneo \u2014 a global firm that later hired Abedin. Abedin signed on with the company while she still held a State Department position, a dual employment that is now being examined by congressional investigators. \u2026Abedin also worked as an adviser to the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit founded by former President Bill Clinton.\n\nThis is amazing. Working for an influence-peddling company while on the government payroll as well?!?\n\nAnd speaking of influence peddling, check out these excerpts from another Politico story.\n\nCampaigns are required to file reports detailing registered lobbyists who round up donations, but that number is only a small slice of the fundraisers who work in some capacity in Washington\u2019s vast influence industry\u2026 A quarter of the \u201cHillblazers\u201d who bundled $100,000 or more for Clinton work at lobbying firms or public affairs agencies lobby at the state level or otherwise make their living from influencing the government on behalf of special interests\u2026 Clinton received at least $5.4 million from professional influencers, compared with $3.2 million from registered lobbyists disclosed to the FEC. For Bush, the equivalent figures are $1.02 million and just under $408,000.\n\nThe Hill also has a story about D.C. insiders flocking to Hillary Clinton.\n\nK Street is banking on Hillary Clinton, with more than twice as many Washington lobbyists donating to the former secretary of State\u2019s presidential campaign than any other candidate. Clinton \u2014 the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination \u2014 received at least $625,703 from 316 registered lobbyists and corporate PACs during the first half of the year, according to disclosure forms. \u2026Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush ranks as a distant second in the influence industry, collecting $444,500 from 140 lobbyists.\n\nAnd why are lobbyists coughing up cash?\n\nFor the simple reason that they want access. And with access to politicians, that means they get access to other people\u2019s money.\n\n\u2026support from K Street can not only help boost a candidate, but also put lobbyists in good standing with the candidate in the event he or she takes the White House. \u2026lobbyists have hedged their bets by supporting several candidates, sometimes at the request of clients, they told The Hill, asking for anonymity.\n\nThough keep in mind that Ms. Clinton and her cronies are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nShe\u2019s more guilty than most for the simple reason that she actively wants to expand government, which would create even more opportunities for mischief.\n\nLet\u2019s also be fair in acknowledging that this problem exists in other countries. Indeed, it\u2019s probably worse elsewhere.\n\nVote buying in India, for instance, can be especially challenging. Check out these passages from a Reuters report.\n\nVillage bachelors in northern India are demanding brides for votes in state polls next month because of a shortage of women after decades of illegal abortions of female fetuses, the Mail Today reported on Thursday.\n\nThough it appears that some Indian politicians actually are willing to say no to voters.\n\nPoliticians have dismissed the demand, the report said.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s quite possible that the politicians are saying no in public and then somehow trying arrange brides behind the scenes.\n\nTime to conclude with some excerpts from a story about our ruling class in Washington.\n\nThousands of clients using the affair-oriented Ashley Madison website listed email addresses registered to the White House, top federal agencies and military branches, a data dump by hackers revealed. The detailed data, released Tuesday, will likely put Washington, D.C., on edge. The nation\u2019s capital reportedly has the highest rate of membership for the site of any city. Indeed, more than 15,000 of the email addresses used to register accounts were hosted on government and military servers.\n\nThe key words above are \u201chighest rate of membership.\u201d Yup, these are the people who think they should tell us how to live our lives. These are the clowns who think they can spend our money better than we can. These are the buffoons who want to direct and control the private economy.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, corruption, Washington DC, progressivism, big government, limited government, Daniel Mitchell, CATO Institute", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "Big government is the mother\u2019s milk of corruption and Hillary Clinton, as well as the entire Clinton clan, are the epitome of this political truth.", "title": "Hillary Clinton, Big Government, and Washington Corruption", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 740, "identifier": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Chelsea-Hillary-Bill-Clinton-money.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/politics/2015/11/05/hillary-clinton-big-government-and-washington-corruption/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Big government is the mother\u2019s milk of corruption and Hillary Clinton, as well as the entire Clinton clan, are the epitome of this political truth.", "creator": "@danieljmitchell", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Chelsea-Hillary-Bill-Clinton-money.jpg", "title": "Hillary Clinton, Big Government, and Washington Corruption | People's Pundit Daily", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/politics/2015/11/05/hillary-clinton-big-government-and-washington-corruption/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/32074", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/32074", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "keywords": "Hillary Clinton, corruption, Washington DC, progressivism, big government, limited government, Daniel Mitchell, CATO Institute", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "progressivism", "published_time": "2015-11-05T14:44:56-04:00"}, "description": "Big government is the mother\u2019s milk of corruption and Hillary Clinton, as well as the entire Clinton clan, are the epitome of this political truth."}, "article_summary": "K Street is banking on Hillary Clinton, with more than twice as many Washington lobbyists donating to the former secretary of State\u2019s presidential campaign than any other candidate.\nThe detailed data, released Tuesday, will likely put Washington, D.C., on edge.\nBut if you really want to see Washington at its most unseemly, the Clinton machine symbolizes the corrupt nexus of big government and cronyism.\n\u2026Abedin also worked as an adviser to the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit founded by former President Bill Clinton.\nI\u2019ve explained, over and over and over again, that big government is the mother\u2019s milk of corruption."}
