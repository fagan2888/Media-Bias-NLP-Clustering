There is one way to ensure it, however.\n\nIt\u2019s not about gaining delegates and managing conventions. It\u2019s about electronic voting. You\u2019d think Republicans would run from high-risk electronic voting systems, but Utah\u2019s Republican establishment thought differently. In its recent primary, GOP voters could vote via computer, tablets, and smartphones, all because of a UK company called Smartmatic\u2014this according to a Breitbart release by Aaron Klein on March 20, 2016. Cool, but dangerous.\n\nNever mind that the chairman of Smartmatic is Gordon Malloch-Brown, BFF to George Soros and board member on Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation, and other Soros-financed organizations. Never mind Smartmatic and all others claim their security is fraud-proof. That\u2019s like saying they can accurately count every leaf on a large maple tree, and come November, tell us which are red and which are not.\n\nDemocrats like to say Republicans are anti-online voting because such freedoms keep the poor away from the polls. These are the same people who claim it\u2019s too hard for the poor to obtain Voter IDs, but voting via their personal computer, tablet, or cell phone\u2014which must be less expensive than a Voter ID?\u2014will make them full citizens.\n\nA new book summarized by its author, Michael Waldman, on Billmoyers.com is The Fight to Vote and parrots the claim progressives drag in front of us to prove there is little or no vote fraud in U.S. elections. The entire article focuses on in-person vote fraud, one-off anecdotes, of which there are, indeed, relatively few examples. Yet, the author goes on and on about the \u201cGOP witch hunt for voter fraud\u201d without once discussing the probability of large-scale electronic or online vote fraud. The magician\u2019s trick of shining a bright light on one part of the stage while keeping the real action in shadow nicely deflects us from the real\u2014not imagined\u2014threat of massive electronic vote fraud.\n\nWhile many states have begun to recognize the ridiculous ease with which a third party or foreign power might upend an election, there remain many others operating without a safety net. According to Ballotpedia.org, fourteen states still do Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) System voting with and without a paper trail (emphasis added).Among them are Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia\u2014at least four being key battleground states. Interestingly, it was Virginia that stress-tested its voting systems and found one company so vulnerable to third party hacking it was de-certified from operating within the state (see its report from April 15, 2015).\n\nThankfully, twenty states still do business the old-fashioned, safe and secure way: paper ballot, but the pressure is on them to \u201cmodernize.\u201d To what expense? In a USAToday piece from September 19, 2012, it was reported that, \u201cin 2010, a University of Michigan assistant professor of computer science and three assistants hacked into Washington, DC\u2019s online voting system during a test. They manipulated it undetected, even programming it to play the Michigan fight song.\u201d \u201cToo many states are choosing convenience over reliability,\u201d the paper reported, and without a paper trail of any kind, \u201cthere\u2019s no way to know whether the machine has recorded the vote accurately, or for that matter, recorded it at all.\u201d In one 2004 example, in Carteret County, NC, 4530 electronic votes evaporated when the equipment ran out of memory.\n\nAmazingly, California may be ahead of the game. According to Thomas Elias, in a story from thecalifornian.com on March 30, 2016, predictions of \u201cmassive\u201d fraud when former state Secretary of State Debra Bowen permitted online voter registration in all 58 counties proved unfounded. Now that there is a November initiate on the state ballot to permit voting via the Internet, Elias says, \u201cthe doomsayers may be correct.\u201d\n\nDemocrats believe online voting will enhance (their) voter turnout. \u201cBackers insist votes can be made secure and encrypted in ways that are almost impossible to hack. But the same was said of electronic voting machines. That was before Bowen conducted her \u2018top to bottom\u2019 review of those gadgets and essentially ordered almost all of them scrapped or resold to other sates and countries because of the ease with which votes cast on them could be \u2018flipped.\u2019\u201d (emphasis added.) Gee, which states?\n\nBackers also insist, says Ricky Ribeiro in statetechmagazine.com in March 2016, that because we can buy cars or anything else online, we ought to be able to vote that way as well. The difference, he notes, is that e-commerce tolerates a certain amount of fraud, while in our sacred election processes, zero tolerance must be the norm.\n\nElias strategizes how organized hackers, as he calls them, might attack certain elections and certain races, but not others. \u201cWhich means,\u201d he concludes, \u201conly a fool would support any move to put voting online, where there\u2019s no hope for a countable \u2018paper trail\u2019 that Bowen began requiring about a decade ago.\u201d\n\nBut what \u201corganized hackers\u201d are he referring to, you wonder. In a recent Bloomberg Businessweek article, Jordan Robertson et al. detail Andres Sepulveda\u2019s claims to have spent eight years stealing elections in Latin America\u2014in places like Colombia, Honduras, Venezuela, and in July 2012, perhaps, the presidency of Mexico. While the president-elect, Enrique Pena Nieto talked about fighting corruption, Sepulveda was in a Bogota apartment, 2000 miles away, destroying all the evidence of having hacked the election in Nieto\u2019s favor. There are no claims, by the way, Nieto knew of or had anything to do with Sepulveda\u2019s activities.\n\nIn 2015, anonymous sources claimed Sepulveda\u2019s alleged sponsor, a Miami political consultant named Rendon, had gone to work for the Trump campaign, but all parties disavow any such connection. Rendon dislikes Trump, it was said, but has been in talks with another leading U.S. presidential campaign.\n\nWanna guess who?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whether the Democrats keep Hillary, settle for Bernie, or reach out for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren remains to be seen, but they know victory in November will not be easy.
