You can do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause when we stay home, they win. So they\u2019re assuming that we won\u2019t care. They are hoping that we won\u2019t be organized and energized. They are praying that we just sit around and wait for somebody else to fix our problems.\u201d\n\nDetroit voter turnout isn\u2019t as crucial to Democrats in statewide races as it used to be--but it\u2019s still important, and could be especially key in the Governor\u2019s race this year.\n\nMost polls show Schauer and Governor Rick Snyder in a tight contest in the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nThe First Lady also touted President Obama\u2019s legislative accomplishments, like the Affordable Care Act, noting that many Americans now have affordable health insurance for the first time.\n\nShe also played up the President\u2019s handling of the economy, pointing out that he inherited a country in \u201cdire crisis mode\u201d that\u2019s now better off by almost \u201cevery economic measure.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, Republicans had quite a different take on those same issues.\n\n\"Whenever Democrats have the opportunity to lead \u2014 whether it's Jennifer Granholm here in Michigan, or Harry Reid in the Senate \u2014 they end up stifling our success and reversing our progress,\" Michigan Republican Party chairman Bobby Schostak said in a Friday statement. \"Michigan is on the road to recovery, and we don't need President Obama, or any other Democrats trying to halt our momentum; Gov. Rick Snyder, U.S. Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land and fellow Michigan Republicans will continue moving us forward.\"", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Government", "description": "First Lady Michelle Obama headlined a campaign event for Michigan Democrats in Detroit Friday.
