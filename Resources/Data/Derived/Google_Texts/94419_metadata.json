Commissioner Robert Peay Jr. then adjusted the amended version that asks the Tennessee General Assembly to defend the state's and citizens' rights \"by upholding the Tennessee and United States constitutions.\"\n\nCommissioner Gourley suggested that such a resolution is an insult to the lawmakers.\n\nBuy Photo Supporters of same-sex marriage and upholding Supreme Court rulings cheer after Sara Mitchell makes a speech in favor of upholding the Supreme Court rulings in front of the County Commission, on Thursday, Jan. 13, 201.

The resolution as passed canceled out the fears and concerns that the protesters had.\"Stevens suggested that the amendment offered by Peay, however, was more oriented \"toward states rights by including the Tennessee Constitution.\"\n\nCommissioner Doug Shafer mentioned his support for the resolution is in part due to the costs associated with the Affordable Care Act that he said is costing the county government about $480,000 to provide the required benefits.\n\nPrior to voting, the commissioners during the public comment period heard from six speakers against the resolution.\n\nCaleb Banks told the commissioners that his marriage to his husband is not a perversion.\n\n\"Leave the LGBT community alone,\" said Banks, who suggested Tennessee's constitutional amendment in 2006 that defined a marriage contract being between one man and one woman was essentially a Jim Crow law. \"We will not be dominated by hate and bigotry.\"\n\nBuy Photo Pat Sanders, left, and Kathy Ferris, supporters of same-sex marriage and upholding Supreme Court rulings wear red to show their support. (Photo: HELEN COMER/DNJ)\n\nOthers opposed to the resolution held signs: \"Don't be stupid, obey the law,\" and \"Support human rights\" and \"One nation indivisible\" and \"Affordable health care for all.\"\n\nBrendon Holloway told the commissioners that the resolution was \"hatred.\"\n\n\"The LGBT community is one of the most vulnerable in the state of Tennessee,\" Holloway said. \"You are denying them their basic human rights.\"\n\nThe LGBT community has faced being bullied in school and getting fired from jobs, said Holloway, adding that all residents should be honored.\n\nSpeaker Christie Crowell suggested that the resolution was a tool of segregation and divisiveness.\n\n\"This resolution is not patriotic disobedience,\" Crowell said.\n\nContact Scott Broden at 615-278-5158.
