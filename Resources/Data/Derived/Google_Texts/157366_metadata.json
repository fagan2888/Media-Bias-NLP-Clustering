Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning can\u2019t keep defenses honest anymore, so Baltimore will load the box, impacting C.J. Anderson\u2019s running ability. Prediction: Baltimore 21, Denver 20.\n\nBraxton, nervous about the season opener\n\nKiz: O ye of little faith. The game that should make Broncos Country nervous is Thursday at Kansas City, not the home opener at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, where a pumped-up crowd should be worth at least three points to Denver. Yes, there\u2019s legitimate concern Baltimore pass-rushing specialist Elvis Dumervil will return to town and make himself at home in the Broncos\u2019 backfield. With that in mind, here\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see: On the first snap of Denver\u2019s first offensive possession, Manning lines up under center, fakes a handoff to Anderson and throws deep to Emmanuel Sanders. The Broncos will win 23-17.\n\nGood to go. You have to feel pretty good about this football team if Manning is the weakest link. Go, Broncos!\n\nWATCH: Will we see more of a Peyton Manning offense on Sunday?\n\nColleen, Casper\n\nKiz: While Manning is everybody\u2019s buddy in television commercials, there\u2019s a hard edge to him on the football field. Or have you forgotten how he told KOA radio that critics could \u201cshove it where the sun don\u2019t shine\u201d after the Broncos scored 51 points on a frigid afternoon in 2013? I\u2019ve suggested Manning is showing signs of irreversible decline inevitable with age. And I have not been alone. Will the old dog takes a bite out of the Ravens to prove doubters wrong?\n\nNever say never. I hate to inform you of the truth, but you are very naive and somebody has to wake you up from your never-never land dream. Gary Kubiak can\u2019t coach his way out of a paper bag. The Broncos will have a losing record under him, probably finishing 6-10.\n\nPeter, Denver\n\nKiz: Never-never land? Isn\u2019t that what folks who dream of finding a nice, two-bedroom apartment for under $2,000 per month call LoHi? During eight seasons as the head coach with Houston, Kubiak\u2019s record was 61-64. Very mediocre. Indeed. But Kubiak also turned quarterback Matt Schaub into a two-time Pro Bowler. I\u2019d say that was more miraculous than teaching a boy how to fly.\n\nSerena slammed. And today\u2019s parting shot is a rebuke of my praise of tennis star Serena Williams for winning 33 straight Grand Slam matches before being upset by Roberta Vinci in the U.S. Open semifinals.\n\nSerena isn\u2019t even close to great. But most of the rest of the field is so atrocious, she appears to be better than she is. Calendar-year Grand Slam? Over. LOL.\n\nSonny, admires Steffi Graf\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or twitter.com/markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Win or lose, Broncos\u2019 opener will be close", "title": "Win or lose, Broncos\u2019 opener will be close", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/12/win-or-lose-broncos-opener-will-be-close/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150910__FBNRavensBroncos1.jpg", "height": 465}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150910__FBNRavensBroncos1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-12T22:14:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T02:51:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Kickin' It With Kiz"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7506\"", "article_summary": "Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning can\u2019t keep defenses honest anymore, so Baltimore will load the box, impacting C.J.\nYes, there\u2019s legitimate concern Baltimore pass-rushing specialist Elvis Dumervil will return to town and make himself at home in the Broncos\u2019 backfield.\nColleen, CasperKiz: While Manning is everybody\u2019s buddy in television commercials, there\u2019s a hard edge to him on the football field.\nBut most of the rest of the field is so atrocious, she appears to be better than she is.\nThe game that should make Broncos Country nervous is Thursday at Kansas City, not the home opener at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, where a pumped-up crowd should be worth at least three points to Denver."}
