I don\u2019t buy that for a minute, but it\u2019s not entirely implausible. There\u2019s great natural beauty, and many of the world\u2019s most creative people and institutions choose to make the area their home. It\u2019s pricey by American standards but still a bargain by global standards. Like New York City in its golden age, it is a glorious collision between culture and money.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the Bay Area partisans are correct in their high estimation of the metropolis. What might we do with that information? Why not pass a law requiring everybody in the United States to live there? As with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s approach to health insurance, we wouldn\u2019t be forcing an inferior product on people; we\u2019d be forcing them to drop their second-rate cities for something better. Sorry, Cleveland \u2014 you can\u2019t keep your crappy city, so deal with it. There would be some great economies of scale at work, and there are well-known economic benefits associated with population density, which we\u2019d have in spades with a population of 300 million. (Though if we define the Bay Area broadly, we\u2019d still have a lower population density than Manhattan, on average.) We could drop altogether thousands and thousands of redundancies \u2014 of school districts, police departments, fire departments, planning and zoning codes, tax laws, city councils. The rest of the country could be turned into farmland or left to revert to wilderness. Think of the efficiency we could achieve.\n\nOnce we\u2019ve decided where everybody should live, we can move on to the question of what they should eat. Father Henri Nouwen, calling it \u201can example of American pragmatism that makes you cry,\u201d tells the story of a Scripture-minded biologist who, taking inspiration from the Biblical description of Israel as the \u201cland flowing with milk and honey,\u201d goes on an all-milk-and-honey diet to test whether that is in fact the ideal human nutritional model. After the scurvy set in, he suggested that maybe the Bible should be amended to describe Israel as the \u201cland flowing with milk and honey plus ten ounces of orange juice.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s not the way to go. We might consider the USDA\u2019s thinking here, or the economic case for the \u201ccheapest, most nutritious, most bountiful food in human history,\u201d that being the McDonald\u2019s double cheeseburger. It may take some experimentation and consultation with the experts, but, after we\u2019ve figured out what everybody should eat, think, again, of all the redundancies we can eliminate, the resources we can redirect into more productive uses, the breathtaking manageability of a nation where everybody lives in the same city and eats the same dinner. You could combine all the best aspects of a Singapore or a Hong Kong with the pitiless efficiency of a fast-food franchise. You want to bend the cost curve down, you don\u2019t consult Congress \u2014 you consult McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe Bay Area has a pretty good mass-transit infrastructure, but we\u2019re probably still going to want some cars, the obvious leading candidate here being the Toyota Prius \u2014 it\u2019s already popular in the area, gets great mileage, is consistently rated one of the most reliable cars, doesn\u2019t take up too much parking space, etc. Given the generally pleasant climate, no need to worry about four-wheel-drive or the like. Do we really even need a vote on that? It\u2019s the Prius \u2014 and we can buy in bulk at a huge discount, presumably; call it single-payer personal locomotion.\n\nSo everybody lives in and around San Francisco, everybody eats McDonald\u2019s double cheeseburgers, and everybody drives a Prius, everybody drinks one beer chosen by the experts \u2014 maybe that\u2019s not the utopia you had in mind, but you could make a pretty good empirical case that this arrangement represents the right metropolis, the right food, and the right car, etc.\n\nIt is easy to see that these results are absurd. For example, sending 300 million people to live in the Bay Area might change some of the things that people like about the region. (But sending millions of people into the health-insurance market will have a negligible effect on prices, market structure, or incentives? Right?) Fine, pick your own answer \u2014 but it is important to recognize that the real absurdity here is not in the answer to each question, but in the question itself. The idea that there exists a single \u201cright\u201d urban cluster or a single \u201cright\u201d automobile or meal fails to take into account any number of variables, not least of which is the fact that people do not all want or need uniformly the same things, and that it is not really our business to tell them what they should want, even when we believe we know better \u2014 even when we have a pretty good body of evidence suggesting that we know better.\n\nBut then how is it that we have come to believe that there is a single \u201cright\u201d model of education, a single \u201cright\u201d minimum health-insurance package, a single \u201cright\u201d minimum price for a gallon of milk or an hour\u2019s labor, or a single \u201cright\u201d choice among the millions upon millions of options in areas in which politicians insist that what is needed is uniformity and consistency based on whatever happens to pass for empirical evidence at any given moment? How is it that, in a world in which the software we use for so many important tasks in our professional and personal lives is updated every few weeks (or even more often), we have 20-year programs for organizing health care, retirements, and more? There are billions of economic relationships between American people and firms and their counterparts in China alone \u2014 but there\u2019s one right set of relationships among them? Think about it for two seconds and it is self-evidently false.\n\n\u201cHow should we do x?\u201d The main problem is not the answer, but the question itself, and the assumptions behind that question, the belief that an answer exists.\n\nSome policies must, by their nature, be implemented at the national level. If you\u2019re going to have a sovereign nation-state, you need a national defense apparatus (which is not to say you need our national-defense apparatus; there are alternatives), and you probably need a national immigration policy, etc. The basic architecture of the current American constitutional order, which is a remarkably wise and intelligent piece of work, contemplates national policies in those areas in which the several states interact with foreign powers and in those cases in which the states cannot coordinate efforts or resolve disputes among themselves on their own. That, along with some 18th-century anachronisms (post roads, etc.) and some awful economic superstitions (political management of trade, a political monopoly on the issuance of currency), constitutes most of what the federal government is in theory there to do. That and fighting pirates and others committing \u201cfelonies on the high seas,\u201d of course, which is awesome, and we can all feel patriotic about fighting pirates.\n\nBut . . . if we look at federal programs by budget share, almost nothing that Washington does requires a national policy. There\u2019s national defense, of course, at around 20 percent of spending; you may believe, as I do, that that number is probably too high, but national defense is a legitimate national endeavor. But most federal spending is on various entitlement programs \u2014 Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and various other welfare benefits. There is not much reason for any of these programs to exist at all \u2014 government is a criminally inept pension planner and a thoroughly incompetent insurance company \u2014 and there is very little reason for any of them to exist as uniform, one-size-fits-all national programs. Start digging into that non-defense discretionary spending and you end up with very little more than a catalog of crony payoffs and political favoritism.\n\nThere is no more reason to believe that a single government-run pension scheme is in each individual\u2019s best interest than to believe that a single city or single model of car is right for everybody. And the people who design and plan these programs know that. The point of Social Security \u2014 like the point of insisting that health insurance is \u201ca right\u201d rather than a consumer good \u2014 is to redefine the relationship between citizen and state. That is the real rationale for a national pension scheme or a national insurance policy. For several generations now, we\u2019ve been changing the very idea of what it means to be an American citizen. It used to mean being entitled to enjoy liberty and republican self-governance under the Constitution. Eventually, it came to mean being eligible for Social Security, functionally if not formally. Now it means being eligible for Obamacare. The name of the project may change every generation, and its totems may evolve from Bismarck to Marx to \u201cthe experts\u201d \u2014 that legion of pointy-headed Caesars who are to be the final authority in all matters in dispute \u2014 but the dream remains the same: society as one big factory under the management of enlightened men with extraordinary powers of compulsion.\n\nThere is a great deal that is distasteful \u2014 positively repugnant \u2014 about 21st-century American life. I do not understand why many of my fellow citizens like the things they like or want the things they want. A few times a year, I force myself to watch a reality-television show, and I\u2019m generally ready to emigrate by the time the credits roll. I do not get the values, interests, and preferences of people who are keeping up with the Kardashians. And I am frequently bewildered by their economic decisions and political preferences. But isn\u2019t that a case against having me make decisions for them rather than an argument for that proposition? It takes a very special kind of arrogance to believe the opposite. \u201cOf all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive,\u201d C. S. Lewis argued. \u201cIt would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron\u2019s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.\u201d Or, as the somewhat less authoritative commentator (and son of the Bay Area) Jello Biafra put it: \u201cShut up, be happy.\u201d\n\nAnd have a cheeseburger.\n\n\u2014 Kevin D.

I don\u2019t buy that for a minute, but it\u2019s not entirely implausible. There\u2019s great natural beauty, and many of the world\u2019s most creative people and institutions choose to make the area their home. It\u2019s pricey by American standards but still a bargain by global standards. Like New York City in its golden age, it is a glorious collision between culture and money.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the Bay Area partisans are correct in their high estimation of the metropolis. What might we do with that information? Why not pass a law requiring everybody in the United States to live there? As with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s approach to health insurance, we wouldn\u2019t be forcing an inferior product on people; we\u2019d be forcing them to drop their second-rate cities for something better. Sorry, Cleveland \u2014 you can\u2019t keep your crappy city, so deal with it. There would be some great economies of scale at work, and there are well-known economic benefits associated with population density, which we\u2019d have in spades with a population of 300 million. (Though if we define the Bay Area broadly, we\u2019d still have a lower population density than Manhattan, on average.) We could drop altogether thousands and thousands of redundancies \u2014 of school districts, police departments, fire departments, planning and zoning codes, tax laws, city councils. The rest of the country could be turned into farmland or left to revert to wilderness. Think of the efficiency we could achieve.\n\n#ad#Once we\u2019ve decided where everybody should live, we can move on to the question of what they should eat. Father Henri Nouwen, calling it \u201can example of American pragmatism that makes you cry,\u201d tells the story of a Scripture-minded biologist who, taking inspiration from the Biblical description of Israel as the \u201cland flowing with milk and honey,\u201d goes on an all-milk-and-honey diet to test whether that is in fact the ideal human nutritional model. After the scurvy set in, he suggested that maybe the Bible should be amended to describe Israel as the \u201cland flowing with milk and honey plus ten ounces of orange juice.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s not the way to go. We might consider the USDA\u2019s thinking here, or the economic case for the \u201ccheapest, most nutritious, most bountiful food in human history,\u201d that being the McDonald\u2019s double cheeseburger. It may take some experimentation and consultation with the experts, but, after we\u2019ve figured out what everybody should eat, think, again, of all the redundancies we can eliminate, the resources we can redirect into more productive uses, the breathtaking manageability of a nation where everybody lives in the same city and eats the same dinner. You could combine all the best aspects of a Singapore or a Hong Kong with the pitiless efficiency of a fast-food franchise. You want to bend the cost curve down, you don\u2019t consult Congress \u2014 you consult McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe Bay Area has a pretty good mass-transit infrastructure, but we\u2019re probably still going to want some cars, the obvious leading candidate here being the Toyota Prius \u2014 it\u2019s already popular in the area, gets great mileage, is consistently rated one of the most reliable cars, doesn\u2019t take up too much parking space, etc. Given the generally pleasant climate, no need to worry about four-wheel-drive or the like. Do we really even need a vote on that? It\u2019s the Prius \u2014 and we can buy in bulk at a huge discount, presumably; call it single-payer personal locomotion.\n\nSo everybody lives in and around San Francisco, everybody eats McDonald\u2019s double cheeseburgers, and everybody drives a Prius, everybody drinks one beer chosen by the experts \u2014 maybe that\u2019s not the utopia you had in mind, but you could make a pretty good empirical case that this arrangement represents the right metropolis, the right food, and the right car, etc.\n\nIt is easy to see that these results are absurd. For example, sending 300 million people to live in the Bay Area might change some of the things that people like about the region. (But sending millions of people into the health-insurance market will have a negligible effect on prices, market structure, or incentives? Right?) Fine, pick your own answer \u2014 but it is important to recognize that the real absurdity here is not in the answer to each question, but in the question itself. The idea that there exists a single \u201cright\u201d urban cluster or a single \u201cright\u201d automobile or meal fails to take into account any number of variables, not least of which is the fact that people do not all want or need uniformly the same things, and that it is not really our business to tell them what they should want, even when we believe we know better \u2014 even when we have a pretty good body of evidence suggesting that we know better.\n\n#page#\n\nBut then how is it that we have come to believe that there is a single \u201cright\u201d model of education, a single \u201cright\u201d minimum health-insurance package, a single \u201cright\u201d minimum price for a gallon of milk or an hour\u2019s labor, or a single \u201cright\u201d choice among the millions upon millions of options in areas in which politicians insist that what is needed is uniformity and consistency based on whatever happens to pass for empirical evidence at any given moment? How is it that, in a world in which the software we use for so many important tasks in our professional and personal lives is updated every few weeks (or even more often), we have 20-year programs for organizing health care, retirements, and more? There are billions of\u00a0economic relationships between American people and firms and their counterparts in China alone \u2014 but there\u2019s one right set of relationships among them? Think about it for two seconds and it is self-evidently false.\n\n\u201cHow should we do x?\u201d The main problem is not the answer, but the question itself, and the assumptions behind that question, the belief that an answer exists.\n\n#ad#Some policies must, by their nature, be implemented at the national level. If you\u2019re going to have a sovereign nation-state, you need a national defense apparatus (which is not to say you need our national-defense apparatus; there are alternatives), and you probably need a national immigration policy, etc. The basic architecture of the current American constitutional order, which is a remarkably wise and intelligent piece of work, contemplates national policies in those areas in which the several states interact with foreign powers and in those cases in which the states cannot coordinate efforts or resolve disputes among themselves on their own. That, along with some 18th-century anachronisms (post roads, etc.) and some awful economic superstitions (political management of trade, a political monopoly on the issuance of currency), constitutes most of what the federal government is in theory there to do. That and fighting pirates and others committing \u201cfelonies on the high seas,\u201d of course, which is awesome, and we can all feel patriotic about fighting pirates.\n\nBut . . . if we look at federal programs by budget share, almost nothing that Washington does requires a national policy. There\u2019s national defense, of course, at around 20 percent of spending; you may believe, as I do, that that number is probably too high, but national defense is a legitimate national endeavor. But most federal spending is on various entitlement programs \u2014 Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and various other welfare benefits. There is not much reason for any of these programs to exist at all \u2014 government is a criminally inept pension planner and a thoroughly incompetent insurance company \u2014 and there is very little reason for any of them to exist as uniform, one-size-fits-all national programs. Start digging into that non-defense discretionary spending and you end up with very little more than a catalog of crony payoffs and political favoritism.\n\nThere is no more reason to believe that a single government-run pension scheme is in each individual\u2019s best interest than to believe that a single city or single model of car is right for everybody. And the people who design and plan these programs know that. The point of Social Security \u2014 like the point of insisting that health insurance is \u201ca right\u201d rather than a consumer good \u2014 is to redefine the relationship between citizen and state. That is the real rationale for a national pension scheme or a national insurance policy. For several generations now, we\u2019ve been changing the very idea of what it means to be an American citizen. It used to mean being entitled to enjoy liberty and republican self-governance under the Constitution. Eventually, it came to mean being eligible for Social Security, functionally if not formally. Now it means being eligible for Obamacare. The name of the project may change every generation, and its totems may evolve from Bismarck to Marx to \u201cthe experts\u201d \u2014 that legion of pointy-headed Caesars who are to be the final authority in all matters in dispute \u2014 but the dream remains the same: society as one big factory under the management of enlightened men with extraordinary powers of compulsion.\n\nThere is a great deal that is distasteful \u2014 positively repugnant \u2014 about 21st-century American life. I do not understand why many of my fellow citizens like the things they like or want the things\u00a0they want.
