Now, in a new press release, the FDA states that ultrasounds or heartbeat monitors are \u201cdesigned to be used by trained health care professionals\u201d and \u201care not intended for over-the-counter (OTC) sale or use, and the FDA strongly discourages their use for creating fetal keepsake images and videos.\u201d\n\nUltrasounds use sound waves to produce an image and are able to provide information on the fetus\u2019s age, sex, and general health; overall, they\u2019re considered a safe and productive way to check on your baby during pregnancy. But \u201ckeepsake\u201d ultrasounds that aren\u2019t completed in a hospital setting might pose a threat to both fetus and mother, the FDA warns.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is lack of evidence of any harm due to ultrasound imaging and heartbeat monitors, prudent use of these devices by trained health care providers is important,\u201d Shahram Vaezy, an FDA biomedical engineer, said in the press release. \u201cUltrasound can heat tissues slightly, and in some cases, it can also produce very small bubbles (cavitation) in some tissues.\u201d\n\nIn 1994, the FDA discovered three companies in Texas that were selling ultrasound products to expectant parents, and gradually discovered more throughout the country. These ultrasounds were \u201cbeing performed by untrained, unlicensed technicians\u201d without a doctor\u2019s supervision, the FDA stated.\n\nIn 2005, the FDA released a warning statement about keepsake ultrasounds: \u201cLaboratory studies have shown that diagnostic levels of ultrasound can produce physical effects in tissue, such as mechanical vibrations and rise in temperature. Although there is no evidence that these physical effects can harm the fetus, public health experts, clinicians and industry agree that casual exposure to ultrasound, especially during pregnancy, should be avoided.\u201d\n\nSince then, some states \u2014 such as Connecticut \u2014 have passed laws prohibiting the use of keepsake ultrasounds. But they\u2019re still able to be purchased in various parts of the country.\n\nWhile it\u2019s safe to say no one is quite sure yet what the potential damage might be, avoiding these keepsake ultrasounds may be the best decision. Having a connection to your unborn infant via ultrasound and a heartbeat monitor is important, but it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.\n\n\u201cWhen the product is purchased over the counter and used without consultation with a health care professional taking care of the pregnant woman, there is no oversight of how the device is used,\u201d Vaezy said in the press release. \u201cAlso, there is little or no medical benefit expected from the exposure. Furthermore, the number of sessions or the length of a session in scanning a fetus is uncontrolled, and that increases the potential for harm to the fetus and eventually the mother.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "keepsake, ultrasounds, run, untrained, technicians, may, pose, threat, fetus, fda", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Commercial ultrasounds, often run by untrained technicians, have the potential to harm you or your fetus, according to the FDA.", "title": "Stop Doing Ultrasounds For Fun; They Could Harm Your Baby", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/keepsake-ultrasounds-run-untrained-technicians-may-pose-threat-fetus-fda-314708", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/17/ultrasound.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Commercial ultrasounds, often run by untrained technicians, have the potential to harm you or your fetus, according to the FDA.", "title": "Stop Doing Ultrasounds For Fun; They Could Harm Your Baby", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/keepsake-ultrasounds-run-untrained-technicians-may-pose-threat-fetus-fda-314708", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/17/ultrasound.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/17/ultrasound.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-12-17T14:43:38-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-17T14:43:37-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Commercial ultrasounds, often run by untrained technicians, have the potential to harm you or your fetus, according to the FDA."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3745\"", "article_summary": "But \u201ckeepsake\u201d ultrasounds that aren\u2019t completed in a hospital setting might pose a threat to both fetus and mother, the FDA warns.\nUltrasounds and heartbeat monitors are often a safe and good way for parents to connect with the fetus, but the FDA warns against keepsake ultrasounds, which are run by untrained technicians or run at home.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has, for years, been warning consumers about the potential hazards of these \u201ckeepsake\u201d ultrasounds.\nWhile it\u2019s safe to say no one is quite sure yet what the potential damage might be, avoiding these keepsake ultrasounds may be the best decision.\nThese ultrasounds were \u201cbeing performed by untrained, unlicensed technicians\u201d without a doctor\u2019s supervision, the FDA stated."}
