Spencer Green, File In this March 18, 2014 file photo, voters cast their ballots in the Illinois primary in Hinsdale, Ill.\n\nToday\u2019s conservatives have a problem. The middle class is increasingly anxious about its economic prospects, and with good reason. Inflation-adjusted earnings have declined for most people since 2000, long before the collapse of 2008. Young adults face more than $1.2 trillion in college debt, declining entry-level salaries, high costs of housing and childrearing, and dwindling employer health and pension benefits.\n\nWith new public attention being paid to inequality of income and wealth, these concerns don\u2019t exactly play to conservative strength. The era since 1981 has been one of turning away from public remediation, toward tax cuts, limited social spending, deregulation, and privatization. None of this worked well, except for the very top. For everyone else, the shift to conservative policies generated more economic insecurity. The remedies are those of liberals\u2019. So what\u2019s a conservative to do?\n\nA good illustration of how the right is responding is a manifesto titled Room to Grow: Conservative Reforms for a Limited Government and a Thriving Middle Class. The document is a series of essays written by people who profess to be intellectually serious, \u201creform conservatives,\u201d as a credulous press calls them.\n\nRoom to Grow is published by the YG Network, which stands for \u201cYoung Guns.\u201d The manifesto acknowledges as Young Guns founders House Budget Committee Chair Paul Ryan, House Republican Whip Kevin McCarthy, and former Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a trinity that suggests the limits of reform.\n\nThe editors and writers include such middle-aged guns as Peter Wehner, former head of George W. Bush\u2019s in-house White House think tank; Yuval Levin, founding editor of the journal National Affairs; Scott Winship of the Manhattan Institute, and National Review\u2019s Ramesh Ponnuru.\n\nAt least these conservatives admit Republicans have a problem. The document begins by candidly stating the plight of the middle class and the challenges facing the right. \u201cSixty-two percent of those in the middle class say the Republican Party favors the rich while 16 percent say the Democratic Party favors the rich,\u201d Wehner writes. \u201cAmericans do not have a sense that conservatives offer them a better shot at success and security than liberals.\u201d\n\nWell, yes. But the remedies the young guns offer are mostly the same old stuff\u2014more tax cuts, tax credits for everything from health insurance to education, more deregulation, more vouchers, more cuts in social supports. To help the long-term unemployed, they propose a temporary reduced minimum wage.\n\nTo read this manifesto, you would think liberals had been in charge since 1981 and that the woes of the middle class had not worsened during an era of conservative dominance. Where the document offers genuinely new stuff, it can be out of touch bordering on creepy.\n\nFor example, the authors, proposing cuts in social insurance, write that \u201cSocial Security and Medicare have \u2018crowded out\u2019 the traditional incentive to raise children as a protection against poverty in old age. Today, most workers can reasonably foresee getting enough support from the public retirement system to stay out of poverty when they get older, making it less likely that they will have to call on direct aid\u2014either in cash or in kind\u2014from their own children.\u201d In other words, if only the government did not provide so much help, people would have more kids, who would support their parents in old age. So let\u2019s go back to the 19th century.\n\nAre the authors aware that the median Social Security check is only about $14,000 a year, pretty bare subsistence? With young adults suffering downward mobility, are these Young Guns serious about adding burdens of supporting aging parents as well as raising young children? No wonder voters are skeptical.\n\nIf conservatives offer little that\u2019s credible to the anxious middle class, why aren\u2019t liberals just trouncing them?\n\nFirst, the right has been so successful at blocking liberal initiatives to deliver tangible help that the middle class is not sure which party to trust.\n\nSecond, compromises like the Affordable Care Act that do make it through Congress are hobbled by a costly and complex role for commercial middlemen\u2014and seem to represent government inefficiency.\n\nAnd third, the details are wonky. This exercise is more about slogans and headlines. Only a tiny fraction of voters will notice the holes in the specifics. So despite such empty rhetoric, Republicans are poised to win the midterm elections.\n\nSo what\u2019s a liberal to do?\n\nAs the party that considers itself responsible stewards of government, Democrats are reluctant to offer proposals that stand no immediate chance of passage. The liberal imagination has been stunted by decades of conservative obstruction and has lost its power to inspire. Most of what ails the middle class requires far more robust policies than are currently in mainstream debate. Liberals should say what they are really for. They might even win more followers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "[[nid:220526]]&amp;nbsp;Today&amp;rsquo;s conservatives have a problem.
