The women were asked about their pregnancy intent, history, and risk. They also were asked which birth control method they preferred\u2014prescription and over-the-counter options, as well as natural family planning and withdrawal method.\n\nThe women in the study were not planning to get pregnant within at least the next 12 months. Thirteen percent of participants planned to have a pregnancy in the next 12 to 24 months; 25 percent in two to five years; 23 percent in five or more years; another 23 percent were not sure if or when they wanted to have a baby; and 16 percent said they did not ever intend to have a baby.\n\nThe pill vs. LARCs\n\nThe findings show that partnership status and frequency of sexual intercourse\u2014not long-term pregnancy intent, as the researchers had hypothesized\u2014is the strongest predictors of prescription contraceptive use.\n\n\u201cCurrently, oral contraceptives (the birth control pill) are the most commonly used contraception in the US\u2014used by 16 percent of all women ages 15-44\u2014while LARCs (long-acting reversible contraceptives, including intrauterine devices and implants) are used by only 7.2 percent,\u201d the researchers write in the journal Contraception.\n\nLARCs are highly effective and, due to the Affordable Care Act, are now available at no cost to women in most private health insurance plans.\n\n\u201cWe found that a lot of women who intend to get pregnant someday, but not for at least a year, were not using LARCs,\u201d says coauthor Cynthia H. Chuang, associate professor of medicine and public health sciences at Penn State. \u201cHowever, women who don\u2019t ever want to get pregnant are more likely to use long-acting reversible contraception.\u201d\n\nThe new research is part of an ongoing randomized controlled trial to test an online intervention to help women make contraceptive choices consistent with their pregnancy plans.\n\n\u201cOver time, if overall use of prescription contraception and adoption of LARCs increase, the rate of unintended pregnancy\u2014estimated at 51 percent of all US pregnancies in 2008\u2014would be expected to decline,\u201d the researchers say.\n\nThe Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute supported the project.\n\nSource: Penn State", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers surveyed nearly 1,000 women and were surprised to learn pregnancy plans had little influence on the type of contraceptive they choose.", "og": {"site_name": "Futurity", "description": "Researchers surveyed nearly 1,000 women and were surprised to learn pregnancy plans had little influence on the type of contraceptive they choose.", "title": "Pill or IUD: These 2 factors influence how women choose - Futurity", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1170, "identifier": "http://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/thepill_1170.jpg", "height": 669}, "url": "http://www.futurity.org/women-birth-control-984722/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers surveyed nearly 1,000 women and were surprised to learn pregnancy plans had little influence on the type of contraceptive they choose.", "creator": "@FuturityNews", "image": "http://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/thepill_1170.jpg", "title": "Pill or IUD: These 2 factors influence how women choose - Futurity", "site": "@FuturityNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "msvalidate.01": "56028DC055B0AA27F7D0287D219F4C4D", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Futurity/143906865226", "section": "Health and Medicine", "tag": "women's health", "published_time": "2015-08-19T10:47:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Researchers surveyed nearly 1,000 women in Pennsylvania, all with private health insurance covering prescription contraception, on their contraception use.\nResearchers say oral contraceptives (the birth control pill) are the most commonly used contraception in the United States\u2014used by 16 percent of all women ages 15-44.\n(Credit: outcast104/FlickrPill or IUD: These 2 factors influence how women chooseWomen are more likely to choose the type of contraceptive they use based on their relationship status and how often they have sex\u2014not on when or if they plan to get pregnant.\nThe women in the study were not planning to get pregnant within at least the next 12 months.\nLARCs are highly effective and, due to the Affordable Care Act, are now available at no cost to women in most private health insurance plans."}
