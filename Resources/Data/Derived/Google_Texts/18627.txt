November has become the hairiest month thanks to the Movember Foundation and the No-Shave November movements, and as we requested, Mercy Health Youngstown in Mahoning Valley, Ohio, has supplied evidence of its fundraising in that arena.

More than 100 men officially joined the “Man Up Mahoning Valley” effort by entering ‘Stache of the Week contests, said Jonathon Fauvie, gift officer, Mercy Health Foundation Mahoning Valley.

The primary aim of the effort for the six years the program has existed is to raise awareness of and participation in much-needed prostate cancer screening. The health system holds free screenings in the community at least four times a year, targeting uninsured and underinsured men. Money generated throughout the year goes directly to provide free screenings for men in the Mahoning Valley.

A group shave-off to end the event was held at Partners for Urology Health in Austintown, Ohio. Fake mustaches were provided for those who couldn’t handle the no-shave itching, couldn’t grow a hairy upper lip, or decided they look too much like Captain Kangaroo when they do.

Dan Knorr, nurse navigator at Partners for Urology Health – who had sported a neatly groomed mustache and fringe on his chin for at least 40 years — even agreed to go under the knife, so to speak.

“Taking it off will definitely generate some conversation,” Knorr said. “My son’s 29 and he’s never seen me without it.”
