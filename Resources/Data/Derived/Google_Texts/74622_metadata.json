Certain behaviors have been tolerated.\u201d\n\nObama noted the case of Ray Rice, the former Baltimore Ravens running back caught on video in an elevator assaulting his then-fiancee, whom he has since married.\n\nAsked whether NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell had \u201ctoo many men\u201d around him as he was handling the matter, Obama made an argument for all leaders \u2013 including presidents \u2013 to promote women and have people of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds on their staffs.\n\nHis remarks came in an interview with ESPN radio\u2019s Colin Cowherd, who asked several questions about politics in sports, starting off with a reference to Cavaliers forward LeBron James\u2019 decision to help promote healthcare.gov, the website where people can sign up for insurance through the federal government\u2019s marketplace established under Obama\u2019s landmark healthcare law.\n\nJames also made news this week for wearing a T-shirt during pregame warm-ups reading \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe,\u201d a reference to the dying words of Eric Garner, the Staten Island man who was put in a deadly choke hold by a police officer trying to take him into custody. Garner\u2019s death and a grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict the officer stoked the tensions that had emerged in recent months after the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.\n\n\u201cSome of our greatest sports heroes \u2013 Muhammad Ali, Bill Russell, Arthur Ashe \u2013 they spoke out on issues that mattered at pretty critical times,\u201d Obama said. Athletes are entertainers, he said, but they\u2019re also citizens.\n\nStill, he acknowledged, he spends \u201cmost of my time\u201d watching ESPN as he gets ready in the morning and doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cinundated by chatter about politics.\u201d\n\nFor more White House coverage, follow @cparsons", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obama: Pro, college football a 'little bit of an old boys' network'", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "President Obama said Friday that professional and college football have been \u201ca little bit of an old boys\u2019 network\u201d but that he thinks sports franchises are now establishing clear policies to address the off-the-field behavior of their athletes.", "title": "Obama: Pro, college football a 'little bit of an old boys' network'", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-obama-espn-radio-interview-20141212-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-548b2b86/turbine/la-pn-obama-espn-radio-interview-20141212", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Obama, NFL, Eric Garner", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82267098", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-12-12", "Description": "President Obama said Friday that professional and college football have been \u201ca little bit of an old boys\u2019 network\u201d but that he thinks sports franchises are now establishing clear policies to address the off-the-field behavior of their athletes.   \u201cThis is not unique to the NFL,\u201d Obama said in an...", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Obama, NFL, Eric Garner"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is not unique to the NFL,\u201d Obama said in an ESPN radio interview.\nPresident Obama said Friday that professional and college football have been \u201ca little bit of an old boys\u2019 network\u201d but that he thinks sports franchises are now establishing clear policies to address the off-the-field behavior of their athletes.\n\u201cSome of our greatest sports heroes \u2013 Muhammad Ali, Bill Russell, Arthur Ashe \u2013 they spoke out on issues that mattered at pretty critical times,\u201d Obama said.\nStill, he acknowledged, he spends \u201cmost of my time\u201d watching ESPN as he gets ready in the morning and doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cinundated by chatter about politics.\u201dFor more White House coverage, follow @cparsons\nAthletes are entertainers, he said, but they\u2019re also citizens."}
