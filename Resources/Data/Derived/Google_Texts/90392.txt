The only real crime here is a waste of tacos.

High school students in Lebanon, Tennessee are facing criminal charges after a food fight they allegedly started in their cafeteria on "Taco Day," the Lebanon Democrat reported.

"We all stood up and said 'food fight!' And just started throwing food," Daren Romkee, a senior at Wilson Central High School, told WSMV. "This is going down in the books."

It started as a senior prank, but the food fight got so crazy that students were throwing chairs and turning tables over, according to the station.

Some of the seniors involved are also not going to be allowed to walk during graduation -- a punishment that senior John Davidson says is too harsh.

"I think everything else we got is tolerable. You gotta do it. But walking the line, that's taking away something that's once in a lifetime," he said.

So far, eight students have been charged with vandalism and disorderly conduct, but Sheriff Robert Bryan told the Lebanon Democrat that "there are probably more charges to come."

Some groups, like the American Civil Liberties Union, are concerned that the over-criminalization of students in schools leads to something they call the school-to-prison pipeline that, they argue, hurts students and their families and does little to increase safety.
