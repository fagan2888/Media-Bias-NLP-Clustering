And he\u2019s only one of the few to achieve a successful exit.\n\nToday, Optum, a group within health-insurance giant UnitedHealth, acquired a majority stake in Verstandig\u2019s startup, Audax Health. It\u2019s not a particularly surprising outcome, given that Verstandig\u2019s vision to make \u201chealth care a consumer-focused industry\u201d is in line with most of the major insurance providers.\n\nVerstandig said by phone that the day-to-day operations of the company will not change. He will continue to run Audax alongside chief operating officer David Ko (the former COO of Zynga) and his experienced team of executives.\n\nThe terms of the deal have not been disclosed.\n\nAccording to a release, Optum is a business unit within UnitedHealth that focuses on \u201cmaking the health system work better for everyone.\u201d Vague marketing jargon aside, insurance providers are under pressure to deliver patient-focused tools that improve price transparency and offer incentives to people who stay healthy. Otherwise, they risk being toppled by upstarts in the digital health sector, like price transparency provider Castlight Health (Castlight recently filed for a monster $2 billion IPO). These days, insurance companies need to offer far more than just insurance, and Optum is UnitedHealth\u2019s technology-focused side of the business.\n\nWashington D.C.-based Audax works with insurance companies (like Cigna) to help consumers devise online health plans. Patients earn points and rewards for eating well and exercising regularly. Its flagship product is the Zensey website, which combines gamification tactics, social networking, and secure medical data sharing.\n\nA patient who walks several miles a day (and can demonstrate that on a Fitbit or other fitness tracking device) can check into Audax and receive a lower premium. \u201cWe are inherently not inside the system,\u201d said Verstandig, who explicitly refers to Audax as a technology company rather than a health care venture. \u201cWe are disrupting the system so better actions will be linked to tangible rewards,\u201d he explained.\n\nRock Health chief strategy officer Malay Gandhi said insurance providers have been grappling for years with keeping patients engaged in their health. \u201cThe issue has consistently been usage \u2014 whether it\u2019s a personal health record, medication adherence app, or a doctor selection tool, the utilization is extraordinarily low relative to the investment,\u201d he explained in an email. Meanwhile, Audax claims it can keep a consumer engaged in their health for even as little as five minutes a day, making it a strategic acquisition prospect.\n\nVerstandig dropped out of college to start Audax. He told Forbes that his frustrations about health care stemmed from a serious knee injury. Verstandig said he couldn\u2019t find sufficient information online so he decided to start a company in the space. It wasn\u2019t until he met with former Apple chief executive John Sculley that he settled on the idea for Audax.\n\nAudax Health\u2019s messaging is aligned with the goals of the Affordable Care Act. In the wake of health care reform, insurers are looking for ways to keep their patients healthier for longer so that they won\u2019t need to shell out for expensive emergency procedures. According to Verstandig, Audax has also proven useful for patients with chronic conditions, who insurers can no longer deny for coverage under the terms of the ACA.\n\nAudax has raised over $55 million in funding to date from individual backers and a slew of venture capital firms.\n\nFacebook Get more stories like this on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2014-02-19T13:11:49+00:00", "author": "christina-farr", "modDate": "2014-02-19T13:11:49+00:00", "keywords": "acquisition,audax-health-solutions,grant-verstandig,health-2,insurance,mergers-and-acquisitions", "type": "news", "id": 934616}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "Washington D.C.-based Audax works with a range of insurance companies to help consumers devise personalized online health plans.", "title": "Audax Health\u2019s 24-year-old CEO sells majority stake to\u00a0UnitedHealth", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2014/02/19/audax-healths-24-year-old-ceo-sells-majority-stake-in-the-company-to-unitedhealth/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/grant_1-528x528.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Washington D.C.-based Audax works with a range of insurance companies to help consumers devise personalized online health\u00a0plans.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Today, Optum, a group within health-insurance giant UnitedHealth, acquired a majority stake in Verstandig\u2019s startup, Audax Health.\nHe told Forbes that his frustrations about health care stemmed from a serious knee injury.\nAccording to Verstandig, Audax has also proven useful for patients with chronic conditions, who insurers can no longer deny for coverage under the terms of the ACA.\nRock Health chief strategy officer Malay Gandhi said insurance providers have been grappling for years with keeping patients engaged in their health.\n\u201cWe are inherently not inside the system,\u201d said Verstandig, who explicitly refers to Audax as a technology company rather than a health care venture."}
