There, you can see the sea ice beginning to disappear, storms gaining in intensity and entire villages preparing to pack up and leave as the land crumbles beneath their feet.\n\nWithin the next 20 years, the Arctic Ocean will see ice-free summers; within the next 30, we\u2019ll have lost two-thirds of the world\u2019s polar bears. As Edward Struzik explains in \u201cFuture Arctic: Field Notes from a World on the Edge,\u201d an engaging new account of a planet transformed, \u201cthe end of the Arctic that has existed for all modern time is upon us today.\u201d\n\nNo pressure.\n\nStruzik, an author and photographer who has spent three decades writing about the Arctic, takes it as a given that the region is changing. He\u2019s more concerned with the bigger question of what we can, and should, do about it. While he\u2019s all for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, he points out that it\u2019s already too late to do much to limit Arctic warming, at least in the short term. Nonetheless, he writes, those vast changes are, to an extent, manageable \u2014 even exploitable \u2014 if we can make the most of scientific knowledge to prepare for the surprises that are certain to come.\n\nEasier said than done, of course. As a Canadian citizen who\u2019s seen the impact of Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s pro-development, scientist-muzzling government in action, Struzik will be the first to tell you that the quasi-optimistic future he thinks is possible isn\u2019t necessarily the one we\u2019re headed toward. But the work to be done in the Arctic, he argues, is a global project. Just remember \u2014 what\u2019s happening there now is a forerunner of what the rest of the world will be experiencing in due time.\n\nSalon spoke with Struzik about the bad news from Canada, the recent good news from the U.S. and the many things we should be getting started on if we want to do the Arctic right. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the good news. You argue in your book that the Arctic as we know it is coming to an end, or maybe has already ended \u2014 but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing in every case.\n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. The history of the Arctic tells us that it\u2019s always been changing. It\u2019s just changing a lot faster now because the climate is warming there twice as fast as any place on Earth. That\u2019s not necessarily a good thing, but it is opening the Arctic to resource development, within reason. It\u2019s opening up opportunities for shipping where there are shortcuts to different destinations. It\u2019s also opening up opportunities for the indigenous people who live there, who have not done well economically in the last 50 years or so. They need something to move forward, and I think it\u2019s not the end of the world \u2014 that if we manage the future Arctic properly, we can derive some pretty good things from it.\n\nThat brings us to the bad news, because the way that we\u2019re managing it now doesn\u2019t seem to be putting us on that path, right?\n\n\n\nIf we continue with the status quo, managing it like it\u2019s the old Arctic, then yes, we are going to see polar bears disappear, caribou disappear. We\u2019re going to see opportunities wasted. The central Arctic Ocean is now ice-free, which could mean that there could be illegal fishing in the central Arctic Ocean, if there are fish there. We just don\u2019t know an awful lot of things about what\u2019s unfolding. The last 10 years have been full of surprises that we just not have been prepared for and I think that we\u2019ve got to learn those lessons.\n\nYou write in the book that some scientists working in the Arctic are more worried about its prospects than they let on, or that the science has fully caught up with. Is there something that concerns you the most?\n\nI think the thing that concerns me the most is that when I talk to scientists, privately they tell me that the changes that are coming are going to be lot more drastic than what we see in the scientific literature, because science has to pretty much be 95 percent sure before it gets into a scientific journal. But if you ask most scientists about sea ice retreat, glacier melt, permafrost thawing and what\u2019s going to happen to polar bears and other critters up there, they\u2019ll tell you privately that their educated hunch is that things are going to be changing a lot more quickly and a lot more drastically than we thought.\n\nAnd I think the last 10 years has kind of proven that. We\u2019ve seen dramatic increases in forest fires and tundra fires in the Arctic. Beluga whales are getting smaller, polar bears are getting thinner. We kind of knew that that was happening, but we don\u2019t learn about it until after the fact, and I think that\u2019s the most worrisome. There are going to be a lot of surprises to come that we\u2019re just not prepared for.\n\nI\u2019m interested in your perspective on this as a Canadian citizen. The Harper administration\u2019s treatment of the Arctic has been highly criticized \u2014 and I personally have never been able to speak with a Canadian government scientist.\n\nIt\u2019s almost surreal what\u2019s happened since the Harper government has come into power. Like you said, it\u2019s extremely difficult to get a government Canadian scientist to talk to you. I live in Edmonton, Canada where two of the government\u2019s polar bear scientists live, and I know them. But they cannot talk to me on the record about anything about polar bears. I\u2019ve been in the field with them in the past and participated in the capture of polar bears, and yet in the last six or seven years, I have not been able to get an interview with any of them.\n\nAnd I think this reflects the attitude of this government. With the decision by President Obama this week to expand the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and to put vast areas of the Arctic Ocean off limits to oil and gas development \u2014 in Canada, what we\u2019re seeing is an attempt to accelerate oil and gas development, to do nothing about polar bears or beluga whales, to essentially ignore all that we\u2019ve learned in the past 10 and 20 years in the Arctic. It\u2019s bizarre. Twelve years ago, the Canadian government literally bribed a foreign company to ship coal through the Northwest passage to prove that this is a viable shortcut. As our environment commissioner has pointed out, the Northwest passage hasn\u2019t even been charted properly. The navigational aids there are antiquated and we don\u2019t have the ice-breaking capabilities to really prove that ships can go through there safely, so what the hell are they doing? I mean, it\u2019s crazy and it\u2019s inexplicable. The only good thing I can say is that President Obama and his administration are pointing the way to the future.\n\nThat was good news to hear from the Obama administration, but it was also upsetting that he did propose to open some drilling leases in the Arctic \u2014 it\u2019s never all good news.\n\nBut at least I think you can say that there\u2019s a vision emerging in the United States. I was just in China, where David Balton, your ambassador for ocean management, was trying to engage the Chinese into discussing an international agreement not to fish in the Central Arctic ocean. It seems kind of strange that we would try and engage the Chinese and other non-Arctic countries not to fish in a part of the world where we don\u2019t know if there are fish there, but it\u2019s a precautionary approach, which I think is extremely prudent. Because if we learn the lessons of the past and you look at the Bering Sea, where people at one time didn\u2019t believe that there were fish in that donut-hole in between Russia and Alaska in the 1980s and Alaska fishermen were absolutely certain there were, the government ignored their concern. It wasn\u2019t until the Alaska fishermen chartered an airplane, flew over it in the wintertime and got video of foreign ships fishing for pollock in that area that anyone was convinced that in fact there were fish \u2014 and illegal fishing \u2014 there. What followed immediately was an agreement with Russia to try and put a stop to this, but by the time they got the agreement in place, the pollock fishery collapsed, and it has never recovered.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Arctic's changing faster than we think, says author Ed Struzik, and our neighbor to the north isn't helping", "title": "\u201cWhat the hell are they doing?\u201d: How Canada\u2019s anti-science leaders are wrecking the Arctic", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Arctic's changing faster than we think, says author Ed Struzik, and our neighbor to the north isn't helping", "title": "\u201cWhat the hell are they doing?\u201d: How Canada\u2019s anti-science leaders are wrecking the Arctic", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/01/what_the_hell_are_they_doing_how_canadas_anti_science_leaders_are_wrecking_the_arctic/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/canada_baby.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Arctic's changing faster than we think, says author Ed Struzik, and our neighbor to the north isn't helping", "title": "\u201cWhat the hell are they doing?\u201d: How Canada\u2019s anti-science leaders are wrecking the Arctic", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/canada_baby.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Arctic, Arctic melt, Barack Obama, Canada, China, Climate Change, Editor's Picks, Offshore drilling, Steve Harper", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd82ca\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Arctic, Arctic melt, Barack Obama, Canada, China, Climate Change, Editor's Picks, Offshore drilling, Steve Harper, Sustainability News, NewsIf you want to know what climate change looks like, turn your gaze north to the Arctic.\nThe central Arctic Ocean is now ice-free, which could mean that there could be illegal fishing in the central Arctic Ocean, if there are fish there.\nWithin the next 20 years, the Arctic Ocean will see ice-free summers; within the next 30, we\u2019ll have lost two-thirds of the world\u2019s polar bears.\nThe only good thing I can say is that President Obama and his administration are pointing the way to the future.\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a good thing, but it is opening the Arctic to resource development, within reason."}
