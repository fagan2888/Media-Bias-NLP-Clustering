Should Cruz persist in seeking the presidency without establishing once and for all that his birth in Canada isn\u2019t disqualifying, Trump warns, he\u2019s setting himself up for an avalanche of lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big question mark on your head \u2026 you can\u2019t do that to the party,\u201d Trump said during Thursday night\u2019s debate.\n\nRelated: Trump Shines in a Substance-Free GOP Debate\n\nOn Friday morning, Trump senior adviser Dan Scavino used Twitter to post the first page of a lawsuit, filed Thursday, in United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in Houston, along with the warning, \u201cLooks like they are underway \u2013 just the beginning.\u201d\n\n.@realDonaldTrump had mentioned lawsuits were headed Cruz's way.

And once you get a look at the original document, it\u2019s easy to see why.\n\nThe page Scavino posted might be the only one in the entire filing without egregious grammatical errors, spelling mistakes and utterly incoherent arguments.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by Houston attorney Newton Boris Schwartz, purports to be a request for declaratory judgment on the issue of Cruz\u2019s eligibility. Schwartz says that he acts on behalf of himself as well as a representative of a class of plaintiffs that includes all registered voters in the United States.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Birther Attacks on Cruz Gain Some Surprising Support\n\nRight out of the gate, the reader is treated to this: \u201cOut of the veritable deluge of public opinions on this issue a majority presently appear to agree that American citizens may agree that while Defendant Cruz is not a natural born U.S. citizen, he may be eligible. Regrettably a majority of American citizens, including constitutional scholars, may disagree with.\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter comes this gem: \u201cThe U.S. Constitution is not a popularity document for fair weather only. The first Chief Justice John Jay was equivocal in his informal contemporaneous writing but his first Supreme Court never ruled on it because it was never presented. Justice Storey in 1833 for the Supreme Court did not rule on it. It is now. \u201c\n\nAnd this is still only page 2 out of 28.\n\nIn his Twitter post, Scavino said that this lawsuit was \u201cjust the beginning.\u201d If the Trump campaign actually expects this issue to go anywhere, it had better hope so.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump has been sounding warnings about Ted Cruz\u2019s eligibility for the presidenc", "title": "The First Cruz Birther Lawsuit Is Here -- and It\u2019s Absurd", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/15/First-Cruz-Birther-Lawsuit-Here-and-It-s-Absurd", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-cruz_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/15/First-Cruz-Birther-Lawsuit-Here-and-It-s-Absurd", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-cruz_1.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Donald Trump has been sounding warnings about Ted Cruz\u2019s eligibility for the presidenc", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e1a\"", "article_summary": "The page Scavino posted might be the only one in the entire filing without egregious grammatical errors, spelling mistakes and utterly incoherent arguments.\nThe lawsuit, filed by Houston attorney Newton Boris Schwartz, purports to be a request for declaratory judgment on the issue of Cruz\u2019s eligibility.\nIn his Twitter post, Scavino said that this lawsuit was \u201cjust the beginning.\u201d If the Trump campaign actually expects this issue to go anywhere, it had better hope so.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big question mark on your head \u2026 you can\u2019t do that to the party,\u201d Trump said during Thursday night\u2019s debate.\nShould Cruz persist in seeking the presidency without establishing once and for all that his birth in Canada isn\u2019t disqualifying, Trump warns, he\u2019s setting himself up for an avalanche of lawsuits."}
