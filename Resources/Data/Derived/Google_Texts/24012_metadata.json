Beyond that, not much was clear.\n\nCMS\u2019s Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), which works with state governments to run Obamacare, didn\u2019t keep track of money spent on polling, focus groups, advertising or public relations efforts of any kind. The CCIIO couldn\u2019t verify its staff salaries or travel, either.\n\nThe core financial system that CMS uses simply couldn\u2019t provide the tracking information that the GAO requested. CMS didn\u2019t have procedures to respond to the GAO\u2019s request at all \u2014 they relied on \u201cad hoc manual procedures that were labor intensive and time consuming,\u201d the report found, and CMS consequently took months to get the data ready for the audit.\n\nWhen the data finally was ready, CMS still wasn\u2019t about to document that the information was reviewed and accurate. Without keeping track of what they\u2019re spending on Obamacare and where, the administration will not be able to determine which advertising efforts actually worked and in which states.\n\n\u201cAfter promising transparency and then ignoring repeated requests from Congress, we now find out that the administration is not even keeping track of how many taxpayer dollars are going out the door,\u201d said Republican Rep. Dave Camp, who requested the audit, in a statement. \u201cWorse yet, the administration won\u2019t even account for how much it spent on public relations campaigns promoting their unpopular law.\u201d\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Can't tell if the law is working", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Obama administration hasn't kept track of the $3.7 billion it spent last year on Obamacare and other federal health programs' implementation, according to a federal audit.
