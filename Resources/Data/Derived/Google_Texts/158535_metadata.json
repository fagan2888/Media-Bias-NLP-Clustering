Learn more.\u201d Clicking on that notification probably brought you to this video:\n\nFacebook has long been sharing user info with advertisers based on on what you might \u201clike\u201d on Facebook, list as an interest or click on your newsfeed, according to The Verge. And now, they\u2019re actually notifying users about the process.\n\nIt is part of new Facebook advertising features. Next week, users will be able to click a drop-down menu on a particular advertisement and see why you are targeted with that particular ad. Users will also be able to view their entire \u201cad preferences\u201d and make alterations to them. Seems pretty great, right? After all, Facebook did say they are \u201cgiving you control.\u201d\n\nWell, yes and no. The New York Times explains:\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s move also comes as the Federal Trade Commission and the White House have called on Congress to pass legislation that would better protect consumers\u2019 private data, including requiring companies to give people more control over the digital files collected on them. \u201cIt is unclear how privacy advocates and public officials will react to Facebook\u2019s efforts to provide more clarity about how its ads work. The F.T.C., which was briefed on the company\u2019s intentions, had no immediate comment. Users will start seeing the changes within the next few weeks. \u201cAlthough Facebook will now give its users a way to modify the customer profiles that drive the ads they see, users can\u2019t completely get rid of ads. If people were to delete everything Facebook had collected about them, they would simply see generic pitches. Nor it is clear what level of detail a user can control.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Facebook is giving folks more control over which ads they'll get, while also plowing deeper into user data VIDEO", "author": "Sarah Gray", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Facebook is giving folks more control over which ads they'll get, while also plowing deeper into user data VIDEO", "title": "Facebook\u2019s faux transparency: The company is rolling out a new ad plan while digging deeper into user data", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/12/facebooks_faux_transparency_the_company_is_rolling_out_a_new_ad_plan_while_digging_deeper_into_user_data/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/zuckerberg_beleaguered.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Facebook is giving folks more control over which ads they'll get, while also plowing deeper into user data VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/zuckerberg_beleaguered.jpg", "title": "Facebook\u2019s faux transparency: The company is rolling out a new ad plan while digging deeper into user data", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Facebook\u2019s faux transparency: The company is rolling out a new ad plan while digging deeper into user data", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, advertisers, Facebook, Privacy, Silicon Valley, Social Media, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf196\"", "article_summary": "If people were to delete everything Facebook had collected about them, they would simply see generic pitches.\nNor it is clear what level of detail a user can control.\u201d\n\u201cIt is unclear how privacy advocates and public officials will react to Facebook\u2019s efforts to provide more clarity about how its ads work.\nNext week, users will be able to click a drop-down menu on a particular advertisement and see why you are targeted with that particular ad.\nUsers will also be able to view their entire \u201cad preferences\u201d and make alterations to them."}
