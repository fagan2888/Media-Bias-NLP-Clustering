Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) has begun attacking his Republican rival with a television ad that plays on Ed Gillespie\u2019s lobbying past.\n\n\u201cEnron. The largest corporate fraud in American history. And Ed Gillespie was their lobbyist,\u201d the narrator says. News clips flash about the Enron employees who lost their jobs and savings and the executives who were sent to prison. With historical footage in the background, the ad tells viewers Gillespie was paid $700,000 to lobby for Enron. The Enron collapse happened in October 2001, and Gillespie\u2019s firm cut ties with Enron in December of that year.\n\nThat dollar figure is derived from two Senate lobbying disclosures filed by Gillespie\u2019s firm. He was one of four lobbyists registered as working with Enron.\n\nThe ad ends: \u201cEnron\u2019s Ed Gillespie. The million-dollar lobbyist who put Enron ahead of you.\u201d\n\nWarner is one of the safer Democratic incumbents facing reelection next month, but he\u2019s still an incumbent in a swing state in an unfavorable environment for his party. A recent Quinnipiac poll gave Warner a nine-point lead over Gillespie, suggesting a narrower race than earlier surveys finding the Democrat ahead by double digits.\n\nWhile Warner has brought up Enron in a debate and the Virginia Democratic Party has done so in billboards, this six-figure statewide ad buy is by far the senator\u2019s most direct and substantial attack on Gillespie\u2019s career as a lobbyist.\n\n\u201cThis ad attacking Ed over a client company at his bipartisan firm 13 years and four jobs ago is the definition of hypocrisy, since it\u2019s a company Warner himself owned stock in at the time,\u201d Gillespie spokesman Paul Logan said. A 2002 Richmond Times-Dispatch article reported that Warner sold shares in Enron in 2001.\n\nGillespie has not been a registered lobbyist since 2007, when he left the bipartisan Quinn Gillespie & Associates for a job at the White House. Before launching his Senate campaign, he was running his own consulting firm, Gillespie Strategies. On the campaign trail, he has emphasized his college job as a parking attendant on Capitol Hill, not his career helping corporate clients navigate the place.\n\nThe Republican has begun launching his own attack ads, focused on Warner\u2019s votes in support of President Obama in general and the Affordable Care Act in particular. The most recent ad, \u201cLie of the Year,\u201d features video of the senator promising in 2009 not to support a health-care plan that would take away anyone\u2019s current insurance.\n\n\u201cMark Warner helped pass Obamacare, denying families the insurance and doctors we trust,\u201d Gillespie says in the ad. \u201c. . . I\u2019ll replace Obamacare with market reforms that create jobs, hold down costs, and let us keep our insurance and doctors.\u201d\n\nThe fact-checking Web site PolitiFact gave President Obama its \u201cLie of the Year\u201d award in 2013 for repeatedly promising that people who liked their health-care plans could keep them. PolitiFact\u2019s Virginia arm has since argued that it is inaccurate to apply the same label to Warner, an interpretation that Republicans dispute. Warner has pushed back on that barrage with his own ad labeling the attack \u201cfalse\u201d and saying he is working to fix health care.\n\nThus far, Warner has outpaced his opponent in fundraising and has outspent him 3 to 1 on TV ads. The two are scheduled to debate again Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A month before Election Day, Sen.
