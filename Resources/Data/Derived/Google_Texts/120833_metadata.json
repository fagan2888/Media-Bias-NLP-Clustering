Jay Nixon, a Democrat, marked New Year\u2019s Eve by calling on Republican state legislators who rebuffed Obamacare to reconsider.\n\n\u201cTomorrow, roughly $37 billion \u2014 including 2 billion of Missourians\u2019 tax dollars \u2014 will begin to flow to 25 states that are reforming and improving their health care systems,\u201d he said. \u201cStates like Arkansas and New Jersey, Iowa and New Mexico, Michigan and Ohio, Arizona and North Dakota.\u201d\n\nIn New Hampshire, state Rep. Cindy Rosenwald, a Democrat, made a similar pitch in an op-ed that said Medicaid expansion should be the legislature\u2019s top priority when it returns to Concord this week.\n\n\u201cThis is tax money we already send to Washington, only now it will be returned to New Hampshire,\u201d she wrote in the Nashua Telegraph.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, as written by Congress, included generous terms for states that expand their Medicaid rolls to include those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. But lawmakers also said states that didn\u2019t expand their rolls would lose most Medicaid funding.\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down that latter provision, saying the government couldn\u2019t force an all-or-nothing choice on the states, a decision that effectively left it up to each state whether to accept the expansion.\n\nStates had to declare last year whether they would expand Medicaid, which spawned battles between the two major political parties and among Republicans, but in states that refused, some lawmakers have promised to try again.\n\nThis year, \u201cit\u2019s safe to say Medicaid will be an issue in many states,\u201d said Melissa Hansen, a program principal at the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nRepublican governors such as Jan Brewer in Arizona, John Kasich in Ohio and Chris Christie in New Jersey, have moved forward with Mr. Obama\u2019s expansion after deciding it was a good deal for their states.\n\nSupporters of Mr. Obama\u2019s reforms say the expansion is a no-brainer that injects money into state economies and offers a compassionate lifeline to the poorest Americans.\n\nIt also prevents an odd coverage gap for as many as 5 million Americans, according to Kaiser Family Foundation estimates. These people earn too much for Medicaid but too little to qualify for subsidized private plans on state-based health care exchanges.\n\nThe federal government is paying 100 percent of the costs of expansion, but opponents doubt it will live up to its commitment to states by 2020, when the federal share is scaled back to 90 percent.\n\nDetractors received new ammunition last week in the form of a study from Oregon that suggests Medicaid beneficiaries tend to visit emergency rooms more often \u2014 not less, as health care reform proponents have suggested.\n\nRepublicans looking for a compromise may be swayed by reform models in states like Arkansas, which is leveraging the federal dollars to purchase private coverage for those who are newly eligible, rather than expanding traditional Medicaid coverage.\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican, put forth a Tennessee Plan that would use available federal dollars to buy private coverage for the expanded population.\n\nBut \u201cbecause Medicaid programs differ from state to state,\u201d his spokeswoman Alexia Poe said, \u201cwhat we\u2019re trying to do here, looks different than Arkansas, Iowa, etc.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, put forward his Healthy Pennsylvania plan in September to revamp Medicaid, which eats up nearly a third of the state\u2019s general fund each year, governor\u2019s spokeswoman Christine Cronkright said.\n\nAmong the plan\u2019s mandates is a requirement for working-age beneficiaries to seek employment. The overall plan is being vetted in hearings this month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly looked at what other states have done and learned from that,\u201d Ms. Cronkright said, \u201cbut we also saw the need to provide a uniquely Pennsylvania solution that would help us to increase access to quality, affordable healthcare while also finding ways to safeguard our Medicaid program for those who rely upon it well into the future.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Obamacare now in effect across the country, some Republican-led states will revisit their decisions to reject an expansion of Medicaid, once again deciding whether their contempt for the Affordable Care Act outweighs the allure of additional federal money in the short term.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With Obamacare now in effect across the country, some Republican-led states will revisit their decisions to reject an expansion of Medicaid, once again deciding whether their contempt for the Affordable Care Act outweighs the allure of additional federal money in the short term.", "title": "Republican-led states rethink rejection of Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/9/republican-led-states-rethink-rejection-of-medicai/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/01/9_1_2013_ap110709300158201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/01/9_1_2013_ap110709300158201.jpg", "description": "With Obamacare now in effect across the country, some Republican-led states will revisit their decisions to reject an expansion of Medicaid, once again deciding whether their contempt for the Affordab", "card": "summary", "title": "Republican-led states rethink rejection of Medicaid expansion"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Health Medical Pharma"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b19\"", "article_summary": "Jay Nixon, a Democrat, marked New Year\u2019s Eve by calling on Republican state legislators who rebuffed Obamacare to reconsider.\nSEE ALSO: White House PR blitz hits states that rejected Medicaid expansionMissouri Gov.\nBut this year\u2019s debate is different in a key respect: Governors and lawmakers now see how the expansion is playing out in other states.\nThe expansion took effect in 25 states and the District of Columbia last week, and cross-border envy is a major talking point among editorial writers and governors who haven\u2019t given up on expansion.\nBut lawmakers also said states that didn\u2019t expand their rolls would lose most Medicaid funding."}
