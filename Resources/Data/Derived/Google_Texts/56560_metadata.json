The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Sabres did not disclose the monetary terms.\n\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s extension will kick in after he completes the final year of his existing contract, which will pay him $6.2 million next season. He will make $11 million in the 2016-17 season of an extension that runs through the 2022-23 season.\n\nThe 24-year-old O\u2019Reilly is regarded as a top-line talent and was acquired from Colorado in a trade that involved five players during the first round of the NHL draft June 26.\n\nThe Sabres also acquired forward Jamie McGinn, while giving up forwards Mikhail Grigorenko and JT Compher, defenseman Nikita Zadorov and the 31st pick in the draft.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to find a player who, at his age, is already established in the league as someone who plays a complete game and makes his teammates better,\u201d Sabres general manager Tim Murray said of O\u2019Reilly. \u201cWhen we acquired him, we viewed him as someone who could immediately improve our roster, but was still young enough to make an impact for several years to come. And this contract reflects that belief.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly will get an opportunity to play alongside rookie center Jack Eichel, who was selected with the second pick in the draft. O\u2019Reilly had 17 goals and 55 points in 80 games with the Avalanche last season.\n\nHe also led Avalanche forwards in averaging nearly 20 minutes of ice time.\n\nThe sixth-year NHL player has 90 goals and 246 points in 427 games during his career.\n\nO\u2019Reilly is a key fixture in a rebuilding process for a Sabres team that is coming off consecutive last-place finishes.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ryan O\u2019Reilly signs with Buffalo, becomes Sabres\u2019 highest-paid player", "title": "Ryan O\u2019Reilly signs with Buffalo, becomes Sabres\u2019 highest-paid player", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/03/ryan-oreilly-signs-with-buffalo-becomes-sabres-highest-paid-player/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-03T20:30:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-03T20:30:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc861\"", "article_summary": "BUFFALO, N.Y. \u2014 The Sabres made newly acquired forward Ryan O\u2019Reilly their highest-paid player by signing him to a $52.5 million, seven-year contract extension Friday.\nO\u2019Reilly is a key fixture in a rebuilding process for a Sabres team that is coming off consecutive last-place finishes.\nThe Sabres announced the signing, while two people familiar with discussions revealed the value of the contract to The Associated Press.\nHe will make $11 million in the 2016-17 season of an extension that runs through the 2022-23 season.\nThe sixth-year NHL player has 90 goals and 246 points in 427 games during his career."}
