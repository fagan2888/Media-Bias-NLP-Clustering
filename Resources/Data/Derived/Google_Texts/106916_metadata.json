It\u2019s like that point in 2008 when Obama supporters hated, hated the individual mandate that eventually became, as it had to, a central piece of Obamacare.\n\nBut anyway, it does seem worth pointing out that progressivity of taxes is not the most important thing, even when your concern is inequality. Notably, Nordic countries \u2014 very much including Denmark, which Sanders has praised as a model \u2014 rely heavily on the VAT, which is a regressive tax; but they use that revenue to pay for a strong social safety net, which is much more important.\n\nIf we add in the reality that heavy soda consumption really is destructive, with the consequences falling most heavily on low-income children, I\u2019d say that Sanders is very much on the wrong side here.
