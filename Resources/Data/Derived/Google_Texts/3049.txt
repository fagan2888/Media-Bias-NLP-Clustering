Stop me if you’ve heard this storyline before: a pious Catholic turns out to be an evil hypocrite. Yes, this tired trope was seen once again on TV last night, this time in The X-Files episode “Founder’s Mutation.” Sadly this is the second time in a row The X-Files has used conspiracy theories to impugn the right and it's getting old.

In The X-Files’ second season, alien clones were shown to be working in abortion clinics so they could do experiments with the fetal tissue (Planned Parenthood sells baby parts...to aliens? HA!) In this new iteration, it is pro-life “champion” Dr. Augustus Goldman (Doug Savant) who is the villain; stealing babies from the womb to experiment on and giving them alien DNA under the guise of helping pregnant women.

FBI Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) discover this plot at the Catholic hospital where Scully works when they seek to connect with the mysterious, secretive Dr. Goldman under the pretense of an investigation – “Obamacare,” Mulder says by way of explanation. Dr. Goldman is called “a true champion of the unborn” and “a blessing” for funding the program for pregnant women in need run by Sister Mary.

Of course Sister Mary turns out to be working with Dr. Goldman on the grand conspiracy to colonize the planet with a human-alien hybrid super species through genetic mutations and eugenics by using human women as incubators. Because Hollywood can’t ever show pro-life Catholics doing anything out of the goodness of their hearts; it always has to be for nefarious reasons.
