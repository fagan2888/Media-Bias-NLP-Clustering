I had to move back in with my parents after everything they have done for me.\u201d\n\nWhen the counselor moves one to the next person, the man introduces himself and says he\u2019s unemployed. Right now, 13 million Millennials are looking work\u2013and can\u2019t find it.\n\nAFP President Tim Phillip said in a statement:\n\nMillennials in America are getting crushed by harmful policies coming out of Washington. Young men and women across the country are struggling with a stagnating economy and lethargic job market. \u201cSadly, big-government politicians are making life more difficult for young people by continuing to support short-sighted policies that stifle entrepreneurship and job creation. It\u2019s time for all of us to stand up and defend the American Dream for the next generation.\u201d\n\nThe ad has a simple narrative: the addictions of big government are killing job opportunities and the American dream. Obamacare and its regulations are creating a highly volatile job market. And the national debt and deficit are still out of control.\n\nYes, government needs an intervention.

But make no mistake: these policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.\"\n\nVoters will surely remember those words, especially those who feel that this president has been a monumental disappointment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Big government is an addiction, but elections can be the cure..05/26/2016 19:47:58PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Big government is an addiction, but elections can be the cure.", "title": "- Millennial Generation Suffers The Impact Of Addiction...From Big Government", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/10/15/millennial-generation-suffers-the-impact-of-addictionfrom-big-government-n1905660", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/10/15/12.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Big government is an addiction, but elections can be the cure.", "title": "- Millennial Generation Suffers The Impact Of Addiction...From Big Government", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/10/15/millennial-generation-suffers-the-impact-of-addictionfrom-big-government-n1905660", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/10/15/12.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Millennial Generation Suffers The Impact Of Addiction...From Big Government, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s time for all of us to stand up and defend the American Dream for the next generation.\u201dThe ad has a simple narrative: the addictions of big government are killing job opportunities and the American dream.\nObamacare and its regulations are creating a highly volatile job market.\nYoung men and women across the country are struggling with a stagnating economy and lethargic job market.\nAFP President Tim Phillip said in a statement:Millennials in America are getting crushed by harmful policies coming out of Washington.\nVoters will surely remember those words, especially those who feel that this president has been a monumental disappointment."}
