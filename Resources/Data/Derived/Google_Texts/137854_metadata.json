The Florida senator did the one thing a candidate should never do \u2013 Rubio confirmed an unflattering caricature \u2013 and he did so on a widely seen national television event at a key juncture in the campaign.\n\nBut just as important as the Floridian\u2019s panic-induced repetition was the point Rubio kept repeating, word for word: \u201cLet\u2019s dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. He is trying to change this country.\u201d\n\nToday, the senator practically bragged about the source of his embarrassment. The New York Times reported\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to say it again,\u201d Mr. Rubio said in front of a crowd of about 1,000 people who packed a high school cafeteria here, one of his largest New Hampshire audiences. \u201cBarack Obama is the first president, at least in my lifetime, who wants to change the country. Change the country \u2013 not fix it. Not fix its problems. He wants to make it a different kind of country.\u201d\n\nIt may seem like a strange thing for Rubio to whine about. In 1985, Ronald Reagan said he intended to \u201c change America forever ,\u201d and the Republican icon had some success on this front. Bill Clinton ran on a \u201cchange\u201d platform, and he too delivered on a series of changes.\n\nGeorge W, Bush, for good or ill, changed the country. Barack Obama, love him or hate him, changed the country. People very rarely seek national office because they intend to leave things exactly as they are. On the contrary, would-be leaders seek powerful offices because they\u2019re not satisfied with the status quo.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on this, but a President Rubio \u201cwants to change the country,\u201d too \u2013 by taking away families\u2019 health care benefits, ending efforts to combat climate change, turning back the clock on marriage equality, giving the wealthy a massive tax break the country can\u2019t afford, etc.\n\nAll of which leads to a rather basic question: why in the world is Rubio complaining so incessantly about President Obama being an agent of change? If you\u2019ve misplaced your right-wing decoder ring, there\u2019s an actually an underappreciated answer to all of this.\n\nRevisiting the transcript , take a look at the sentences that immediately follow Rubio\u2019s robotic, repetitious talking points: \u201cLet\u2019s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world. That\u2019s why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America.\u201d\n\nMoments later he added, \u201cWe are not facing a president that doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows what he is doing. That\u2019s why he\u2019s done the things he\u2019s done. That\u2019s why we have a president that passed Obamacare and the stimulus. All this damage that he\u2019s done to America is deliberate.\u201d\n\nRead that last sentence one more time: \u201c All this damage that he\u2019s done to America is deliberate .\u201d\n\nThis will probably seem silly to most of the American mainstream, but Rubio not only rejects some of the president\u2019s most notable accomplishments \u2013 bringing affordable health care to millions of families, rescuing the country from the Great Recession, adding new safeguards and layers of accountability to Wall Street, blocking Iran\u2019s access to a nuclear weapon \u2013 the senator actually sees them as deliberate efforts to undermine the United States.\n\nNo, seriously. This isn\u2019t a joke. In Rubio\u2019s mind, the Recovery Act, which ended the recession, was \u201cdamaging\u201d to the country. The Affordable Care Act, which cut the uninsured rate to a level unseen in modern history, is part of a \u201cdeliberate\u201d campaign to sabotage America.\n\nSalon\u2019s Simon Maloy explained today:\n\nIf you\u2019ve listened to a lot of conservative radio (or watched just a few seconds of Glenn Beck) then you\u2019ve probably come across this theme. Each AM dial screamer has his own variation on the \u201cBarack Obama is deliberately trying to undermine the United States\u201d theory\u2026. They\u2019re all slightly different routes to the same destination: Obama is deliberately harming the country by targeting and destroying the things that make us uniquely \u201cAmerican.\u201d It\u2019s a dark, paranoid vision of the Obama presidency that sets up the twice-elected Democrat as a sort of supervillain whose policy achievements are rooted in malevolence. And here comes Marco Rubio, the emerging favorite of the Republican establishment, offering a very lightly sanitized version of this same lunatic message.\n\nQuite right. In right-wing circles, it\u2019s not enough to believe Obama is simply wrong. These conservatives also somehow managed to convince themselves that the president, motivated by a deep-seated anti-American animus, is actually carrying out a campaign intended to undermine the United States, on purpose, from within the White House.\n\nAnd while such an unhinged perspective may seem limited to crackpot fringe, Rubio was offering subtle support for this argument with his carefully scripted talking points, which he repeated on Saturday night. And then repeated again. And then again. And then once more with feeling.\n\nThe Washington Post \u2019s Paul Waldman characterized such nonsense as \u201c positively insane ,\u201d which seems more than fair under the circumstances.
