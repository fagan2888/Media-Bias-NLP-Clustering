No one wants to admit it, but everyone knows many items are returned after Christmas because of unwanted gifts. Retailers certainly know it.

Keemonica Mauriscey, Best Buy General Manager says there is always a rush after Christmas.

"They're coming in doing returns or exchanges either for things they wanted or didn't want and getting gift cards in return for those items. It's just busy you think Christmas is over, everything is done, but it is still busy and we just love it," says Mauriscey.

Best Buy has a special policy for Christmas returns. Purchases made between November 1 and December 31, customers have until January 15 to return items.

Their normal policy doesn't accept returns after 15 days.What about the gifts that didn't come with a receipt?

"No receipt returns are a case by case depending on what it is, but typically we don't do no receipt returns," says Mauriscey.

In some cases you may be able to recieve store credit.

Mauriscey says gift cards are always a popular gift so many people are happy with store credit. She says with all the returns and shoppers that have gift cards or christmas money burning a hole in their pocket, it can get extremely busy.

"We make sure we have enough people in here to cover the amount of traffi,c especially people using those gift cards. They're definitely coming back in to shop with us and it's just super busy so we make sure we keep it staffed and make sure the customers get taken care of," says Mauriscey.
