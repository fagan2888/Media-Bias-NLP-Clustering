Supervisor Shawn Nelson voted no.\n\nXerox State and Local Solutions will overhaul the county\u2019s phone and computer networks, which serve 17,000 employees. The contracting process sparked intense years-long lobbying from industry and labor, and pricing disputes made for the latest in a string of IT controversies.\n\nUltimately, the supervisors swallowed a disputed $26 million price increase since the company\u2019s final bid in November, though that figure was about $1 million lower than a July proposal.\n\nFor the most part, supervisors Tuesday didn\u2019t address concerns about the Xerox price hike. Nelson chided company executives for the increase at the July 30 board meeting, but he did not elaborate Tuesday. In a staff report, the county attributed $11 million of the jump to Xerox and $15 million to the IT department\u2019s own demands.\n\n\u201cI have before you a contract that is clear in terms of what it provides, clear in terms of cost, and clear in terms of who is responsible for what,\u201d Chief Information Officer Mahesh Patel told the supervisors.\n\nXerox plans to merge phone and computer networks, and will install \u201cvoice over Internet protocol,\u201d a system that runs phone service on the Internet. The county estimates the new contract will save $33.4 million over the five years.\n\nRepresentatives from the Orange County Employees Association disputed some of the cost assumptions and contract terms. OCEA General Manager Nick Berardino also criticized supervisors\u2019 campaign contributions from Xerox lobbyists and their political action committees.\n\n\u201cIf you get money from people, they\u2019re going to influence you,\u201d said Berardino, who acknowledged his union also contributes.\n\nAs many as 20 county employees could be displaced by the outsourcing, Patel said, although he will try to move them to another department. Failing that, Xerox agreed to interview workers for positions at the company.\n\nIn other matters, the board unanimously approved the hiring of 90 eligibility workers at the Social Services Agency, for Affordable Care Act implementation. Also, supervisors approved unanimously a contract with Corrective Solutions for the Probation Department\u2019s GPS device monitoring. In August, the county fired its last GPS contractor after reports some offenders were left unsupervised.\n\nContact the writer: 714-796-2254", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "news", "description": "News: Supervisors approve disputed $132 million IT contract | county, million, supervisors, xerox, contract, terms, clear, board, phone, employees", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "MIKE REICHER", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Putting to rest a controversial $132 million information technology contract, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to approve a five-year deal with Xerox.", "title": "Supervisors approve disputed $132 million IT contract", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/county-525214-million-supervisors.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/msxv1h-b781173131z.120130910185921000gqu1frrb3.2.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/msxv1h-b781173131z.120130910185921000gqu1frrb3.2.jpg"}, "description": "Putting to rest a controversial $132 million information technology contract, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to approve a five-year deal with Xerox.", "site": "@ocregister", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Supervisors approve disputed $132 million IT contract"}, "content_author": "MIKE REICHER", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/msxv1h-b781173131z.120130910185921000gqu1frrb3.2.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "county, million, supervisors, xerox, contract, terms, clear, board, phone, employees", "publication_date": "2013-09-10", "access-type": "free", "section": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Supervisors approve disputed $132 million IT contract"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3bc\"", "article_summary": "Putting to rest a controversial $132 million information technology contract, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to approve a five-year deal with Xerox.\nRepresentatives from the Orange County Employees Association disputed some of the cost assumptions and contract terms.\nUltimately, the supervisors swallowed a disputed $26 million price increase since the company\u2019s final bid in November, though that figure was about $1 million lower than a July proposal.\nAs many as 20 county employees could be displaced by the outsourcing, Patel said, although he will try to move them to another department.\nIn a staff report, the county attributed $11 million of the jump to Xerox and $15 million to the IT department\u2019s own demands."}
