People who would disagree with that would say it\u2019s because we left without leaving a remnant force behind, and without maintaining diplomatic ties behind as well.\n\nWhatever the case, Moore said he believes now is a time for empathy.\n\n\u201cWe need to have compassion upon people who are fleeing from this sort of tyranny, many of which are brothers and sisters in Christ,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission held an event Wednesday in Washington called \u201cThe Syrian Refugee Crisis: A Christian Response\u201d as a way to encourage a thoughtful discussion.\n\nDozens of conservative leaders who make up the Conservative Action Project called Nov. 30 for tougher vetting of Syrian refugees.\n\nBecause the vetting process for refugees takes nearly two years, Moore told The Daily Signal before his organization\u2019s event, he is comfortable that a good system is in place. Still, he acknowledges that America can\u2019t be the only country doing the heavy lifting:\n\nThere\u2019s a limit on what the United States is able to do in terms of actually resettling refugees. Saudi Arabia is doing virtually nothing for refugees[, and] we don\u2019t want to emulate Saudi Arabia. We don\u2019t want to emulate Middle Eastern countries that are turning their back on this humanitarian crisis.\n\nAlso, with Christians also being beheaded and tortured by ISIS, Moore said it\u2019s time for the Obama administration to change its public position.\n\nAmericans \u201cneed to make sure we have a government that calls what\u2019s going on in the Middle East what it is, which is genocide,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Obama administration is very reluctant to do that.\u201d\n\nMoore added:\n\nThey\u2019re willing to use the genocide label when it comes to Yazidis, and that is correct. But it is also genocide directed toward Christian communities. ISIS is making the religious distinctions. They\u2019re the ones specifically targeting Christian communities for murder, rape, kidnapping, and systemic persecution.\n\nKen McIntyre contributed to this article.\n\n>>> Syrian Immigration Poses \u2018Grave Threat,\u2019 Conservative Leaders Say", "article_metadata": {"description": "Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, says many Syrian refugees \"are brothers and sisters in Christ.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, says many Syrian refugees \"are brothers and sisters in Christ.\u201d", "title": "Evangelical Leader: US Has Duty to Those Fleeing ISIS", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151210_MooreRefugees_Brody.png", "updated_time": "2015-12-10T17:41:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1XPVpAM"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, says many Syrian refugees \"are brothers and sisters in Christ.\u201d", "title": "Evangelical Leader: US Has Duty to Those Fleeing ISIS", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151210_MooreRefugees_Brody.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-12-10T17:04:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-10T17:41:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "refugees, Syria, Syrian refugees, ISIS, Islamic State, terrorism, Russell Moore, immigration, Middle East Christians"}, "article_summary": "Russell Moore, one of the nation\u2019s leading evangelical Christian voices, says America has a moral obligation to take in Syrian refugees fleeing the brutality of the terrorist army known as the Islamic State, or ISIS.\nDozens of conservative leaders who make up the Conservative Action Project called Nov. 30 for tougher vetting of Syrian refugees.\nAlso, with Christians also being beheaded and tortured by ISIS, Moore said it\u2019s time for the Obama administration to change its public position.\n\u201cWe need to have compassion upon people who are fleeing from this sort of tyranny, many of which are brothers and sisters in Christ,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have a responsibility as a country to this region of the world,\u201d Moore said in an interview with The Daily Signal."}
