They soon found themselves staring at an empty cupboard.\n\n\u201cYou open up the closet and all we had was coffee,\u201d said Angelo Maffucci, 82, who had been a drywall installer in New Jersey. \u201cI never thought we would be down on our hands and knees like that, but it happened fast.\u201d\n\nWhile the U.S. economy adds jobs and the financial markets steadily improve, a growing number of seniors are having trouble keeping food on the table. In 2013, the most recent data available, 9.6 million Americans over the age of 60 \u2014or one of every six older men and women\u2014could not reliably buy or access food at least part of the year, according to an analysis from researchers at the University of Kentucky and the University of Illinois.\n\nEnid Borden, president of the National Foundation to End Senior Hunger in Alexandria, Va., which commissioned the report, said the country was doing a \u201cworse job in trying to end senior hunger in America,\u201d noting that the number of seniors who \u201cface the threat of hunger has gone up every single year since we started doing the research on this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s not good,\u201d she said.\n\nAcross the country, the rate of food insecurity\u2014the academic term for a disruption in the mundane yet vital task of maintaining a basic, nutritious diet\u2014among seniors has more than doubled since 2001, according to the National Council on Aging. And it is projected to climb even further as the Baby Boom generation gets older.\n\nThe precise conditions fueling the increase in senior hunger are unclear: the poverty rate for seniors, in fact, fell from 2001 to 2005, though it has risen every year since, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. And, all the while, the rate of food insecurity among older Americans has ticked upward.\n\nBut researchers who study the trend say the causes are complicated and overlap. There are the logistical challenges of getting to a grocery store when many seniors can no longer drive, either because of physical disability or because they cannot afford a car. Long rides on public transportation are difficult to endure for seniors suffering from illness, disability and dementia. And those maladies alone can rob seniors of the ability to feed themselves.\n\nOut-of-pocket medical expenses, which increase steadily as people age, often use up large portions of monthly income for seniors, monies that otherwise might be used on groceries.\n\nThe descent into privation for seniors accustomed to middle-class life is usually swift and unforgiving, say the advocates who aid them, and it is often also triggered by failing health, the inability to work or the death of a spouse.\n\nFor Sarah Knight, 75, that moment arrived when her husband, a former jeweler from New Jersey who has Alzheimer\u2019s disease, left his job at a Naples supermarket. As his disease robbed her husband of his faculties, the couples\u2019 budget also suffered.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just falling apart,\u201d Knight said of her husband.\n\nJust one of his medications costs $125 a month, she said, and there is little left from their Social Security check for essentials like food and toilet paper. She found assistance at Jewish Family and Community Services of Southwest Florida, which gives her $100 a month for food and gas and helped her apply for food stamps. Knight was awarded $16 a month, but she says that help comes with a psychological cost.\n\n\u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve struggled. So, now, in my 70s, I have to struggle all, all over again?\u201d said Knight. \u201cYou know how ashamed I get?\u201d\n\nThat sentiment is echoed by Joanne Bartolomeo, 95, who retired from Philadelphia to Naples and continued to work at an upscale dress shop in the tony Venetian Village until just a few years ago. But after an emergency surgery, Bartolomeo could no longer work; she couldn\u2019t keep up with her rising rent and money for food became scarce. Her life was swept into disarray.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing that bothers me,\u201d said Bartolomeo. \u201cAt one time, I was in control.\u201d\n\nPride is one the central reasons, experts say, that only one-third of eligible seniors are enrolled in food stamps, compared to three-quarters of the eligible general population.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different generation,\u201d said Thomas Felke, an assistant professor of social work at Florida Gulf Coast University. The idea of relying on government benefits \u201cmay not be something that they admit to,\u201d he added, especially after what \u201cthey thought was going to be their life in paradise.\u201d\n\nAnd many seniors, who have perhaps never before navigated the sometimes complicated public services safety net, don\u2019t know where to look for help or mistakenly believe they don\u2019t qualify for food stamps or other assistance programs, including the Commodity Supplemental Food Program.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a single senior sitting in an apartment, you don\u2019t know what to do, you don\u2019t know where to go,\u201d said Al Brislain, president of Harry Chapin Food Bank in Fort Myers, Florida.\n\nTo help reach potential hungry seniors, Brislain employs social workers who scour local apartment buildings, senior centers and elsewhere to get the word out about food pantries, home-delivery services like Meals on Wheels and government programs.\n\nWhen the discussions reveal deep embarrassment over a senior\u2019s plight, Brislain says he reassures older Americans \u201cthat they deserve this help, that it\u2019s neighbors helping neighbors, that it\u2019s the government supporting you in your time of need.\u201d\n\nIn Naples, the prospect of poverty and hunger hiding amid the towering beachside condominiums and acres of golf courses has been a blow to the city\u2019s image as a ritzy retirement destination and vacation playland. Just a short drive from the upscale Fifth Avenue shopping district, with its impressive palm trees and faux-colonial architecture, are gated communities where researchers, using Census data, have detected surprisingly high rates of poverty. But following up door-to-door to find out more about the well-being and food insecurity has proved challenging.\n\n\u201cThese gated communities don\u2019t want people coming around asking questions about poverty,\u201d said Felke. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to find out who is hungry, who is struggling.\u201d\n\nWith the help of a Naples food pantry and a weekly ration of $34 in food stamps, the Maffuccis\u2019 cupboards are no longer bare. But nor are they filled with nutritious food. A recent delivery included flavored Dunkin\u2019 Donuts coffee, Uncle Ben\u2019s rice, matzos and pasta.\n\nAngelo Maffucci\u2019s doctor has long urged him to lose weight, especially by eating more vegetables and fish, but it can be a challenge.\n\n\u201cWhere you gonna get the money to buy the fish? Fish is expensive!\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have it once a week, you\u2019re lucky.\u201d\n\nSo on most days, the couple eats pasta instead. \u201cYou can cook a pound of pasta for less than $2, and you get a meal,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that and a cup of coffee, we get through the day.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
