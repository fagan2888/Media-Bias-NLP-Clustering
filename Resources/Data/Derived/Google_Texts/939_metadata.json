Perhaps there were others, but nothing that I can recall. The one was bad enough.Dad was really in his prime of medical practice in the early 1970s when he missed a rare cardiac ailment in a woman. Married with 3 children, the lady tragically died from the condition.The lawyers from dad\u2019s malpractice insurance firm recommended that he settle rather than go to court. I guess a courtroom with a widower and father with 3 teenage children would have been a personal injury lawyer\u2019s dream. The settlement was very big for its time\u2014about $500,000 (that\u2019s nearly $3 million in today\u2019s dollars).\u201cI never saw a case like that and my physician colleagues at the time and all through the years after said they never did either,\u201d dad told me after he retired from medicine. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter though, I was responsible.\u201dI remember that the case greatly troubled my father (and my mother), but I don\u2019t know if it impacted his style of doctoring. I do recollect a bit of unpleasantness personally from some of the family members (they lived in our hometown). I never knew why until later.Was it a total misdiagnosis? Was it a delayed diagnosis? Again, I can\u2019t recall. And while dad was generally open to my questions about his doctor career, on this matter, I had to pull it out of him. Back then\u2014true glory years for physicians\u2014whether there was medical negligence or not, patients seldom sued their doctor.Here are a few facts about medical malpractice:\u2022 The total amount of money paid out in all US medical malpractice cases in 2013 was $3.7 billion. The high was in 2003, when the total reached $5.7 billion.\u2022 96% of medical malpractice cases are settled out of court.\u2022 The states with the highest per capita malpractice payouts are: New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut; the lowest were North Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin, Mississippi, and Indiana.\u2022 As to patients\u2019 type in malpractice cases, 45% are inpatients and 38% are outpatients.\u2022 The top 5 malpractice allegations are from: diagnosis (33%), surgery (23%), treatment (18%), obstetrics (10%), and medication/anesthesia (10%).\u2022 The median malpractice case payout in 2013 was $195,000, that\u2019s down from a high of $218,400 in 2007.\u2022 Malpractice insurance premiums for doctors are declining. In 2013, on average, internists saw their rates drop by 1.6%, rates for general surgeons fell by 1.3%, and OB/GYN rates were down by 1.7%.\u2022 One-third of all physicians pay more than $10,000 per year in malpractice insurance premiums.\u2022 The top anesthesia-related malpractice injury claims are: teeth damage (21%), death (18%), nerve damage (13%), organ damage (13%), pain (11%), and cardiopulmonary arrest (11%).\u2022 Thee average US physicians spends 10% of his/her medical career waiting for a malpractice case to be resolved.\u2022 Up to 16% of all medical malpractice cases are filed against primary care doctors. For PCPs, the top two causes for malpractice suits are a missed diagnosis and drug errors. The top 3 missed diagnoses were meningitis, heart attack, and cancer.\u2022 40% of physicians say that their monthly patient care volume can lead to errors.Sources: National Practitioner Data Bank", "article_metadata": {"description": "In more than 50 years of medical practice, I only have one memory of my physician-dad being involved in a medical malpractice case.
