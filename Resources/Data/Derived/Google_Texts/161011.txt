PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Rhode Island’s health insurance exchange is moving its call center from Providence to East Providence.

Thursday will be its last day at the current call center at 70 Royal Little Drive in Providence.

HealthSource RI will close that call center Friday and open at its new location at 401 Wampanoag Trail in East Providence on April 4.

HealthSource RI officials say the new location is accessible by the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority Route 32 bus and there’s ample free parking.

They say customers should expect longer call wait times on the days leading up to the closing due to the transition.

The call center’s telephone number will remain the same.

Customers will be able to drop off documents and payments as before, but in-person assistance won’t be available.
