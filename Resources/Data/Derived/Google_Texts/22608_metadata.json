You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone--not just those at the top. That is the job. I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.\n\nI'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts. From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we have made. They would repeal the Affordable Care Act--not improve it. They would give more tax breaks to the super wealthy and corporations--not to the middle class, and they would--despite all their tough talk about terrorism-continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns. So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "(AP Photo/Jim Cole)(CNSNews.com) -\u00a0In her opening statement at the third Democratic presidential debate\u00a0hosted by ABC News at St.", "title": "Hillary Clinton: Republicans \u2018Would Repeal the Affordable Care Act\u2019", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/cnsnewscom-staff/hillary-clinton-republicans-would-repeal-affordable-care-act", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/clinton-ap_photo-jim_cole-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-20T16:52:14-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-20T09:26:27-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-20T16:52:14-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "(AP Photo/Jim Cole)(CNSNews.com) -\u00a0In her opening statement at the third Democratic presidential debate\u00a0hosted by ABC News at St.", "title": "Hillary Clinton: Republicans \u2018Would Repeal the Affordable Care Act\u2019", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/cnsnewscom-staff/hillary-clinton-republicans-would-repeal-affordable-care-act", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/clinton-ap_photo-jim_cole-1.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "(AP Photo/Jim Cole)(CNSNews.com) -\u00a0In her opening statement at the third Democratic presidential debate\u00a0hosted by ABC News at St.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act is also known as Obamacare.\nThey would repeal the Affordable Care Act--not improve it.\nFrom my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we have made.\nHere is former Secretary Clinton\u2019s opening statement:Well, thank you, and I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.\nI'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts."}
