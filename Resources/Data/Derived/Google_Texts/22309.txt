Red Alert Politics ‘ Kelsey Osterman was on The Michael Koolidge Show earlier this week to talk about Obamacare and more.

The duo first talked about Jon Stewart’s heated interview with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius earlier this week. Stewart called out Sebelius, who has been tasked with managing the president’s Affordable Care Act, for allowing a one-year delay on the implementation of the employer mandate but not the individual one.

“He’s been very openly left during the whole government shutdown, but I was very surprised at how hard he went after Kathleen Sebelius on Obamacare, specifically, and kept pressing her multiple times during the interview on why businesses can get a one year delay and individuals can’t, and she didn’t have a really good answer for him, ” Osterman told Koolidge.

The pair then talked about the massive problems the healthcare exchanges set up by Obamacare have faced since they opened on Oct. 1.

“Sebelius admitted, as the ‘understatement of the year,’ that it started a little bit rockier than we’d like,” Osterman said. “When you have months, years to prepare for this – this roll-out has been coming for quite some time – and you’re supposedly having the best tech people in the country working on it, make sure it works properly because this is very important to a lot of Americans to be able to sign up for healthcare, and it’s just a mess.”

Osterman also talked about about Texas Rep. Steve Stockman’s State of the Union date, fake Obamacare enrollee Chad Henderson, and the impact that the government shutdown is having on Washington, D.C.
