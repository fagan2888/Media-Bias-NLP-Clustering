Rob Bishop took a short hike through Tule Springs and held bits of mammoth bone in his fingers.\n\n\u201cThis is cool,\u201d said the Republican congressman from Utah. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work this out.\u201d\n\nBishop visited the proposed monument site Monday as part of a whirlwind, three-hour tour that also offered him a quick look at other public land set to be transferred or otherwise impacted by the legislation.\n\nHe was accompanied on the tour by some high-powered advocates for the bill, including its sponsor, Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, former Congressman turned lobbyist Jon Porter, and Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce President Kristin McMillan.\n\nAs they stood at the edge of a trench left over from an early-1960s scientific expedition known as the \u201cBig Dig,\u201d Horsford praised Bishop for his willingness to research the issue in person.\n\n\u201cOnce you get out here and touch it and see it, you can see why we\u2019re working so hard to transfer this land,\u201d Horsford said.\n\nThe bill would create Nevada\u2019s only national monument on 22,650 acres prized for its wealth of fossils from a vast cross-section of time, which allows researchers to study climate change and its impact on camels, horses, mammoths and other animals that died off about 11,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age.\n\nThe measure also would grant 660 acres of federal land to Las Vegas and 645 acres to North Las Vegas to be auctioned off as \u201cjob creation zones.\u201d\n\nOther parts of the bill would add land to the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, improve management of the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, free up property for campus expansion by the Nevada System of Higher Education, and convey land to Clark County for an off-road vehicle recreation park at Nellis Dunes.\n\nIt is the most sweeping public lands legislation for Southern Nevada in a decade, and every member of Nevada\u2019s delegation supports it \u2014 or at least they did.\n\nThe measure was headed for a Feb. 27 hearing before the House Natural Resources Committee when Bishop, a leader on the committee, sponsored a last-minute change that would direct profits from land auctions in the bill into the U.S. Treasury rather than allowing the money to remain in the state.\n\nNevadans said they feared the amendment, which likely would have passed the Republican-controlled committee, would chip away at the state\u2019s lucrative conservation law, the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act.\n\nThe 1998 law directs profits from federal land auctions in the valley to be spent on schools, parks, Lake Tahoe preservation and recreation projects in the state. Over the years the sale of more than 15,000 acres has generated more than $3 billion.\n\nBut Bishop has said keeping land receipts within the state now amounts to a violation of the 2010 House ban on earmarks. As a result, the bill as written could be killed on a \u201cpoint of order\u201d on the House floor or, more likely, never allowed to reach the floor at all.\n\nDemocrats suggested the move was consistent with previous efforts by Republicans to divert federal land sales profits into the Treasury to offset the deficit.\n\nSen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he would withdraw support for the bill, effectively killing it, rather than allow it to pass with language that he said would \u201cgut\u201d the land management act.\n\nConservationists who took part in writing the measure said they also were irked by other proposed changes, including one that would require the National Park Service to perform a detailed suitability study before taking management of the Tule Springs national monument. They said the Bureau of Land Management already has spent 10 years and $6 million on studies.\n\nAs soon as the amendment was introduced on Feb. 26, Horsford quickly moved to postpone action on the bill in hopes of saving it.\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s tour, Bishop seemed to give supporters of the measure reason to hope.\n\nAfter his brief walk through the chalky hills in blue jeans and loafers with no socks, he said he was impressed by what he saw. He said the site\u2019s strongest selling point is its proximity to a large metropolitan area, but that also puts its ice age treasures at risk.\n\nBishop said he noticed quite a bit of trash strewn around the area, a sign that the BLM hasn\u2019t done enough to protect the property. A \u201chigher status\u201d for the land could help preserve it, he said.\n\nSo how difficult will it be for Congress to \u201cfind a way forward\u201d on the Tule Springs bill, as North Las Vegas Mayor Lee put it?\n\n\u201cEasy,\u201d said Bishop, who flew to Las Vegas from Salt Lake City Monday morning just to take the tour. \u201cI think some of my amendment can change too.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, he headed back to the airport to catch his return flight home.\n\nContact reporter Henry Brean at hbrean@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0350.
