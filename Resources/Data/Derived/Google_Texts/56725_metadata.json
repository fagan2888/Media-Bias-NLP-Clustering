Rescuers hiked off-trail and located Trottier in a heavily wooded area at 3:30 a.m. Sunday.\n\nTrottier was found to be cold, wet and disorientated, but was able to walk out with assistance from the rescue party.\n\nUpon reaching the trail head shortly after 5 a.m., Trottier was transported to Littleton Regional Hospital by a Twin Mountain ambulance for further evaluation.\n\nFish and Game officers were also called to Mount Monadnock in Jaffrey to rescue a 14-year-old boy with a lower leg injury Saturday night.\n\nThe boy, who was with a group of police cadets from Windsor, Connecticut, injured his leg at about 5 p.m. after slipping on wet rocks while hiking in the rain on the White-Dot Trail. Conservation officers along with Mount Monadnock Park personnel carried the boy off the mountain.\n\nRescuers reached park headquarters at 11:30 p.m. Saturday and the boy was transported to Monadnock Community Hospital by the Jaffrey/Rindge Memorial ambulance.\n\nThe boy\u2019s injuries are considered non-life-threatening.\n\nConservation officers remind hikers to always take the weather into consideration before setting out on any hike and to always hike in sturdy footwear.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Sun, 14 Sep 2014 20:57:41 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Two people were rescued from two separate mountains in New Hampshire this weekend.", "title": "Two people rescued from New Hampshire mountains", "url": "http://www.wmur.com/news/two-people-rescued-from-new-hampshire-mountains/28058670", "image": "http://www.wmur.com/image/view/-/10719720/highRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/d7ht00/-/Emergency-Lights-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wmur.com/news/two-people-rescued-from-new-hampshire-mountains/28058670", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wmur://content/article/28058670", "iphone": "wmur://content/article/28058670", "googleplay": "wmur://content/article/28058670"}, "name": {"ipad": "wmur", "iphone": "wmur", "googleplay": "wmur"}, "id": {"ipad": 504646663, "iphone": 504646663, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}}, "site": "@wmur9", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wmur://content/article/28058670", "app_name": "wmur", "package": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}, "ios": {"url": "wmur://content/article/28058670", "app_store_id": 504646663, "app_name": "wmur"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 98665743246}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wmur.com/news/two-people-rescued-from-new-hampshire-mountains/28058670"}, "keywords": "mountain, crews, rescue, hikers, stranded", "google-site-verification": "xTJFxn8Gm6mXV5ugnbTb198craV_CkoMGMqQyL4EfS4", "news_keywords": "mountain, crews, rescue, hikers, stranded", "description": "Two people were rescued from two separate mountains in New Hampshire this weekend."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf4a\"", "article_summary": "Two people were rescued from two separate mountains in New Hampshire this weekend.\nThe weather for the Mount Washington area for the overnight was rain with temperatures dropping into the 30s, which was a concern.\nTrottier and his sons had been hiking down Mount Washington when Trottier started suffering from a preexisting medical condition.\nConservation officers along with Mount Monadnock Park personnel carried the boy off the mountain.\nAfter completing their assignments and hiking down the trail, voice contact was made off of the trail with Trottier."}
