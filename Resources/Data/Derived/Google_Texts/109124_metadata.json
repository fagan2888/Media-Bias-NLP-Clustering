Well, then you may have heard that conservatives like me hate you. In fact, I'm sure you've probably heard some version of it a hundred times since it seems to be the standard rap for liberals these days. \"Those conservatives are racists! They hate Hispanics! They're homophobes! They're Nazis! They're engaged in a war on women!\"\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nWell, first off, do you really think you can trust liberals to tell you what motivates conservatives? Can you REALLY trust Paul Krugman, Michael Moore, and your college professor who is railing about American imperialism and white privilege to tell you what people like me are thinking? Do you even believe they know in the first place and if they did, could you really trust them to give you an honest rundown of why conservatives disagree with them about pretty much everything under the sun?\n\nObviously, they're not exactly the best source about what conservatives really think and most conservatives find it a little insulting to talk about our \"motivation\" since it's always framed in \"when did you stop beating your wife\" terms. If you don't beat your wife, that's an offensive question. If you're not racist, sexist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, etc., etc., it's offensive to be accused of it. Incidentally, while there are always exceptions, the overwhelming majority of conservatives aren't any of those things and, yes, they do get offended when they're falsely accused. Wouldn't you? So, why should they be any different?\n\nWhile I can't speak for all conservatives about what motivates them, I can speak for myself. I am a Tea Party conservative. I run a website called Right Wing News. In fact, I\u2019m so far to the Right that I was blackballed from the 2008 and 2012 Republican National Conventions for being too tough on our last two presidential nominees. I didn\u2019t think either of them were particularly good politicians, but I also didn\u2019t believe they were conservative enough.\n\nThat\u2019s me -- and I don\u2019t hate you.\n\nI don\u2019t even hate Barack Obama, Chris Matthews, or Harry Reid. Admittedly, I don\u2019t like them, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re good for the country, and I have big problems with their agenda. But, if one of them was drowning to death in a lake, I\u2019d toss him a life preserver. I wouldn\u2019t be happy if they got sick or something happened to one of their kids. I wouldn\u2019t be celebrating if they died. I even have liberal friends. How good of friends? Good enough to go to dinner with. Good enough to invite them to stay in my home.\n\nI could also add that I have friends that are black, Hispanic, gay, Jewish, etc., etc., but bizarrely, people treat that as some sort of racist dodge these days. So, let\u2019s not go there. But, let\u2019s do point out the obvious: conservatives tend to get along particularly well with other conservatives while liberals tend to get along with other liberals. Conservatives like Clarence Thomas just as much as liberals like Obama. Is it racist for liberals to dislike Clarence Thomas? If conservatives would love to see Ted Cruz as our next President, does that mean we love Hispanic Americans while liberals hate them because they\u2019d vote against him or does it mean that both conservatives and liberals like people who agree with them?\n\nHow many times have you heard someone say that Tea Parties are racist? A zillion, right? Yet, at every Tea Party I\u2019ve ever been to, there have always been not many, but a few black or Hispanic Americans there. They\u2019ve always come across as just as relaxed and comfortable as everyone else. That\u2019s because they actually know conservatives, not the funhouse mirror image of conservatives that\u2019s presented on the Left.\n\nHere\u2019s another little secret: there are openly gay people in the conservative movement. They get invited to events. They go to parties. Just because someone\u2019s a Christian or is against gay marriage (unapologetically guilty on both counts) doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s anti-gay. On a personal note, I\u2019ve had gay writers at Right Wing News, I organized a petition to get Alec Baldwin fired from Capitol One for anti-gay slurs, and I\u2019ve been to more than one GOProud party. Did some of those people disagree with me 110% on gay marriage? Sure, but that doesn\u2019t mean we hate each other.\n\nAlso, do you really think conservatives like me are engaged in some sort of misogynistic war on women? Just because we have the same position -- as Ann Coulter, Michelle Malkin, Michele Bachmann, Dana Loesch, Laura Ingraham, S.E Cupp, Nikki Haley and Sarah Palin -- on abortion and forcing companies like Hobby Lobby to violate their religious convictions? That doesn\u2019t even make any sense \u2013 and by the way, if you really buy into the idea that conservatives want to keep women barefoot, pregnant, and stuck in the kitchen making them sandwiches -- look at that list of extremely popular conservative women I just mentioned and note that none of them is a, \u201cyes, whatever you say, dear\u201d Stepford wife. Yet all of them are extremely popular with conservative men.\n\nSo, if conservatives aren\u2019t motivated by hate, what REALLY motivates us?\n\nPersonally, I want to see us get our debt in control because I think there is a very real possibility that Social Security and Medicare as we know them are going to end within the next couple of decades because we simply won\u2019t have the money to continue those programs any more. If that happens \u2013 and it\u2019s more likely than not that it will \u2013 a lot of good people who worked hard and played by the rules throughout their whole lives are going to get hammered.\n\nI worry that the next few generations of Americans aren\u2019t going to have it as good as we have because we\u2019re being so irresponsible with our money today. I worry about kids growing up in an amoral society where marriage doesn\u2019t matter, God is ignored, and they\u2019re told that if it feels good, it\u2019s okay to do it.\n\nI oppose illegal immigration because I think we should be more concerned about poor and middle class workers than illegal aliens. It\u2019s not fair that there are Americans who can\u2019t find jobs because they can\u2019t work as cheaply as people who don\u2019t pay for medical insurance, don\u2019t pay for car insurance, and cheat on their taxes. I\u2019m concerned about the potential impact of rewarding tens of millions of people for breaking the law and if you look at the flood of children on our southern border being drawn here by our immigration policies, you should be, too.\n\nI can still remember being poor enough to seriously consider sleeping in my car for a couple of months to save up money; so I can empathize with anyone struggling to make ends meet. But, I believe we can best help people in the position I was in by creating an environment that allows them to help themselves. Offering training and creating a powerful economy that makes it easier for them to get good jobs will do more to really help people than any government welfare program ever could.\n\nMaybe you agree with what I just said and maybe you don\u2019t. Well meaning, intelligent people can disagree \u2013 and let\u2019s face it, conservatism isn\u2019t for everyone. If you love nothing more than abortion on demand and Obamacare, you\u2019re better off voting for the Democrats. However, if you believe in fiscal responsibility, law and order, traditional values, a strong defense, equal opportunity, and small government, then we\u2019re on the same side. It may true that, \"There's a sucker born every minute,\" but you don\u2019t have to be one of them by being scammed into believing that conservatives hate you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Are you Hispanic, black, Asian, Jewish, gay, young, old, poor, or a woman?
