It was the shock heard ’round the world, y'all!

On the fateful morning of December 13, 2013 Beyoncé released a secret self-titled album, including 14 songs and 17 videos to iTunes—and the fans went FRIGGIN' CAH-razy!

To even imagine Queen Bey nervous moments before her almost platinum album's release is absolutely heinous!

But in a new interview, Blue's momma revealed she had a million doubts minutes before the music dropped:

"I was terrified. I was so scared. I already envisioned like the worst things that could happen. I was really nervous because this was a huge risk."

The album's unconventional release became one of the year's top social media freakout moments of this year, and people are STILL talking about its power!

So we're extremely happy Bey faced her fears and released the jams…because they're totes amaze!
