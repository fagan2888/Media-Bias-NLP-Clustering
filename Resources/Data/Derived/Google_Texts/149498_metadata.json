Are you suggesting Peyton Manning returns next year as quarterback of the Broncos after the 43-8 loss in the Super Bowl? Dude, you\u2019re kidding, right? What will it be like next season, when Manning is a year older and a year slower?\n\nJoe, blames the quarterback\n\nKiz: The problem wasn\u2019t Manning. The problem, especially after season-ending injuries to offensive tackle Ryan Clady and linebacker Von Miller, was the Broncos were too reliant on Manning. It\u2019s not a question whether Manning can be effective next season. The real question is: Would Broncos executive John Elway dare ask Manning to restructure his deal to allow the team to spend more money on its areas of need?\n\nTebow factor. The 50 or so people at my home for a Super Bowl party all agreed the Broncos are forever under the curse of Tim Tebow for how Elway and the team treated him. Many people around the country feel that way. Life goes on. But what goes around comes around.\n\nRick, seeking revenge\n\nKiz: To err is human. To forgive divine. It\u2019s seems many bitter fans of Tebow are more human than divine.\n\nJoke\u2019s on Broncos fans.When does the Super Bowl parade for the Broncos take place? Oh, wait a minute. I forgot. You guys lost the Super Bowl! How insensitive of me to make such a terrible faux pas at what must be a painful time for you losers. \u2026 I mean Denver fans. Still rolling on the floor and laughing,\n\nDavid, Overland Park, Kan.\n\nKiz: Always good to hear from a fan from an AFC West division rival. Way to stay classy, Chiefs Nation. Now, help me out here. When was the last time the Chiefs won a playoff game? Was it when George Bush the younger or the elder was president of the United States? It was so long ago, I forget. And know the funny thing? It was so long ago, most Chiefs fans forget, as well.\n\nColor of humiliation. The orange uniforms have got to go. The Broncos need to hold a public bonfire and burn the darn things. Every Super Bowl they wear those orange uniforms they get humiliated.\n\nWilliam, feeling blue\n\nKiz: The Broncos will keep the uniforms. They\u2019ll change a lot of guys who wore the uniforms during the loss to Seattle.\n\nAt a loss from the toss. Here\u2019s a piece of Super Bowl analysis I thought I\u2019d share with you. The Broncos lost because of the coin flip. When Seattle won the toss and elected to defer, I genuinely think the Broncos had no idea what to do with themselves. The offense wasn\u2019t ready to be on the field, clearly wasn\u2019t ready for the crowd being loud on the first snap and the rest was history.\n\nJason, life\u2019s a game of chance\n\nKiz: Orange uniforms? Coin flip? Oh, boy. Can\u2019t wait to hear the next knucklehead\u2019s theory why the Broncos lost.\n\nConspiracy to tank.Watching the Super Bowl, I kept saying to myself: \u201cI don\u2019t believe this!\u201d The extent of Denver\u2019s loss seems unbelievable. Well, here\u2019s a disturbing hypothesis: Some Broncos took a dive. Yes, I realize what I\u2019m suggesting is shocking, insulting and perhaps completely inaccurate.\n\nPaul, conspiracy theorist\n\nKiz: Yep, these are my peeps. They\u2019re nuts. God bless them.\n\nRussian flush. And today\u2019s party shot is fired at the $50 billion winter soiree thrown by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe opening show in Sochi was so Russian \u2014 think Potemkin village \u2014 glitz on the outside but forgot the plumbing.\n\nNatalie, Castle Rock\n\nKick it with Kiz by writing mkiszla@denverpost.com.
