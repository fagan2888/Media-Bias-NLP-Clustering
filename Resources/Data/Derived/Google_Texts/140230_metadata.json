He began his adult journey in the repertory theaters and coffeehouses of 1960s San Francisco \u2014 and here he is today, a 67-year-old playwright with a leading role in community theater in Keene.\n\nWrite in a few characters, title it \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d and there\u2019s your magnum opus, come full-circle.\n\nLowe would laugh at this connotation. Oh, it\u2019s all sweet-sounding and orderly and somewhat true, but it\u2019s like peeking at him through a pinhole. His story is much more profound and compelling: sometimes dark and meditating, certainly pioneering \u2014 even titillating, if being an editor at Playboy in its 1980s heyday qualifies.\n\nAnd that\u2019s merely a summation of the first half of his life. When he turned 60, he earned the designation Professor Walter L. Lowe Jr., Ph.D.\n\nThe book on Lowe is cosmopolitan. He\u2019s interviewed famous personalities from Norman Mailer to Brooke Shields; he\u2019s edited the works of deep thinkers such as Alex Haley (\u201cRoots,\u201d \u201cMalcolm X\u201d) and Ralph Ellison (\u201cInvisible Man\u201d). He asked the late Chicago mayor Harold Washington 20 questions. He refers to Hugh Hefner as \u201cHef.\u201d\n\nHe was the first African-American hired as a news reporter at the Chicago Sun-Times, in 1971. On his first day, he walked by a veteran reporter\u2019s desk who handed his typewritten story to him, thinking Lowe was the copy boy. \u201cI said, \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019\u201d Lowe recalls.\n\nHe was the first African-American editor at Playboy. When Hefner, the publisher of Playboy and a strong supporter of the human rights movement, learned he had no African-Americans on staff, he brought in new human resources leaders. \u201cAnd they were given the assignment, go out and find a black editor,\u201d Lowe says.\n\nThe play Lowe wrote in two months, \u201cAuld Lang Syne,\u201d isn\u2019t an autobiography but is mostly construed from real-life experiences \u2014 his and those of people he\u2019s encountered \u2014 yet he\u2019s cryptic in offering an exact description.\n\nHe says it\u2019s a play about lost or suppressed memories that resurface and affect the lives of his characters. He invented the personalities one by one, writing his own role the first night, bringing another character to life the second night, and so on, until the cast reached five.\n\n\u201cFor some reason I had the impulse to start writing a play last year,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cI\u2019m really not sure where that came from.\u201d\n\nDirected by Kim Dupuis and put on by the Edge Ensemble Theatre Company of Keene, it features sexual tension and graphic language. Opening night is Nov. 14 at Keene\u2019s Heberton Hall.\n\nAnd don\u2019t bring the children, warns Ray Mahoney of Keene, a longtime actor in local community theater who brings one of the characters to life.\n\nLowe may be a playwright newbie, but he has expert credentials when it comes to relationships and families.\n\nHe dove into academia after a 21-year journalism career, prompted by what he calls a mid-life crisis. Though he retired from full-time teaching this year, he\u2019s an adjunct professor in the marriage and family therapy program of the applied psychology department at Antioch University New England Graduate School in Keene.\n\nHe and his wife, Hana, a native of Czechoslovakia, also have private marriage and family therapy practices in Swanzey. Lowe earned a Ph.D at age 60 from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., and a master\u2019s from Purdue University Calumet. He\u2019s lived in the Monadnock Region for 7\u00bd years.\n\nProudly influenced by his father\n\nLowe is a Midwesterner and admittedly a bit conflicted by the lack of diversity in New Hampshire. He was born and raised on the south side of Chicago, where racism was prevalent. His father, the first African-American insurance broker in Illinois, had a significant influence on him.\n\nWalter Lowe Sr. was at first banned from owning his own brokerage because he was black. He fought for his rights, writing a letter to Adlai Stevenson, the former Illinois governor, Secretary of State and two-time Democratic presidential candidate. Stevenson backed him up, saying he saw no reason why the elder Lowe couldn\u2019t have his own brokerage, documents that today are in the Chicago Historical Society.\n\nHis father also wrote occasional columns and essays in the Chicago Tribune, in a forum titled, \u201cVoice of the People.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack then, there were no black faces in the Chicago Tribune, not even periodically,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cDad would say he really would have liked to have been a writer.\u201d\n\nTheater appealed to the younger Lowe and he eventually set out for San Francisco State. He played Jimmy, the young sailor in \u201cA Taste of Honey,\u201d wrote and directed one-act plays, played guitar in coffeehouses and bars. He returned to Chicago and got his undergraduate degree at Roosevelt University, picking up freelance work such as writing for airline magazines.\n\n\u201cSomething I wrote caught the attention of the editor of the Sun-Times showcase section,\u201d says Lowe, who was hired to write about movies, books and theater. When the news section was looking for its first African-American reporter, the 23-year-old Lowe got the job.\n\nThe copy boy story on his first day notwithstanding \u2014 \u201cThis veteran reporter saw me walking past and just handed me his copy thinking I was the copy boy because many copy boys in the newsroom were black\u201d \u2014 Lowe had a positive experience.\n\nRay Brennan, often described as the prototype scotch-swilling, chain-smoking, big-city newspaperman, supported Lowe as he wrote about issues affecting the rough-and-tumble south side of Chicago. Brennan, who covered Al Capone\u2019s tax evasion trial and interviewed Capone in jail, was nearing the end of his 45-year career.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of pressure because you\u2019re so conspicuous,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cBut when I left, there were six (African-Americans on staff).\u201d\n\nLowe moved on to Playboy and stayed there for 15 years. The editors, he says, were serious journalists who interviewed many of the top newsmakers in the late 1970s and \u201980s. He interviewed numerous stars \u2014 and was part of the rotation of editors on site of pictorial shoots \u2014 but it\u2019s the writers he remembers most.\n\nIndeed, if you truly bought Playboy for the articles, you\u2019d come across Lowe\u2019s work.\n\nLowe edited the last four Playboy articles by noted novelist and essayist James Baldwin, who in 1985 wrote, \u201cEvidence of Things Not Seen,\u201d about the Wayne Williams child murders in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cI had an opportunity to meet and work with all kinds of interesting people,\u201d Lowe says.\n\nOne life ends, another begins\n\nLowe has a son and daughter with his first wife, but hit what he calls a mid-life crisis. His 20-year marriage broke up, his children moved in with him in Gary, Ind., and his father died at 94, all within a year. He had been commuting to Chicago for Playboy and decided to give that up.\n\n\u201cI was getting home at 7 or 8 o\u2019clock and I had kids getting out of school at 3, and that was a recipe for disaster,\u201d he says.\n\nIn order to spend more time with his children, he got a job teaching high school English for three years in the Gary, Ind., school system. He became certified and started taking courses in mental health. Most importantly, he was home for his kids, who today live in Hampton, Va., and the Chicago area.\n\n\u201cThere was no running around and getting in trouble because they knew I was going to be home,\u201d he says.\n\nSome troubling incidents pushed him deep into the mental health field. He met a number of \u201cvery disturbed young men\u201d in Indiana, but the state\u2019s overburdened mental health system didn\u2019t have the resources to help them. He remembers two young men in particular who were referred to family therapy, which had a waiting list of 75 families.\n\n\u201cIn that year, both committed murder \u2014 one killed three people in a roller rink, the other beat his uncle to death,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cIt really disturbed me in that these horrific crimes they committed, I knew a therapist could have made a difference.\u201d\n\nInspired, he entered the master\u2019s program at Purdue University Calumet and earned his degree in the early 1990s, though he laughs over being unable to remember which year. There\u2019s a plaque on the wall someplace in his house, he jokes.\n\nHe went to work in a residential treatment facility for adolescent males, putting in more than 50 hours a week. There, he met his wife, Hana, who also was intrigued by marriage and family therapy and eventually opened her own practice. Lowe lasted about five years in the residential treatment center.\n\n\u201cI got burned out,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought it would be really nice to get into academia and teach.\u201d\n\nHe was accepted into the doctorate program at Purdue, which was paid for through a minority scholarship. Upon earning his Ph.D, he began to look for a place to teach and Antioch popped up. \u201cThey made me an offer and my wife and I moved here 7\u00bd years ago,\u201d he says.\n\nSettling into the Monadnock Region\n\nLowe has always lived in or near cultural meccas, where diversity is the norm. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s lived in a mostly white community and he has found it, well, different. He says they love the area and especially the outdoors. He has become engrossed in fishing, noting the cleanliness of the environment and the clarity of the area\u2019s lakes and rivers.\n\nHis first foray into local theater came through a chance meeting with Scott Saxby, the Edge Ensemble\u2019s lighting technician. The company in 2012 was looking for someone to play Hoke in \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d alongside local actress Catherine Behrens. Lowe says he\u2019s been told he even looks like Morgan Freeman, who played the lead role in the movie.\n\nLowe loved playing Hoke and, with his creative juices flowing, out came \u201cAuld Lang Syne.\u201d The play is edgy and, like the name of the theater company, Lowe says Dupuis has run with it. She is producer and director; rehearsals are ongoing with opening night a little more than a month away.\n\nLast spring Antioch threw Lowe a retirement party, but he says he\u2019s still a ways from slowing down. His private family therapy practice has been burgeoning since he retired, and he has no plans to stop any time soon.\n\nAs for the title of his play, \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d is commonly connected with New Year\u2019s Eve, yet it was written in the 1700s, two centuries before it became a holiday tradition. Even Billy Crystal famously wondered what it really means in the movie \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally.\u201d\n\nLowe isn\u2019t giving it up. Come see the play, he says. Just don\u2019t bring the children.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SentinelSource.com", "description": "I t\u2019s almost too easy, binding the bookends of Walter Lowe Jr.\u2019s life on a stage.
