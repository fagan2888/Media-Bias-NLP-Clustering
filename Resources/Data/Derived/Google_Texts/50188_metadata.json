I probably haven\u2019t been to a dentist in a decade. I brush, occasionally floss but, admittedly, skip out on the daily routine for a quick rinse of cold water and done. Luckily, Maya has her mother Dacia, who is more vigilant in promoting oral hygiene. Yet daily brushing and regular dentist visits weren\u2019t always the norm for both of us.\n\nIt\u2019s been just dumb luck that I haven\u2019t had any major dental problems. But lately, as I begin to pay closer attention to my daughter\u2019s teeth, I\u2019m noticing mine aren\u2019t in the best of shape. In teaching our daughter to take care of her teeth, we as parents are becoming more aware of our own oral health. Helping our daughter brush means we have to brush, which wasn\u2019t always the case from our own childhoods.\n\nThe eruption of Maya\u2019s first teeth was a wonderful milestone for us. But it was also one of the first times we realized as parents that we had to teach Maya to care for something on her own. It really was Maya\u2019s first actual chore or responsibility.\n\nAfter Maya\u2019s first dental visit at 17-months-old bookended with a No Cavity Club certificate \u2013brushing became more of a concern. Yet in the hustle and bustle of parenthood, nightly brushing and flossing didn\u2019t really start to take until she was about 21-months-old. We tried everything initially \u2013 promises of toys or playing in the sink and snacks, usually just resulting in tears for everyone involved.\n\nIt was a few months ago I began reporting on oral health in Native American communities and saw the importance of developing early good oral health for children. The facts astounded me, and I used my reporting to establish a renewed importance on getting her to embrace oral health. I really felt bad that Maya wasn\u2019t brushing regularly.\n\nUltimately, the best strategy became making brushing into a game of copycat. Dacia would brush her teeth and Maya, of course, wanted to play in the sink. Slowly, Maya begin handing her mother the toothbrush, so Dacia could brush her baby teeth. Then Maya began brushing her teeth and rinsing. It\u2019s become a nightly routine, not just for Maya but for her mom, who brushes alongside.\n\nI watch it all unfold at a distance. I\u2019m still bullish on dental visits; maybe I\u2019m scared of what a dentist would say once they hear I haven\u2019t had a visit since I was a teenager? But I now find myself in front of a mirror more often, examining my teeth, flossing and brushing. The sight isn\u2019t always pretty, but at least I\u2019m beginning to see the full picture. And I have my daughter to thank.\n\nIn trying to teach my daughter to brush her teeth, I learned a little something along the way.\n\nTo read more from Travis, see his last blog \u201cWhat can a man learn about breastfeeding?
