But, as the Texas lawmaker is increasingly seen as his party\u2019s the best chance to block Donald Trump\u2019s path to the nomination, his Senate colleagues are facing the tough decision of whether to line up behind him.\n\nSo far, none of them have endorsed Cruz\u2019s bid for the White House. Only 23 of the 54 Republican senators have endorsed at all, and only 16 are backing a candidate still in the race, with 14 behind Sen. Marco Rubio and one each for Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Trump.\n\n\u201cI think right now a lot of our members are keeping their powder dry,\u201d said Sen. John Thune, the third-ranking Republican. \u201cFor the most part, everybody\u2019s kind of waiting to see how the voters weigh in.\"\n\nThe lack of support from his colleagues stems from the fact that Cruz has presented himself as an outsider since he was elected in 2012. He pushed his party to shut down the government over funding the Affordable Care Act in 2013, then criticized his fellow lawmakers for not standing firm, something that frustrated many of his colleagues. Last year, he took to the Senate floor to call Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a liar, and he often rails against the \u201cWashington cartel\u201d on the campaign trail.\n\nYet Senate Republicans are split on whether to rally behind Cruz, with some ready to support his bid and others either sticking with Rubio or declining to pick sides at all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surely significant that not a single Republican senator has endorsed him, including very conservative senators,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who had endorsed Jeb Bush.\n\nWhen asked why Cruz didn\u2019t have more support from his colleagues, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., who has endorsed Rubio, said: \u201cI\u2019m going to let you speculate about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that is a question, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., who also has endorsed Rubio, said to a similar question.\n\n\u201cYou know, I think I\u2019m going to invoke the McConnell rule and not talk about the presidential primary,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn, the Republican whip and Cruz\u2019s fellow senator from Texas.\n\nOthers, however, are ready to rally around the candidate if he continues to string together primary victories. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who dropped out of the presidential race late last year and has been one of Cruz\u2019s most outspoken critics, told RealClearPolitics Monday that he would \u201cswallow my pride\u201d and admit his colleague has the best chance to defeat Trump.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who has not endorsed anyone in the race, said some of his colleagues simply haven\u2019t adjusted to Cruz\u2019s surging candidacy.\n\n\u201cPeople obviously were going for Rubio,\u201d Cassidy told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI have found that sometimes it just takes a while for folks to adjust to a new reality. I think the new reality is Ted Cruz is -- if you don\u2019t like Trump -- Cruz is the guy. That\u2019s the new reality and just sometimes people\u2019s emotional experience takes a little longer for that to adjust, or they may be hoping that Rubio can pull it out in Florida.\"\n\nAsked if Cruz would be able to repair relationships with his fellow senators if he does become the nominee, Cassidy said, \u201cOf course, we\u2019re professionals.\u201d He likened the relationship between GOP senators and Cruz to his marriage of 26 years.\n\n\u201cOccasionally my wife and I have said things that we regret. We\u2019re still happily married,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cIn any long-term relationship there are times of stress. The overarching goal, though, hopefully dominates. And in this case, that is taking care of the American people.\u201d\n\nThune said he hasn\u2019t worked closely with Cruz in the Senate, adding that the Texas Republican has mostly staked himself on being a \u201cdisrupter\u201d and had long been eyeing a national run. But he believes Cruz would ultimately be effective in working with his colleagues if he becomes the nominee and then president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have any choice,\u201d Thune told reporters. \u201cIf he were to become the nominee, obviously to get anything done around here, not only to win the election and but then also to ultimately govern the country, you\u2019ve got to be able to work with the Congress.\"\n\n\u201cA President Ted Cruz would probably be very different than Sen. Ted Cruz when it comes to funding the government,\u201d Thune added later.\n\nDemocrats, who have also had their fair share of clashes with Cruz in the upper chamber, didn\u2019t fully take the bait on the potential of Cruz being the nominee.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Sen. Cruz hasn\u2019t gotten a Republican endorsement from people who are the most conservative to the most liberal I think says something about what people think he\u2019d be as president,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer.\n\nSen. Harry Reid, the minority leader, said the Republican primary is \u201cgoing to be a nasty affair.\u201d\n\nRealClearPolitics intern Ellie Potter contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s no secret Ted Cruz isn\u2019t the most popular senator in Washington, something he often boasts about on the campaign trail.
