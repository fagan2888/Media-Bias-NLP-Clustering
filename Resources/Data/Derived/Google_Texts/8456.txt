The NFL on Monday released the top 25 player jerseys from April 1 through July 17, 2014, and a guy who has yet to play in a pro game beat out the veterans for the top spot.

Johnny Manziel, the 22nd overall pick by the Browns, has the most sold jerseys on NFLShop.com in the last 3 1/2 months, while Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning round out the top four.

Manning is the only Bronco on the list, but joins a group with 12 other quarterbacks.

Manziel is joined by fellow rookies Michael Sam (No. 6) of St. Louis, Teddy Bridgewater (No. 13) of Minnesota, Jadeveon Clowney (No. 16) of Houston and Blake Bortles (No. 18) of Jacksonville.
