Ted Cruz and Mike Lee have taken the helm of the GOP, steering their party and its grassroots into a much-needed, head-on battle with the Democrats.\n\nOn the campaign trail on the way to his win in November 2012, President Barack Obama promised to finish the work he\u2019d gone to Washington to do: \u201cfundamentally transforming the United States.\u201d Things look tough for the right in Washington today, but the reality is these three conservative Republicans, aided by friends in the Senate and the House, have dragged the president\u2019s ambitious agenda to a complete halt, throwing both him and Democrat Sen. Harry Reid on their heels and adding policy paralysis to the president\u2019s long list of post-election woes.\n\nWhile Republican leadership in the House was loud when scandals from Benghazi to the IRS unfolded, over the last year conventional wisdom in Washington has held that sequester would never happen; amnesty for illegal immigrants was a done deal; no sane Republican would stand against an assault-weapons ban after Sandy Hook; the GOP would bless a charge into Syria; and, well, fill in the blank: student loans? Climate change? The tea party was over and Washington, D.C. was Obama\u2019s oyster.\n\n\n\nBut then a strange thing happened. As one by one, impossible victories were won, observers saw the policy agenda of the president \u2014 a man who won a resounding victory just months ago \u2014 stagnate and stall: He hasn\u2019t won a single victory since his re-election. (RUSH LIMBAUGH: \u2018Amen!\u2019)\n\nIt\u2019s almost surreal. Sequester is tentatively in place; amnesty is derailed; gun control is on the run; American forces are not involved in Syria\u2019s civil war.\n\nSenior Republicans are taking their cues from a couple of freshman conservatives.\n\nAfter years of void, Republicans have leadership in D.C.\n\nAnd after decades of void, conservatives do, too.\n\nThe new breed of conservatives won victories by shifting public opinion and navigating parliamentary procedure. Today, Cruz and Lee\u2019s fight to defund Obamacare is deeply mired in parliamentary mumbo-jumbo, and public opinion is divided and negative across the board. In short, it is not ideal. And so long as the Democrats control the White House and the Senate, it never could be ideal. But one thing is undeniable: Their stand has lit a much-needed fire in D.C. (BEDFORD VIDEO: Obama, media, fail to summon apocalypse)\n\nWill they defund Obamacare? No, they won\u2019t. But they could \u2014 and they have \u2014 changed the narrative in Washington. And barring a disaster, that could change the narrative across the country on Nov. 4, 2014.\n\nThe folks who live in the world of Politico see electoral defeat hiding in the closet and Newt Gingrich\u2019s ghost under the bed, but here\u2019s an important question: What are Republicans so afraid of? Who is coming to get them?\n\nThe House of Representatives has turned Obama and Reid\u2019s strategy on its head. When the president used the bully pulpit to call for Republicans to fund children with cancer, they did; when the president used the bully pulpit to call for Republicans to fund national parks, they did; when the president used the bully pulpit to call for Republicans to fund veterans, they did. All of the House\u2019s stop-gap measures died in the Democrat\u2019s Senate, along with scores of others.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Christopher Bedford", "description": "After Republicans drifted for years without a pilot, Sens.
