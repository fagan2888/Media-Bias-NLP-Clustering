McKinsey found that 27 percent of shoppers in the 2014-2015 enrollment season saw prices drop, while this year, 34 percent of shoppers are seeing prices decline, although that's based only on a comparison of the average price of the lowest-cost silver plan.\n\nBut shoppers' experiences vary widely depending on where they live. Average premiums are increasing in the vast majority of states, rising by as much as 26 percent in Oklahoma. They're coming down in a handful of states, including New Mexico, where they're falling by 14 percent.\n\nAnd shoppers have slightly fewer plan options during this enrollment period, which lasts through January. There are now 314 insurers participating in marketplaces around the country, down from 333 last year. While 16 percent of consumers will have more plans available to them, 40 percent will find fewer carriers competing in their county.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare insurance plans are more expensive on average than last year, although fewer consumers are seeing price increases in the most popular mid-level plans.\nA week into enrollment through healthcare.gov and the state-run insurance marketplaces, independent analysts are finding that insurers have raised premiums more than they did last year.
