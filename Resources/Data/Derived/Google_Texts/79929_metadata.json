(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nLike many other students at the University of the District of Columbia, Bobbie Lancaster learned last week that her academic program is slated for elimination as part of a cost-cutting proposal for the school.\n\nLancaster, who is studying graphic design at the 5,490-student public college in Northwest Washington, grew up on Georgia Avenue and is the only one of three children in her family to attend college. She chose the school after seeing the tuition costs at the city\u2019s private schools \u2014 one would have cost her more than $20,000 a semester, while UDC, because she is a city resident, is more like $3,600.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people understand how vital this school is,\u201d Lancaster, 22, said. \u201cIt\u2019s affordable education.\u201d\n\nOfficials at UDC said last week that they are considering a plan that would cut all of the school\u2019s athletic teams and eliminate nearly two dozen baccalaureate and graduate academic programs to save millions of dollars a year. The school\u2019s interim president said he hopes to reinvest that money into other academic programs, tuition assistance and online education to transform the school into something that better prepares its students for the Washington region\u2019s job market.\n\nThe news hit the Van Ness campus with a bit of a thud. Students and faculty anxiously discussed the potential cuts.\n\nT-shirts and sweatpants with the school\u2019s Firebirds sports logo hung in the student bookstore as the prospect of the UDC\u2019s teams\u2019 disappearance sunk in.\n\nThe Faculty Senate sent a letter to the administration questioning the plan, saying the proposal lacked \u201cthe rationale, data, and analysis to support its recommendations.\u201d In some classrooms, teachers talked candidly with students about what the proposal, part of the school\u2019s Vision2020 plan, would mean.\n\n\u201cHow did they even choose graphic design?\u201d Lancaster asked her friends over a plastic container of fries in the cafeteria, in Building 38 just off Connecticut Avenue. A friend suggested it might be because of low enrollment, as has been reported in the news. But that doesn\u2019t make sense to Lancaster, who couldn\u2019t even get into her major for a year because it was full.\n\nSome point out signs of investment, such as the $40 million student center under construction just outside the cafeteria. But they said they can\u2019t understand how the university wound up in such an apparently dire situation.\n\nDerrick Barnes, a 40-year-old who grew up in the District and is working toward a master\u2019s in business management, blames poor management, the city\u2019s lackluster investment and a weak alumni network. To Barnes, the proposal seems like the end of a mission to serve District residents.\n\n\u201cAs gentrification has occurred in D.C.,\u201d Barnes said, \u201cwhat we\u2019re saying to [less well-off people] who are left here is we don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe university\u2019s interim president, James E. Lyons Sr., has said the proposals are an effort to bolster the school by adding students, staying affordable and preparing graduates for jobs in high-demand fields. Lyons hopes to use the millions of dollars in annual savings from sports and academic cuts to expand and enhance the remaining programs.\n\nThe university has withered from what it was in the 1970s, when the D.C. Teachers College, the Washington Technical Institute and Federal City College were combined into one institution that had 13,000 students. In 2009, the school created a separate UDC community college, in part to help improve its dismal four-year graduation rates.\n\nThomas Kakovitch, who has been a professor of environmental science at the school for 42 years, said the proposed cuts worry him \u2014 and bemoaned the fact that his program is one of those being considered for elimination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been at this school longer than any president or provost,\u201d Kakovitch said. \u201cWhatever they tell me, it is not satisfactory.\u201d\n\nHe said enrollment in his classes is high and the work he and his students do is vital to the District and to the university\u2019s mission as a public land grant institution. This fall, he helped a Southeast church, ReGeneration House of Praise, set up an aquaponics facility he had designed to farm fish and grow fresh food in an urban setting. University officials praised the project at the time.\n\n\u201cThey publicized it knowing all along that they were going to shut it down,\u201d Kakovitch said.\n\nHis office sits across from offices for the biology department, which is one of the programs the proposal suggested bolstering with more funding. The juxtaposition has made for an awkward week. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to talk to me,\u201d Kakovitch said.\n\nRetired English professor Anne Hughes was on campus Wednesday to meet with a physics professor who is a former colleague. Hughes said she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the proposed cuts.\n\nHer colleague, who requested anonymity because his program is slated for elimination, said he attended the university\u2019s three-day retreat at the Washington Convention Center during the summer, where the talk focused on mission statements. \u201cThere was no mention of academic programs\u201d being cut, he said.\n\nIn 2006, the pair created an eight-week summer crash course to get students up to speed before they started college. UDC educates more D.C. residents than any other school in the area, and Hughes said many of those students come to the university ill-equipped for college. But more than 75 percent of the students in their summer course are able to test out of remedial math classes.\n\nHughes, who taught everything from reading to statistics as a full-time professor, comes back every summer to teach the math courses so students will be prepared for the transition to college. Too often, she said, the school \u2014 which gets almost 40 percent of its $169 million operating budget from the city \u2014 becomes a \u201cpolitical football,\u201d hurting its ability to educate D.C.\u2019s public school graduates. No other university in the city, she said, takes on that challenge like UDC does.\n\n\u201cTo me,\u201d Hughes said, \u201cit\u2019s a tragedy for this university not to succeed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "UDC, UDC budget, UDC cuts, University of the District of Columbia, reaction to UDC cuts, UDC budget proposal, D.C. university, D.C. college", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Students and professors reacted to the University\u2019s proposal with shock and frustration", "title": "Deep cuts proposed by UDC leave campus in shock", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/contemplating-a-new-future-many-at-udc-feel-left-behind/2013/11/17/0fb7b4ac-4d37-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/11/Local/Images/UDC0121384138931.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Students and professors reacted to the University\u2019s proposal with shock and frustration", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "UDC, UDC budget, UDC cuts, University of the District of Columbia, reaction to UDC cuts, UDC budget proposal, D.C. university, D.C. college", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "0fb7b4ac-4d37-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc07\"", "article_summary": "In 2009, the school created a separate UDC community college, in part to help improve its dismal four-year graduation rates.\nNo other university in the city, she said, takes on that challenge like UDC does.\nUDC educates more D.C. residents than any other school in the area, and Hughes said many of those students come to the university ill-equipped for college.\nIn 2006, the pair created an eight-week summer crash course to get students up to speed before they started college.\nBut more than 75 percent of the students in their summer course are able to test out of remedial math classes."}
