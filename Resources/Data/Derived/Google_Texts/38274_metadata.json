Beware that Virginia ranks as one of the toughest states on speeders, and police are proud of it.\n\nDriving 20 mph over the speed limit qualifies as reckless driving in Virginia law. That offense is not a mere traffic citation, but a Class One criminal misdemeanor punishable by a $2,500 fine and up to a year in jail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the highest-level misdemeanor, right below a felony,\u201d said Michael Frank, who rated states as best and worst for speeders.\n\nVirginia came in at fourth toughest, with New Jersey finishing No. 1. With its wide-open highways, North Dakota was ranked most lenient.\n\nUnlike North Dakota, which imposes a modest $5 fine for each mile per hour over the speed limit, Virginia pulls out all the stops to crack down on speeders.\n\n\u201cWhen the commonwealth raised its interstate speed limits a few years back, it failed to adjust the reckless driving threshold accordingly. So now, anyone caught going 11 mph over the posted speed on the interstate is subject to a reckless driving charge,\u201d said John Bowman, spokesman for the National Motorists Association.\n\nVirginia State Police spokeswoman Corrine Geller said VSP \u201cdoes take an aggressive stance on traffic violators because safe driving saves lives.\u201d\n\nGeller also pointed out that all funds generated from summons issued by Virginia State Police \u201cgo directly to court fees and the state\u2019s Literary Fund, which benefits public school construction, technology funding and teacher retirement.\u201d\n\nThough Virginia is the 12th largest state in population, it ranks seventh for most tickets issued per year.\n\n\u201cSpeed limits are set absurdly low, 45 mph on some highways,\u201d said Frank. \u201cRadar detectors are illegal, and cops have devices to detect them.\u201d\n\nBowman said his group\u2019s research shows that Virginia has far more traffic attorneys per capita \u2014 about 18 per 100,000 residents.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nearly twice as high as the next state, which is Maryland,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cThis indicates an extraordinarily high level of traffic enforcement, otherwise there wouldn\u2019t be enough demand to keep all of those lawyers in business.\u201d\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a hurry this holiday?
