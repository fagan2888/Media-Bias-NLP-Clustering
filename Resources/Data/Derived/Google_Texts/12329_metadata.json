Just before, he had met there with his foreign-policy advisers and just after he visited officials at the Republican National Committee \u2014 signs that, in spite of his Trump-knows-best manner, the political novice is making efforts to build a more well rounded bid.\n\n[Read the full transcript of the Trump interview]\n\nOver the course of the discussion, the candidate made clear that he would govern in the same nontraditional way that he has campaigned, tossing aside decades of American policy and custom in favor of a new, Trumpian approach to the world.\n\nIn his first 100 days, Trump said, he would cut taxes, \u201crenegotiate trade deals and renegotiate military deals,\u201d including altering the U.S. role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nHe insisted that he would be able to get rid of the nation\u2019s more than $19 trillion national debt \u201cover a period of eight years.\u201d\n\nMost economists would consider this impossible because it could require taking more than $2 trillion a year out of the annual $4 trillion budget to pay off holders of the debt.\n\nTrump vehemently disagrees: \u201cI\u2019m renegotiating all of our deals, the big trade deals that we\u2019re doing so badly on. With China, $505 billion this year in trade.\u201d He said that economic growth he foresees as a consequence of renegotiated deals would enable the United States to pay down the debt \u2014 although many economists have said the exact opposite -- that a trade war would be crippling to the U.S. economy.\n\nTrump also said that the United States has lost its standing in the world and that he would make people \u201crespect our country. I want them to respect our leader.\u201d Asked how he would do so, Trump cited an \u201caura of personality.\u201d\n\nAs a group of world leaders attended President Obama\u2019s Nuclear Security Summit less than a mile away, Trump said that, like Obama, he would support full-scale nuclear disarmament but quickly added, \u201cI love that. But from a practical standpoint, not going to happen.\u201d\n\nWere he to be elected president, Trump said he would want high-level employees of the federal government to sign legally binding nondisclosure agreements so that staffers couldn\u2019t write insider accounts of what it\u2019s like inside a Trump White House.\n\n\u201cWhen people are chosen by a man to go into government at high levels and then they leave government and they write a book about a man and say a lot of things that were really guarded and personal, I don\u2019t like that,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBut first, Trump must get elected, and his campaign is struggling through one of its most challenging stretches. In the past week, his campaign manager has been charged with battery for grabbing a reporter, Trump has been criticized for mocking the looks of an opponent\u2019s wife as compared with those of his own spouse, and he has backtracked from comments about abortion that offended many in his own party.\n\nTrump said that everyone close to him \u2014 family, friends, Republican leaders \u2014 have been urging him to tone down his attacks and reach out to former rivals, both to reassure wary voters and to begin the difficult process of unifying a party in which many have sworn to never back him. Trump does not intend to take the advice. He said such overtures are \u201coverrated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the first thing I have to do is win,\u201d he said. \u201cWinning solves a lot of problems. And I have two people left\u201d: his two remaining Republican rivals, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to break an egg,\u201d Trump said, and Cruz and Kasich were the two remaining eggs.\n\nTrump did offer some concessions to the realities of being a political novice, saying that he would not pick an outsider like himself as a vice-presidential running mate, but rather, \u201csomebody that can walk into the Senate and who\u2019s been friendly with these guys for 25 years, and people for 25 years. And can get things done. So I would 95 percent see myself picking a political person as opposed to somebody from the outside.\u201d\n\nIn another unprecedented move, Trump said he plans to announce a list of 10 to 12 judges from which he would pick to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court to allay concerns from conservatives that he wouldn\u2019t choose someone to their liking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting names. The Federalist people. Some very good people. The Heritage Foundation,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m going to announce that these are the judges, in no particular order, that I\u2019m going to put up. And I\u2019m going to guarantee it. I\u2019m going to tell people. Because people are worried that, oh, maybe he\u2019ll put the wrong judge in.\u201d\n\nAnd after a series of violent incidents at his rallies between supporters and protesters, Trump acknowledged that, at least for a little while, he has tried to calm things down.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve purposefully kept the crowds down this past week,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve gone into small venues and we\u2019re turning away thousands and thousands of people, which I hate, but we didn\u2019t want to have the protest. You know, when you have a room of 2,000 people, you can pretty much keep it without the protesters.\u201d\n\n\u2018I bring rage out. I always have.\u2019\n\nThe question posed to Trump about his decision to run: \u201cWhere do you start the movie?\u201d\n\nA wry smile spread over his face as he repeated the question about the moment when he decided to turn what had long been a flirtation with running for the presidency into something real.\n\nAsked who he talked to about this critical decision, Trump answered, \u201cTo myself.\u201d\n\nTo your family?\n\n\u201cTo my family, but to myself.\u201d\n\nSo it was an interior dialogue?\n\n\u201cThis is thought process. And I\u2019m saying to myself, you know, look, they put me in these polls. I\u2019m number one.\u201d\n\nTrump said his interest really started to pick up in the summer of 2014, when he was still busy with his hit NBC reality show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d He kept his ambition mostly to himself, slowly thinking it through into early last year, when he hired political advisers, months before he formally jumped in.\n\nTrump said his experience throughout the last two years wasn\u2019t like 1987, when he first made a speech in New Hampshire that he \u201cforgot about\u201d soon after delivering it. This time, as he read the daily newspapers, printed-out online articles (his preferred method of reading) and kept tabs on cable news, he felt the pull.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You know, this is something I really would like to do.\u2019 I think I\u2019d do it really well. Obviously the public seems to like me,\u201d Trump recalled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a moment when it kicked to yes. Because it was a monetary moment also. . . . There was a moment in, I would say February of last year, so that would be four months, three, four months before I announced, when Steve Burke, great guy, of Comcast . . . came to see me with the top people at NBC. And they wanted to extend my contract.\u201d\n\nTrump told them he was going to run for president instead.\n\n\u201cI just felt there were so many things going wrong with the country,\u201d Trump said of his thinking at the time. He was frustrated with what he saw as the \u201cstupidity\u201d of trade deals and Iran nuclear negotiations that were \u201cterrible\u201d and dominated by \u201cPersians being great negotiators.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s wife, Melania, heard most of his complaints, but was enthusiastic about him becoming a candidate. \u201cShe said, \u2018We have such a great life. Why do you want to do this?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I sort of have to do it, I think. I really have to do it.\u2019. . . I could do such a great job.\u201d\n\nLater, Melania said, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t do it, but if you run, you\u2019ll win,\u201d according to Trump.\n\nNow, more than a year later and with the Republican nomination in sight, Trump\u2019s family is giving him different advice. \u201cMy family said to me \u2014 and Don [Jr.] has said this, and Ivanka, and my wife has said this \u2014 \u2018Be more presidential.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTrump said he is getting similar guidance from close friends. He had a story to share. A couple weeks ago, a friend, a famous athlete, called. This was right after Trump beat Sen. Marco Rubio in Florida, the senator\u2019s home state. \u201cThat was a big beating. Don\u2019t forget, he was the face of the Republican Party. He was the future of the Republican Party. So [the athlete] called me up. And he said, \u2018Hey Donald, could you do us all a favor? We love you. Don\u2019t kill everybody. Because you may need them on the way back.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut Trump doesn\u2019t see it that way, at least not yet. \u201cI think you have to break the egg initially,\u201d he said, adding that he has to beat his opponents and secure the nomination before he is willing to consider reaching out or easing off in any way.\n\nWhen it was suggested that he seems comfortable being the Lone Ranger \u2014 the famous old-time TV and radio-masked vigilante who fought for good outside the law \u2014 Trump immediately concurred.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I understand life. And I understand how life works. I\u2019m the Lone Ranger.\u201d\n\nAsked how he would build a coalition for the general election, Trump responded that he hasn\u2019t focused on Hillary Clinton yet \u2014 an implication that once he starts attacking her, voters would rally to his side.\n\nPressed on whether it is incumbent on him to tame the anger within his party, Trump said it was, but also: \u201cI bring rage out. I do bring rage out. I always have. I think it was, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an asset or a liability, but whatever it is, I do. I also bring great unity out, ultimately. I\u2019ve had many occasions like this, where people have hated me more than any human being they\u2019ve ever met. And after it\u2019s all over, they end up being my friends. And I see that happening here.\u201d\n\nNot with everyone, though. Trump acknowledged that he has been \u201crough\u201d and \u201cnasty\u201d in debates \u2014 so much so that some relationships with his former rivals are likely beyond repair. \u201cOne of the problems I have is that when I hit people, I hit them harder maybe than is necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s almost impossible to reel them back.\u201d\n\nLike Rubio, and former Florida governor Jeb Bush. \u201cSome of the people that I was competing against, I\u2019m not sure they can ever go back to me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was very rough on Jeb.\u201d It was \u201cJeb: Low energy. Little Marco. Names that were devastating.\u201d\n\nTrump seemed unsure whether Cruz would ultimately fit that category. Trump noted that they had gotten along quite well for many months and suggested they could again, but he was also ambivalent about potentially reaching out to Cruz if he beats the senator from Texas for the nomination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never have to call him,\u201d to get his help and support, Trump said, adding that if Cruz did reach out, he would congratulate him. \u201cBecause out of 17 people, you beat 16. Okay? Which is pretty good.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump admitted that he needed to do more outreach. \u201cHonestly, a lot of people are calling me, but I should be calling them,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause to a certain extent, I should be calling them, they shouldn\u2019t have to be calling me.\u201d\n\nTrump noted that two of his former rivals, Ben Carson and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, are supporting him. As for some others, \u201cThey will be loved. At the right time, they will be loved.\u201d\n\nAsked specifically at this uncertain moment in his campaign whether \u201call politics, all successful politics, is about coalition building,\u201d he responded: \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nDo you agree?\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Trump said, his arms folded across his familiar dark suit, white shirt and red tie, as he sat in what he hopes will be his newest trophy hotel. \u201cI agree. I agree.\u201d\n\nPressed on when that coalition building might begin, he turned to stories about boxing great Muhammad Ali and football coaching icon Vince Lombardi.\n\nAli, he said, earned respect \u201cthrough having the goods. You know, so Muhammad Ali is a friend of mine. He\u2019s a good guy. I\u2019ve watched many people over the years. Muhammad Ali would get in the ring, and he\u2019d talk and talk and scream and talk about the ugly bear, and this, that \u2014 you know. And then he\u2019d win. And respect is about winning. We don\u2019t win anymore. I see it in my \u2014 we don\u2019t win anymore. And he\u2019d win. I\u2019ve seen many fighters that were better than Muhammad Ali, in terms of talking. I\u2019ve seen guys that were so beautiful, so flamboyant, they\u2019d get into the ring \u2014 and then they\u2019d get knocked out. And guess what? It\u2019s all gone.\u201d\n\nTrump took a similar lesson from Lombardi.\n\n\u201cThe coalition building for me will be when I win. Vince Lombardi, I saw this. He was not a big man. And I was sitting in a place with some very, very tough football players. Big, strong football players. He came in \u2014 these are tough cookies \u2014 he came in, years ago \u2014 and I\u2019ll never forget it, I was a young man. He came in, screaming, into this place. And screaming at one of these guys who was three times bigger than him, literally. And very physical, grabbing him by the shirt.\n\n\u201cNow, this guy could\u2019ve whisked him away and thrown him out the window in two seconds. This guy \u2014 the player \u2014 was shaking. A friend of mine. There were four players, and Vince Lombardi walked in. He was angry. And he grabbed \u2014 I was a young guy \u2014 he grabbed him by the shirt, screaming at him, and the guy was literally. . . . And I said, wow. And I realized the only way Vince Lombardi got away with that was because he won.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s precarious times\u2019\n\nTrump has contended for months that the U.S. economy is in trouble because of what he sees as an overvalued stock market, but his view has grown more pessimistic of late and he is now bearish on investing, to the point of warning Americans against doing so.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re sitting on an economic bubble. A financial bubble,\u201d Trump said. He made clear that he was not specifying a sector of the economy but the economy at large and asserted that more bullish forecasts were based on skewed employment numbers and an inflated stock market.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re not at 5 percent unemployment. We\u2019re at a number that\u2019s probably into the twenties if you look at the real number,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat was a number that was devised, statistically devised to make politicians \u2014 and, in particular, presidents \u2014 look good. And I wouldn\u2019t be getting the kind of massive crowds that I\u2019m getting if the number was a real number.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s assertion does not match data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Its analysis of joblessness beyond the unemployed \u2014 such as \u201cmarginally attached\u201d workers and those who have dropped out of the labor force \u2014 was under 10 percent nationally last month.\n\nTrump\u2019s view also runs counter to that of most economists, whose rough consensus is that the U.S. economy has about a 20 percent chance of slipping into recession this year largely because growth remains weak across the world, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of economists in March.\n\nMost economists aren\u2019t overly worried about an imminent downturn because job creation remains strong, workers are starting to see their wages grow and the Federal Reserve remains cautious about shifting away from the low-interest-rate stance that has helped stimulate the economy. Any number of Trump\u2019s predictions haven\u2019t worked out. In 2012, for instance, he predicted that if Obama were reelected, oil and gas prices would go \u201cthrough the roof like never before.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Trump said that when Obama\u2019s health-care law took effect, national unemployment would \u201cgo even higher\u201d than 9 percent. He was also bullish on real estate investments in the run-up to the housing bust.\n\nNonetheless, Trump said, \u201cit\u2019s precarious times. Part of the reason it\u2019s precarious is because we are being ripped so badly by other countries. We are being ripped so badly by China. It just never ends. Nobody\u2019s ever going to stop it. And the reason they\u2019re not going to stop it is one of two. They\u2019re either living in a world of the make-believe, or they\u2019re totally controlled by their lobbyists and their special interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pessimistic,\u201d Trump said. \u201cUnless changes are made. Changes could be made.\u201d\n\nBy Trump, for instance: \u201cI can fix it. I can fix it pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nTrump firmly believes that a turnaround on trade would be the necessary beginning of a solution to any looming recession.\n\nHe mentions the Trans-Pacific Partnership as one pact he would immediately seek to renegotiate, putting him at odds with congressional Republicans who supported giving the president fast track trade authority last year.\n\nCoupled with his push on trade would be a \u201cvery big tax cut,\u201d which Trump unveiled last September. That proposal increases taxes on the \u201cvery rich\u201d but reduces taxes for most taxpayers and would cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. To woo companies back to the United States, he would offer an incentive of a deeply discounted rate and would no longer allow corporations to defer taxes on income earned overseas.\n\n\u2018You\u2019ll be falling asleep\u2019\n\nIn the center of Washington on Thursday, world leaders were attending a summit focused on reducing nuclear stockpiles around the world. A day earlier, Trump had made headlines for saying at an MSNBC forum that he would \u201cpossibly\u201d use a nuclear weapon as president. Less than a week before, in an interview with the New York Times, Trump had suggested that Japan and South Korea should consider acquiring nuclear arms as a way of disengaging the United States from its role as a military protector \u2014 a proposal that the Obama White House promptly called \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d\n\nTold that Obama had said in 2010 that his greatest worry is a nuclear device exploding in an American city, Trump at first took a dig at the president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny. It\u2019s very interesting. I\u2019m surprised he said that because I heard him recently say that the biggest problem we have is global warming, which I totally disagree with. Okay?\u201d Trump said.\n\nBut after mocking, Trump turned solemn on the topic, calling the nuclear threat the \u201csingle greatest problem\u201d for global peace. \u201cYou look at Hiroshima and multiply it times a thousand,\u201d he said, shaking his head. Trump said if other countries would agree to do so simultaneously, he would be open to eliminating nuclear weapons held by the United States. \u201cIf it\u2019s done on an equal basis, absolutely,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Trump added a caveat. He said as much as he supports the idea of eliminating nuclear weapons, it may not be feasible in the current climate and with countries such as Russia and Pakistan perhaps unwilling to relinquish their arms since they are \u201cspending a tremendous amount of money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that in an ideal world is wonderful, but I think it\u2019s not going to happen very easily. I would love to see a nuclear-free world. Will that happen?\u201d Trump said. \u201cLook, Russia right now is spending a tremendous amount of money on redoing their entire nuclear arsenal.\u201d\n\nTurning to Russia\u2019s leader, Vladimir Putin, Trump said he continues to appreciate praise from Putin, even though his human-rights record and incursions into Ukraine and elsewhere have alarmed many. \u201cI want Putin to respect our country, okay?\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think he respects strength. Okay? I think Putin respects strength. And I\u2019ve said it before, I think I will get along well with Putin. Now you never know. I don\u2019t say that \u2014 only a fool would say, \u2018I will,\u2019 but I feel that I will get along well with Putin.\u201d\n\nAfter talk of Putin and strength, Trump was read a few lines from Jeffrey Goldberg\u2019s interview with Obama in the Atlantic, which quotes Obama as saying, \u201cReal power means you can get what you want without having to exert violence.\u201d\n\nTrump listened carefully and said, \u201cWell, I think there\u2019s a certain truth to that. I think there\u2019s a certain truth to that. Real power is through respect. Real power is\u2026I don\u2019t even want to use the word--fear. But you know, our military is very sadly depleted. You look at what\u2019s going on with respect to our military, and it\u2019s depleted from all of the cuts,\u201d Trump said, noting that he frequently sees advertisements for former U.S. military bases being available for purchase.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people to be afraid. I want them to respect our country,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, they don\u2019t respect our country.\u201d\n\nTrump said the United States should not retreat from the world but should reevaluate its relationships and role in many international groups and alliances, including NATO.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s obsolete,\u201d he said. \u201cOur big threat today is terrorism. Okay? And NATO\u2019s not really set up for terrorism. NATO is set up for the Soviet Union more than anything else. And now you don\u2019t have the Soviet Union.\u201d But for Trump, NATO, Putin, nuclear weapons, all of that is for later. For now, against mounting calls from friends, loved ones and fellow Republicans, remains the fight.\n\n\u201cMy natural inclination is to win,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd after I win, I will be so presidential that you won\u2019t even recognize me. You\u2019ll be falling asleep, you\u2019ll be so bored.\u201d\n\nJim Tankersley and Evelyn M. Duffy contributed to this report, which was originally published by The Washington Post.
