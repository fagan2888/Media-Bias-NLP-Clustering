Some experts contend it\u2019s much more likely to be abused than other drugs, such as OxyContin, which was reformulated in 2010 to make it tamper-resistant.\n\nZohydro includes high doses of an opioid painkiller, similar to OxyContin. According to the drug company\u2019s literature, an adult could overdose on two capsules and swallowing just one pill could kill a child, NPR reports. The drug is the first ever cleared for U.S. patients that contains only the opioid hydrocodone, and at a dose five to 10 times higher than Vicodin and similar painkillers that blend hydrocodone with over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.\n\n\u201cNew England has seen more than our share of prescription drug addiction and abuse,\u201d Pingree said in a statement. \u201cOne effective response has been to make pain killers like OxyContin tamper resistant but now the FDA has gone ahead and improved a new drug that doesn\u2019t have those safeguards. It just doesn\u2019t make sense and even the FDA\u2019s own experts warned against approving the drug.\u201d\n\nThe FDA\u2019s medical advisory panel recommended 11-2 against approving the drug.\n\nPingree and Michaud joined U.S. House colleagues Reps. Carol Shea-Porter and Annie Kuster of New Hampshire, and Rep. Peter Welch of Vermont in sending the letter.\n\nZohydro\u2019s manufacturer has announced it\u2019s developing a tamper-resistant version of the drug, due to hit the market in three years. Pingree and her colleagues called on the FDA to keep the drug off the market until the new form is available, according to her statement. Attorneys general from more than two dozen states, including Maine, have made the same request.\n\nOtherwise, Zohydro is due to become available within the month, according to Michaud\u2019s office.\n\nMichaud joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers in introducing legislation to withdraw FDA approval of the drug. The bill, An Act to Prohibit Zohydro, also would prohibit the FDA from approving any version of the drug not formulated to prevent abuse.\n\n\u201cAs the New England states continue to combat opiate addiction, the last thing our communities need is a new, highly abusable narcotic on the street,\u201d Michaud said in a press release.\n\nMichaud noted the 927 drug-affected infants born in Maine last year, also referenced by Gov. Paul LePage in his State of the State address last month.\n\nRandy Liberty, Kennebec County sheriff and president of the Maine Sheriffs\u2019 Association, was quoted in Michaud\u2019s release saying the legislation is crucial to prevent more overdose deaths.\n\nHe was joined by Darrell Crandall, Aroostook County chief deputy sheriff and former commander of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement in Maine has far too frequently witnessed the dire consequences of the improper use of high potency, delayed release opioids,\u201d Crandall said in the release. \u201cIn my experience, the worst of those drugs failed to include adequate tamper resistant formulas.\u201d\n\nThe Maine Chiefs of Police Association also announced support for the bill, the release states.\n\nDr. Brad Galer, chief medical officer for the drug company Zogenix, which is marketing Zohydro, told NPR the company will closely monitor any abuse of the medication, which he said could help millions of people in chronic pain.\n\nThe FDA has defended the drug amid growing calls from public health groups and others to rescind its approval.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that this is a powerful drug, but we also believe that if appropriately used, it serves an important and unique niche with respect to pain medication and it meets the standards for safety and efficacy,\u201d Hamburg said yesterday at a hearing of the U.S. Senate\u2019s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, according to Reuters.\n\nCorrection: I reworked a sentence comparing Zohydro to OxyContin to reflect that Zohydro does not come in significantly higher doses.\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "198.196"}}, "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdefc\"", "article_summary": "He was joined by Darrell Crandall, Aroostook County chief deputy sheriff and former commander of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency.\nCorrection: I reworked a sentence comparing Zohydro to OxyContin to reflect that Zohydro does not come in significantly higher doses.\nAccording to the drug company\u2019s literature, an adult could overdose on two capsules and swallowing just one pill could kill a child, NPR reports.\nZohydro includes high doses of an opioid painkiller, similar to OxyContin.\n\u201cNew England has seen more than our share of prescription drug addiction and abuse,\u201d Pingree said in a statement."}
