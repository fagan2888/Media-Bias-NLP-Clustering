It is an old building in Boston\u2019s North End, with doors that are big and heavy, not an easy place for an amputee to live.\n\nWhen she left the hospital, a month after the Boston marathon bombing, she had a choice: She could find another place to live, one more suitable for someone who wears a prosthetic that replaces most of her right leg. Or, she could stay.\n\n\u201cEarly on when all this happened, so many people were telling me to move out of the city and move out of my apartment because of the stairs and I don\u2019t have an elevator and parking is not very convenient,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut I have been able to get past all of that.\u201d\n\nIn that, she mirrors Boston itself.\n\n\u201cI have to tell you, honestly, Boston is a better city now than it was before,\u201d says Thomas Menino, Boston\u2019s former mayor. \u201cPeople learned how to deal with each other, they had to deal with a tragedy.\u201d\n\nNot that it\u2019s been easy. Three people were killed at last year\u2019s Boston Marathon, and more than 260 were injured, and the legacy of trauma and lost limbs remains \u2014 as does the shock of having endured a terrorist attack on Marathon Monday. Nor can Bostonians forget the fear that gripped a city locked down in the midst of a manhunt.\n\nBut Boston has been able to get past all of that. Copley Square is no longer littered with impromptu tributes to the dead and injured; they\u2019re now on display in an exhibit at the Boston Public Library, where Robert White of Lynn saw meaning in every teddy bear and pair of sneakers: \u201cEvery last one of the items says \u2018Boston Strong\u2019 or \u2018I will return next year.'\u201d\n\n___\n\nRoseann Sdoia is 46 years old, a vice president of property management for a Boston development company. She is a cheerful woman; she smiles broadly when she arrives at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown for physical therapy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just my nature,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not a negative person. I\u2019m not a Debbie Downer.\u201d\n\nStill, she says, she cries every day.\n\n\u201cWhat is sinking in is that life has changed,\u201d she says, her face awash with tears.\n\nSdoia is a runner, but she did not take part in the marathon. She was at the finish line on April 15, rooting for friends in the race, when the second bomb went off. Aside from her leg injury, she suffered hearing loss.\n\n\u201cOther than losing the bottom of my right leg, I\u2019m still me,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t changed, I am still the same person I was before.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, so much has changed. She had to take more leave from the job she loved. Winter, and snow, were tough to handle. She\u2019s had to tackle daily tasks \u2014 showering, vacuuming \u2014 differently.\n\nMarc Fucarile, a 35-year-old roofer from Stoneham, also lost his right leg from above the knee; he has shrapnel in his heart, and still could lose his left leg.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A year after bombing, Boston and its people heal", "title": "A year after bombing, Boston and its people heal", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A year after bombing, Boston and its people heal", "title": "A year after bombing, Boston and its people heal", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/12/a_year_after_bombing_boston_and_its_people_heal/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/boston-marathon-bombing-healing-the-wounds.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A year after bombing, Boston and its people heal", "title": "A year after bombing, Boston and its people heal", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/boston-marathon-bombing-healing-the-wounds.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Denise Lavoie and Paige Sutherland", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda65f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOther than losing the bottom of my right leg, I\u2019m still me,\u201d she says.\nWhen she left the hospital, a month after the Boston marathon bombing, she had a choice: She could find another place to live, one more suitable for someone who wears a prosthetic that replaces most of her right leg.\n\u201cI have to tell you, honestly, Boston is a better city now than it was before,\u201d says Thomas Menino, Boston\u2019s former mayor.\nThree people were killed at last year\u2019s Boston Marathon, and more than 260 were injured, and the legacy of trauma and lost limbs remains \u2014 as does the shock of having endured a terrorist attack on Marathon Monday.\nMarc Fucarile, a 35-year-old roofer from Stoneham, also lost his right leg from above the knee; he has shrapnel in his heart, and still could lose his left leg."}
