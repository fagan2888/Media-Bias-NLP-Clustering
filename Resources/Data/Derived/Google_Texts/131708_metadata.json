After all, any port in a storm, right?\n\nWhy would Redskins fans get any satisfaction over a Seahawks win? Because the man who supposedly helped build the roster of the defending Super Bowl champions was introduced Friday as the alleged new architect of Washington Redskins personnel.\n\nScot McCloughan \u2014 a \u201csenior personnel executive\u201d with Seattle \u2014 was reportedly the man responsible for drafting Russell Wilson, Richard Sherman, Bruce Irvin, Bobby Wagner and K.J. Wright, if you are keeping score.\n\nOf course, the general manager who may have had a small role in building the Seahawks \u2014 John Schneider \u2014 was the Redskins\u2018 vice president of player personnel in 2001, so they already had the guy in the building who had hired the guy they introduced Friday in the building, and let him leave.\n\nThat, though, is living in the past. That\u2019s not the Redskins way \u2014 at least not the last 20 years or so.\n\nThe past before that, though, comes right out of the playbook for fresh starts at Redskins Park.\n\n\u201cSeeing all the tradition, seeing the World Championships, seeing the Hall of Fame football players and seeing the stadium sold out and just rabid fans, it all fell into place for me right now,\u201d McCloughan said at Redskins Park on Friday during his introductory press conference.\n\nBless him, he mentioned five world championships \u2014 acknowledging the two this franchise won when it first arrived in Washington in 1937 and again in 1942, recognizing the NFL didn\u2019t begin with the first Super Bowl.\n\nBut, when asked how difficult it would be to \u201cinfuse his philosophy into the organization, McCloughan answered, \u201cThe past is the past.\u201d\n\nHis philosophy, I would assume, being winning.\n\nOne year to the day, Jay Gruden said the same thing when he was hired as Washington\u2019s new coach.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to forget about the past and look toward the future every day,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nI\u2019ll bet Jay Gruden remembers every single excruciating day of this past year.\n\nMcCloughan, 34, read from other excerpts from the Redskins Park fresh start playbook \u2014 hitting the most important note, how much Redskins owner Dan Snyder wants to win.\n\nHe talked about \u201csitting down with Mr. Snyder for about five, six hours face-to-face and just seeing the passion he had in his eyes \u2014 the passion for the fanbase, the passion for winning, and if he said it one time he said it 20 times, that\u2019s all that matters is winning games here.\n\n\u201cThe one thing with Dan which is incredible was just the fact that whatever it takes to win, let\u2019s do it, let\u2019s do it no matter what,\u201d McCloughan said. \u201cThey deserve it \u2014 the fans deserve it, the players deserve it, he deserves it. You know, just to see \u2014 when you see a guy\u2019s eyes light up like that and just see not aggression, but you see him just get excited like a little kid, it was cool as crud, you know?\u201d\n\nAgain, one year to the day, Gruden read from the same script.\n\n\u201cI know that interviewing with Dan Snyder and Bruce Allen and everybody here that the passion for excellence is there,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cAll they want do is win and they\u2019re going to provide me with every avenue to win. I don\u2019t know what happened last year and I don\u2019t care what happened last year. All I care about next year is moving forward. I am going to provide the players with every avenue, like I said, for them to succeed and be great. So moving forward, we\u2019re going to forget about the past and look forward to the future every day.\u201d\n\nMcCloughan told you what he believes you can look forward to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to outwork the next guy no matter what,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have great communication with everybody in the building that matters in personnel and in coaching, and when we make decisions, we\u2019ll make them as a group. We\u2019ll take ownership for the players and we\u2019re going to get better.\u201d\n\nIf we are to believe the experts, he did that in San Francisco, where he was the general manager, and he did it in Seattle, helping to build the team that manhandled the Panthers on Saturday night and may be on their way to a second consecutive Super Bowl championship.\n\nIf we are to believe McCloughan, that is the future in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u2022 Thom Loverro is co-host of \u201cThe Sports Fix,\u201d noon to 2 p.m. daily on ESPN 980 and espn980.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why would Redskins fans get any satisfaction over a Seahawks win?
