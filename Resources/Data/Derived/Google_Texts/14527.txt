SANTA CRUZ &GT;&GT; Senior Network Services Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program announces eight forums to help Santa Cruz County residents learn about their Medicare enrollment options. Topics include how to determine which of the 31 Part D prescription drug plans is best for you, how the Affordable Care Act has affected Medicare and fraud protection.

Two of the four plans offered this year will not be available next year, and there will be one new plan.

HICAP plans a Medigap seminar Dec. 9 from 10-11:30 a.m. at the Live Oak Senior Center, 1777 Capitola Road, to review the plans available, how to shop, and the California birthday rule.

The seminar is scheduled in time for those who have lost their plan to take action and want to return to original Medicare and a Medigap plan without having a gap in coverage, according to Beth Hyttinen of HICAP.
