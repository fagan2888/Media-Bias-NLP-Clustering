Mike Enzi and Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is a duel proving itself worthy of the wild west.\n\nWyoming's a small and (usually) congenial state. The kind of place where \"fishing buddies\" and family names can go a long way. That is why this GOP primary, a contest of homespun versus homecoming, already tops lists of GOP confrontations to watch ahead of 2014. Though unlike 2012 races in Indiana or Missouri, this Republican primary isn't expected to lead to a Democrat stealing the seat; no matter who tops the August primary, solidly-conservative Wyoming is still expected to send a Republican to Washington.\n\nThe aftermath of the bitter contest, however, is starting to splinter the state's Republican Party. Already the race has ripped apart long-time friendships, left local party bosses scratching their heads and attracted outsiders to weigh in.\n\nAfter 16 years in the Senate, Enzi, a former Gillette, Wyo., mayor and state legislator, is without a doubt fending off his savviest primary challenger yet.\n\n[READ: The 3 Hottest Congressional Races to Watch in 2014]\n\nLiz Cheney's got a family pedigree, of course, but her political astuteness and established political team are what have made her a formidable opponent. She has outraised Enzi with more than $1 million in her first quarter, raking in big checks from Republican Party stars like former secretary of defense Donald Rumseld and dad Dick Cheney.\n\nBut all the money in the world may not be able to help Liz Cheney navigate around her central obstacle, which is that she doesn't have the long-standing record of service in the state.\n\nCheney's announcement in July that she would seek the Enzi's seat, shocked Wyomingites who have got a certain affection for the familiar.\n\n\"I don't think people are looking to trade Enzi in for someone they don't know or trust,\" says Liz Brimmer, a GOP strategist and Enzi campaign volunteer in the state. \"It's a choice of made-in-Wyoming versus made up in Washington.\"\n\nCheney's tried to paint herself as the consummate Washington outsider, but its tough when her name is tied to her father's old-guard GOP legacy. She helped write his memoir, after all.\n\nCheney's spent the major part of her adult life outside of the \"cowboy state,\" working in Washington at the State Department and then co-founding Keep America Safe, a hawkish foreign policy think tank inside the beltway. Cheney is also no stranger to the cable news circuit where she often appeared to discuss and bolster her family's tough foreign policy positions.\n\nSo it's not surprising she's caught a lot of flack for what some allege are shallow roots in Wyoming.\n\nCheney, who had raised a family just outside of Washington in the suburbs, bought a house outside of Jackson Hole, Wyo., just last year, leaving many to question her motives.\n\n\"It looks like pure ego. Buying a pair of cowboy boots doesn't make you a cow girl,\" Brimmer says.\n\nCheney's reinforced the outsider stereotype as well - paying property taxes late (although according to a Casper Star-Tribune report Mike Enzi also was late three times paying his property taxes in 1999, 2000 and 2008) and getting an \"in-state\" - and therefore discounted - fishing license even though she did not meet the minimum one-year resident statute to qualify for the perk. Even her own sister, who is gay, posted on Facebook that Liz Cheney's stance against gay marriage was \"dead wrong.\"\n\n[READ: Gun Control Groups Claim They Helped Beat Cuccinelli, But Did They?]\n\nBut Cheney has drowned out the critics. She might come from Wyoming political royalty, but she recognizes what she'll have to do to win. It's about putting mileage on her car and out-handshaking Enzi.\n\nBouncing around Wednesday between meetings and a Rotary Club luncheon, Cheney told U.S. News over the phone that her main focus remains getting out on the road everyday.\n\n\"The person-to-person piece of it will make all the difference,\" she says. Even before she announced her candidacy, she was laying the groundwork for a run, meeting with local conservatives and making her rounds at party banquets.\n\n\"I am very proud of both my parents, but this is my race,\" she says. \"It is a race that I intend to win one voter at a time.\"\n\nAs for the carpet-bagging charges Cheney says, \"The people making that claim are the people who don't want to talk about Sen. Enzi's lack of results.\"\n\n\"I am proud of my roots here. Wyoming has always been my home,\" she adds. But the latest public poll showed Cheney far behind, proving she still must convince voters she's just a girl from Casper, Wyo.\n\n\"When you live in a small town in the boondocks, everyone knows everyone. That is what matters here,\" says Thomas Lubnau, Wyoming's House speaker, about the state's politics. \"Wyoming is a small town with really, really long streets.\"\n\nBut few people can wrap their heads around why Liz Cheney's running now. Unlike GOP primary challenges of the past, Enzi's no conservative squish the tea party must replace.\n\n\"He's consistently ranked as one of the top conservative senators. Wyoming voters have known Mike a long time, and they know he has a strong and consistent conservative record,\" Enzi's spokesman Kristin Walker said in an email.\n\nHe has a 93 percent lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union, a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee and an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association.\n\n\"It is hard to distinguish between Mike Enzi and Liz Cheney. The two of them are the most conservative people in the universe,\" says Lubnau, who has known Enzi since the senator was a shoe salesman in Gillette, Wyo. but says he has not yet had a chance to meet with Cheney.\n\nCheney dismisses claims that there are few political difference between her and her opponent.\n\n\"I took a hard look at the race before I got into it,\" she says, adding it's Enzi's approach that is the real problem.\n\n[READ: Abortion Debate Begins in the Senate]\n\nWhile he's voted against the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as the Republican-loathed \"Obamacare,\" at every opportunity, she points out Enzi was part of the \"gang of six,\" a bipartisan group of legislators who met early on to cobble together a health care compromise. The talks eventually collapsed, paving the way for the Democrat-only crafted ACA. And while he has been vehemently opposed to President Barack Obama's new environmental regulations on the coal industry, Liz Cheney says Enzi's not been aggressive enough to help Wyoming's coal industry.\n\n\"It isn't good enough to say 'I tried.' It isn't good enough to say you are working behind the scene. We need a senator who is going to actively and aggressively push back,\" Liz Cheney says.\n\nEnzi's campaign says preserving the coal industry has been one of Enzi's signature legacies.\n\nDuring his time in Congress, the three-term senator has focused on bolstering Wyoming's energy sector, which is the largest exporter of coal in the country. In 2006, Enzi helped secure more than $1.5 billion through an Abandoned Mines Land Fund for the state of Wyoming. As a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Enzi helped revise miner safety laws.\n\nBattling over tactics is one thing, but when it comes to actually being on opposite sides of the coin, there remains just one issue where Enzi and Cheney clearly differ, though it's not clear whether the esoteric-sounding Marketplace Fairness Act will be enough to get Wyomingites to vote against the incumbent senator.\n\nEnzi sponsored the legislation, which gives businesses a chance to collect sales tax from customers who buy goods over the Internet. Because the law allows out-of-state businesses to collect sales tax on residents, Cheney vehemently opposed the bill and argues it's proof Enzi not against new taxes after all. The issue has divided Republicans in the Senate with some senators in states with sales tax also opposed.\n\nThere's still 10 months until the August primary - plenty of time for the candidates to draw clearer contrasts - but what's increasingly clear is the wedge they are driving between Republicans back home.\n\n\"We are experiencing an internal state party schism,\" says one Republican activist in the state, who spoke on background. \"It is kind of a sticky situation for us. We have a long-time and well-liked senator and an engaging challenger. It is a tough line for us to walk.\"\n\n[READ: Young Democrats Urge Harry Reid to Press Senate Rules Change]\n\nThe race has also taken a toll on the Cheney family's relationship with family friend former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson.\n\nSimpson, who declined to talk to U.S. News about the party squabbling, told the Casper Star-Tribune in September that Liz's mother Lynne Cheney told him to \"shut up\" at a local event after he refused to sign a football he was worried might be used at a fundraiser for Liz. The football was actually going to be used for a charity event.\n\n\"It's a deep, deep, deep-rooted friendship,\" Simpson told the Washington Post about his relationship with Enzi. \"I didn't have that friendship with Liz.\"\n\nBut Cheney has been able to wrangle her own supporters back in Wyoming.\n\nFoster Friess, a millionaire businessman who bankrolled former GOP presidential contender Rick Santorum's campaign, is throwing his lot behind the challenger.\n\n\"Liz will be more 'hawkish' when it comes to restoring fiscal responsibility in Washington,\" Friess said in an email exchange with U.S. News. \"Mike Enzi is going strong, but I'm a big fan of more youth in our legislative bodies and passing the baton to the next generation of leaders.\"", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Congress", "title": "In Wyoming Senate Primary, A Contest of Mike Enzi and Liz Cheney's Roots.", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "In Wyoming, a senate primary worthy of the wild west.", "title": "In Wyoming Senate Primary, A Contest of Mike Enzi and Liz Cheney's Roots.", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/11/08/in-wyoming-senate-primary-a-contest-of-mike-enzi-and-liz-cheneys-roots", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/98/70c1066fe96b1a01a6214b30999a9b/49580widemodern_enzi_131108.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Wyoming, a senate primary worthy of the wild west.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "In Wyoming Senate Primary, A Contest of Mike Enzi and Liz Cheney's Roots."}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Nov. 8, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lauren Fox,Pulse,Wyoming,Cheney, Liz,Enzi, Mike,elections,Congress", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "In Wyoming, a senate primary worthy of the wild west."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7cfd\"", "article_summary": "The Republican primary race unfolding in Wyoming between incumbent Sen.
