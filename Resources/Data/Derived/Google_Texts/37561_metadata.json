It is traditional for the Speaker to be escorted ''against their will'' to the chair by colleagues.\n\nMr Abbott, who has pointedly promised a ''measured and calm'' government, will also be hoping for less action in the Speaker's chair after the removal of Harry Jenkins and Peter Slipper's brief but controversial stint in the chair during the fractious 43rd Parliament.\n\nMs Bishop said: ''I certainly feel that the Parliament itself is entitled to have dignity returned to it. That doesn't mean it won't be a robust place, but it does mean that it will have a dignity that has been lacking in the last little while.''\n\nMeanwhile, Liberal Victorian Premier Denis Napthine has urged Mr Abbott to promote more women to the federal ministry, suggesting Victorian MPs Kelly O'Dwyer and former workforce participation minister Sharman Stone as worthy possible selections.\n\nIt is understood NSW senator Arthur Sinodinos will be promoted to cabinet in the finance role. However, the Australian Financial Review is reporting that Senator Sinodinos may be overlooked for the role in favour of Mathias Cormann.\n\nQueensland Senator Ian McDonald, who missed out on a frontbench seat, took to social media to express his disappointment, saying it was the ''worst day of his life''.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Political News", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Bronwyn Bishop has promised to preside over a more &quot;dignified&quot; Parliament from the Speaker's chair.", "title": "Bronwyn Bishop anointed new Speaker of the House", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bronwyn-bishop-anointed-new-speaker-of-the-house-20130915-2tsx9.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/2/t/s/x/q/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.2tsx9.png/1379282308720.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/2/t/s/x/q/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.2tsx9.png/1379282308720.jpg"}, "description": "Bronwyn Bishop has promised to preside over a more \"dignified\" Parliament from the Speaker's chair.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Bronwyn Bishop anointed new Speaker of the House"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Bronwyn Bishop has promised to preside over a more \"dignified\" Parliament from the Speaker's chair."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8aba\"", "article_summary": "Mr Abbott said his choice of Ms Bishop was about returning the floor of Parliament to a place of ''genuine debate''.\nMs Bishop said: ''I certainly feel that the Parliament itself is entitled to have dignity returned to it.\nBronwyn Bishop has promised to preside over a more ''dignified'' Parliament from the Speaker's chair.\nMs Bishop, who entered Parliament in 1987 and was twice a minister under John Howard, has accepted the role of Speaker of the House of Representatives after a personal request by incoming prime minister Tony Abbott.\nBronwyn Bishop."}
