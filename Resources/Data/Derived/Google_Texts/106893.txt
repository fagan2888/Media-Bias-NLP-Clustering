New information shows the sixth anniversary of ObamaCare may not be worth celebrating.





While the Obama administration has touted access to and quality of coverage, critics and consumers have raised concerns about higher premiums and deductibles.

Meanwhile, news outlets like Daily Signal are pointing to a decrease in insurer competition in almost half the states.

"From 2015 to 2016, you actually saw that in 22 states there was a decrease in the number of insurance companies selling plans on the exchanges," says Melissa Quinn, reporter for Daily Signal. "We know that the Obama administration has certainly praised the Affordable Care Act with providing more competition and more choice for consumers, but when you look at the insurance companies that are sticking with ObamaCare, those numbers seem to be falling."

Pointing to Alaska, Quinn says that state had one insurance company selling plans on the federal exchange.

"They use Healthcare.gov," Quinn says. "That means that when Alaska residents sign onto the website to purchase insurance, they can select from a number of actually plan options, but they only have one insurer that they can choose from."

Ten states did see an increase in insurer participation but more than that saw no change.

Meanwhile, the cost of Healthcare.gov remains anyone's guess.

"The Obama administration has not yet released a final figure for how much the construction of Healthcare.gov and then obviously the fixes to Healthcare.gov, how much that's going to cost taxpayers," explains Quinn.

"We can certainly estimate that it's between $800 million and $2.1 billion," she adds.

Quinn is drawing those figures from estimates according to Department of Health and Human Services Office of The Inspector General, HHS Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell, and Bloomberg Government.

Quinn says Bloomberg changed the parameters and "looked at the full-scope of the work."
