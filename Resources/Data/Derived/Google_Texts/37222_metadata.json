At issue: whether engineers can design a bike lane that minimally reduces the number of parking spaces churchgoers depend on.\n\nThe four-hour meeting inside a charter school\u2019s auditorium was attended by several hundred Shaw residents. It unfolded without the outrage and anger that marred the initial public meeting in October, when many African-American churchgoers accused the District Department of Transportation of trying to ram through the project against the community\u2019s wishes.\n\nOn Saturday, the gathering quietly listened to a DDOT presentation on four bike lane alternatives that remove varying numbers of parking spaces and provide from two to three-and-a-half miles of protection from vehicular traffic.\n\nThe October meeting also appeared to pit long-time black residents who commute by car against white newcomers who prefer bikes, but the reality is more complicated.\n\n\u201cI think there is more nuance in it than simply racial lines,\u201d said Carl Hickerson, the pastor of Springfield Baptist Church, which has been in Shaw 77 years.\n\n\u201cI think there is a healthy compromise we can come to,\u201d said Hickerson, who said he would support the project provided his church does not lose the on-street parking that has become scarcer as Shaw has gentrified. Some Shaw residents partly fault the loss of parking for the displacement of as many as 10 historic black churches.\n\nThe leaders of Hemingway Temple A.M.E. Church also have notified District officials of their possible support for a protected bike lane.\n\n\u201cFor everyone\u2019s benefit, the 2014 total of more than 50 people struck by motor vehicles in Shaw must be reduced to zero as we move forward. Separate protected facilities for cyclists keep them out of the way of motor vehicles. Reducing the width of the road makes them safer for pedestrians to walk across,\u201d said the Reverend Thann Young in a letter to Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and DDOT director Leif Dormsjo.\n\n\u201cOur congregation stands ready to support the needs of our community and neighbors now and in the future,\u201d said Rev. Young. Shiloh Baptist Church in Shaw is also open to supporting the District\u2019s plans to expand its network of protected bike lanes as part of the city\u2019s newly adopted goal of eliminating all traffic fatalities in the next decade.\n\n\u2019Our view has not changed\u2019\n\nBut United House of Prayer, one of the largest congregations and property owners in Shaw, remains against any bike lane proposal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let someone\u2019s pastime destroy our lifeline,\u201d said UHOP\u2019s Pastor Robert Price as he stood before the hundreds attending Sunday\u2019s meeting. \u201cOur view has not changed, but we come in peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe recommend no-build! Is that alright?\u201d Price asked the room. About half of those in attendance verbalized their approval.\n\nThe region\u2019s largest bike advocacy group, the Washington Area Bicyclist Association, also mobilized its supporters to attend the meeting. One of its board members, Martin Moulton, who is African American, sought to undermine the prevailing narrative of black churches vs. white newcomers.\n\n\u201cStudies show that many more people would ride bicycles if they felt safer doing so on roadways. Projects like this one we heard about today would create new recreation and transportation opportunities for people in this community,\u201d Moulton said.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Martin Di Caro", "og": {"site_name": "WAMU 88.5", "description": "The intense controversy surrounding the District\u2019s proposals to build a major north-south bike lane through the Shaw neighborhood took a civil turn on Saturday, as transportation officials held a publ", "title": "Three African-American Churches Open To Compromise On Shaw Bike Lane", "url": "http://wamu.org/news/16/02/07/three_african_american_churches_open_to_compromise_on_shaw_bike_lane", "image": "http://wamu.org/sites/wamu.org/files/styles/medium/public/images/attach/bikelane20160206.jpg?itok=KmB7AU-u", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 0, "nid": 215465, "google-site-verification": "8AyE7rFVyUE7ZiqFGJ29mxnUk_L6YMXe4KHsLRUvvmQ"}, "article_summary": "And although some large African-American churches remain adamantly opposed to constructing a traffic-protected bike lane through the historically black neighborhood, others are signaling willingness to compromise.\nAt issue: whether engineers can design a bike lane that minimally reduces the number of parking spaces churchgoers depend on.\n\u2019Our view has not changed\u2019But United House of Prayer, one of the largest congregations and property owners in Shaw, remains against any bike lane proposal.\nSome Shaw residents partly fault the loss of parking for the displacement of as many as 10 historic black churches.\nThe leaders of Hemingway Temple A.M.E.
