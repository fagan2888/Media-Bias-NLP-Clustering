Over the past few months, we have witnessed the hyperactive agency:\n\n\u2022 Attempt to expand its authority over virtually every puddle and stream in the nation;\n\n\u2022 Implement rules that could bankrupt an entire industry and allow Washington, D.C., to tell states what energy sources they can and cannot use; and, of course\n\n\u2022 Provide the awful spectacle of turning one of Colorado\u2019s most beautiful rivers the color of Tang.\n\nAnd these are just the EPA\u2019s activities that made headlines.\n\nSay what you will, the EPA is certainly ambitious. No sooner does it enact a new set of rules to broaden its micromanagement over state and local economies, than it is brainstorming over what impossible-to-achieve mandate it can inflict next.\n\nThe latest target of the EPA\u2019s bureaucratic fist is nothing less than the economy of two-thirds of the nation, including Colorado. This fall, the agency is expected slash the ground-level ozone cap from today\u2019s less-than-a-decade-old standard of 75 parts per billion to somewhere between 65 and 70 ppb. Four years ago, even President Obama rejected this idea, fearing widespread economic damage. Such trivial concerns don\u2019t discourage the EPA, however.\n\nHow will this impact Colorado? For starters, it will place much of the state \u2014 both on the Front Range and the Western Slope \u2014 out of attainment, in some cases for the first time ever. A recent report by the Center for Regulatory Solutions shows that 15 Colorado counties \u2014 comprising 89 percent of the state\u2019s GDP and 85 percent of its workforce \u2014 will, arbitrarily and overnight, be in violation of this new bureaucratic standard. That means the federal government will effectively hold veto power over any economic activity within those counties that might conceivably emit something \u2014 in other words, pretty much any activity that creates something of value and pays a decent wage.\n\nAs the CRS report explains, Colorado will be impacted not only through lost jobs and incomes, but under a lower standard, much needed transportation infrastructure projects also will be delayed or even denied. It will matter very little if we as a state figure out a new funding mechanism to provide for transportation projects. As long as the places where those projects are most needed are kept out of attainment by the EPA, they will be kept bound up in the ever-gestating supply of federal red tape. Contemplate that as you enjoy your commute on Interstate 25.\n\nOver the past several decades, Coloradans have made great strides toward improving air quality. We are at the point now where a considerable amount of the ozone being measured in the state is naturally occurring or drifting in from elsewhere \u2014 fires in Washington State, for instance, or, increasingly, from overseas. In fact, it is at the point where even the EPA has admitted that it has only identified one-third of the controls needed to achieve compliance with its own standards. The EPA is instituting standards it knows cannot be met, and threatening local economies if they are not.\n\nTo justify this agenda, the EPA and environmental groups repeatedly claim that they\u2019re trying to reduce asthma cases. Roger McClellan, a former chairman of the EPA\u2019s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, recently said this claim ignores more than a decade of public health data showing \u201casthma cases have increased by millions while ozone concentrations have declined.\u201d So how does attacking someone\u2019s source of income improve their health?\n\nThis is not a partisan issue. Elected officials at all levels and on both sides of the political spectrum recognize that, at least in this instance, the EPA is going too far. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado has said the proposal \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense on the ground.\u201d Gov. John Hickenlooper was recently reported saying that he is not convinced that setting up a standard that cannot be met is the right direction to take, and that he remains concerned that Colorado is at a natural disadvantage.\n\nHe is right to be concerned. No matter the extent or success of Colorado\u2019s own environmental initiatives, to the EPA it will never be enough. That begs the question: What might they do to us next?\n\nKelly Sloan is the energy policy fellow for the Centennial Institute, Colorado Christian University\u2019s Denver-based think tank.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No: Colorado will be hurt by new ozone cap", "title": "No: Colorado will be hurt by new ozone cap", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/18/no-colorado-will-be-hurt-by-new-ozone-cap/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150918__20150920_Z00_OP20P_SLOANp1.jpg", "height": 431}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150918__20150920_Z00_OP20P_SLOANp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-18T11:22:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T02:14:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The latest target of the EPA\u2019s bureaucratic fist is nothing less than the economy of two-thirds of the nation, including Colorado.\nThis fall, the agency is expected slash the ground-level ozone cap from today\u2019s less-than-a-decade-old standard of 75 parts per billion to somewhere between 65 and 70 ppb.\nKelly Sloan is the energy policy fellow for the Centennial Institute, Colorado Christian University\u2019s Denver-based think tank.\nTo justify this agenda, the EPA and environmental groups repeatedly claim that they\u2019re trying to reduce asthma cases.\nNo matter the extent or success of Colorado\u2019s own environmental initiatives, to the EPA it will never be enough."}
