He says at $200 Zuckerberg would overtake Bill Gates as the world's richest person \u2014 assuming all things stay the same as they are now. (De Jong was responding to a tweet from NYT columnist Farhad Manjoo.)\n\nFacebook's stock was trading at $76.20 this morning, so it needs to almost triple. Facebook's current market cap is $195.4 billion. If the stock went to $200, Facebook would be worth over $500 billion. For some comparison, Apple is currently valued at $580 billion.\n\nRelated: FBI\u2019s Billion Dollar Facial Recognition Falls Short of Facebook\u2019s\n\nCould Facebook do it? Can it reach $500+ billion?\n\nWhen Apple broke through the $500 billion barrier, it was doing ~$33 billion in annual profit which was a 15X price to earnings ratio. That's roughly in line with market as a whole over time. Price to earnings (P/E) is approximately how much an investor has to pay for $1 of earnings. It's a way to compare the value of stocks to each other.\n\nHowever, the better comparison for Facebook might be Google, which is a software/internet company. Apple is viewed as a hardware company, so it has a tougher P/E ratio. With a $401 billion market cap, Google has a P/E of 31, and earnings of ~$13 billion.\n\nFacebook currently has a P/E of 98, and its trailing 12-month profits are $1.91 billion.\n\nIf we use Google as a comparison, and Facebook's P/E eventually contracts to 31, then net income has to reach ~$16.1 billion, an ~8X increase from where it's at today. If we use Apple/the market then Facebook has to get its net income to $33 billion, which is 16X where it's at today.\n\nRelated: Why Facebook and Twitter Want Us to \u2018Buy Now\u2019\n\nCould Facebook get there? Certainly!\n\nFacebook has only scratched the surface of its potential. The core business' revenue is still growing at 61% on a year-over-year basis. It's sitting on Instagram, which could be another advertising juggernaut, and it then there's WhatsApp and Facebook messages. Plus there's Oculus and who knows what else Facebook can think of.\n\nSo, while it may not be his goal in life, Mark Zuckerberg can very conceivably become the richest man in the world.\n\nThis article originally appeared at Business Insider.\n\nRead more at Business Insider:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "We doubt this is Mark Zuckerberg's goal in life, but if he wanted to be the richest ma", "title": "How Zuckerberg Could Become the Richest Person on the Planet", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/24/How-Zuckerberg-Could-Become-Richest-Person-Planet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/07202012_rich_Mark_Zuckerberg_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/24/How-Zuckerberg-Could-Become-Richest-Person-Planet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/07202012_rich_Mark_Zuckerberg_slideshow.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "We doubt this is Mark Zuckerberg's goal in life, but if he wanted to be the richest ma", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc855\"", "article_summary": "He says at $200 Zuckerberg would overtake Bill Gates as the world's richest person \u2014 assuming all things stay the same as they are now.\nPrice to earnings (P/E) is approximately how much an investor has to pay for $1 of earnings.\nFacebook's stock was trading at $76.20 this morning, so it needs to almost triple.\nSo, while it may not be his goal in life, Mark Zuckerberg can very conceivably become the richest man in the world.\nWe doubt this is Mark Zuckerberg's goal in life, but if he wanted to be the richest man in the world Facebook's stock has to go to $200."}
