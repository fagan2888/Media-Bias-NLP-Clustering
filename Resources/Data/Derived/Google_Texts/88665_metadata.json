Sheld said some aspects of the poll were worse for McConnell than it was for Boehner because McConnell was less popular than the outgoing House Speaker.\n\n\u201cIf I were McConnell, I would be careful right now,\u201d Sheld told host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125.\n\nAs Republicans search for a new Speaker in the coming weeks, there may be more pressure put on McConnell from grassroots conservatives who have been fed up with a Republican leadership that too often ignores their concerns. Already, Louisiana Governor and 2016 GOP presidential candidate Bobby Jindal has called on McConnell to resign. So has Roger Villere, the Louisiana GOP Chairman and Republican National Committee\u2019s vice chairman, who said that McConnell is hurting Republicans \u201ctremendously with our elections.\u201d\n\nSheld said the poll also found that voters believe the Republican leadership is more interested in doing the bidding of the Chamber of Commerce, corporations and lobbyists than standing up for for the rank and file GOP voter. And the poll found that two-thirds of Americans believed that Washington in general is more responsive to to lobbyists, big businesses, and special interests than the average Joe.\n\nShe also mentioned that the poll showed that Americans are not buying the litany of excuses the GOP establishment has made since 2010\u2013like not having the presidency\u2013for not fighting for what they promised on the campaign trail.\n\nSheld pointed out that when Democrats did not control the presidency or Congress, \u201cthey managed to make some progress on their front\u201d and fought for their principles. She said Republicans should have at least tried to stand firm against defunding Obama\u2019s executive amnesty and repealing Obamacare instead of not even trying because \u201cObama will never sign it.\u201d In the poll, 64% of respondents answered, \u201cI am disappointed with the performance of the Republican leadership in Congress, they are not living up to their promises on issues like immigration and Obamacare, upon which they were elected\u201d\n\nSheld said voters are tired of a GOP leadership that doesn\u2019t bother to put up a fight against Obama\u2019s agenda and she mentioned that though Republicans regained control of Congress by running against Obamacare and Obama\u2019s executive amnesty, the GOP leadership decided the day after wining the 2014 midterm elections that \u201cwe can\u2019t do anything because Obama is the President.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Top GOP Pollster: McConnell Better Be Careful Because He's More Unpopular than Boehner", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Top GOP Pollster: McConnell Better Be Careful Because He's More Unpopular than Boehner", "title": "Top GOP Pollster: McConnell Better Be Careful Because He's More Unpopular than Boehner - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3000, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/ap_mitch-mcconnell_ap-photo3.jpg", "height": 2394}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/05/top-gop-pollster-mcconnell-better-be-careful-because-hes-more-unpopular-than-boehner/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Top GOP Pollster: McConnell Better Be Careful Because He's More Unpopular than Boehner", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/ap_mitch-mcconnell_ap-photo3.jpg", "title": "Top GOP Pollster: McConnell Better Be Careful Because He's More Unpopular than Boehner - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-10-05T04:12:09-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Sheld said some aspects of the poll were worse for McConnell than it was for Boehner because McConnell was less popular than the outgoing House Speaker.\nAlready, Louisiana Governor and 2016 GOP presidential candidate Bobby Jindal has called on McConnell to resign.\n\u201cIf I were McConnell, I would be careful right now,\u201d Sheld told host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K.
