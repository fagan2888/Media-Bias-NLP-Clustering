Cruz\u2019 remarks came one day after his potential GOP presidential rival, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, endorsed Common Core.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCruz described Common Core as \u201cnational standards being dictated from Washington\u201d during an appearance at the influential anti-tax Club for Growth\u2019s annual winter meeting in Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday, February 27, ABC News reported.\n\n\u201cThere is no remedy when they are dictating what\u2019s being taught to your kids,\u201d said the Senator. His comments stood in stark contrast to those from Bush, who told the same group that the education goals would help more students be prepared for college or better jobs, also according to ABC News.\n\nBreitbart News reported that at the annual suburban Washington, DC-held Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Bush stood by his support for Common Core. He claimed that the standards were not a federal government takeover of education.\n\nCruz, on the other hand, has been consistently and emphatically opposed to the Common Core. He is also the lead cosponsor of the Enhancing Educational Opportunities for All Act, a measure introduced by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) that hopes to expand school choice, Breitbart News reported.\n\nOn February 21, Cruz appeared on Shark Tank where he spoke out against Big Education. He said \u201cIt is wrong and we need to stand up against Common Core and stop it.\u201d\n\nThe popular conservative US senator from Texas emphasized that \u201ceducation is far too important for it to be controlled by unelected bureaucrats in Washington,\u201d while pointing to his own young daughters Caroline, 6, and Catherine, 4. The Senator said he understood how other parents felt about their children\u2019s schooling, commenting that education \u201cneeds to be at the state level or the local level where we as parents have direct control over the standards, over the mores, over the curriculum that is being taught to our kids.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cCommon Core is being used by the federal government as a mechanism to force a uniform curriculum, to put federal bureaucrats in charge of what is taught to our kids.\u201d\n\nCruz believed that the only way to stop Common Core, or even change the direction of the United States from the lawless path it is currently on under the Obama administration, may rest with the grassroots. He reiterated a comment he has said before, \u201cIf we look to Washington for the solution, these problems will not be solved.\u201d Soberingly, he stated, \u201cWashington is fundamentally broken.\u201d\n\nCruz pointed out that part of the reason why the Stop Common Core movement has gained so much momentum is because \u201ca whole bunch of Republicans joined with a whole bunch of Democrats (who) agree that the federal government shouldn\u2019t stick its nose in the middle of education.\u201d\n\nThe Senator added that the biggest divide in America today isn\u2019t between Americans in the two political parties. But rather, he said it is between career politicians in both parties and the American people. He suggested that the only way to reverse Common Core is for grassroots movements all over this country to rise up and say \u2018enough is enough.\u201d He said constituents should be holding their elected officials accountable \u2014 Republican and Democrat.\n\nDuring the Shark Tank interview, Cruz drew parallels between presidents Carter and Obama, alluding to another time in history when a grassroots movement arose out of frustration with leadership and the direction of the nation. He was referring to the Reagan Revolution.\n\nThe controversial Common Core standards are often positioned by supporters as voluntary and state led. The federal government\u2019s role; however, has been central to the implementation of standards that have been nicknamed \u201cObamacare for Education,\u201d which Breitbart California reported.\n\nLast year, Cruz expressed his opposition to the federal education standards following an event for the Network of Iowa Christian Home Educators, Breitbart News reported. At that time, he called school choice the \u201ccivil rights issue of the 21st Century.\u201d\n\nCruz, is one on the lengthy list of 2016 potential GOP presidential candidates that includes Bush, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, Dr. Ben Carson, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul (R-KY).\n\nFollow Merrill Hope on Twitter @OutOfTheBoxMom.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senator Cruz spoke out against Common Core during a speech to a Florida conservative group. \"We should repeal every word of Common Core.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Senator Cruz spoke out against Common Core during a speech to a Florida conservative group. \"We should repeal every word of Common Core.\"", "title": "Ted Cruz: 'We Should Repeal Every Word of Common Core'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2358, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Ted-Cruz-with-Flag.jpg", "height": 1743}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/02/28/ted-cruz-we-should-repeal-every-word-of-common-core/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senator Cruz spoke out against Common Core during a speech to a Florida conservative group. \"We should repeal every word of Common Core.\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Ted-Cruz-with-Flag.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz: 'We Should Repeal Every Word of Common Core'", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 Republican Presidential Primary, Common Core, CPAC 2015, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz,Breitbart Texas,Common Core", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-02-28T09:09:03-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe203b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe should repeal every word of Common Core,\u201d he said.\nThe controversial Common Core standards are often positioned by supporters as voluntary and state led.\nCruz\u2019 remarks came one day after his potential GOP presidential rival, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, endorsed Common Core.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSenator Ted Cruz spoke out against Common Core during a speech to a Florida conservative organization.\nBreitbart News reported that at the annual suburban Washington, DC-held Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Bush stood by his support for Common Core."}
