This is the year you\u2019re finally going to get it together and start your holiday shopping early. Sure you will \u2014 right after you finish binge-watching Season 2 of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d How are you supposed to go shopping on Thursday night when the Shonda-verse is on, anyway? And have you even finished any of the National Book Award finalists? Don\u2019t worry. From the boy-crazy tween in your life to your sorta-still-hip dad, the Salon Gift Guide rounds up the best presents for your friends and family \u2014 real and imaginary, human and humanoid, heroes and villains alike.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s been carrying those treasured old mix tapes around for years. Upgrade all of his favorite mixes onto one Cassette Tape 8 GB USB Stick ($25).\n\nWhat overgrown kid doesn\u2019t like a good widget? The Orbotix Ollie ($99.99), a remote app-controlled cylinder on wheels, might not get him out of showdowns with scavengers, but it can do tricks at speeds up to 14 mph.\n\nHe\u2019ll find a kindred spirit in eternal poptimist Rob Sheffield, whose sequel to his heartbreaking memoir \u201cLove Is a Mix Tape\u201d embraces the life-changing virtues of barroom belting in \u201cTurn Around Bright Eyes: A Karaoke Journey of Starting Over, Falling in Love, and Finding Your Voice\u201d ($10 paperback).\n\nEven heroes have to have someone to look up to. These Stark Expo replica prints ($59, set of three) \u2014 full-scale replicas printed from original Marvel \u201cIron Man 2\u201d film files \u2014 are a retro-chic nod to his favorite fellow superhero.\n\n\n\nFrom advice she needs to hear to encouragement we can all use, Amy Poehler\u2019s \u201cYes Please\u201d ($17, hardcover) is a simple gift for a complicated girl.\n\nThe Ban.do canvas heart tote ($20) is the next best thing to wearing her heart on her sleeve.\n\nWhen she\u2019s brave, she admits she wants to be a writer. Help her figure out what kind of writing family she wants to create with Lori A. May\u2019s \u201cThe Write Crowd: Literary Citizenship and the Writing Life\u201d ($17, paperback), a collection of best practices for connecting with the writing community.\n\nThose A-line retro-chic sundresses she likes never go out of style. The Out on the Veranda teal dress from Modcloth ($54) works for daytime doctor visits or navigating awkward love-triangle moment and increasingly-complex family gatherings.\n\n\n\nThe skulls and crown gothic microprint on this Diesel Zava button-down shirt ($148) works for long days at the office, relaxing at home, and taking off before tough conversations with his son.\n\nThe new paperback edition of the compelling Richard Pryor biography \u201cFurious Cool: Richard Pryor and the World That Made Him\u201d ($13) makes a great stocking stuffer and a handy teaching tool.\n\nBecause he loves taking credit for doing basic chores. The Picnic at Ascot BBQ Master Grill Tool Set ($83) includes 20 stainless steel grill tools inside a spy-worthy briefcase.\n\nHe has to have all the new toys \u2014 we mean tools \u2014 to stay current at work. The new Apple iPad Air2 (from $499) is thinner and lighter than his old model with better resolution. Touch ID security technology means the kids can\u2019t take it over.\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s going to need a drink at the end of a winter finale like that one. The Sparq Home Vodka Shooter set ($34) includes four freezable soapstone 2-ounce glasses so her drink never gets warm.\n\nDoes it sometimes seem like she must have eyes in the back of her head? Google Glass Explorer Edition ($1,500) will let her add to her encyclopedic knowledge without even opening a file.\n\nIn the courtroom or the classroom, her style is always on point. Don\u2019t let a plastic fitness bracelet ruin her look. The Tory Burch rose metal bracelet ($195) hides a discreet Fitbit Flex tracker ($99) inside.\n\nThese Vince Camuto stiletto ankle boots ($139) were made for walking right out of this old fight and into the arms of another man.\n\n\n\nIf you need her, she\u2019ll be down here on the floor dying. Or losing herself in the latest sexy dance-fighting videos and e-book romances on the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 ($379).\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly erotic friend fan fiction, but she\u2019ll love Mallory Ortberg\u2019s irreverent literary satire \u201cTexts From Jane Eyre\u201d ($14, hardcover) just the same.\n\nTime for the charm bomb to explode \u2014 she\u2019ll be ready with the Lush Bubble Gum Lip Scrub ($22) and Honey Trap Lip Balm ($16), and Jimmy Jr. won\u2019t know what hit him.\n\nOne day, she\u2019ll look back at all of this angst, and groan at the memories. Until then, let her record her biggest humiliations in this Letters to My Future Self ($12) set, which functions as diary, keepsake and blackmail material for her little siblings.\n\n\n\nNothing will top his own \u201cTrace Italian,\u201d but the 4-D Cityscape puzzle of Westeros ($37), the imaginary lands of George R.R. Martin\u2019s (and HBO\u2019s) \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d will let him literally build a world out of scattered pieces.\n\nThe Rubik\u2019s Futuro Cube ($79) takes the enigmatic puzzle game of his youth and updates it with multi-axis accelerometers, vibration feedback, wireless connectivity, multicolor LED lights and four-channel audio. The cube comes with 12 built-in games, and a customizable software package is coming soon.\n\nThe complete set of all 40 of the original Choose Your Own Adventure books ($200) by R.A. Montgomery, where we first learn that you either go forward or you die (and sometimes, if you choose the wrong way out of the shark tank, you still die).\n\nBefore there was metal, there was Zeppelin. Like all of Led Zeppelin\u2019s newly remastered Super Deluxe Edition box sets, Led Zeppelin IV ($104) includes the original on CD, digital download and 180-gram vinyl with replicated original packaging, plus bonus tracks like alternate takes, instrumentals and live recordings.\n\n\n\nHe loves long drives around Detroit and can\u2019t bear to touch too much of the world. Dents of London has made leather gloves since 1777. If anyone can appreciate the long life and high style of a pair of Dent leather driving gloves ($75), he can.\n\nLet him pack a meal of the good Type O-negative for the road in the Woodchuck flask ($39), made of stainless steel with a 100 percent real wood exterior.\n\nHe\u2019s been wearing those old aviator shades since the last time you two left London. Carrera Eyewear\u2019s Hots 64mm Aviators ($120) will bring him into the new century.\n\nExclusively from Jack White\u2019s Third Man Records, \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Paramount Records, Volume Two\u201d ($400) is this year\u2019s music fan must-have gift. In six LPs, 800 digital tracks and two large-format books, Paramount\u2019s pioneering Delta blues recordings (1928-32) will scratch his history itch and teach him some new old songs.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s going to protect the boss or die trying. And he\u2019s going to need a fresh tie if he\u2019s going to go straight into tomorrow\u2019s meeting. Emma Willis\u2019 refined Leaf-Print Silk Tie ($185) is elegant enough to see him through whatever the next day brings.\n\nYou\u2019ve noticed that he\u2019s really into audiobooks these days. Replace his worn-out earbuds with a set of featherweight Polk Audio Nue Era headphones ($79) in stylish tortoiseshell.\n\nSometimes, for his job, he has to put fear into other people. Make sure he stays hydrated on those cross-country flights with the Define Bottle ($24). The fruit infusions should help him lay off that bad meeting coffee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A heart tote for Jane the Virgin?
