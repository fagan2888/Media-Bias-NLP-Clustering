U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta endorsed Donald Trump for president Tuesday in an interview with WMUR.

Guinta, a two-term Republican running in a swing district, said Trump is seen as a “different and refreshing” candidate who is bringing new faces into the party.

“I want to lead and let people know in New Hampshire that I think given the choices our country faces between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, I think Donald Trump is the better alternative,” the 1st Congressional District Republican told WMUR.

Guinta said the priorities on which he hopes to work with Trump are growing the economy, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, addressing the heroin crisis and improving services for veterans.

In the interview, Guinta declined to support Trump’s controversial call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.

Guinta will have at least one Republican challenger in the primary for the 1st Congressional District in businessman Rich Ashooh.

Ashooh hasn’t made an endorsement in the presidential race, his campaign manager, Dante Vitagliano, said Tuesday.

Carol Shea-Porter, the three-term 1st District Democrat who is running again this year, has endorsed Hillary Clinton for the presidency. Her primary challenger, businessman Shawn O’Connor, endorsed Bernie Sanders.
