They claim the measure will serve to empower the NSA just months after its authority was curbed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing battle and this is a major step backwards from the progress we\u2019ve been making,\u201d Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.), a leading privacy voice on Capitol Hill, told The Hill shortly after the spending bill passed.\n\nThe two bills, pushing in different directions, are emblematic of 2015 in general. Privacy activists, who have seen swathes of the public grow skeptical of intelligence agencies\u2019 broad spying powers, have been unable to score the kind of wide-ranging and irreversible changes that they seek.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve ended the NSA bulk collection. I consider that to be a win,\u201d Rep. Blake Farenthold Blake FarentholdOvernight Cybersecurity: House to offer bill on government hacking powers Five problems, five bipartisan solutions to advance the tech economy House to offer bill blocking government hacking powers MORE (R-Texas), are prominent voice on civil liberties issues, told The Hill this month. \u201cBut you always have the security hawks saying \u2018The more information the government has, the better the battle on terrorism goes.\u2019 I believe the more information the government has, especially about American citizens, the less freedom we have.\u201d\n\nSome digital rights advocates worry that passage of the cyber bill \u2014 which encourages companies to share more data on hacking threats with the government \u2014 represents a troubling momentum swing after several years of smaller, incremental gains.\n\nA rash of data breaches and the recent terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., have given new urgency to previously muted calls for increased access to digital data.\n\n\u201cWe do need to protect ourselves,\u201d Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), a lawmaker who often focuses on tech issues, told The Hill. \u201cThere\u2019s not an argument about that. We also need to protect the Constitution. Those two are not mutually exclusive.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, government leaker Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosure of secret NSA spying programs kicked off an intense, nationwide discussion of government surveillance that gave privacy advocates enormous political capital.\n\nThis summer\u2019s passage of the surveillance reform bill, known as the USA Freedom Act, was one product of that discussion.\n\nThe measure axed the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records, which Snowden first revealed.\n\nUnder a new program that went into effect in late November, the NSA will have to go to private phone companies to request a narrow set of \u201cmetadata\u201d records about a suspect, instead of indiscriminately gathering millions of Americans\u2019 information and looking for individual suspects later.\n\n\n\nThe USA Freedom Act had an unusual combination of winds at its back \u2014 good timing, favorable politics and sympathetic public sentiment \u2014 and these helped push it through Congress.\n\nEven with all of that, passage of the bill only came at the last moment, aided by a legal deadline demanding that lawmakers either address the program or let it die. Hawkish Republicans were obliged to accept reforms rather than risk the law expiring for good.\n\nThe cyber bill, by contrast, was tucked into the massive omnibus spending bill that floated through Congress on the last day of its legislative calendar.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s revealing that it was jammed in here by the Republican leadership, because they couldn't actually pass it on its own,\u201d Lofgren said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s really a black mark on the Republican Party that they would stain the Constitution in this way.\u201d\n\nMany others don\u2019t see it that way. Industry groups, lawmakers in both parties and the White House hail the so-called Cybersecurity Act of 2015 as a much-needed tool to enable information about hacking threats to be shared. They point to the solid bipartisan majorities that approved the three individual bills that were ultimately merged into the final legislation.\n\nPrivacy advocates fear their loss in December was yet another example of Congress\u2019s propensity to increase national security powers in the wake of new anxieties about terrorism.\n\n\u201cI noticed early on up here that members of Congress are more concerned about what\u2019s in the news tonight than what\u2019s going to be in the news in five or 10 years,\u201d Farenthold said. \u201cI think the country would be better served if we sometimes stepped back and considered what\u2019s going to be in the news 10 years down the road.\u201d\n\nStill, digital rights groups insist their agenda is far from dead.\n\nEven if privacy advocates\u2019 progress on Capitol Hill has had a stutter-step quality, privacy backers point to victories elsewhere as proof that the national conversation has changed since Snowden\u2019s leaks.\n\nEncryption applications, which secure people\u2019s data from hackers and spies, have proliferated in recent years.\n\nDespite pushback from national security officials, who warn that the technology allows terrorists and criminals to \u201cgo dark,\u201d the White House has decided \u2014 for now \u2014 against new legislation to outlaw strong encryption or force companies to give the government a \u201cbackdoor.\u201d\n\nAnd this summer, the Justice Department released new guidance restricting the use of cellphone tracking devices known as stingrays, which have been used by at least 13 federal agencies and 23 states.\n\nPrivacy activists also see several opportunities for wins on the horizon.\n\nIn coming weeks, U.S. and European officials are hoping to finalize a new agreement allowing American companies to deal with Europeans\u2019 data under the continent\u2019s more stringent privacy rules. And in 2017, lawmakers will have to reevaluate portions of national security law that authorize the NSA\u2019s controversial \u201cUpstream\u201d and \u201cPRISM\u201d programs, which collect vast amounts of data about foreigners abroad, as well as some data on Americans.\n\n\u201cIn the pendulum analogy, everyone says after Snowden it swung really far one way and now it\u2019s starting to swing back the other way,\u201d said Nathan White, the senior legislative manager with digital rights group Access Now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to swing back as far as people think.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to go back to October 2001, when they passed the Patriot Act,\u201d White added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go back to maybe October 2008, when people were still really concerned about these issues, but also willing to balance and consider real threats versus real privacy concerns.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Terror attacks in France and California could lead to broader surveillance measures", "description": "Terror attacks in France and California could lead to broader surveillance measures", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett and Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Terror attacks in France and California could lead to broader surveillance measures", "title": "Privacy activists notched wins in 2015 but fear shift in tide", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/264208-privacy-activists-notched-wins-in-2015-but-fear-shift-in-tide", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/polisjared_060513aw.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-02T09:10:53-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-02T09:10-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/264208-privacy-activists-notched-wins-in-2015-but-fear-shift-in-tide", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-02T09:10-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Niall Stanage", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Civil liberties, Privacy, Surveillance, government surveillance, spying,Jared Polis, Zoe Lofgren, Blake Farenthold, Edward Snowden,National Security Agency", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-02T09:10:56-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-02T09:10:53-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/264208-privacy-activists-notched-wins-in-2015-but-fear-shift-in-tide", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Terror attacks in France and California could lead to broader surveillance measures", "card": "summary", "title": "Privacy activists notched wins in 2015 but fear shift in tide"}, "dcterms.title": "Privacy activists notched wins in 2015 but fear shift in tide"}, "article_summary": "Privacy advocates fear their loss in December was yet another example of Congress\u2019s propensity to increase national security powers in the wake of new anxieties about terrorism.\nCivil libertarians took one step forward this summer, reforming the National Security Agency (NSA) in the first major rollback of U.S. surveillance powers in a generation.\n2015 was a mixed bag for digital privacy advocates on Capitol Hill.\nPrivacy activists also see several opportunities for wins on the horizon.\nThey claim the measure will serve to empower the NSA just months after its authority was curbed."}
