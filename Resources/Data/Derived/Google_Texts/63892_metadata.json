(AP) - If America really is a melting pot, then places like the corner of Quioccasin Road and Blue Jay Lane in western Henrico County are the hot, bubbly center of our national fondue.\n\nIt isn\u2019t much to look at, as intersections go - mostly a cluster of aging strip malls straddling the intersection of a small side street and a busy four-lane road.\n\nBut, tucked between an ailing mall and several apartment complexes, largely surrounded by neighborhoods of modest, well-kept homes, the place is a magnet for ethnic food.\n\nWant rolled salted watermelon seeds, masala spice mix for fish, a beef-tongue taco, Balkan dry goods, fresh tortillas, homemade hummus or Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica, a Brazilian soda pop? Look no further.\n\n\u201cWe just love it, because we are just one of them,\u201d said Fernanda Peres, co-owner of Cantinho Do Brasil, a restaurant in one of the shopping centers. \u201cBecause America is like, everywhere you go, you meet different people.\u201d\n\nThe establishments include a mix of small grocery stores and restaurants. Stores carry Latin American, European, Indian-Nepali and Middle Eastern goods. There are a tortilleria and restaurants serving Mexican, Greek-Italian, Brazilian and Middle Eastern cuisine.\n\nSeveral establishments in the area are both restaurants and stores. The Cantinho, for example, has a buffet and a small corner devoted to Brazilian brands. The family hopes to add traditional Brazilian barbecue, with rotating spits of meat.\n\nThe corner is a place where immigrants and others can buy candles for an upcoming festival of lights, fill grocery lists written in Arabic and, in some cases, hear the language they grew up with.\n\nOn a recent Tuesday afternoon, Falcon Fittipaldi and Weleton Goncalves, both native Brazilians, lingered in the restaurant as the last weekend\u2019s Luxembourg-Spain soccer match replayed on the TV.\n\n\u201cI just come here because I can see the Brazilian people and (eat) good food and meet somebody to talk to,\u201d Fittipaldi said.\n\nThe establishments on the corner draw a wide range of customers. That, of course, includes immigrants - local business owners said the nearby apartments are popular with new arrivals.\n\nBut at the Mediterranean Bakery and Deli, across the street from the Cantinho, customers include not just Middle Eastern immigrants, but also Americans looking to try something new and military veterans who developed a taste for the region\u2019s cuisine while serving abroad, said Saba Abed, a Palestinian immigrant who runs the deli and market with her husband and son.\n\nThere\u2019s a great deal of ethnic diversity among the employees, too.\n\nTrak\u2019s, a Greek and Italian restaurant, is run by an Egyptian family who recently took over from the Egyptian family that started the restaurant. The women helping Peres\u2019 father in the kitchen at Cantinho do Brasil are Honduran. And the Mediterranean Bakery and Deli cooks recipes that come from everywhere from Bosnia to Lebanon.\n\nShopping in the area can require a little linguistic goodwill. Many of the employees speak fluent English, but some don\u2019t.\n\nFor example, when Peres\u2019 father - who speaks Portuguese but not English - is manning the counter at the Brazilian restaurant, English-speaking customers get by with gestures and a few simple words. It usually ends up being something like: \u201cHey, Papa - fish,\u201d she said.\n\nAlmost all of the establishments are family businesses, and it isn\u2019t uncommon at some of the places to walk in and find a knee-high youngster or two playing in the corner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a family restaurant, and we are welcoming everybody,\u201d said Sam Hanna, co-owner of Trak\u2019s.\n\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s the food. It\u2019s frequently very authentic, and almost always homemade.\n\nAt the Mediterranean Bakery and Deli, Abed said, mujadara, a meatless dish of lentils, rice and saut\u00e9ed onions, is a customer favorite, even at catered parties.\n\n\u201cBack in Palestine, it was like the poor man\u2019s meat,\u201d she said, \u201cbut here, it\u2019s the sophisticated people\u2019s food.\u201d\n\nThe families behind the restaurants and shops took different paths to their businesses. Peres met her husband, who had also come to American from Brazil, in the Richmond area, she said.\n\n\u201cHe was from Seattle, and I was from Texas, so we kind of met in the middle,\u201d she said.\n\nThe couple also have a construction company and, when they can find time, flip houses, but had always had the idea of opening a restaurant, spurred on by Peres\u2019 father\u2019s history - he ran a small caf\u00e9 selling boxed lunches for workers back in Brazil.\n\nWhen they saw the chance, they took over the space off Quioccasin, where another Brazilian restaurant had closed.\n\nGopal Gurung, co-owner of Gurung Brothers Store, came to the country as a refugee. His family was Nepali but moved generations ago to nearby Bhutan to work, along with many others, he said. They were subsequently forced out, and Gurung lived in a camp in Nepal as a refugee before coming to America.\n\nThe Abed family had a history of men coming to America to work before Jameel Abed married Saba Abed and brought her here.\n\nThey bought a business that was, at the time, principally a pita bakery on Horsepen Road. They have expanded the menu through the years, adding deli items.\n\nNow, they do not bake any pita, but do a brisk lunch business in prepared foods. And when they had to leave the space on Horsepen, they bought a defunct Boston Market building on Quioccasin.\n\n\u201cSo now, nobody can kick us out anymore,\u201d Saba Abed said with laugh.\n\nHanna, of Trak\u2019s, was trained as a chemist in Egypt and came to America on a lottery visa. He has done everything from run a Subway restaurant to work in environmental protection in New York. He moved to Virginia to better take care of his family and ended up buying Trak\u2019s from a family at his church.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been working, thanks (to) God,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Richmond Times-Dispatch, http://www.timesdispatch.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "If America really is a melting pot, then places like the corner of Quioccasin Road and Blue Jay Lane in western Henrico County are the hot, bubbly center of our national fondue.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "If America really is a melting pot, then places like the corner of Quioccasin Road and Blue Jay Lane in western Henrico County are the hot, bubbly center of our national fondue.", "title": "Ethnic foods thrive in Henrico restaurants", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/25/ethnic-foods-thrive-in-henrico-restaurants/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/25/c8c6c788b27e5a29630f6a70670034d7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/25/c8c6c788b27e5a29630f6a70670034d7.jpg", "description": "If America really is a melting pot, then places like the corner of Quioccasin Road and Blue Jay Lane in western Henrico County are the hot, bubbly center of our national fondue.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Ethnic foods thrive in Henrico restaurants"}, "Author": "TED STRONG", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2756\"", "article_summary": "The Abed family had a history of men coming to America to work before Jameel Abed married Saba Abed and brought her here.\nWhen they saw the chance, they took over the space off Quioccasin, where another Brazilian restaurant had closed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a family restaurant, and we are welcoming everybody,\u201d said Sam Hanna, co-owner of Trak\u2019s.\nAt the Mediterranean Bakery and Deli, Abed said, mujadara, a meatless dish of lentils, rice and saut\u00e9ed onions, is a customer favorite, even at catered parties.\n\u201cBecause America is like, everywhere you go, you meet different people.\u201dThe establishments include a mix of small grocery stores and restaurants."}
