Beruff’s a buffoon

Editor: I’m writing in response to this TV ad about Carlos Beruff, a candidate for the U.S. Senate.

His statements make about as much sense as Jethro Bodine or Sonny Drysdale of “The Beverly Hillbillies.”

Beruff attacks affordable health care because it took a black president to implement a health care program which was written by the Republican “eight” (including Rubio and Boehner), which, I know, Beruff did not know because if he did, he would not make the uneducated statements in his ad. President Obama has gotten this country back to where it needs to be. The economy is peaking, unemployment is at its lowest point in 10 years, minimum wage is escalating, jobs are at an all-time high. The Affordable Care Act has benefitted billions positively.

Beruff sounds like the racist Donald Trump by being a liar and divisive.

One thing Obama has done is force the Duval and St. Johns County racists to identify themselves without the hood or confederate flags.

We all are the same, but we all do not have the same opportunities. God bless everyone.

Stop hate, and love everyone.
