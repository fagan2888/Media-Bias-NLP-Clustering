Mark another goal off the dwindling checklist of things to accomplish for Grainger High School standout Zach Long.

The senior placed third Saturday in the 36th annual Foot Locker South Regional cross country championship at McAlpine Park in Charlotte, N.C.

The top-10 finish earned Long, a University of Tennessee signee, a trip to the Foot Locker nationals on Dec. 13 at Balboa Park in San Diego.

"I was just trying to get in the top 10," said Long, who won the state Class A/AA championship earlier this month in Nashville.

"Coming in third was a huge surprise," said Long. "I don't think I was even predicted to be in the top 30 before the race."

Long averaged 4 minutes and 49 seconds per mile on his way to finishing the 5K course in 14 minutes, 58 seconds.

His time was a personal best by a whopping 23 seconds.

Long trailed only Andrew Horton (14:36) of Virginia and Carter Blunt (14:54) of Texas in the field of 287 elite runners from across the south.

Long said he felt strong throughout the race.

"I was in 15th place at the mile mark. In the second mile I broke into the top 10 and made it up to sixth," Long said. "I picked off three more runners down the stretch to make it to third."

Long now hopes to close out his high school career with a bang in San Diego in two weeks.

"I've got one more race to go ? it's really exciting," said Long. "There are 40 guys there and my goal is to finish in the top 15 and make the All-American team."

Several other area runners had strong showings Saturday.

The Catholic tandem of Joe Bindner (15:25) and Jonathan Chavez (15:28) placed 20th and 24th, respectively.

Other area runners to finish in the top 100 were Hardin Valley's Dartanian Oakley (15:46) in 56th and Oak Ridge's Wesley Robinson (15:57) in 82nd.

Webb's Peighton Meske (30th, 18:01) was the top area finisher in the girls race.

North Carolina's Ryen Frazier won in 16:27.

Other area runners to finish in the top 100 were Megan Murray (53rd, 18:19) of West and Rebecca Story (79th, 18:37) of Christian Academy of Knoxville.

Another area cross country program made its mark Saturday at the Nike Cross Nationals Southeast Regional in Cary, N.C.

The state Class AAA champion Morristown West girls, led by Cherie Wilson (36th, 18:30.7), placed five runners in the top 100.

Makenzie Jones (18:33.5) was 39th, Chantal Wilson (18:50.7) 65th, Elizabeth Liposky (19:03.5) 81st and Maggie Layer (19:12) 88th.

Adam Barnard of Daniel Boone won the boys race in 14:44.
