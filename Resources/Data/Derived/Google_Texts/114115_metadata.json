The foundation said that was \u201cactually a lower percentage than is common for high-volume regulatory dockets.\u201d\n\nIn highly debated federal rule-making processes like those involving the Keystone pipeline or the Affordable Care Act, often more than 80 percent of comments come in form-letter format.\n\n\u201cTypically we see a rule-making dominated by a few organized letter-writing campaigns,\u201d said Andrew Pendleton, who co-wrote the Sunlight study with Bob Lannon. \u201cA lot of people in this instance wrote a comment for themselves,\u201d he said, probably spurred by the debate\u2019s seeping into mass media, as net neutrality did with a segment on HBO\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight With John Oliver.\u201d\n\nOver all, the comments studied were overwhelmingly one-sided. Less than 1 percent were clearly opposed to net neutrality. And about 5 percent had anti-regulation messages, although those included seemingly contradictory camps, one calling for consumer freedom and another advocating freedom for Internet service providers.\n\nThe F.C.C. data studied by the foundation was released on Aug. 5, two weeks after the initial deadline for comments. There was a second comment period, however, which ended Monday, and there is a good chance that a greater portion of anti-net-neutrality comments came in as organizers opposed to new regulations learned something from the efforts of their rivals.\n\nThere are, of course, gray areas in any such analysis. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note,\u201d the authors said, that while 1 percent of the input was clearly opposed to net neutrality, \u201cthe remaining 99 percent of comments include both comments supporting net neutrality and comments with no clear position on net neutrality, such as the full text of \u2018War and Peace.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140918163634, "BN": "bits", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "technology/bits", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/bits/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 18, 2014", "org": "Federal Communications Commission", "keywords": "Net Neutrality,Regulation and Deregulation of Industry,Federal Communications Commission,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/bits/Net Neutrality Comments to F.C.C.
