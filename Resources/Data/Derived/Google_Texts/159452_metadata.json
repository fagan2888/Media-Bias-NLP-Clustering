Twice during the speech, Trump called the practice a \"positive thing\" while talking up the necessity of its use.\n\n\"I'm not in love with eminent domain, but eminent domain is a good thing. It's necessary,\" Trump said, adding later that \"eminent domain is something that's a positive thing \u2014 not a negative thing. Yeah, sometimes cities will use it in order to do business.\"\n\n\"Let's say a person has a house or a person has a backyard and they're going to build a factory that's going to employ 5,000 people, and sometimes the city will use the power,\" Trump said. \"And by the way, if you don't get that property, they're going to go to another city, and they're going to spend millions of dollars and they're going to build a factory there, they're going to employ 5,000 people \u2014 but not in your city. Eminent domain is a positive thing. It's got to be used judiciously.\"\n\n\"Without it, you wouldn't have any highways, you wouldn't have laws,\" Trump continued. \"Did anyone know that that's how you build roads and thats how you build schools and that's how you build other things?\"\n\nBob Owens, a 61-year-old resident of Pella, agreed partly with Trump's points, stating, \"yeah, you've got to think about progress, and you've got to think about things that [Trump] was talking about. But when it gets to actual personal and talking about taking away your farm, then it gets to be a little bit of a different deal [who's against the airport.] We have a good airport. We have an airport that's functional. I just personally don't think there's a need for it.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/01/trump_touts_his_support_for_eminent_domain.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Trump touts his support for eminent domain"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\"I'm not in love with eminent domain, but eminent domain is a good thing.\nIt's necessary,\" Trump said, adding later that \"eminent domain is something that's a positive thing \u2014 not a negative thing.\n\"And by the way, if you don't get that property, they're going to go to another city, and they're going to spend millions of dollars and they're going to build a factory there, they're going to employ 5,000 people \u2014 but not in your city.\nEminent domain is a positive thing.\n\"Did anyone know that that's how you build roads and thats how you build schools and that's how you build other things?\""}
