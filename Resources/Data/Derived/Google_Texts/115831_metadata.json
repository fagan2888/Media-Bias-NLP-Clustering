The government will lie relentlessly to cover up its failures, power-worshiping media will help bureaucrats get away with it, and the people can\u2019t really do anything about systemic problems anyway.\n\nTransparency and competition are among the first casualties when coercive force is introduced into any system. Collectivism never comes remotely close to keeping its promises. It gains the power to silence complaints, and calls that \u201csuccess.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nObamaCare provides a sterling example.\n\nIt\u2019s a pity America needed another lesson in collectivist failure, but boy, did we ever get one. When a submissive population complies with coercive enrollment policies, the collectivists call it \u201csuccess,\u201d even though enrollment still lags behind projections \u2013 as if following orders you will be sternly punished for disobeying is the equivalent of \u201cpopularity.\u201d You can\u2019t escape from ObamaCare, and you\u2019ll be fined into penury if you try. Now, will you obey, comrade, or must we hurt you? You\u2019ll obey? Splendid! You \u201csupport\u201d ObamaCare!\n\nThe millions who lost insurance plans they liked, or who complain about high costs and lousy benefits under ObamaCare, are summarily ignored by the regime and its media. We were saddled with this lousy system because megaphones were turned on for everyone who disliked the old health-care system; it was portrayed as an unbearable crisis, even though the vast majority of people were happy with it. The exact opposite approach is taken with ObamaCare \u2013 not many people are truly pleased with it, and frankly they\u2019re not the ones bearing the insane cost of the system, but they\u2019re the only people you\u2019ll ever hear about.\n\nWhen the topic of discussion was the government takeover of health insurance, all legal concerns were glibly brushed aside. Who cares what the Constitution says? Heck, who cares what the Affordable Care Act says? The whole system is written on the fly, by edict and decree\u2026 as the commissars keep a weather eye on the polls, just in case their media friends are unsuccessful at making unhappy Americans feel marginalized and helpless. Five years on, we\u2019re told that a comparable crusade of Hope and Change to rid ourselves of the ObamaCare disaster is pointless and futile \u2013 a half-written bill passed in the dead of night, during a brief window of unchecked Democrat power, is supposedly more fixed and immutable than the Constitution itself.\n\nSharyl Attkisson has a devastating expose of Covered California \u2013 which she notes, for good and ill, is the \u201cmodel\u201d ObamaCare exchange \u2013 at the Daily Signal. (It\u2019s a two-part article, with the second part available here.) It\u2019s filled with the sort of details that would outrage us to the point of demanding investigations, formal charges, and probably government regulatory \u201cfixes,\u201d if the subject of the article was a private-sector company.\n\nAs you might have noticed, there are no investigations or charges when neo-fascist State/industrial systems screw up, and there\u2019s no more powerful authority to plead with for regulatory fixes. Billions of dollars are squandered, without hope of recovery, unhappy \u201ccustomers\u201d are told to shut up, and the media refuses to build a narrative of systemic failure. Attkisson was one of the few mainstream reporters who wrote against the interests of the Obama Administration, which is why she\u2019s now \u201cformer CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson,\u201d and occasionally gets to enjoy watching her computer switch itself on in the middle of the night.\n\nOne of her sources for the Covered California story is profoundly disappointed project manager Aiden Hill, who became an ObamaCare supporter because he had a pre-existing condition that prevented him from getting an insurance policy under the old system. He went to work for Covered California as a true believer\u2026 and was abruptly dismissed after half a year of witnessing waste, incompetence, and cover-ups turned him into a whistleblower. \u201cI really believe that we\u2019ve created a monster \u2013 and it\u2019s an unaccountable monster,\u201d he declared.\n\nOther sources within Covered California backed up Hill\u2019s critique, speaking of impossible project goals pushed for political reasons, a glitchy website brought live despite \u201cdisastrous\u201d pre-launch testing, repair costs the government refuses to discuss in detail, inflated enrollment figures touted by a government that knew they were wrong, confused customers buried under mountains of paperwork, the mainstream media swallowing ObamaCare propaganda without question, no-bid contractors paid huge sums of money for work they didn\u2019t deliver, and soaring prices for insurance coverage. (Hill himself, initially so happy to find coverage through ObamaCare, said he was facing a 71 percent increase; 84 percent of California customers will be facing rate hikes this year.)\n\nAll of this was covered under a blanket of secrecy that would have put sweat-soaked private-sector CEOs into hot seats before angry congressional committees\u2026 but accountability simply doesn\u2019t happen any more, when Big Government takes over. Attkisson\u2019s sources accuse Covered California, and the federal ObamaCare apparatus, of obscuring or actively misrepresenting virtually every detail. Hill was told not to use computer resources in a way that could build an incriminating paper trail. Attkisson says every question she asked of Covered California for her article was ignored.\n\nAs for whether ObamaCare is meeting its goals in California, the truth can no longer be concealed. An official told Attkisson that enrollment growth has pretty much flatlined \u2013 they were hoping for 500,000 new enrollments in 2015, but they\u2019ve gotten only 7,098 so far, while losing a whopping 35 percent of their customers from 2014.\n\nThe media and political blackout on unhappy ObamaCare customers is a marvel to behold, but it\u2019s entirely predictable. The last vestiges of free-market medicine were put on the chopping block with a selective emphasis on anecdote \u2013 certainly there were people unhappy with the pre-ObamaCare system, people who couldn\u2019t get insurance coverage for a variety of reasons. Their numbers were vastly over-estimated, as individual stories were refashioned into systemic critiques. Instead of wisely-planned specific reforms to address the relatively small number of \u201chard-core\u201d uninsured, America was stampeded into a multi-trillion-dollar bureaucratic nightmare that functions less well than our pre-2010 insurance system overall\u2026 but as long as President Obama and his media pals can spotlight a few \u201cwinners\u201d here and there, conceal the biggest problems with the system, avoid discussing the vast sums of money wasted, and stifle Americans\u2019 complaints about high premiums and poor service, they can keep ObamaCare alive.\n\nWhen you get right down to it, that\u2019s the core problem with falling prey to collectivism. Under a free-market system, you can complain, initiate legal action, and above all use the awesome power of \u201cno\u201d to walk away from vendors who displease or deceive you. Once the State takes over, there is no way to say \u201cno.\u201d Your only hope is to build a political movement powerful enough to overthrow the collectivist regime, which will always have a defensive line of dependents and supportive moneyed interests, not to mention a media doggedly determined to avoid writing about the failures of a State they have partnered with in both romantic and symbiotic relationships. Big Media believes in Big Government, they\u2019re in love with its ideology of Big Solutions to Big Problems, and they do not want to write stories that might result in an outbreak of Big Freedom.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Covered California Shows ObamaCare Is Failure and Deception, All the Way Down", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Covered California Shows ObamaCare Is Failure and Deception, All the Way Down", "title": "Covered California Shows ObamaCare Is Failure and Deception, All the Way Down - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/obamacare-prices-2015-ap.jpg", "height": 479}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/21/covered-california-shows-obamacare-is-failure-and-deception-all-the-way-down/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Covered California Shows ObamaCare Is Failure and Deception, All the Way Down", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/obamacare-prices-2015-ap.jpg", "title": "Covered California Shows ObamaCare Is Failure and Deception, All the Way Down - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Covered California, health care, health insurance, obamacare, Sharyl Attkisson,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Sharyl Attkisson", "published_time": "2015-04-21T11:31:32-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3264\"", "article_summary": "Attkisson\u2019s sources accuse Covered California, and the federal ObamaCare apparatus, of obscuring or actively misrepresenting virtually every detail.\nThe media and political blackout on unhappy ObamaCare customers is a marvel to behold, but it\u2019s entirely predictable.\nSharyl Attkisson has a devastating expose of Covered California \u2013 which she notes, for good and ill, is the \u201cmodel\u201d ObamaCare exchange \u2013 at the Daily Signal.\nHe went to work for Covered California as a true believer\u2026 and was abruptly dismissed after half a year of witnessing waste, incompetence, and cover-ups turned him into a whistleblower.\nAttkisson says every question she asked of Covered California for her article was ignored."}
