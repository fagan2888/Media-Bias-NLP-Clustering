Ted Cruz noted he wanted to repeal every word of the law, but he was willing to settle for simply defunding it, while in another Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul helpfully offered the compromise position of a one-year delay on the implementation. So they\u2019re clearly willing to negotiate.\n\nAlso read: \u2018Duck Dynasty\u2019 Star Targets Abortion: \u2018You Have a God-Given Right to Live\u2019 (Video)\n\n\u201cEvery one of those offers is a compromise from the Republicans\u2019 initial offer \u2013having Mitt Romney be president,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cBut surprise, surprise, Obama wouldn\u2019t negotiate on that either.\u201d\n\nAs lawmakers helpfully noted in press conferences and on news programs, furloughing federal workers is not a game.\n\nTo mark the lack of fun being had in the Beltway, Colbert cooked up the perfect diversion, \u201cNot a Game: The Official Government Shut-Down Home Game\u201d from the makers of \u201cNot Sorry\u201d and \u201cOperation Denied Due to Pre-Existing Condition.\u201d\n\nGame pieces include a donkey to represent Democrats, an elephant to signify Republicans and a bug up the elephant\u2019s ass to embody the Tea Party. As Colbert explained, players set a timer to represent the looming debt ceiling and then promptly ignore it.\n\nGet it before it flies off store shelves.\n\nWatch the video:", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/colbert1-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Brent Lang", "description": "\"The Colbert Report\" host marks one-week anniversary with special commemorative board game", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "\"The Colbert Report\" host marks one-week anniversary with special commemorative board game", "title": "Stephen Colbert on Government Shutdown: Defunding Obamacare is a Compromise (Video)", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 614, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/colbert1.jpg", "height": 411}, "updated_time": "2014-07-10T20:49:29+00:00", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/stephen-colbert-government-shutdown-defunding-obamacare-compromise-video/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "&#8220;The Colbert Report&#8221; host marks one-week anniversary with special commemorative board game", "title": "Stephen Colbert on Government Shutdown: Defunding Obamacare is a Compromise (Video)", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/stephen-colbert-government-shutdown-defunding-obamacare-compromise-video/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/colbert1-340x300.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/colbert1-340x300.jpg"}, "creator": "@brentalang", "site": "@thewrap", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-08T14:16:00+00:00", "sailthru.title": "Stephen Colbert on Government Shutdown: Defunding Obamacare is a Compromise (Video)", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/colbert1.jpg", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "section": "Dailies", "tag": "Stephen Colbert", "published_time": "2013-10-08T07:16:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T20:49:29+00:00"}, "sailthru.tags": "stephen colbert", "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "sailthru.category": "videos,tv,dailies", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Stephen Colbert on Government Shutdown: Defunding Obamacare is a Compromise (Video)\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/stephen-colbert-government-shutdown-defunding-obamacare-compromise-video\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/10\\/colbert1-150x150.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"165968\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-08T14:16:00Z\",\"section\":\"Dailies\",\"author\":\"Brent Lang\",\"tags\":[\"stephen colbert\"]}", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf62e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut surprise, surprise, Obama wouldn\u2019t negotiate on that either.\u201dAs lawmakers helpfully noted in press conferences and on news programs, furloughing federal workers is not a game.\nAlso read: \u2018Duck Dynasty\u2019 Star Targets Abortion: \u2018You Have a God-Given Right to Live\u2019 (Video)\u201cEvery one of those offers is a compromise from the Republicans\u2019 initial offer \u2013having Mitt Romney be president,\u201d Colbert said.\nAs Colbert explained, players set a timer to represent the looming debt ceiling and then promptly ignore it.\nWatch the video:\nIn one clip, Texas Sen.
