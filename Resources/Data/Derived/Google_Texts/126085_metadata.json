That's consistent with national numbers.\n\nHowever, small-business owners in Minnesota have grown more positive about their outlook for the state economy, as 55 percent said they believe the state is better off than the nation, the highest percentage since U.S. Bank started the survey seven years ago.\n\nBusiness conditions are slightly down in 2016 compared with a year ago, and revenue is generally flat. Economic uncertainty was reported as the biggest challenge.\n\n\"Business owners are still in a cautious mode, second-guessing future decisions,\" said Ross Carey, head of business banking at U.S. Bank. \"Business is good, though they wonder if another shoe will drop in the economy. A little more time and some clarity around who will be leading our country a year from now will go a long way in boosting their confidence.\"\n\nAnother challenge is the health care system, which business owners still regard with deep skepticism, six years after passage of the Affordable Care Act. Some 54 percent of those surveyed said health care would have a negative long-term impact on their business.\n\nSmall-business owners' optimism varies by state, according to the survey. In Minnesota, Colorado, Washington and northern California, business owners feel better. States where business owners feel the state economy is worse than the national economy include Arizona, Oregon, Wisconsin, Missouri and Illinois.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Small-business owners feel good about their own businesses, but they are getting more anxious about the national economy, according to an .", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Small-business owners feel good about their own businesses, but they are getting more anxious about the national economy, according to an .", "title": "Small businesses bullish on Minnesota, bearish on nation", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/small-businesses-bullish-on-state-bearish-on-nation/378665151/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1bbox29.l.standalone.prod_affiliate.2.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1bbox29.l.standalone.prod_affiliate.2.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Small-business owners feel good about their own businesses, but they are getting more anxious about the national economy, according to an .", "title": "Small businesses bullish on Minnesota, bearish on nation", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/small-businesses-bullish-on-state-bearish-on-nation/378665151/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1bbox29.l.standalone.prod_affiliate.2.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1bbox29.l.standalone.prod_affiliate.2.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "U.S. Bank"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "small business,outlook,U.S. Bank"}, "article_summary": "States where business owners feel the state economy is worse than the national economy include Arizona, Oregon, Wisconsin, Missouri and Illinois.\nIn Minnesota, Colorado, Washington and northern California, business owners feel better.\n\"Business owners are still in a cautious mode, second-guessing future decisions,\" said Ross Carey, head of business banking at U.S. Bank.\nSmall-business owners feel good about their own businesses, but they are getting more anxious about the national economy, according to an annual survey from U.S. Bank.\nAnother challenge is the health care system, which business owners still regard with deep skepticism, six years after passage of the Affordable Care Act."}
