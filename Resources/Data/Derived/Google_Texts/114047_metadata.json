The New York Times reported (April 6) that many of Tribe\u2019s colleagues at Harvard Law School are \u201cbewildered and angry.\u201d Jody Freeman, director of the environmental law program at Harvard Law School, told the Times that Tribe\u2019s claims of unconstitutionality are \u201cbaseless.\u201d Freeman and respected law professor and Supreme Court advocate Richard Lazarus wrote on the Harvard Law School website that Mr. Tribe\u2019s arguments are \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nReally? The legal analysis of one of the country\u2019s leading constitutional scholars has no merit whatsoever?\n\nWorse yet, Tribe has even been called a traitor. But a traitor to what? It can\u2019t be that he is a traitor to the constitution. Every constitutional case involves disagreement over the meaning of the constitution. Judges, including Supreme Court justices, often disagree about constitutional requirements. Losing arguments and dissenting opinions are not the pronouncements of traitors. That Professor Tribe disagrees with the Obama administration and apparently most academic lawyers could not make him a traitor to the constitution.\n\nTribe\u2019s sin is not that he might prove to be wrong on the constitutional issue. Rather it is that he might prove to be right and thereby undercut the Obama administration\u2019s climate change policies. In other words, Tribe is a traitor to the environmentalist policy agenda.\n\nSadly, this sort of characterization of legal arguments is increasingly commonplace. When Ted Olson joined J to argue in defense of gay marriage he was deemed a traitor by many social conservatives. When Chief Justice John Roberts provided the fifth vote to uphold the constitutionality of Obamacare he was labeled a traitor by opponents of the health care law. But like Tribe, right or wrong, these people were stating honestly held legal conclusions, not personal policy preferences. Or so we must fervently hope.\n\nThe politicization of legal argument is particularly evident in the legal academy. Many law professors see themselves as advocates for particular causes, not teachers of the law. Environmental law professors, for example, are overwhelmingly dedicated to preparing their students to represent the environmentalist side of environmental disputes. Those who would suggest that the law sometimes actually favors the position of an energy company or some other \u2018enemy\u2019 of the environment are dismissed as hired guns. Either you\u2019re on the side of the environmentalists, or you\u2019re the enemy. And woe unto someone like Professor Tribe who was presumed to be on the side of right and good but appears to have taken up the cause of the enemy.\n\nHonest disagreements over the meaning of the constitution and other laws should be the grist of academic debate, not the basis for labeling one side or the other as traitorous. Professor Tribe should be, and will be in the upcoming legal proceedings, challenged on the legal merits of his constitutional argument. By dismissing his views as those of a traitorous hired gun we invite the courts to do the same.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jim Huffman", "description": "Losing arguments and dissenting opinions are not the pronouncements of traitors.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Harvard Professor Laurence Tribe has been getting a lot of press in advance of his representation of Peabody Energy in its dispute with the Obama Administration over the constitutionality of the Envir", "title": "Laurence Tribe: A \u2018Traitor\u2019 To The Environmental Agenda", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/04/10/laurence-tribe-a-traitor-to-the-environmental-agenda/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014-12-19T104639Z_1_LYNXMPEABI0FL_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-e1422456679160.jpg", "height": 516}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Losing arguments and dissenting opinions are not the pronouncements of traitors.", "title": "Laurence Tribe: A \u2018Traitor\u2019 To The Environmental Agenda Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/04/10/laurence-tribe-a-traitor-to-the-environmental-agenda/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014-12-19T104639Z_1_LYNXMPEABI0FL_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-e1422456679160.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-10 10:09:23", "sailthru.title": "Laurence Tribe: A 'Traitor' To The Environmental Agenda", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "epa,gina-mccarthy,john-roberts,laurence-tribe,ted-olson,jim-huffman", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "epa,gina mccarthy,john roberts,laurence tribe,ted olson", "sailthru.description": "Harvard Professor Laurence Tribe has been getting a lot of press in advance of his representation of Peabody Energy in its dispute with the Obama Administration over the constitutionality of the Envir", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014-12-19T104639Z_1_LYNXMPEABI0FL_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-e1422456679160.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe18ed\"", "article_summary": "Environmental law professors, for example, are overwhelmingly dedicated to preparing their students to represent the environmentalist side of environmental disputes.\nThat Professor Tribe disagrees with the Obama administration and apparently most academic lawyers could not make him a traitor to the constitution.\nProfessor Tribe should be, and will be in the upcoming legal proceedings, challenged on the legal merits of his constitutional argument.\nBut like Tribe, right or wrong, these people were stating honestly held legal conclusions, not personal policy preferences.\nIn other words, Tribe is a traitor to the environmentalist policy agenda."}
