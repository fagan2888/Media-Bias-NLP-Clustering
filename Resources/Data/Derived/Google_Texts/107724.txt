(CNN) The super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's bid for president will spend $10 million on its first major TV ad campaign starting next month.

A spokesman for Right to Rise PAC confirmed that the group will start running ads in the crucial early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire on September 15, with ads starting in South Carolina the week after.

The commercials, first reported by The Associated Press , will focus on promoting the former Florida governor's record and will run through December.

Before becoming a candidate in mid-June, Bush spent the first half of the year raising money for the super PAC, helping it reach its goal of more than $100 million, an unprecedented amount of money this early for a presidential candidate.

While the buy marks the group's first phase of TV ads, Right to Rise has spent about $200,000 on online ads so far.
