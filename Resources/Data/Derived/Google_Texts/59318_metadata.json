Usually policies do one or the other.\n\nCongressional Republicans, however, are unusually bad at crafting sensible proposals in this area. It\u2019s comparable to someone going on a diet and going out of their way to find foods that have too many calories and taste terrible.\n\nIn this case, the issue is an Affordable Care Act provision that requires many employers to provide health care coverage to full-time employees \u2013 and the law defines \u201cfull time\u201d as those working 30 hours a week or more. Republicans desperately want to move that threshold to 40 hours a week, and yesterday, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office sketched out what would happen if GOP lawmakers got their way.\n\nA bipartisan measure changing ObamaCare\u2019s definition of full-time work would raise the deficit by $53.2 billion over 10 years and move up to 1 million people into government sponsored health insurance, congressional budget analysts said Wednesday. The projection from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) poses a messaging challenge to Republican supporters of the measure who are using it as their first attack on the healthcare law this Congress\u2026. The number of uninsured would also increase by less than 500,000, the CBO said.\n\nWell, it might cause a messaging challenge if Republican lawmakers cared even the slightest bit about substantive policy analyses. [Update 4:33 p.m.: The bill passed the House this afternoon, 252-172. Literally zero Republicans voted against it.]\n\nRemember, GOP lawmakers were told yesterday that their proposal would cut off insurance for hundreds of thousands of Americans, while costing taxpayers more money. They were also told the day before that President Obama will, without question, veto the legislation if it reaches his desk.\n\nConfronted with that reality, House Republicans are proceeding anyway, not because it\u2019s a good bill \u2013 even conservative media doesn\u2019t see the point \u2013 but because GOP lawmakers consider their bad bill ideologically satisfying.\n\nIndeed, just two days after the 2014 midterm elections, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) sketched out their top priorities for this Congress, and this awful idea was near the top of their list\n\nThe House will vote on it today, and the Republican-led Senate has vowed to act soon after. They know it can\u2019t become law; they know it would increase the uninsured rate; and they know it would add to the deficit they sometimes pretend to care about; but they\u2019re doing it anyway.\n\nFor GOP lawmakers, legislative priorities aren\u2019t about public policy; they\u2019re about scratching an ideological itch. Republicans won\u2019t actually do anything with this little gambit, except feel better about themselves.\n\nMatt Yglesias had a good piece on the bill yesterday, noting that Republicans have hit upon a cure that\u2019s \u201cworse than the disease.\u201d\n\nTheir proposal, as outlined by John Boehner and Mitch McConnell in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, is to \u201crestore the traditional 40-hour definition of full-time employment, removing an arbitrary and destructive government barrier to more hours and better pay created by the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\u201d Except it turns out that the authors of the ACA weren\u2019t idiots. As Yuval Levin explained in a recent National Review item, the 30 hour threshold was established \u201cin part to limit the degree to which employers cut worker hours by putting the cut-off well below the number of hours that most workers put in.\u201d Sherry Glied and Claudia Solis-Rosman have shown that while working slightly more than 40 hours is common, working slightly more than 30 hours is rare. In other words, few workers are at risk of having hours slashed from 31 per week to 29, but many could be cut back from 41 to 39.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "It's actually difficult to put together a health care bill that adds to the deficit and reduces coverage at the same time.
