It\u2019s freezing,\u201d he said from a makeshift stage erected on the south end of the field.\n\nBuckeyes fans were on their feet as coach Urban Meyer and the team emerged from the southeast tunnel obscured by fog and flanked by flames. Onstage, local politicians delivered speeches and players danced and joked with each other while chants of \u201cO-H! I-O!\u201d rang out throughout the stadium and several highlight videos from the Buckeyes\u2019 14-1 season played on the scoreboard.\n\nAs he took the podium to address the crowd, coach Urban Meyer said he initially wanted to move the event indoors to Value City Area until athletic director Gene Smith challenged him.\n\n\u201cGene Smith says, \u2018You don\u2019t realize, these Buckeye fans are nuts,'\u201d Meyer said. \u201cYou are nuts, and from the bottom of our heart thank you for being here.\u201d\n\nThe university awarded 2,500 free passes allowing fans to watch from the field.

Flames and fireworks went off as Meyer gathered in the first college football playoff trophy.\n\nAfter recognizing walk-on cornerback Nik Sarac for selflessly declining a scholarship during the summer, Meyer brought out a handful of players including quarterbacks Braxton Miller, J.T. Barrett and Cardale Jones, whom he introduced as \u201cthe magnificent three.\u201d Miller, whose status for next season is unknown, told fans, \u201cWe\u2019ve got another year to do it, so let\u2019s go Bucks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Buckeyes celebrate their title at Ohio Stadium", "title": "Buckeyes celebrate their title at Ohio Stadium", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Buckeyes celebrate their title at Ohio Stadium", "title": "Buckeyes celebrate their title at Ohio Stadium", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/24/buckeyes_celebrate_their_title_at_ohio_stadium/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/ohio-st-celebration-football.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Buckeyes celebrate their title at Ohio Stadium", "title": "Buckeyes celebrate their title at Ohio Stadium", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/ohio-st-celebration-football.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 After leading Ohio State to a national championship, Joey Bosa had one question for the 45,000 fans who crowded into Ohio Stadium in late January.\nBuckeyes fans were on their feet as coach Urban Meyer and the team emerged from the southeast tunnel obscured by fog and flanked by flames.\nI-O!\u201d rang out throughout the stadium and several highlight videos from the Buckeyes\u2019 14-1 season played on the scoreboard.\nFlames and fireworks went off as Meyer gathered in the first college football playoff trophy.\nAssociated Press regional director Eva Parziale presented the AP national championship trophy to Meyer, who also accepted championship trophies from the College Football Playoff and the American Football Coaches Association."}
