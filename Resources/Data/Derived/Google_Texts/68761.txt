Sioux Falls, SD

South Dakota's three candidates for governor square off in KELO-TV's hour-long debate on Wednesday night. At 8 p.m. central, Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard, Democratic challenger Susan Wismer, and Independent challenger Michael Myers all answer questions that matter the most to South Dakotans. In the past, they have answered a lot of questions about the economy and education. Both seem to remain in line with voter concerns.

We wanted to know what matters the most to voters, and what they would ask the gubernatorial candidates.

"As a teacher, I would ask them what their plan is to maintain, and maybe help teachers pay out to keep qualified teachers in the state," Lisa Griebel said.

Griebel is a social studies teacher at Roosevelt High School in Sioux Falls.

"What are you going to do about education? How are you going to raise it to a standard of living for the teachers, so that we can keep our good teachers to provide a quality education for our children?" Nancy Gunner asked.

Gunner said her daughter is also a teacher.

Focusing on the economy, other voters wanted to know about businesses, jobs, and, of course, money.

"What are you going to do to help with some of the federal overreach that's happening, and also, all of the out of control spending we see in Washington, D.C.?" Isaac Latterell asked.

Latterell owns a technology consulting business.

"How do they propose to bring enough workers here to fill the jobs that exist in every town here?" Jeff Peltier, a sales representative, asked.

Health care is often a heated discussion in the country as well, including in South Dakota.

"Do you feel the Affordable Care Act is positively impacting the state?" Jenni Peterson, a registered nurse, asked.
