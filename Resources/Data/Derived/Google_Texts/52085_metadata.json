Underneath larger umbrella issues. So these points that the students brought up, I think we as a task force will have to address the much larger issues that have inspired these small ones the students have addressed,\" Carter said.\n\n\n\n\"I think it's not unreasonable for them to have a list of demands. If they want to see changes. If they're not feeling at home at this university then that's a problem because that's what we're all here to do. And I feel at home so if other people aren't, I would want them to be comfortable,\" said Alex Gibson, a UA student.\n\n\"It's a good idea to bring that to the forefront and have a discussion about it,\" said Sid Patanwala, an associate professor at the UA.\n\nSome students say some of the demands could be met with compromise.\n\n\"I know that we have to take a diversity emphasis gen ed already. It's already hard enough to graduate in four years so I feel like maybe the diversity emphasis courses can have some added to cover more aspects of social justice,\" said Erica Rao, a student.\n\nThe task force is chaired by Javier Duran, professor and director of the UA Confluence Center, Bryan Carter, associate professor of Africana Studies and Tannya Gaxiola, UA assistant vice president for community relations and chair of the UA Diversity Coordinating Committee.\n\nThe task force will also include alumni associations and clubs, the disability resource office, religious groups, Associated Students of ther UA, graduate and professional student association and student cultural groups.\n\nView the list of demands here.\n\nCopyright 2016 Tucson News Now.
