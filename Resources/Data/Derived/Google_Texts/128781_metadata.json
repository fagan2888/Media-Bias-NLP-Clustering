If any firm decisions are made, we will provide an update,\" a Hong Kong-based Barclays' spokeswoman said in an email.\n\nThe latest job losses will include staff from countries in which the bank's business is not a leading player, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the subject.\n\nThe closure of the Korean and Taiwan businesses reflect Chief Executive Jes Staley's desire to trim in countries where the bank's corporate relationships are weaker to focus on core centers, including Hong Kong, the sources added.\n\nOne source said that Staley had told staff last month that the pace of restructuring had been too slow and the bank needed further job cuts.\n\nThe bank has pushed back staff bonus payments to March, two people said.\n\nBarclays is not alone in reducing its exposure in the region, with Asia-focused Standard Chartered announcing a year ago that it would close the equities franchise it had launched in November 2008 and rival Societe Generale saying more recently that it would close its equities research desk in India.\n\nAsia is expected to bear the brunt of cuts under Staley's three-year cost-reduction plan, which involves shedding 19,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of Barclays' global workforce, as he seeks to improve profitability.\n\nBarclays is also weighing up the sale of its Asian private wealth business, for which Singapore's DBS Group Holdings and Julius Baer are seen as potential bidders, sources told Reuters last month.\n\n(Additional reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee in MUMBAI and Anjuli Davies in LONDON, editing by Rachel Armstrong, Louise Heavens and David Goodman)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Barclays will announce investment banking job cuts acr", "title": "Exclusive: Barclays to cut Asia investment banking jobs next week - sources", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/05/Exclusive-Barclays-announce-investment-banking-job-cuts-across-Asia-next-week", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/banks-forex-settlement-usa_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/05/Exclusive-Barclays-announce-investment-banking-job-cuts-across-Asia-next-week", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/banks-forex-settlement-usa_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Barclays will announce investment banking job cuts acr", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Barclays will announce investment banking job cuts across Asia next week, including closures in South Korea and Taiwan, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nReuters reported on Monday that Barclays will close its Indian equities business as part of the wider pullback in Asia.\nOne source said that Staley had told staff last month that the pace of restructuring had been too slow and the bank needed further job cuts.\nBarclays is also weighing up the sale of its Asian private wealth business, for which Singapore's DBS Group Holdings and Julius Baer are seen as potential bidders, sources told Reuters last month.\nIf any firm decisions are made, we will provide an update,\" a Hong Kong-based Barclays' spokeswoman said in an email."}
