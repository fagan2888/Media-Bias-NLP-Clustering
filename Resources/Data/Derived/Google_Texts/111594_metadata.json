Allen Sr. Courts Building to wrestle over $10 million in prize money an arbitration panel says Armstrong owes SCA. But at the last second, for unexplained reasons, that hearing was canceled. Now, we know why:\n\nThe lawsuit has been settled.\n\nThat is according to SCA\u2019s attorney, Dallas\u2019 Jeff Tillotson, who says via email Sunday afternoon that the settlment resolves the parties\u2019 long-simmering dispute, which dates back more than a decade.\n\n\u201cSCA has agreed to settle its dispute with Lance Armstrong,\u201d the LBJ Freeway-headquartered promotions company says in a brief statement. \u201cWhile the terms of the settlement are confidential, SCA can say that the agreement was mutually acceptable to both parties. SCA is pleased to have this matter finally resolved and beyond this statement, SCA has no further comment.\u201d\n\nArmstrong says via email that he\u2019s glad the issue is behind him.\n\n\u201cWhile the terms of the settlement are confidential, I can say that the settlement was mutually acceptable to all parties,\u201d he says in a statement sent via his manager and spokesman Mark Higgins. \u201cI am pleased to have this matter behind me, and I look forward to moving on. I do wish to personally apologize to SCA and its CEO, Bob Hamman, for any past misconduct on my part in connection with our dispute and the resulting arbitration. \u201d\n\nTillotson and SCA sued Armstrong to retrieve millions SCA paid the cyclist for winning the Tour de France in 2002, \u201903 and \u201904. SCA paid the money on behalf of Tailwind Sports, which owned the U.S. Postal Service team for which Armstrong raced, and wanted it returned after Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that, yes, all those stories about him filling his blood with numerous banned substances were true after all.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time Tillotson and SCA tussled with Armstrong: In 2004 SCA tried to keep from paying the bonus around the same time reporters Pierre Ballester and David Walsh published their book L.A. Confidentiel: Les secrets de Lance Armstrong, in which Armstrong\u2019s masseuse Emma O\u2019Reilly spoke openly of performance-enhancing drug use. Tillotson would become the only attorney to ask Armstrong about those allegations, among others, after he swore to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help him God.\n\n\u201cI race the bike straight up fair and square,\u201d he told Tillotson, who can be seen questioning the cyclist under oath in Alex Gibney\u2019s 2013 documentary The Armstrong Lie. Except, of course, he didn\u2019t.\n\nSCA and Armstrong settled their differences in 2006. Seven years later, after that Oprah interview, SCA filed its lawsuit, claiming \u201cLance Armstrong perpetuated what may well be the most outrageous, cold-hearted and elaborate lie in the history of sports.\u201d In February of this year, two members of a three-member arbitration panel \u2014 one representing Armstrong, one representing SCA, and a third who was neutral \u2014 said that Armstrong must repay the money. The reason was a simple one, it said when handing down its decision:\n\n\u201cPerjury must never be profitable.\u201d\n\nIn May Armstrong\u2019s attorneys tried to get the judge to vacate the panel\u2019s decision, insisting that it \u201ceffectively eviscerated a fully negotiated and binding settlement agreement\u201d made between SCA and Armstrong in 2006. On September 4, Parker was going to consider confirming the award.\n\nBut two and a half years later, the parties have decided to end the race, just in time for the U.K. release of Stephen Frears\u2019 movie The Program starring Ben Foster as Armstrong. The film, writes Catherine Shoard in The Guardian, \u201cexcels is in examining how it feels to be unable to accept defeat, even when you know victory was ill-gained.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA5L2F0dG9ybmV5LWxhbmNlLWFybXN0cm9uZy1hbmQtZGFsbGFzLXNwb3J0cy1wcm9tb3Rpb25zLWNvbXBhbnktc2V0dGxlLTEwLW1pbGxpb24tZGlzcHV0ZS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "[Editor's note: This item has been updated to include a statement from Lance Armstrong.] On September 4, attorneys representing disgraced Oak Cliff-born, Plano-raised cyclist Lance Armstrong and Dallas-based sports promotions\u2026", "title": "Lance Armstrong: I\u2019m sorry for \u2018any past misconduct on my part\u2019 that led to $10 million dispute", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/09/attorney-lance-armstrong-and-dallas-sports-promotions-company-settle-10-million-dispute.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2013/01/LanceArmstrongDeposition.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-09-27T18:46:44Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe14c3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSCA has agreed to settle its dispute with Lance Armstrong,\u201d the LBJ Freeway-headquartered promotions company says in a brief statement.\n[Editor\u2019s note: This item has been updated to include a statement from Lance Armstrong.]\nSCA is pleased to have this matter finally resolved and beyond this statement, SCA has no further comment.\u201dArmstrong says via email that he\u2019s glad the issue is behind him.\n\u201dTillotson and SCA sued Armstrong to retrieve millions SCA paid the cyclist for winning the Tour de France in 2002, \u201903 and \u201904.\n\u201cWhile the terms of the settlement are confidential, SCA can say that the agreement was mutually acceptable to both parties."}
