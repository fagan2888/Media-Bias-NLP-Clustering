It\u2019s much larger than the GDP of major U.S. trading partners like South Korea or Mexico, and dwarfs all of the economies of OPEC. Almost the entire GDP of California - our largest state economy - would be needed to pay for it all, and it\u2019s nearly five times as costly as Michigan\u2019s annual GDP.\n\nFrightening as this all sounds, the truly terrifying news is the source of the information. It\u2019s not Fox News or a Republican talking point. It\u2019s not a university research paper or from a think tank. Instead, it\u2019s an estimate produced by the federal government itself.\n\nThe \u201cImpact of Regulatory Costs on Small Firms\u201d was issued in 2010, under a contract from the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s Office of Advocacy. The SBA report covered 2008, and estimated the federal regulatory burden to be $1.75 trillion. Using the report\u2019s methodology, the Competitive Enterprise Institute creates an annual update, entitled \u201cThe Ten Thousand Commandments,\u201d and said last year the 2012 federal regulatory crater had topped $1.8 trillion.\n\nCongress created the SBA Office of Advocacy in 1976 and charged it with \u201cexamining the contributions and challenges of small businesses \u2026\u201d It\u2019s a creature of the executive branch. Its leader was appointed by President Obama and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe SBA report notes the smallest businesses (those with fewer than 20 employees) shouldered the worst burden, at $10,585 in federal regulatory costs per employee. The average for all businesses - large and small - was $8,086 per employee.\n\nMost strikingly, if measured on a per-capita basis, the SBA authors say the 2008 price of regulations worked out to $15,586 per household, or $5,000 more than the average cost per household for health care that year.\n\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute said the $1.8 trillion price tag for 2012 was large enough to equal half of all federal spending that year, and that Washington cooked up a new rule or law every 2.5 hours.\n\nCEI says the 2012 Federal Register - Washington\u2019s rule book - clocked in at 78,961 pages. Stack those end to end, and you\u2019ll be walking for nearly 14 miles to read all the lawyer-speak telling you \u201cThou Shall\u201d or \u201cThou Shalt Not.\u201d\n\nEconomically, regulations equal taxation. Rather than spend tax dollars to accomplish its goals, government orders Americans to spend their own money to accomplish its goals. CEI says the cost of federal regulations now exceeds federal and corporate income taxes combined.\n\nUnlike taxes, regulations are less direct and hidden from view. We don\u2019t watch closely, and then suddenly we\u2019ve got a boat anchor literally the size of the Indian economy weighing down our prosperity. (And all this is before state regulations are added in.)\n\nBuried in the avalanche of orders are certainly good ideas worth preserving. But Americans must begin demanding the death of costly rules as often as we accept or even request the birth of new ones.\n\nLast year, the federal agencies overseeing the Affordable Care Act submitted estimates for the annual paperwork compliance of ACA regulations. The total worked out to 127 million man hours, enough to build 18 brand new Empire State Buildings each year. Americans of all political stripes should have been loudly and honestly warned all this was coming before it was passed. Perhaps we\u2019d have demanded something different.\n\nKen Braun was a legislative aide for a Republican lawmaker in the Michigan House and worked for the Mackinac Center for Public Policy.
