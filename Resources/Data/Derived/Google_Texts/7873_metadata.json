It still keeps them stuck. They\u2019re getting money for free. They feel worthless. They\u2019re uneducated. I mean, as long as you are that way, they can keep you under their control \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have a plantation mentality,\u201d Dash said. \u201cAs long as they give you this much money, you\u2019ll stay right there. You don\u2019t need to know too much because if you do, you might start thinking for yourself.\u201d\n\nI think Stacey Dash needs to get out more, perhaps visit Louisiana and the rest of America and see that all blacks, myself included, certainly don\u2019t feel \u201cworthless\u201d under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nWhether Democratic or Republican, scores of black people \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Allen West, Condoleezza Rice, Ben Carson, Shelby Steele, Bill Cosby, Robin Roberts, and many many others \u2014 are highly educated, gainfully employed, paying their bills and frankly doing quite well. Dash is one of them.\n\nMany black people may want Obama to provide more productive policies, but to suggest, as Dash does, that blacks are largely \u201cuneducated\u201d and \u201cgetting money for free\u201d is a racist narrative that conservatives need to stop perpetuating. That kind of talk is an offensive nonstarter in getting blacks to consider voting Republican. So is the often repeated meme by some black conservatives that blacks \u201chave a plantation mentality.\u201d\n\nWhether you\u2019re white or black, it\u2019s never cool to invoke metaphors of slavery, which was a gruesome, painful institution protected by Democrats in America that went on way too long. Conservatives should remind Americans of the history of slavery and how the Democratic Party perpetuates policies of paternalism that don\u2019t benefit blacks.\n\nContinue reading at CNN.com.\n\n32 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?
