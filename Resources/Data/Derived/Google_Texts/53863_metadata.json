Last week, he announced a quickly reversed plan to establish a state run news service, labeled \u201cPravda on the Prairie\u201d by Breitbart News, which brought ridicule and scorn from critics in Indiana and around the country.\n\nPence has also become embroiled in the Common Core educational standards controversy. His decision to, in effect, merely \u201crebrand\u201d the controversial standards with a new name and, consequently, allow the state\u2019s No Child Left Behind waiver to be restored, suggests Pence is more interested in keeping federal funds flowing into the state than protecting Indiana from federal intrusion.\n\nIn a statement issued Tuesday announcing \u201cthat the State has received approval from the federal government to use an updated version of the consumer-driven Healthy Indiana Plan known as HIP 2.0 instead of Medicaid to offer access to quality health care to 350,000 uninsured Hoosiers,\u201d Pence took a page from his Common Core rebranding strategy.\n\nNo longer will Medicaid\u2013the federal program for Americans below the poverty line\u2013go by that name in Indiana. Instead, Pence has rebranded it as \u201cHealthy Indiana Plan 2.0,\u201d or HIP 2.0.\n\nYou can read the details of Pence\u2019s HIP 2.0 plan here.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), states that agree to expand Medicaid receive additional federal funding for the first few years of the expanded program\u2019s operation. To date, \u201cgovernors in 28 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid,\u201d while governors in 22 states have just said no.\n\nNext week, Tennessee could become the 29th state to expand Medicaid when the state legislature convenes in a special session called by Republican Governor Bill Haslam to consider his plan to accept more federal funding and expand Medicaid. Conservative lawmakers, however, are expected to mount vigorous opposition to Haslam\u2019s proposal.\n\nElsewhere, in 2013, when Ohio Governor John Kasich could not get the state legislature to buy into Medicaid expansion, he ran an end-run and got two years of the program approved by a \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d state organization. As the Toledo Blade reported, \u201c[t]he [Medicaid] expansion was made possible when the quasi-legislative Ohio Controlling Board agreed to draw down $2.6 billion in federal funds to pay for it.\u201d\n\nWith those two years now up and the Ohio Controlling Board funds depleted, Kasich is again pitching the state legislature to approve his version of Medicaid expansion.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity (AFP), The Heritage Foundation, and local limited government activists lead the parade of opposition.\n\nWhile Chase Downham, head of AFP\u2019s Indiana chapter, called Pence\u2019s \u201cattempt to reform traditional Medicaid \u2026 laudable,\u201d he noted still, \u201cour concerns with HIP 2.0 remain.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he price of reforming traditional Medicaid should not come at the cost of expanding an already troubled entitlement program [Indiana\u2019s HIP 1.0, introduced by former Governor Mitch Daniels] to include hundreds of thousands of able-bodied, working-age, childless adults,\u201d Downham concluded.\n\nJohn Davidson, director of the Center for Health Care Policy at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, blasted Pence\u2019s plan at the Federalist:\n\n[HIP 2.0] dragoons the entire non-disabled Medicaid population into the expansion scheme, not just those above the poverty line, and offers them a choice between a HIP Basic and a HIP Plus plan (some can also choose a plan that supplements employer coverage, a long-standing feature of traditional Medicaid), both of which feature a health savings account with a $2,500 deductible funded almost entirely by taxpayers. The state will still cover the entire cost of the deductible and copayments will be limited to 5 percent of income. The basic plan essentially requires nothing of enrollees. They get a health savings account and can either pay into it or not\u2014the state will still cover the entire cost of the deductible and copayments will be limited to 5 percent of income, as they are for all Medicaid programs everywhere.\n\nOne respected free market health care reformer, Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute, however, called Pence\u2019s plan \u201ca win.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile conservatives are sure to criticize this plan as an expansion of Medicaid,\u201d Turner wrote on Tuesday. \u201cI see it as taking advantage of an opportunity to lay the groundwork for the kind of Medicaid reform that we must move toward in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsent Obamacare,\u201d Turner concluded, \u201cmany conservatives would praise this effort to make Medicaid look more like a Health Savings Account and catastrophic high-deductible coverage. This is an important start toward much-needed changes to this public program. By using the ObamaCare waiver option that the administration wanted, Gov. Pence has gained important and potentially transformative changes to Medicaid. This is a win.\u201d\n\nIndiana resident Joy Pullman, managing editor at the Federalist and a research fellow at the Heartland Institute, has a different view.\n\n\u201cAccording to federal measurements,\u201d she wrote on Wednesday, \u201cmy family consists of \u2018low-income Hoosiers\u2019 even though we\u2019ll make something near the median state income this year, because under Pence\u2019s Medicaid expansion government dependents can earn twice as much as the federal poverty level. In fact, we\u2019re eligible for Pence\u2019s welfa\u2026er, Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nPullman offered this blunt assessment of Pence\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cNo way in hell are we taking it,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cI am not about to get my family into a health-care program that offers worse care than being uninsured,\u201d Pullman wrote.\n\n\u201c[W]e live a quite comfortable middle-class lifestyle. We eat well, we have two cars, and our house is almost paid off. Our children are well-clothed and well-toyed. We have memberships to the local zoo and indoor gardens,\u201d Pullman explained.\n\nThe Pullman family has \u201ca high-deductible health plan,\u201d Pullman wrote, \u201cso [they] pay essentially all of [their] medical bills in cash.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have never had a problem affording that,\u201d Pullman explained, \u201cdespite having also paid cash for our three kids\u2019 births, although affording health care does entail taking the kids to immunization clinics instead of pediatricians to cut costs and visiting quick-care clinics instead of emergency rooms when we have a malady that requires medical attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t pay subsidized rates at the clinics. We pay the full cost,\u201d Pullman said. \u201cAs my husband explained to the puzzled nurse once, \u2018We can afford to pay.\u2019 If we can, so can lots of people Pence just told to stick their bills to taxpayers.\u201d\n\nA number of conservatives in Indiana are looking at Pence\u2019s new health care plan with the same caustic disapproval displayed by fellow Hoosier Pullman in her article.\n\nThat attitude could spell trouble for HIP 2.0 in Indiana in 2015 as well as for Pence on the campaign trail in 2016, should he choose to offer his political leadership skills to the country as a whole.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mike Pence Becomes Latest GOP Establishment Governor to Buy Into Obama's Medicaid Expansion", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Mike Pence Becomes Latest GOP Establishment Governor to Buy Into Obama's Medicaid Expansion", "title": "Mike Pence Becomes Latest GOP Establishment Governor to Buy Into Obama's Medicaid Expansion - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/AP249836808015.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/29/mike-pence-becomes-latest-gop-establishment-governor-to-buy-into-obamas-medicaid-expansion/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mike Pence Becomes Latest GOP Establishment Governor to Buy Into Obama's Medicaid Expansion", "title": "Mike Pence Becomes Latest GOP Establishment Governor to Buy Into Obama's Medicaid Expansion - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/AP249836808015.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Americans for Prosperity, Galen Institute, Governor Bill Haslam, Governor John Kasich, Governor Mike Pence, Grace-Marie Turner, Heritage Foundation, HIP 2.0, John Davidson, Joy Pullman, Medicaid expansion, obamacare, Texas Public Policy Foundation, The Federalist,Big Government, Obamacare,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "The Federalist", "published_time": "2015-01-29T05:30:51-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb28\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Tuesday Pence became the most recent Republican governor to buy into President Obama\u2019s push to expand Medicaid.\nIn fact, we\u2019re eligible for Pence\u2019s welfa\u2026er, Medicaid expansion.\u201dPullman offered this blunt assessment of Pence\u2019s plan.\nInstead, Pence has rebranded it as \u201cHealthy Indiana Plan 2.0,\u201d or HIP 2.0.\nYou can read the details of Pence\u2019s HIP 2.0 plan here.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIndiana Governor Mike Pence is showing leadership skills, but not ones the limited government, Tea Party wing of the Republican Party expected to see from him."}
