Fire Marshal Jason Collier says once firefighters arrived on scene they worked to contain the fire and keep it from spreading to other homes.\n\n\"Fire units kept it from going to any other apartments and actually saved some pets,\" Fire Marshal Jason Collier says, \"All the people were out of the building when fire units actually arrived.\"\n\nCollier says a fire this big required more man power, and other units were quickly dispatched to help in anyway they could.\n\n\"We brought a lot of extra crews in. The acting battalion chief did a great job in calling for help early, which is actually important,\" says Collier. \"He called a lot of extra help, mainly a lot of it was rehab and some of it was the size of the fire.\"\n\nCollier says investigators are going to process all of the evidence found at the scene and aren't going to assume anything until the investigation is complete.\n\nAs for the two juveniles connected to the fire, Detective Dareall Thompson of the Meridian Police Department says they are currently being held in the Juvenile Center in Rankin County where they are being charged with arson. Thompson says the juveniles will appear in Lauderdale County Youth Court this coming week.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Although investigation is still underway into the cause of the fire, two juveniles have been charged.", "language": "english", "author": "Aaron Morrison", "og": {"description": "Although investigation is still underway into the cause of the fire, two juveniles have been charged.", "title": "Two Juveniles Charged with Arson in Apartment Fire", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Western-Gardens-Apartment-Fire-Still-Under-Investigation-266887151.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/DBE/60E/DBE60E5F2C794ACF803827718A34FEA3", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/9B2/1E6/9B21E6BC5A55482D80E03FBE565A23CF.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Although investigation is still underway into the cause of the fire, two juveniles have been charged.", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Western-Gardens-Apartment-Fire-Still-Under-Investigation-266887151.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Western+Gardens+Fire.jpg", "title": "Two Juveniles Charged with Arson in Apartment Fire", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Two Juveniles Charged with Arson in Apartment Fire", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Two Juveniles Charged with Arson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2ac\"", "article_summary": "As for the two juveniles connected to the fire, Detective Dareall Thompson of the Meridian Police Department says they are currently being held in the Juvenile Center in Rankin County where they are being charged with arson.\nThompson says the juveniles will appear in Lauderdale County Youth Court this coming week.\nThe acting battalion chief did a great job in calling for help early, which is actually important,\" says Collier.\nFire Marshal Jason Collier says once firefighters arrived on scene they worked to contain the fire and keep it from spreading to other homes.\nThe investigation is still underway into the devastating fire that took the homes of many Friday afternoon at Western Gardens Apartments."}
