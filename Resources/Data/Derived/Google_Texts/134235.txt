The city’s public hospital system faces “unprecedented threats to our survival,” its president said Monday.

“I am not saying we are too big to fail. I am saying we are too important to fail,” Health and Hospitals president Ram Raju told the City Council.

He said Obamacare, despite “all its positive impact,” has dealt a financial blow to the already cash-strapped system, which runs 11 hospitals.

Cuts to federal aid for hospitals that care for uninsured patients could cost $300 million next year, and grow to $460 million a year after that. Health and Hospitals is also losing Medicaid funds. It faces a $1.2 billion budget gap next fiscal year.

“We cannot simply cut our way out of this dilemma,” Raju said.

In addition to lobbying the feds and state to change course, HHC’s turnaround plan depends on attracting more paying patients and signing more people up for its health insurance plan, MetroPlus.

But Raju acknowledged the changes are "not yet sufficient to assure our long term financial sustainability."

Councilman Corey Johnson, chair of the health committee, said he likes the ideas but doesn’t think they’ll be enough.

“It’s hard for me ... to have confidence our public hospital system is going to be able to continue to exist in New York City,” he said. “It’s hard for me to see how we are going to be able to dig our way out of this hole. ... I must tell you I don’t feel optimistic, and I’m a pretty optimistic guy, but the challenges just seem so steep. They seem so overwhelming.”

Health and Hospitals also recently took over health care at Rikers Island, the violence-plagued jail where the previous health provider, Corizon, had been widely criticized.

Johnson pressed Raju on whether he considered the practice of solitary confinement there to be “cruel and unusual.” It’s being ended for young inmates, but is still used for adults.

“I probably think it is,” Raju said.
