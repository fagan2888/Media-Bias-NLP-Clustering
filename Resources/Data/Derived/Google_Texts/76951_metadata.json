Consumer advocacy groups are now fighting what they see as a fraudulent practice.\n\nA Consumer Reports survey found that almost one-third of Americans have received a surprise medical bill within the past two years because their health insurance covered less than they had expected. Now Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, is pushing for states to sign legislation to stop these practices.\n\nSusan Gillen is just one of the people who fell victim to what she considers a fraudulent practice. Her son was rushed to the emergency room following a trampoline accident in July 2014, arriving at Mercy San Juan Hospital in Carmichael, California. The hospital accepted Gillen\u2019s insurance, but unbeknownst to her, that didn\u2019t necessarily mean treatment from everyone caring for her son at the hospital was covered.\n\nREAD MORE: Wells Fargo facing lawsuit after firing father of dying cancer patient over healthcare costs\n\nAlthough her son turned out fine, most of the pain was to come later in the form of billing and insurance issues.\n\n\u201cHonestly, the whole thing is a mess and I see it as fraudulent,\u201d Gillen told Healthline.\n\nBefore they even agreed to treat her son, Mercy San Juan Hospital had demanded that Gillen pay $6,250. She refused, telling them to send her a bill instead.\n\nCome January, she received another bill for $721 from an Ohio company she had never heard of called Acute Care Surgery. After contacting the company, Gillen learned that it was for the doctor who had treated her son in the emergency room six months earlier. He wasn\u2019t contracted with the hospital, even though Mercy San Juan was part of her insurance network.\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick my doctor. The hospital should only have doctors that accept the same insurance as they do,\u201d Gillen said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not my fault. Most people would have given up and paid it. I could just pay my bill, but I\u2019m mad.\u201d\n\nSince the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), more commonly known as Obamacare, cases like Gillen\u2019s are on the rise, according to Progress Illinois. The controversial federal healthcare law leaves few consumer protections against surprise billing, meaning that individuals who obtain health care coverage through the law\u2019s insurance exchanges can run into such problems.\n\nREAD MORE: 7.5 million Americans paid Obamacare penalty \u2013 IRS\n\n\u201cThe only exception for out-of-network charges under the ACA is for emergency services,\u201d America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) spokeswoman Courtney Jay told Progress Illinois.\n\nTo add insult to injury, a new report from AHIP found that out-of-network providers charged an average of three times more than what Medicare paid for the exact same service.\n\nAHIP studied 97 medical procedures performed from 2013 to 2014 across all 50 states. For 57 out of the 97 procedures, out-of-network charges billed by providers were at least triple the insured in-network price. Even the same services by the same providers were sometimes found to be more expensive when they were performed out-of-network.\n\nIn California, Consumer Watchdog and others have sued Blue Shield, an insurance company, for misleading its customers about the scope of coverage that their ACA plans offer. On Tuesday, California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care announced a settlement with Blue Shield on the matter, but this isn\u2019t enough for the consumer advocate. Consumer Watchdog said in a press release the settlement \u201cdoes not ensure that Blue Shield customers are fully reimbursed for the costs they incurred as a result of the company\u2019s misrepresentations regarding its network of doctors and hospitals.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years we have heard horror stories from consumers hit with surprise medical bills following routine and emergency procedures,\u201d she said in a press release. \u201cEven if you go to a hospital in your network, the unfortunate truth is that there is no guarantee that all your treatment \u2014 whether it\u2019s the radiologist, anesthesiologist, or lab work \u2014 will be treated as in-network, leaving patients owing thousands of dollars they never anticipated.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A third of all US patients report receiving surprise medical bills that they had thought would be covered by their insurance because of uncontracted workers providing care.
