They were expecting a tax refund this year. Randy Turner is disabled and draws Social security disability while Janice Turner works part-time. In 2014, she had no health insurance. So last year she signed up for the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare. They thought they were doing everything right to be eligible for a refund.\n\n\u201cThey took my taxes and I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know who took them or who got them. I\u2019d like to know who got them,\u201d said Randy Turner.\n\nThe Turners were surprised that they didn\u2019t get their full refund.\n\n\u201cWell we figured to get about the same as last year because our income hadn\u2019t changed, around $850 or a little more,\u201d said Janice Turner.\n\nTheir insurance was through the Community Health Alliance in Knoxville, which is now out of business. The couple believed they had made the proper decisions about her health insurance.\n\n\u201cWe went in there to take out insurance, told them we couldn\u2019t pay no $300 or $400 for insurance for her,\u201d said Randy Turner.\n\nThe cost of Janice Turner\u2019s insurance was $140 a month.\n\n\u201cWe sent her taxes and stuff in. It\u2019s based on her income,\u201d said Randy Turner.\n\nThey filled out a form 10-95A showing how much she made each month, but when they got their final tax return, it was a shocker.\n\nWe were supposed to get back $861. Then we went back over there, we got back $17,\u201d said Randy Turner. \u201cThat\u2019s a big hit.\u201d\n\nAt the tax office, Janice Turner was told she made some miscalculations last year.\n\n\u201cShe paid $139.99 a month,\u201d said Randy Turner. \u201cI thought we were doing right. Then they said we didn\u2019t pay enough premium. It\u2019s a rip off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think someone should have explained it to me. Maybe we should have paid more premium or something,\u201d said Janice Turner.\n\nLisa Atkins, a tax adviser in Knoxville, does not know the Turners nor did her company fill out their tax return. However, she says H&R Block has reported thousands of people like the Turners, couples who had insurance under the Affordable Care Act, but had money subtracted from their tax refund.\n\n\u201cIt is more of a technical problem because most people don\u2019t quite understand what they are doing. Sometimes they may have to seek out some assistance in figuring out how they need to apply for the healthcare marketplace insurance so they are getting the right subsidy,\u201d said Atkins.\n\nAtkins says the Turners didn\u2019t necessarily need to ask more questions to their insurance carrier.\n\n\u201cThe tax consultant is probably going to know more of the ins and outs, how it is going to affect your taxes. We can help you plan for that,\u201d she said.\n\nJanice Turner has decided not to sign up for Obamacare this year. Together they have learned a costly lesson.\n\n\u201cBe aware of what\u2019s going on before you get insurance. Make sure they explain it,\u201d said Randy Turner.\n\nAs Atkins said, it\u2019s your tax consultant who can best explain it or contact the IRS for assistance.\n\nThe tax preparation company H&R Block has reported that many people who went without health insurance in 2015 under the Affordable Care Act have ended up this tax season paying fines higher than in 2014. Among their customers who owe a penalty for the 2015 tax year, the average fine is $383 compared with $172 in 2014.\n\nSeparately, among those who have complied with the law and took advantage of Obamacare, six in ten are now having to pay back to the IRS some portion of their tax refund.\n\nThe Turners say they would have gotten more money back as a tax refund had they not signed up for the Affordable Care Act last year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Cocke County couple signed up with the Affordable Care Act were expecting to get hundreds of dollars as a tax refund this year, but they w\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mediageneral.wate", "og": {"site_name": "WATE 6 On Your Side", "description": "A Cocke County couple signed up with the Affordable Care Act were expecting to get hundreds of dollars as a tax refund this year, but they were shocked when their refund amounted to less than $20 a\u2026", "title": "Affordable Care Act miscalculation costs Cocke County couple most of tax refund", "url": "http://wate.com/2016/03/16/affordable-care-act-miscalculation-costs-cocke-county-couple-most-of-tax-refund/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvwate.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/vlcsnap-2016-03-16-17h57m50s199.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Cocke County couple signed up with the Affordable Care Act were expecting to get hundreds of dollars as a tax refund this year, but they were shocked when their refund amounted to less than $20 a\u2026", "creator": "@6News", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwate.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/vlcsnap-2016-03-16-17h57m50s199.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Affordable Care Act miscalculation costs Cocke County couple most of tax refund", "site": "6news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Knoxville, TN News & Weather", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id= 511297956", "fb": {"pages": 112945508738113}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WATE 6 On Your Side", "google-site-verification": "CV5oKVNQCepzG3ubMGxG21BH-llTVkuHAscpIom1HPI", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WATE6OnYourSide", "published_time": "2016-03-16T22:00:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-16T22:00:28+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wate.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1d4ffc72e0fc147870ebace80df0a02a?s=16"}, "article_summary": "So last year she signed up for the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare.\nThe Turners say they would have gotten more money back as a tax refund had they not signed up for the Affordable Care Act last year.\nRandy Turner is disabled and draws Social security disability while Janice Turner works part-time.\nThe cost of Janice Turner\u2019s insurance was $140 a month.\nHowever, she says H&R Block has reported thousands of people like the Turners, couples who had insurance under the Affordable Care Act, but had money subtracted from their tax refund."}
