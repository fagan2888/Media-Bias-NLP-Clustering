With the Affordable Care Act set to greatly expand the number of health care options, navigating the confusing health insurance landscape could become challenging.

But now, small business owners have a new resource to help them with the process. StartupInsurance, launched by YEC (Young Entrepreneur Council), an invite-only organization of elite entrepreneurs, is designed to provide business owners with a carefully curated collection of health care providers and affordable insurance plans from across the nation.

The online service offers startups, business owners and "job-unlocked" individuals (those who are likely to transition into self-employment as a result of being able to purchase health insurance options outside of traditional employers) direct access to affordable, quality health insurance options, all while removing confusion and time inefficiencies from the purchasing process, YEC says.

Each of the health care options StartupInsurance offers will be fully compliant with the Affordable Care Act by 2014, ensuring that insured individuals who purchase qualifying plans avoid tax penalties.

"As our nation becomes more entrepreneurial — and more Americans launch startups, start small businesses and join the booming "gig" economy — YEC wants to be there to support business owners and newly job-unlocked individuals by providing them with access to quality, affordable health care insurance options throughout the United States," said Scott Gerber, founder of YEC.

YEC says StartupInsurance's direct carrier partnerships allow for access to one of the largest major medical footprints in the United States, making insurance options available in nearly every state across the nation.

In the coming weeks, StartupInsurance's health insurance options will also be made available to the business customers and members of various organizations and corporations, including FedEx, Grasshopper, Wave Apps, LegalZoom, Moo, Startup Weekend, Dwolla, Crowdspring, 99designs and others.

"As we enter uncertain times with the changing health care landscape, these insurance products will bring certainty and predictability for our customers," said Kirk Simpson, co-founder and CEO of Wave Apps.
