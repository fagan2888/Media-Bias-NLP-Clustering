After a bunch of winking and blinking, and a little conversation, I realized cutie\u2019s good looks might have been his greatest asset.\n\nIt got me to thinking about the number of organizations that offer senior discounts, whether we use them as often as we might, and whether there is any \u201cshame in our game\u201d about age.\n\nOf course, we know that every day above ground is a blessing, and every day of life, at 16 or 60, is a gift. We can save a few dollars, or sometimes more than a few, if we aggressively seek out senior discounts. We can ask retail establishments if they offer a senior discount, and use our AARP membership card to get discounts when we can. Ten percent here, 15 percent there add up. Sometimes we have to ask and resist the vanity that tells us that we don\u2019t look 60, and don\u2019t want to act that way either.\n\n>> Celebrate Black History Month: Get 20% Off Membership Dues and a Free Gift When Joining AARP.\n\nWould you pass up a discount if it were offered because you are an automotive club member or carry a certain credit card?
