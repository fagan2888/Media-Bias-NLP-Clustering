They can also be used to save for retirement. As with other types of tax deferred accounts, however, an HSA comes with a lot of rules that must be followed. We\u2019ll cover the requirements, rules and regulations in this detailed guide to Health Spending Accounts.\n\nAs healthcare costs in the United States have continued to rise, consumer-driven healthcare plans have become more common. But, with the advent of Obamacare and the subsequent Health Insurance Marketplace, they\u2019ve really taken off.\n\nAt its core, consumer-driven healthcare is about putting the power of healthcare spending decisions back into the hands of the consumer. With a consumer-driven plan, you\u2019re often free to shop around between providers to price out various services. This is different from older health plans, where your doctor assigned you to one network specialist, and off you went.\n\nWith the growth of the consumer-driven health plan, consumers have more power to make healthcare choices. But they\u2019re typically expected to foot a larger portion of the bill.\n\nThis can come as a shock to the financial system for many of us who are used to more traditional $10-copay health insurance plans. This is where the Health Savings Account comes in. This specialized account can help you save for upcoming healthcare expenses while netting tax benefits.\n\nHealthcare Savings Accounts are only available for certain types of health plans, and there are as many contribution and withdrawal rules governing these accounts as there are with tax-advantaged retirement savings plans. Despite their complex nature, though, HSAs can be a great savings vehicle attached to your consumer-driven healthcare plan.\n\nBefore you sign up for your company\u2019s HSA or choose an independent healthcare plan that includes one, be sure you understand all the in and outs of this type of account. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is an HSA?\n\nAn HSA is kind of like a retirement savings account for your healthcare expenses. It\u2019s a tax-preferred account, which means that money you contribute isn\u2019t taxed. Over the course of a year, contributions to an HSA can generate serious tax savings, which we\u2019ll talk about in a minute.\n\nLike other tax-preferred accounts, HSAs come with both withdrawal and contribution limits. The withdrawal limits are fairly straightforward. Money in the account can be used for healthcare-related expenses, including vision and dental care expenses. Each year, the federal government sets contribution limits for individuals and families using HSAs.\n\nHow to Qualify\n\nTo qualify for an HSA, you must first be signed up for a qualifying health plan. These health plans are known as High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs). To qualify for an HSA in 2016, your plan must have a minimum individual deductible of $1,300 and a minimum family deductible of $2,600. For most of these plans, this means that you must pay $1,300 out of pocket for one person before your insurance will kick in to cover additional expenses. Many HDHPs have a higher deductible, but this is the minimum to qualify for an HSA.\n\nOne other qualification: you can\u2019t be covered by other health plans except what\u2019s allowed in the federal guidelines. Acceptable coverage includes liability coverage like workers\u2019 compensation, coverage for a specific illness or disease, disability insurance, dental care, vision care, or long-term care insurance.\n\nPlus, you cannot use HSA funds if you also have access to a full-fledged flexible spending account (FSA). You can, however, use an HSA in tandem with a limited-use FSA \u2013 one that only covers vision and dental care.\n\nRegardless of whether your health plan is employer-sponsored or individual, you qualify for using an HSA provided the plan meets these parameters. Many employers now offer sponsored HSAs, which makes signing up and administrating the account particularly simple. Also, many of the plans on today\u2019s health insurance marketplace include HSAs that are attached to your healthcare plan.\n\nHowever, you don\u2019t need to have a healthcare plan with an attached HSA in order to own an HSA. As long as your existing healthcare plan meets these parameters, you can open an HSA independently. Many banks and credit unions now offer and administer HSAs. To sign up, you\u2019ll just have to prove that your healthcare plan qualifies.\n\nChoosing an HSA\n\nEven if you\u2019re in an employer-sponsored healthcare plan that comes with an HSA option, you are still free to shop around for an account, just as long as your healthcare plan otherwise qualifies. We\u2019ll talk about using your HSA as an investment in a moment, but know up front that this is a possibility. If your employer\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t offer good HSA investment options, consider taking your funds elsewhere.\n\nShopping around for an HSA is a wise option, but there are a couple of potential caveats to consider:\n\nEmployer contributions. Your employer may or may not choose to contribute to an alternative personal HSA. If this is part of your potential benefits package, be sure you don\u2019t lose out on this free money. You can, in fact, open up multiple HSAs. Use the employer-sponsored account to net any employer contributions, but shift your own funds to an independent HSA that offers better investing options. This is fine, so long as the total annual contribution to all accounts is less than or equal to that year\u2019s maximum.\n\nYour employer may or may not choose to contribute to an alternative personal HSA.

This is fine, so long as the total annual contribution to all accounts is less than or equal to that year\u2019s maximum. Pretax vs. post-tax. With an employer-sponsored HSA, contributions are usually taken from your paycheck pretax. As a result, the savings are realized up front. With an independent HSA, you\u2019ll likely make post-tax contributions, so you won\u2019t see the savings until you file your taxes. This isn\u2019t necessarily a deal-breaker, but is certainly worth consideration.\n\nWhere to Open an HSA\n\nIf you plan to open an HSA on your own, there are countless options. The key considerations include finding HSAs with a reputable company that offers low fees and good investment options. One of our favorites is Health Savings Administrators.\n\nIt offers low cost investment options from Vanguard. It also comes with a debit card tied to the HSA. And its administrative fees are reasonable.\n\nContributing to an HSA\n\nAs with tax-advantaged retirement accounts, HSAs have federally-set limits on annual contributions. These limits typically rise year to year. For 2016, the individual contribution limit is $3,350, and the family limit is $6,750. If you\u2019ll be age 55 or older in 2016, you can make an additional $1,000 contribution to your account.\n\nIf you\u2019re using an employer-sponsored HSA, this limit is the combined contributions from you and your employer. In other words, if your employer\u2019s benefits package includes a $2,000 annual contribution to your HSA, you can only contribute $1,350 if you\u2019re on an individual plan and $4,750 if you\u2019re on a family plan.\n\nSpeaking of individual vs. family plans, there\u2019s one interesting caveat to HSA contributions. The contribution limit applies based on the people covered by your qualifying HDHP, but the funds can be distributed for any of your dependents.\n\nFor example, Mr. and Mrs. Jones are on different employer-sponsored healthcare plans because Mrs. Jones\u2019s employer will only sponsor coverage for herself and their two children. Mrs. Jones\u2019s healthcare plan has a low deductible, so it doesn\u2019t qualify for an HSA.\n\nMr. Jones, however, is on his own employer-sponsored HDHP. His plan offers an attached HSA, and he wants to contribute. Mr. Jones can only contribute up to the individual limit of $3,350 in 2016. However, he can use the funds he\u2019s contributed to cover healthcare expenses for Mrs. Jones and their children, even though they aren\u2019t covered by his actual healthcare plan.\n\nThis can get pretty confusing, and it\u2019s always good to speak with your healthcare administrator to be clear on the rules before signing up for HSA contributions.\n\nWays to Contribute\n\nIf you\u2019re on an employer-sponsored healthcare plan with an attached HSA, chances are you can choose to have contributions automatically taken out of your paycheck. These contributions should be taken out of your check before your check is taxed. They\u2019ll save you on your taxes on the front-end by reducing your taxable income. With most employers, you simply have to sign up for per-paycheck or per-year contributions during open enrollment time, or when you\u2019re hired on.\n\nIf your employer adds to your HSA as part of your benefits, this should be made clear in healthcare enrollment paperwork. Some employers will \u201cfront-load\u201d the account with the full year\u2019s worth of their promised contribution. Others contribute a certain dollar amount per paycheck or per month until they hit the promised contribution. It\u2019s not unusual for employers to use a combination of these approaches, contributing 50% of the total on January 1, and then adding the rest in on a per-paycheck basis.\n\nWhat if you\u2019re opening an independent HSA or using an independent healthcare plan with an attached HSA? In this case, you\u2019ll have to add after-tax contributions to your account. You can talk with your account administrator about how to do this. Typically, it\u2019s simple to set up recurring transfers to the account so your contributions will be seamless.\n\nThe main difference here is that your contributions aren\u2019t saving you taxes up front. Instead, you\u2019ll get paperwork at the end of the year detailing your total contributions, which will then become a tax deduction when you file taxes.\n\nUsing Your HSA\n\nAny expense that would qualify for a dental or health care deduction on your taxes qualifies for an HSA distribution. The comprehensive list is found in IRS Publication 502. They include any expenses for the \u201cdiagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease\u201d and include prescription medications.\n\nClearly, the qualified expenses are pretty broad. If you have questions about a specific expense, it\u2019s worth your time to contact your healthcare plan administrator.\n\nMany HSAs come with specialized debit cards that you can use for medical expenses. Often, these limited-use debit cards will reject any transactions that are clearly non-medical. But, you still may be required to provide receipts to the account administrator and, later, the IRS proving that any HSA distributions were for expressly medical expenses.\n\nOther HSAs work on a reimbursement model. In other words, you\u2019ll pay for the expense out of pocket and then send your receipts to the HSA administrator. The administrator will verify the expense and send you a reimbursement by check or direct deposit to your bank account.\n\nIf you have the option, the first option is typically easier on your budget. With the reimbursement model, you\u2019re paying into the HSA, ideally, month by month. So your taxable income is already reduced. Then, you have to pay out of pocket for the medical expense, and wait\u2013sometimes a month or more\u2013for your reimbursement to come in. You\u2019ll still reap the tax benefits, but this model can be tough if you\u2019re on a tight budget.\n\nInvesting with Your HSA\n\nDepending on where your HSA is set up, you can likely invest the funds into mutual funds or other investments. Like a 401(k), interest is tax-free, as long as your distributions are made appropriately. In the case of an HSA, you\u2019ll avoid tax penalties as long as all withdrawals are for qualified healthcare expenses.\n\nInvesting with your HSA is similar to investing with a retirement account, though options may be more limited at this time. Also, according to Betterment, HSA investing costs aren\u2019t as regulated as costs for 401(k)s, so be sure you get a full schedule of fees and charges before you sign up.\n\nAlso, check out different HSA providers\u2019 investing options. Some offer full-featured mutual fund options. Others may only offer an account like a typical savings account, which will bear very little interest. You\u2019ll also want to take charge of investing your HSA funds to be sure you\u2019re getting the most bang for your buck.\n\nIn some cases, an HSA can be a great additional savings vehicle for retirement. If you find yourself with extra money to save and generally low healthcare expenses, add your HSA to your overall savings strategy. Roll funds over from year to year, and make wise investing decisions. By the time you get to retirement, and likely to the point in your life where your medical care costs are rising, you could have a nice nest egg saved for those specific expenses.\n\nDetermining HSA Contributions\n\nOne of the best benefits of HSAs (as opposed to their cousins, Flexible Spending Accounts) is that their contents roll over from year to year. There\u2019s no limit to the HSA\u2019s balance, so you can continue saving the maximum each year \u2013 even if you have minimal healthcare expenses.\n\nHowever, you may not want to contribute the maximum annually. If, for instance, you\u2019re prioritizing paying off debt, you may want to make a more conservative contribution to free up funds for debt payments. Depending on your health circumstances, you may also want to prioritize other ways of saving, such as retirement accounts.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to carefully consider how much you\u2019re likely to spend on healthcare expenses in a given year when setting your annual contribution. This is less important if you\u2019re making after-tax contributions to an HSA. If you have a major health event during the year, you can always put more money into the account in order to net tax savings before paying your healthcare expenses.\n\nSince you can roll over HSA funds from year to year, it\u2019s not a problem to contribute more than you\u2019ll spend that year. But many employer-sponsored plans only allow you to change per-paycheck contributions during open enrollment. So it\u2019s best to try to hit the right contribution level for you annually.\n\nLook through last year\u2019s healthcare expenses to start. Be sure to account for any changes in your health plan this year, such as higher deductibles or out-of-pocket maximums. Then, think about any additional expenses you\u2019d expect in the coming year. For instance, if you\u2019re trying to add a baby to the family, you might want to consider maxing out the account for a year!\n\nBe thoughtful about your contributions, but don\u2019t stress about it too much. Additional contributions could be invested, earning interest that you can use for future health expenses.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nHealth Savings Accounts aren\u2019t for everyone, and they don\u2019t fit with every healthcare plan. But if your healthcare plan offers an HSA, it\u2019s a great option for saving money on taxes, or even as an additional retirement savings vehicle.\n\nNext Steps\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "With HSA health plans becoming more popular, you need to understand how they work.
