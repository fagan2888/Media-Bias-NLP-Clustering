Our goal is to eliminate those instances; we offer many features and pumps that other DME companies do not,\u201d says Jennifer Jordan, Aeroflow\u2019s Business Development Team Leader.\n\nMedela is regarded as the top breastpumps manufacturer by hospitals and mothers around the world. \u201cWe are grateful for the strong relationship we have with Medela. We are able to offer the best pumps to mothers, and even offer upgrade models far above what other DME companies can supply,\u201d says Jordan.\n\nAmong Medela breastpumps offered by Aeroflow Healthcare are the Medela Pump In Style Advanced with options to add a cooler set and stylish carrying bag, and the Medela Freestyle, which has the same features as the Pump In Style Advanced but with added benefits such as hands-free pumping, a digital display, and long-lasting battery.\n\nAeroflow Healthcare works with leading insurances such as Aetna, United Healthcare, Blue Cross and Blue Shield and select smaller insurance companies as well. \u201cWe do our best to make the process as quick and easy as possible. Aeroflow takes care of all paperwork, and communication with insurance and physicians. All moms have to do is fill out our qualification form online, choose which pump they want, and we\u2019ll send it out based on their insurance,\u201d says Customer Service Representative, Courtney Bradshaw. She says that the response from mothers has been overwhelmingly positive, and the team is hoping to carry this momentum into the second half of 2014.\n\nMedela and Aeroflow are partnering up in more than just products, and will soon be offering online breastfeeding education and support to mothers who get their pumps through Aeroflow, as well as expos and forums for pregnant women in the Southeast (near Aeroflow Healthcare headquarters). \u201cThrough education and Aeroflow\u2019s simple qualification process, we hope to eliminate any stress associated with breastfeeding.
