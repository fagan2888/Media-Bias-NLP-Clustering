Kevin Yoder\u2019s amendment to withhold Homeland Security funds from cities and counties that don\u2019t strictly enforce federal immigration laws.\n\nYoder, a Republican representing Kansas\u2019 eastern 3rd District, introduced the amendment to target so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d which, conservatives argue, allow undocumented immigrants to skirt deportation.\n\n\u201cCongress must take a strong stand against sanctuary cities that support illegal immigration by giving aid and comfort to violent felons,\u201d Yoder said Tuesday.\n\nThe House Appropriations Committee, which Yoder is a member of, voted 28-21 to adopt Yoder\u2019s amendment to an annual appropriations bill for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHeated rhetoric over sanctuary cities has spawned in recent weeks from the July 1 slaying of Kathryn Steinle, 32, in San Francisco. The man accused of killing her, Francisco Sanchez, has been deported several times and has a list of felony convictions.\n\n\u201cThe heartbreaking tragedy in San Francisco was preventable and we must do everything we can to ensure that it never happens again,\u201d Yoder said.\n\nAccording to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the law enforcement agency had requested that Sanchez remain in custody while he awaited processing by ICE but he was instead released April 15. Conservatives, including several presidential contenders, have called on Justice Department officials to pressure cities and counties to more strictly enforce immigration laws in the wake of Steinle\u2019s death.\n\nYoder\u2019s amendment mirrors that of a Senate amendment put forth by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark.\n\nYoder\u2019s office said Tuesday there are about 300 cities and counties in the U.S. that act as a sanctuary to some extent, citing a recent report by the anti-immigration Center for Immigration Studies. Among those counties listed is Shawnee County, though county counselor Rich Eckert said Tuesday that the county isn\u2019t a sanctuary.\n\n\u201cWe are following federal case law. I don\u2019t know how we got on the list,\u201d Eckert said.\n\nIn June 2014, the Shawnee County Department of Corrections announced it would no longer honor ICE requests for a detainer, a request to hold someone indefinitely, without first receiving a warrant or show of probable cause.\n\n\u201cWe want to cooperate with all of the law enforcement agencies, but we have to have probable cause,\u201d Maj. Timothy Phelps, deputy director of administrative and investigative services for the Shawnee County DOC, said at the time. \u201cWe have to respond to the way the law has shifted.\u201d\n\nA few months before the county\u2019s decision, a federal judge in Oregon ruled that a county had violated the rights of an individual by complying with an ICE detainer.\n\nYoder\u2019s amendment and its Senate counterpart are likely to garner plenty of support from the all-Republican Kansas congressional delegation. Asked at a town hall Saturday for his opinion on sanctuary cities, Sen. Jerry Moran said he thinks they are illegal.\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp of western Kansas said on Twitter last week that man accused of killing Steinle \u201cwas in San Francisco because it was a sanctuary city. That\u2019s where she was gunned down.\u201d The tea party Republican also said President Barack Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t support sanctuary cities; only a sanctuary nation.\u201d\n\nRep. Lynn Jenkins also supports a crackdown on sanctuary cities and counties, telling WIBW-TV on Monday that sanctuary policies are \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cin clear violation of existing immigration laws.\u201d\n\nYoder\u2019s amendment still has a long road to passage as the Homeland Security funding bill makes its way through the full House and Senate before landing on the desk of the president, likely an opponent of the idea.\n\nBut Yoder said Tuesday local governments that shelter undocumented immigrants should run the risk of losing federal financial support.\n\n\u201cCities that refuse to comply with immigration officials and release dangerous criminals back into our communities put innocent American lives at risk,\u201d Yoder said. \u201cIf these cities wish to continue to subvert the law they will do so without the support of American taxpayers.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Shawnee County, the Center for Immigration Studies identifies five other Kansas counties that act as sanctuaries: Finney County, Sedgwick County, Harvey County, Butler County and Johnson County, which Yoder represents.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, State, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "A U.S. House committee on Tuesday approved Rep.
