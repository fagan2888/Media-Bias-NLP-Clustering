In a region with a long and bloody history of ethnic conflicts and political instability, the developments have caused consternation both domestically and abroad.\n\nMonths of accusations between rival politicians locked in a power struggle have plunged the country into one of its deepest political crises since Macedonia gained independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991.\n\nPotential trouble looms again on Sunday, when the opposition plans an anti-government rally billed as the largest Macedonia has ever seen in the capital, Skopje. The protests are supposed to continue for days, and a rival pro-government protest has been called for Monday.\n\nSunday\u2019s opposition rally \u201cwill be a historic day of reckoning for the current government of Macedonia,\u201d said Nikola Dimitrov, a former national security adviser. \u201cThe increasingly authoritarian regime of (Prime Minister Nikola) Gruevski will face a crowd of citizens craving freedom, democracy, rule of law and accountability.\u201d\n\nDimitrov, now a fellow at The Hague Institute for Global Justice, predicted that \u201cin an all-or-nothing situation, (the government) will be ready to pay a very high price to survive.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the crisis is a massive cache of wiretapped conversations that the head of the opposition Social Democrats, Zoran Zaev, has been releasing since January. Zaev claims that Gruevski, in power for nearly a decade, was behind the mass wiretapping of more than 20,000 Macedonians, including ministers, politicians, police, journalists, judges, foreign ambassadors and religious leaders.\n\nThose conversations, which Zaev said were leaked to him by \u201cpatriots\u201d in the domestic intelligence service, purport to reveal corruption at the highest levels of government, including the mismanagement of funds, spurious criminal prosecutions of opponents and even attempted cover-ups of killings. He has demanded that Gruevski resign and new elections be held.\n\nOpposition parties have been boycotting parliament for nearly a year since accusing the governing coalition of fraud in the April 2014 election.\n\nGruevski, who has won successive elections since 2006, angrily rejects the accusations. He accuses Zaev of participating in a coup plot backed by unnamed foreign spy agencies seeking to overthrow his conservative government.\n\nSome Macedonians are worried.\n\n\u201cI am afraid that Macedonia could enter into civic conflict with unpredictable consequences,\u201d said Julijana Petrovska, a 64-year-old retired economist. \u201cPeople are so stubborn \u2026 and divided that things could get out of control easily.\u201d\n\nBut others blame the opposition for creating instability.\n\nZaev \u201cstarted to publish recordings he got from foreign spies and now he wants to seize power illegally, without elections,\u201d said Jovan, a 23-year-old law student who would only give his first name for fear of reprisals. \u201cHe is the one the most responsible for this crisis.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Macedonia divided: Corruption, armed rebellion splits nation", "title": "Macedonia divided: Corruption, armed rebellion splits nation", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Macedonia divided: Corruption, armed rebellion splits nation", "title": "Macedonia divided: Corruption, armed rebellion splits nation", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/16/macedonia_divided_corruption_armed_rebellion_splits_nation/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/macedonia-politics.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Macedonia divided: Corruption, armed rebellion splits nation", "title": "Macedonia divided: Corruption, armed rebellion splits nation", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/macedonia-politics.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Konstantin Testorides", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Sunday\u2019s opposition rally \u201cwill be a historic day of reckoning for the current government of Macedonia,\u201d said Nikola Dimitrov, a former national security adviser.\n\u201cI am afraid that Macedonia could enter into civic conflict with unpredictable consequences,\u201d said Julijana Petrovska, a 64-year-old retired economist.\nPotential trouble looms again on Sunday, when the opposition plans an anti-government rally billed as the largest Macedonia has ever seen in the capital, Skopje.\n\u201cPeople are so stubborn \u2026 and divided that things could get out of control easily.\u201dBut others blame the opposition for creating instability.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) \u2014 Macedonia\u2019s short history of independence has been a troubled one \u2014 and its political turmoil appears to be getting worse."}
