Fire departments say they can\u2019t afford to pay for insurance.\n\n\u201cMost of these are operating on a shoestring budget \u2014 holding pancake dinners to raise money to put enough gas in the truck so they can respond to the next fire, the next medical call,\u201d said Dave Finger, director of government relations for the National Volunteer Fire Council.\n\nFaced with the cost of insurance, or being fined if they fail to provide it, departments would likely be forced to reduce the number of hours that firefighters can volunteer or to eliminate the benefit programs, officials said. That has both fire chiefs and lawmakers raising concerns.\n\nDarrel Fournier, fire chief in Freeport, said his department is bracing for what could be significant costs under the health care law. He expects he\u2019ll have to provide coverage for the five firefighters he employs part time. That would cost the town \u2014 and ultimately taxpayers \u2014 about $75,000, or a penalty of $150,000.\n\nAdditionally, in a busy winter with lots of fires, emergency calls and accidents, he said his roughly 50 volunteers could work more than 30 hours a week, meeting the threshold under the law that would require him to provide health insurance for them as well.\n\nTo avoid the penalty, Freeport could cut back on the number of hours that part-time and volunteer firefighters have to work. But that would mean finding more volunteers to make up the difference, something the department and others across the country already struggle to do, Fournier said. When he started in Freeport in 1972, there was a waiting list of 25 people. Now, after three months actively recruiting in the community, Fournier said he\u2019s lucky that he\u2019ll soon be interviewing nine potential volunteer firefighters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing how this law is touching different operations,\u201d he said in an interview in Freeport\u2019s brick firehouse, where yellow fire trucks and ambulances were lined up awaiting the next call. \u201cI\u2019m not sure everyone thought that through.\u201d\n\nThe question is expected to be answered when the Internal Revenue Service releases final regulations this year before the provision takes effect in 2015. A Treasury spokeswoman said the department is taking the concerns into account as it works toward the final regulations, but wouldn\u2019t comment on what they\u2019re likely to include.\n\nIn the meantime, Maine\u2019s U.S. senators are backing a recently introduced bill aimed at ensuring that volunteer firefighters and other emergency responders are exempt from the health care law requirement. Republicans point to the confusion as another example of the problems with the law, which has been plagued by a fumbled rollout and criticism over canceled health care plans.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another adverse and unanticipated impact of Obamacare,\u201d said Maine Republican Susan Collins.\n\nCity and town leaders are also discussing ways to keep their staff under 50 employees to dodge the costs, Maine Municipal Association officials said. School superintendents are making sure their substitute teachers aren\u2019t working more than 30 hours a week to avoid having to cover them, Collins said.\n\nOthers point to factors that they say show the concern is overblown. Many small towns only have about 20 to 30 volunteer firefighters, likely making them too small to be affected by the law\u2019s mandate. And though Fournier described a busy winter with a lot of work for firefighters, they often fall short of working enough hours to be affected by the insurance requirement. Most volunteers also receive insurance coverage through their primary work as teachers, business professionals or city employees.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to ring the alarm, concluded Trish Riley, an adjunct professor of health policy at the University of Southern Maine\u2019s Muskie School of Public Service.\n\n\u201cWith any major piece of legislation like this, there are bound to be unintended consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t leap to conclusions before the federal government has the opportunity to address it.\u201d\n\nFinger said he\u2019s confident the issue will ultimately be addressed either through the regulations or legislation and is urging fire departments to avoid taking any immediate steps. But he realizes that the political tension over the health care law means that even a small change can turn into a big fight.\n\n\u201cThe tough part is, anything having to do with this law is just so partisan that it\u2019s difficult to take action on,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many may be entitled to insurance, but small towns that can\u2019t afford to pay for it will be facing a burden.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Many may be entitled to insurance, but small towns that can\u2019t afford to pay for it will be facing a burden.", "title": "Health care law may add volunteer firefighter costs - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/20140106_834335.xml-Health+Overhaul+Vounteer+Firef.jpg", "height": 666}, "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/01/05/health_law_leaves_volunteer_firefighting_in_limbo_/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many may be entitled to insurance, but small towns that can\u2019t afford to pay for it will be facing a burden.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/20140106_834335.xml-Health+Overhaul+Vounteer+Firef.jpg", "title": "Health care law may add volunteer firefighter costs - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "published_time": "2014-01-05T11:54:07-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc881\"", "article_summary": "But he realizes that the political tension over the health care law means that even a small change can turn into a big fight.\nDarrel Fournier, fire chief in Freeport, said his department is bracing for what could be significant costs under the health care law.\nIn the meantime, Maine\u2019s U.S. senators are backing a recently introduced bill aimed at ensuring that volunteer firefighters and other emergency responders are exempt from the health care law requirement.\nAdditional Photos Freeport Fire Chief Darrel Fournier is wary of how the health care law will affect his department\u2019s budget and his roughly 50 volunteers.\nMany small towns only have about 20 to 30 volunteer firefighters, likely making them too small to be affected by the law\u2019s mandate."}
