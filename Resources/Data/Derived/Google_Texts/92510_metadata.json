Foster Stadium on Friday night. ( Brandon Hopper / Daily Record )\n\nColorado Springs \u2014 A 49-21 win against the Widefield Gladiators on Friday night wasn't enough to propel the Ca\u00f1on City Tigers into the Class 4A state playoffs.\n\n\"If we would have played that well all the time, then maybe, maybe, maybe,\" Tigers coach Tom O'Rourke said.\n\nCa\u00f1on City finished the season 6-4 and missed the playoffs for the first time in six years when it went 5-5 in 2007. When the wild card points were released on Sunday, the Tigers were in 21st and the top 16 qualified.\n\nSenior Tyler Templeton ran the ball for 205 yards on 16 carries and scored three times \u2014 from 39, 25 and 12 yards.\n\nThe win prolonged the program's streak of not losing two games in a row in the same season since 2009.\n\nPerfect final play\n\nSenior quarterback Logan Nethercot's final play of his high school football career couldn't have gone any better. Up 49-21 with seconds left on the clock, he rolled out to the right and was hit hard by Desmond Holmes for a sack.\n\nIt was the first time Holmes had played this season, and Widefield head coach Brent Cottrell said Holmes is mentally disabled.\n\n\"It's great. He's a great kid,\" Cottrell said. \"What Ca\u00f1on City did was amazing. He's pretty happy, our kids are happy for him. The coach that was here before me did a great job with him, and he's just a great kid to have around.\"\n\nEven after the teams shook hands, Holmes was still celebrating the sack with his teammates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Now that it's happened I don't think I'd want anything else,\" Nethercot said. \"That was a special moment. I wanted to make sure I was the guy who did that because I've always wanted to do something special.\"\n\nThe Tigers' second-teamers had been in the game, including backup quarterback Zach Manchester.\n\nTigers coach Tom O'Rourke knew nothing of the play until it happened, but he said it speaks to the kind of kids that Ca\u00f1on City High School has.\n\nNethercot (Brandon Hopper / Daily Record)\n\nHolmes entered the game with less than a minute on the clock and lined up in the safety position. Visibly thrilled to be in the game, he was giving hard high fives to his teammates. Even though the Tigers took a knee on his first play, an excited Holmes continued with the high fives.\n\nThen an official called him to line up at the cornerback position near the Widefield sideline for the next play. Nethercot rolled out in a light jog and sold the hard hit by lifting his feet off the ground on contact.\n\nThe announcer in the press box and the Widefield fans and players let out a loud burst of excitement on the hit. Cottrell said it was the first play of Holmes' high school varsity career.\n\nAfter the game Nethercot said his lip was bleeding from the play.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_24446300/ca-city-tigers-football-misses-playoffs-1st-time", "modificationDate": "2013-11-03T13:14:17-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/1103/20131103__04drCFOw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Brandon Hopper \n \n  hopperb@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Colorado Springs \u2014 A 49-21 win against the Widefield Gladiators on Friday night wasn't enough to propel the Ca\u00f1on City Tigers into the Class 4A state playoffs.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:24446300:view"}, "startDate": "2013-11-03T13:11:49-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_24446300/ca-city-tigers-football-misses-playoffs-1st-time", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/1103/20131103__04drCFOw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Colorado Springs \u2014 A 49-21 win against the Widefield Gladiators on Friday night wasn't enough to propel the Ca\u00f1on City Tigers into the Class 4A state playoffs.", "title": "Ca\u00f1on City Tigers football misses playoffs for 1st time since 2007"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Colorado Springs \u2014 A 49-21 win against the Widefield Gladiators on Friday night wasn't enough to propel the Ca\u00f1on City Tigers into the Class 4A state playoffs.", "title": "Ca\u00f1on City Tigers football misses playoffs for 1st time since 2007", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_24446300/ca-city-tigers-football-misses-playoffs-1st-time", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/1103/20131103__04drCFOw~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-03T13:11:49-0700", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2023-11-03T13:08:43-0600", "sailthru.title": "Ca\u00f1on City Tigers football misses playoffs for 1st time since 2007", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Brandon Hopperhopperb@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/1103/20131103__04drCFOw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2013-11-03T13:15:31-0700", "news_keywords": "Canyon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canyon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf598\"", "article_summary": "Ca\u00f1on City finished the season 6-4 and missed the playoffs for the first time in six years when it went 5-5 in 2007.\nTrey Owen gets a block from Chris Pilafas and runs for the touchdown during the Ca\u00f1on City Tigers' football game against the Widefield Gladiators at C.A.\n\"If we would have played that well all the time, then maybe, maybe, maybe,\" Tigers coach Tom O'Rourke said.\n( Brandon Hopper / Daily Record )Colorado Springs \u2014 A 49-21 win against the Widefield Gladiators on Friday night wasn't enough to propel the Ca\u00f1on City Tigers into the Class 4A state playoffs.\nTigers coach Tom O'Rourke knew nothing of the play until it happened, but he said it speaks to the kind of kids that Ca\u00f1on City High School has."}
