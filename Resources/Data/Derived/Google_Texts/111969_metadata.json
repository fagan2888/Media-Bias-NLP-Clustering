In every direction, you\u2019ll see only greens and golds, scrub and boulders. All of it dwarfed by an immensity of sky. If you\u2019re lucky, you might come across a figure. And it\u2019s just some fellow wanderer to you until you notice that one arm is sheathed in a stiff, medieval-looking glove. On that glove? Something that belongs to the sky.\n\nYou\u2019re not on a Game of Thrones set. You\u2019ve stumbled across a master of falconry \u2014 a Black woman, no less. These days, falconry is a little-known club of people blurring the lines of hobby, history, pet ownership and hunting. It\u2019s also an ancient art that dates back thousands of years and was once practiced by Genghis Khan. But a handful of people have brought it back to life.\n\nMeet Tiffany White. The curvy, curly-haired woman with the chunky silver jewelry is one of only about 4,800 American falconers, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The falconers of yore were out to feed their families. For White, 44, falconry is all about passion. To pay the bills and put gas in her black Mustang convertible, she does marketing for a mystery novel publisher. Weird as it sounds, working with these birds is a way for her to relax.\n\nTo become a falconer, you essentially have to be married to the sport.\n\nIt started when she was a fisheries biologist for the state of Florida, and a colleague brought in her kestrel. Falconry has never been a whim, nor could it be. \u201cYou have to jump through hoops,\u201d White says. That\u2019s one way of putting it. The process is intriguingly feudal: Aspiring falconers must start as apprentices \u2014 there\u2019s a test and an inspection \u2014 spending at least two years with a veteran sponsor. From there you become a general falconer. Stick it out for another four or so years \u2014 learning about raptor biology, ornithological diseases and treatments, relevant laws and more \u2014 and you might just earn the title of master falconer.\n\nIt\u2019s been 20 years since White began. She is single, with no kids \u2014 but she has two hawks, Morpheus and Morgana. To become a falconer, you essentially have to be married to the sport. \u201cI\u2019m not the type to settle down,\u201d White says.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of people who would be repelled by this hobby. Keeping a wild animal locked up is unethical, says Ashley Byrne, a campaign specialist at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. The pastime not only terrorizes and kills game birds for pleasure, she says, but also causes falcons to become neurotic and self-mutilate. For falcons, \u201ca life in captivity where they are denied everything that is natural to them is a miserable experience.\u201d Even state game and wildlife officials acknowledge the problems. \u201cAnytime you are talking wildlife, there\u2019s a certain sensitivity,\u201d says Tim Snow, a falconry administrator and regional non-game specialist for the Arizona Game and Fish Commission.\n\nThe agency\u2019s regulations include health inspections and a requirement for spacious housing, which is one reason all this can burn a hole in your pocket. Back in the day, hunters captured their own birds, but falconers today can buy them too. Many of White\u2019s falconer friends come from the Middle East, especially places like oil-rich Dubai. She recalls one saker falcon going for a cool $750,000 at auction in the UAE. Her Harris\u2019s hawk Morpheus? A more down-to-earth $750, yes, but still a far cry from the cost of hiking boots or movie tickets.\n\nBut it\u2019s a cost the true falconer isn\u2019t going to complain about it, even if this is a curious pursuit \u2014 spending all that time with creatures designed to fly, fly away from you. As for White, she has her eye on a new member of the family: a golden eagle, a bird that is revered in this circle. \u201cTo me, that is a dream.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIt\u2019s all about seeing your babies eat.
