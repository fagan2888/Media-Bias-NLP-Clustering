The Wayne County medical examiner's office says the unarmed 35-year-old man who was fatally shot by a suburban Detroit officer had multiple gunshot wounds.

Spokesman Lloyd Jackson said Saturday in an email that Kevin Matthews' death was ruled a homicide.

The Detroit man was shot Wednesday by a Dearborn police officer who approached him in connection with an earlier theft. Authorities also said he was wanted on a probation violation warrant. The confrontation followed a foot chase.

Detroit Police Chief James Craig has said the officer suffered minor injuries.

Detroit and state police are investigating the shooting. A message was left Saturday seeking comment from Dearborn police.

Valerie Johnson has said her son was a paranoid schizophrenic and not a threat to officers.

Protesters rallied Saturday outside Dearborn police headquarters.
