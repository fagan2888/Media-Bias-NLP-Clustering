Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and(D-Mo.) questioned how the agency was using its $7 billion budget and practices such as solitary confinement.\n\nSamuels denied that federal prison officials used solitary confinement.\n\n\u201cWe do not practice solitary confinement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur practice has always been to ensure that when individuals are placed in restrictive housing, we put them in a cell with another individual,\u201d he continued, adding that staff members periodically make rounds to check in on them.\n\nSamuels added that barring evidence that an inmate poses a threat to others or a medical evaluation calling for solitary confinement, \u201cwe do not under any circumstances, nor have we ever had the practice of putting an individual in a cell alone.\u201d\n\nBooker expressed surprise at those claims.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s astonishing to me, and I\u2019d love to explore that further, because all of the evidence is that it is a practice at the federal level,\u201d he said.\n\nSamuels described Special Housing Units, an agency alternative housing method that lasts on average 65 days, but insisted it was not solitary.\n\nMcCaskill noted that only 5 percent of the bureau's prisoners have committed violent crimes.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even have primary jurisdiction probably on most of those crimes in the federal system,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cThe federal law enforcement system was not designed or ever intended to address what most people think of as crime in this country,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re spending 7 bullion dollars, and 95 percent of that money is being spent on non-violent offenders. That\u2019s an astounding number.\n\n\u201cHow many times have you been brought into the policy questions of who is being prosecuted in the federal system and why? Because you guys don\u2019t get 911 calls,\u201d McCaskill continued.\n\nShe said federal prosecutors \u201cget to decide what they want to prosecute, unlike state prosecutors who have to make a decision on every single case.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor any policy decisions, relative to who is being prosecuted, that remains with my colleagues in the department,\u201d Samuels said of the Justice Department.\n\nThe hearing also comes amid a renewed push for prison and sentencing reform in Washington.\n\nSamuels accompanied President Obama on a recent tour of the El Reno correctional institution in Oklahoma. Obama became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison and cited issues with overcrowding and mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders.\n\n\u201cThis huge spike in incarcerations is also driven by nonviolent drug offenses where the sentencing is completely out of proportion with the crime,\u201d Obama said after the visit.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The director of the Bureau of Prisons faced tough questions on the treatment of prisoners.", "description": "The director of the Bureau of Prisons faced tough questions on the treatment of prisoners.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The director of the Bureau of Prisons faced tough questions on the treatment of prisoners.", "title": "Dems grill federal prisons chief", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/250247-dems-grill-federal-prisons-chief", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/jailprison_051115getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/250247-dems-grill-federal-prisons-chief", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-04T18:06-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Meghashyam Mali", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Caroline Kelly", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Claire McCaskill,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-04T18:06:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/250247-dems-grill-federal-prisons-chief", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The director of the Bureau of Prisons faced tough questions on the treatment of prisoners.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dems grill federal prisons chief"}, "dcterms.title": "Dems grill federal prisons chief"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc28d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou don\u2019t even have primary jurisdiction probably on most of those crimes in the federal system,\u201d she continued.\n\u201cHow many times have you been brought into the policy questions of who is being prosecuted in the federal system and why?\nObama became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison and cited issues with overcrowding and mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders.\nSamuels denied that federal prison officials used solitary confinement.\n\u201cWe do not practice solitary confinement,\u201d he said."}
