CHICAGO (AP) – Officials at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois will allow customers to keep existing health plans that were being canceled because they fall short of requirements in the nation’s health care law.

Spokesman Greg Thompson says the company made the decision Monday. Premiums may go up on the plans and customers may choose to switch instead to a policy on the new insurance marketplace.

Last month, President Barack Obama gave states and insurers the option to renew the plans for one year. The proposal was meant to make good on Obama’s promise that Americans who liked their plans could keep them.

About 185,000 Illinoisans have received cancellation notices. Blue Cross has the most customers in Illinois’ individual market. It plans to notify customers and brokers about the options.
