All American Meats, Inc., is recalling more than 167,000 pounds of ground beef that may be contaminated with E. coli.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) says a sample tested positive for E. coli on Oct. 30, but no cases of illness have been reported.

All of the recalled products are stamped with the establishment number "EST. 20420" inside the USDA mark of inspection.

All American Meats, based in Omaha, Nebraska, says the recalled meat products were shipped to retail locations nationwide. USDA and company officials expressed concern that some of the meat may be in consumers' freezers.

USDA testing detected a strain of E. coli called O157:H7, which can cause severe illness or even death. Symptoms including abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea may develop an average of 3 or 4 days after consuming food contaminated with the bacteria.

While most people recover within a week, children under age 5 and older adults are at greater risk of severe complications, including kidney failure.

The USDA says cooking meat thoroughly to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit can kill harmful bacteria, including E. coli. The agency encouraged consumers to use a food thermometer to ensure that meat is cooked safely.
