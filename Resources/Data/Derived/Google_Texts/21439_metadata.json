During the GOP debate on Saturday, Rubio repeated the same line FOUR times: Barack Obama knows what he\u2019s doing.\n\nRubio was asked if he was too inexperienced \u2014 and attacked by others with the comparison that Obama was a one-term senator.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Rubio. \u201cHe knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world. That\u2019s why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran, it is a systematic effort to change America.\u201d\n\nAnd again:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing.
