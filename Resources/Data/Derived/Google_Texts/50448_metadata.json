Prospects blooming, veterans attempting comebacks and unknowns raising eyebrows are things I keep an eye on.\n\nHere are three storylines that have caught my attention as Rockies spring training got underway:\n\nJairo Diaz: At 6-feet, 248 pounds, he looks more like Broncos linebacker Von Miller than a relief pitcher from Venezuela. Diaz looks imposing and his sizzling 95-97 mph fastball adds to presence. The 23-year-old was acquired from the Angels in an off-season trade for infielder Josh Rutledge. Diaz \u2014 who converted from catcher because he couldn\u2019t hit \u2014 made just five big-league appearances in 2014, but struck out eight in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out more than 13 batters per nine innings with a 2.20 ERA at Double-A Arkansas in 2014. When Diaz got the unexpected call-up from the Angels late last summer, Diaz cried. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. He fits the power profile that GM Jeff Bridich and manager Walt Weiss want in their bullpen.\n\nTommy Murphy: The stocky catcher was \u201cvery impressive\u201d last spring, according to Weiss, and just about everyone else in the organization. So impressive, in fact, that he was on a fast-track to make the big-league club. But a slight tear of his right rotator cuff wiped out nearly his entire 2014 season with Double-A Tulsa. \u201cIt was scary. You can\u2019t help but think your career might be over,\u201d Murphy said. But a winter\u2019s worth of rehabilitation has Murphy feeling positive again. \u201cMy shoulder feels 100 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no pain at all. It\u2019s all good.\u201d Murphy won\u2019t break camp with the Rockies this spring and it\u2019s very unlikely he will make the majors this season, but he\u2019s back on track. \u201cI just have to tell myself to be patient and not try to rush back,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing I can do to get back last year.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Three storylines that have caught my attention as Rockies' spring training got underway: Jiaro Diaz, Tommy Murphy and Christian Friedrich.", "title": "Jairo Diaz, Tommy Murphy, Christian Friedrich worth watching", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/02/22/diaz-murphy-friedrich-3-rockies-worth-watching-spring/19378/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/02/Friedrich-495x312.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Three storylines that have caught my attention as Rockies' spring training got underway: Jiaro Diaz, Tommy Murphy and Christian Friedrich.", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/02/22/diaz-murphy-friedrich-3-rockies-worth-watching-spring/19378/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/02/Friedrich-495x312.jpg", "title": "Jairo Diaz, Tommy Murphy, Christian Friedrich: 3 Rockies worth watching this spring", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "news_keywords": "Christian Friedrich,Jiaro Diaz,Tommy Murphy,Walt Weiss", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Three storylines that have caught my attention as Rockies' spring training got underway: Jiaro Diaz, Tommy Murphy and Christian Friedrich"}, "article_summary": "Diaz looks imposing and his sizzling 95-97 mph fastball adds to presence.\nSCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. \u2014 Under-the-radar stories are one of the great joys of spring training.\nTommy Murphy: The stocky catcher was \u201cvery impressive\u201d last spring, according to Weiss, and just about everyone else in the organization.\nHere are three storylines that have caught my attention as Rockies spring training got underway:Jairo Diaz: At 6-feet, 248 pounds, he looks more like Broncos linebacker Von Miller than a relief pitcher from Venezuela.\nWhen Diaz got the unexpected call-up from the Angels late last summer, Diaz cried."}
