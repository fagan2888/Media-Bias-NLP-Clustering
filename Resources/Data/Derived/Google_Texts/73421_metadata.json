That includes administering a wider range of care and prescribing most drugs without a physician\u2019s blessing.\n\nNurses have been fighting for decades to practice to the top of their license, the Post reports, with certain groups such as the American Medical Association arguing that physician-led teams lead to better integration and coordination. But in places such as West Virginia, with the Affordable Care Act expanding access, the need for more clinicians has been too great to ignore this issue, especially in rural areas.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to provide the care for that? If there\u2019s nowhere for them to take the card and get the care, it\u2019s not helpful,\u201d Beth Baldwin, president of the West Virginia Nurses Association, told the newspaper. \u201cWe in no way feel that we\u2019ll be replacing physicians. But physicians can be focusing on the people they need to see.\u201d\n\nMany states have also been moving in this direction, with 21 of them, plus the District of Columbia, now allowing full-practice authority to nurses. This wasn\u2019t a complete slam-dunk for West Virginia nurses, however. The state has been ravaged by the opioid epidemic and, for fear of releasing more of these drugs into the public, the final version of the bill does not allow nurses to dispense Schedule II substances.\n\nAre nurses getting the needed support after making fatal mistakes?\n\nThe website Vox published an interesting in-depth piece last week on the \u201csecond victim crisis\u201d in health care, and how nurses can cope following a fatal mistake.\n\nThe writer leads off with the story of Kim Hiatt, a nurse of 24 years who gave a frail infant a fatal dose of medication and subsequently killed herself because of the grief. Hiatt's is not an isolated case, as Vox notes that about 66 percent of clinicians experienced \u201cdifficulty concentrating\u201d and \u201cextreme sadness\u201d following such incidents. Some 68 percent of respondents to one survey said they didn\u2019t receive institutional support following a mistake that harmed a patient.\n\nVox goes on to detail how hospitals are responding to this crisis. About a dozen or so have set up hotlines to help clinicians cope, including the University of Missouri, one of the first to do so in the nation.\n\nCatholic Health Initiatives leader lauded for lifetime achievement\n\nKathleen Sanford, R.N. \u2014 senior vice president and chief nursing officer at Catholic Health Initiatives \u2014 is being honored as one of the top nurse execs in the field later this month.\n\nThe American Organization of Nurse Executives announced last week that it\u2019s bestowing its lifetime achievement award on the longtime nurse leader. Sanford\u2019s long list of accomplishments includes publishing more than 100 articles and two management books, along with serving on the boards of both the American Hospital Association and Washington State Hospital Association. The 35-year vet is also a former Army caregiver, previously retiring as chief nurse of the Washington Army National Guard.\n\nSanford will receive the award next week during a presentation ceremony at AONE\u2019s annual meeting in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nNurses\u2019 least favorite phrases\n\nThere\u2019s a lively discussion on the social media site allnurses.com about the phrases that most grind the gears of RNs.\n\nOne respondent, \u201cnynursey,\u201d particularly disdains when people say, \u201cI\u2019ll go get your nurse,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll have your nurse take care of it.\u201d The poster feels such utterances are part of the age-old concept that nurses can do everyone else\u2019s job, but not all staff can do a nurses\u2019 job. Why should these skilled clinicians waste time with ancillary tasks when they should be focused on caring for a patient?\n\n\u201cI do realize that as an RN I represent the center of the patient's entire care experience, but I refute the idea that the nurse ought to be preoccupied with obtaining ginger ales, extra pillows, changing the television station, or obtaining a telephone. As you're expecting me to carry out these menial, easily delegated tasks, I am often in the middle of more serious issues such as stabilizing a blood pressure, inserting a new IV, re-assessing a patient that has fallen, or being present with a physician to discuss end-of-life issues,\u201d nynursey writes.\n\nWhat are your least favorite phrases to hear as a nurse?
