After noting that the Obama administration has touted \u201cthe largest reduction in the uninsured in four decades,\u201d Asness concedes that, yes, insurance coverage has risen. But he declares that this was never in doubt:\n\nThat more people would be insured was never in dispute. If you mandate that people buy something, penalize them if they don\u2019t and give it away to some, more people will end up with it. The proper response to this is: Duh.\n\nAsness is absolutely right that it was completely obvious that Obamacare would substantially increase insurance coverage. We know this because the same system \u2014 regulated insurance plus subsidies plus mandate \u2014 was tried in Massachusetts, and lots of people signed up. But Asness is wrong about whether it was in dispute. Despite the blithering obviousness of the fact that Obamacare would bring about a major decline in people lacking insurance, lots of conservatives denied that it would happen. I rounded up a handful of examples the other day, though plenty more can be found:\n\nThe National Center for Policy Analysis, a major conservative health-care think tank, predicted in 2013, \u201cthe massive law that was enacted to solve the problem of the uninsured in America is more likely to worsen it.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day, for all of the rhetoric and promises about what Obamacare would achieve, the health law\u2019s most ardent supporters have stuck to their guns because of one thing: coverage expansion,\u201d wrote Avik Roy, a leading Republican health-care adviser, in 2014. \u201cBut new data suggests that Obamacare may fail even to achieve this goal.\u201d Obamacare would result in \u201cessentially the same number of uninsured,\u201d insisted Charles Krauthammer in February 2014.\n\nPeople deny obvious cause-and-effect relationships all the time. People even deny that the massive release of heat-trapping gasses into the atmosphere will trap more heat \u2014 people like Cliff Asness.\n\nIndeed, it is not even clear that Asness is conceding Obamacare\u2019s impact on insurance now. In his op-ed, he suggests, \u201cThe real question is how many of those covered by ObamaCare were previously uninsured.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s why you measure the net number of uninsured people, not just the gross expansion of coverage under Obamacare. Asness seems unclear on this concept, so I\u2019ll unpack it a bit. Here\u2019s a chart showing the decline in the rate of uninsured Americans:\n\nThose numbers at the top of the chart, ranging from 17.4 percent to 18 percent, represent the proportion of Americans lacking insurance before Obamacare went into effect. The number at the right, 11.9 percent, represents the current total. That means that Obamacare has so far resulted in a net 6 percent of the American population that was previously uninsured gaining insurance coverage. If Obamacare was mostly enrolling people who already had insurance, there would not be a large drop in the uninsured rate. That\u2019s what \u201cthe largest reduction in the uninsured in four decades\u201d means.\n\nBy the way, Asness is managing and founding principal of AQR Capital Management, which is helpful to know in case you\u2019re looking to put your savings in the hands of a man who has strong opinions on topics of which he lacks basic comprehension.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Wall Street Journal gives wealthy, ignorant man op-ed in which to expose himself.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "Wall Street Journal gives wealthy, ignorant man op-ed in which to expose himself.", "title": "Confused Hedge-Fund Manager Cliff Asness Struggles to Express Continued Rage at Obamacare", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/04/cliff-asness-struggles-to-express-obamacare-rage.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/04/16/16-clifford-asness.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wall Street Journal gives wealthy, ignorant man op-ed in which to expose himself.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/04/16/16-clifford-asness.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Cliff Asness Struggles to Express Obamacare Rage", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, obamacare, cliff asness", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,obamacare,cliff asness", "published_time": "2015-04-16T14:31:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, obamacare, cliff asness", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "Asness is absolutely right that it was completely obvious that Obamacare would substantially increase insurance coverage.\nThat means that Obamacare has so far resulted in a net 6 percent of the American population that was previously uninsured gaining insurance coverage.\nAfter noting that the Obama administration has touted \u201cthe largest reduction in the uninsured in four decades,\u201d Asness concedes that, yes, insurance coverage has risen.\nIf Obamacare was mostly enrolling people who already had insurance, there would not be a large drop in the uninsured rate.\nPeople even deny that the massive release of heat-trapping gasses into the atmosphere will trap more heat \u2014 people like Cliff Asness."}
