Readers responded to Oliver Sacks\u2019 \u201cMy Own Life\u201d with gratitude.\n\n\u201cI have been able to see my life as from a great altitude, as a sort of landscape, and with a deepening sense of the connection of all its parts,\u201d Mr. Sacks wrote. \u201cI feel intensely alive, and I want and hope in the time that remains to deepen my friendships, to say farewell to those I love, to write more, to travel if I have the strength, to achieve new levels of understanding and insight.\u201d\n\nA science writer, a former medical student, the mother of a child with autism, a man on his \u201cway out\u201d and a man who, by chance, shared an airport lunch table with Mr. Sacks were among those who shared their own adventures of the mind. At least one skeptic weighed in.\n\nAs a young student engaged in the history of science, SAS from Newton, Mass., wrote, \u201cyour books inspired, delighted and amazed me. When I had a child, I would read passages out loud to my daughter, who is now studying to become a neuroscientist. Your words have become part of the fabric of our lives.\u201d\n\nMr. Sacks wrote of an intense sense of purpose in his remaining days, familiar in the literature of death and dying. \u201cI feel a sudden clear focus and perspective,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is no time for anything inessential.\u201d\n\nDaily marvels took on shape in comments, too.\n\n\u201cEach morning I observe the sun as it begins its glorious show. I observe flowers as they open, and our fish as they wander our pond,\u201d Richard Schmidt wrote from Concord, N.C. \u201cI observe our grandchildren, as they change each day. All is wonder.\u201d\n\nOne reader said Mr. Sacks\u2019s recitation of books written and manuscripts pending seemed out of place. The neurologist\u2019s joys and intensity, rather than inspire him, brought to mind the shortcomings in his own life.\n\n\u201cIt is depressing because it highlights my own lack of human connections and significant accomplishments,,\u201d A. Davey wrote from Portland. \u201cHow can those of us who have suffered from isolation and disappointment take any comfort or guidance from these words?\u201d\n\nA former medical student of Mr. Sacks\u2019s described the imposing bearded figure of the onetime weight lifter riding a motorcycle through New York City, and illustrated the humor of his gentle mentor.\n\n\u201cOn demonstrating the gag response on me, to which I didn\u2019t gag, he remarked: \u2018Either you are missing the response or being very polite,\u2019\u201d Donald Green of Reading, Mass., wrote of one lesson. \u201cHe respectfully introduced us to patients who were later portrayed in \u2018Awakenings.\u2019 It was eerie to have your memory jogged by a movie of something you had observed so closely years before.\u201d\n\nA reader with a terminal diagnosis of his own said reading Mr. Sacks\u2019s work, he \u201clearned about migraine; mysterious, Parkinsonian sleep; your British Jewish family; hallucination; music; and, above all, human idiosyncrasy,\u201d G wrote from Virginia. \u201cYour voice is clear and kind and, as I like to think, has inspired kindness in my own soul.\u201d\n\nA mother whose child has autism and \u201ca brilliant, very alive mind\u201d wrote to appreciate Mr. Sacks \u201cfor helping open minds to all of the wonderful human possibility expressed in the idea of neurodiversity.\u201d\n\nA New Yorker recounted a time at a California airport when an older man asked to sit at his table as they awaited their plane to the city. \u201cAs he sat quietly, eating his chicken noodle soup and crackers, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that he looked familiar,\u201d wrote Phillip from New York City, who realized eventually that he was sitting with the best-selling author. \u201cFortunately, I was prepared, having just finished reading \u2018An Anthropologist on Mars\u2019 and \u2018Uncle Tungsten.\u2019 \u2026 He even gave me a sneak preview of his forthcoming book on music.\u201d\n\nMr. Sacks wrote that watching his generation fade out has pained him.\n\n\u201cEach death I have felt as an abruption, a tearing away of part of myself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is the fate \u2014 the genetic and neural fate \u2014 of every human being to be a unique individual, to find his own path, to live his own life, to die his own death.\u201d\n\nDespite the pending abruption, some readers said Mr. Sacks\u2019 life will continue to inspire imagination.\n\n\u201cI heard something at a friend\u2019s funeral not too long ago about immortality \u2014 that we do live forever, and not just as memories,\u201d Elizabeth Fuller wrote from Peterborough, N.H. \u201cWhat we have done, said, and written lives on in ways big and small, often subconsciously, in those whose lives we have touched.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150223162918, "BN": "op-talk", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/optalk", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/op-talk/post", "per":
