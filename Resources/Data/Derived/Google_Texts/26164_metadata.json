Bobby Jindal (R) announced Monday that he is forming a presidential exploratory committee, and that he would announce his decision about jumping into the 2016 race in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cFor some time now, my wife Supriya and I have been thinking and praying about whether to run for the presidency of our great nation. We\u2019ll make a final decision in June,\u201d Jindal said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile other Republican leaders are talking about change, I\u2019ve published detailed plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, rebuild America\u2019s defenses, make America energy independent, and reform education for our nation\u2019s children,\u201d Jindal added, in a reference to the crowded GOP field will face if he throws his hat into the ring.\n\nJindal has long been considering a presidential run. A formal exploratory committee will allow him to raise funds to travel and hire staff in support of a White House bid. Should he ultimately declare his candidacy, Jindal will likely make an appeal to social conservatives, tout his school choice program, and highlight efforts to lower taxes in Louisiana.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Potential 2016 Presidential Contenders Potential 2016 Presidential Contenders\n\n1 of 33 Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) Share this slide:\n\nSpencer Platt via Getty Images", "article_metadata": {"description": "Louisiana Gov.
