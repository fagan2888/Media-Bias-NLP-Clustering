Rick Perry, who recently finished 14 years as governor of Texas, one of the few states that didn\u2019t adopt Common Core, said \u201cthe whole concept of Common Core is just like Obamacare \u2014 a bureaucrat in Washington, D.C., to sit there and decide what is going to be the right curriculum.\u201d\n\nA still from the Collaborative for Student Success television ad on Common Core Collaborative for Student Success\n\nCommon Core proponents note that 46 states voluntarily adopted the grade-level benchmarks in math and English to help raise student achievement. They say curriculum is set by state and local school boards, not the federal government.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount of confusion around Common Core,\u201d said Karen Nussle, executive director of the Collaborative for Student Success, which didn\u2019t disclose the cost of the ad campaign. \u201cThe fact is rigorous standards that are comparable across state lines, coupled with increased accountability, is a conservative reform with roots dating back to Ronald Reagan. It\u2019s important that Republicans not allow this issue to be hijacked.\u201d\n\nThe ad campaign could offer some political cover to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a likely presidential candidate who has backed the standards. He founded the Foundation for Excellence in Education, a think tank that receives funding from some of the same philanthropies that support the Collaborative for Student Success, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nIn New Hampshire over the weekend, Mr. Bush said he\u2019s \u201cfine\u201d if states don\u2019t like Common Core as long as they adopt high standards. He also emphasized that the federal government should have no role in writing curriculum.\n\nRelated\n\nOpinion: The Conservative Case for Common Core \u2014 By William J.
