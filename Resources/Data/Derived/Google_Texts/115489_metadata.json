The initial consumer experience of HealthCare.gov has not lived up to the expectations of the American people. We are committed to doing better.\"\n\nThe department characterized the initiative to fix the exchanges as a \"tech surge,\" referencing the rapid increase of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan in 2009.\n\n\"Our team is bringing in some of the best and brightest from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the team and help improve HealthCare.gov,\" it wrote. \"We're also putting in place tools and processes to aggressively monitor and identify parts of HealthCare.gov where individuals are encountering errors or having difficulty using the site, so we can prioritize and fix them. We are also defining new test processes to prevent new issues from cropping up as we improve the overall service and deploying fixes to the site during off-peak hours on a regular basis.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The web-based, federally-run insurance exchanges went online on October 1, but they have been beset with problems.", "author": "Andrew Nusca", "fragment": "!", "og": {"site_name": "ZDNet", "description": "The web-based, federally-run insurance exchanges went online on October 1, but they have been beset with problems.", "title": "U.S. plans 'tech surge' to fix balky health exchanges | ZDNet", "url": "http://www.zdnet.com/article/u-s-plans-tech-surge-to-fix-balky-health-exchanges/", "image": "http://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/09/18/f7993172-3f01-11e4-b6a0-d4ae52e95e57/thumbnail/770x578/6ef4744dbd46ca4778ca46d211cfb847/u-s-plans-tech-surge-to-fix-balky-health-exchanges.png", "type": "website"}, "theme-color": "#080e14", "article": {"author": "https://twitter.com/editorialiste"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31d4\"", "article_summary": "The department characterized the initiative to fix the exchanges as a \"tech surge,\" referencing the rapid increase of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan in 2009.\n\"The experience on HealthCare.gov has been frustrating for many Americans,\" the department wrote in a blog post on its website.\n\"Our team is bringing in some of the best and brightest from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the team and help improve HealthCare.gov,\" it wrote.\nThe exchanges are core to the Affordable Care Act\u2014colloquially, \"Obamacare.\"\nThe initial consumer experience of HealthCare.gov has not lived up to the expectations of the American people."}
