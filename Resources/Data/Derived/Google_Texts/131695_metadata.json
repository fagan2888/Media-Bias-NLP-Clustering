Let the men in, and they make more.\n\nThat is not how it was supposed to work. As the doors marked \u201cmen only\u201d and \u201cwomen only\u201d came down, women and men would have more choices. Men would work at \u201cwomen\u2019s jobs,\u201d and women would work at \u201cmen\u2019s jobs,\u201d and pretty soon we\u2019d achieve pay equity.\n\nSay, in 40 or 50 years, if things don\u2019t keep slowing down.\n\nBut why worry about real pay equity when we\u2019re about to get equity on the $10 bill?\n\nActually, \u201cabout to get\u201d is a bit of an overstatement. 2020 is the expected date of release \u2014 marking the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment. To think, we may get a president before we get a bill.\n\nAnd no, it\u2019s not exactly a whole bill. No one is proposing that Alexander Hamilton lose his slot. Instead, the 2020 stamp will picture an undisclosed woman, as well. (Let me guess: In addition to being female, she will also be something else. This is a good bet for an African-American, Hispanic or Asian woman, 2020 being an election year.)\n\nRecently, there was a social media campaign to put a woman on the $20 bill, and Harriet Tubman, the highly respected abolitionist, finished first. At least the yet-to-be-named woman is likely to fare better than the past two women who ended up on coins rather than special paper.\n\nSuffragette Susan B. Anthony was on silver dollars from 1979 to 1981, with a reboot in 1999. Sacagawea, the Native-American woman who led Lewis and Clark\u2019s expedition (some say with her baby strapped across her back), also had her likeness on dollar coins beginning in 2000. Reportedly, neither was very popular.\n\nThis only partly explains Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s 1978 U.S. Supreme Court encounter with Justice William Rehnquist. Ginsburg, a professor and feminist advocate at the time, was arguing for equality in jury selection. (Her client, ironically, was a male convicted by an all-male jury who claimed women should not have been excluded from his murder trial.) As it happened, Herma Hill Kay, then the dean of UC Berkeley\u2019s Boalt Hall Law School, was arguing on the same day for gender equity in California pension funds.\n\nFor a woman clerk like me, it was a day not to be missed. Both women were brilliant, but at the conclusion of then professor Ginsburg\u2019s argument, even cynical me was shocked to hear Rehnquist make a joke of it: \u201cYou will not settle for putting Susan B. Anthony on the new dollar, then?\u201d Later recalling the event, Ginsburg wrote that while she refrained, she was of a mind to reply, \u201cNo, your Honor, tokens will not do.\u201d\n\nNo, tokens won\u2019t do, except perhaps in one profession: pornography. This is the one profession where women\u2019s pay grade is significantly higher than men\u2019s. A woman can be paid $1,000 for a heterosexual porn shoot, while a man would be paid half of that.\n\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t take into account how long the women spend in hair and makeup or how fast their careers decline. Porn remains perhaps the one area where men are willing to pay a premium for a woman\u2019s services.\n\nA new study from the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research points out the fact that not only is equal pay not a reality now, but it isn\u2019t likely to be one until 2058 \u2014 a problem that a new $10 bill will not solve.\n\n\u2014 Susan Estrich is a best-selling author, the Robert Kingsley Professor of Law and Political Science at the USC Law Center and was campaign manager for 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
