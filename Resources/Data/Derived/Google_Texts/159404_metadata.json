Fortunately, the president is in luck: The doorway to a job with one of his many Hollywood admirers already appears to be wide open.\n\nTinseltown\u2019s never-ending love affair with Mr. Obama often borders on the point of nausea. He\u2019s won two Grammy Awards for best spoken-word album. He\u2019s also won a NAACP Image Award, and has been nominated for Teen Choice and Kids\u2019 Choice awards. He\u2019s been praised at the Oscars \u2014 and Michelle Obama even appeared by satellite to announce the 2012 Academy Award for Best Picture winner (\u201cArgo\u201d).\n\nHis most recent nomination of sorts, however, can only be described as a \u201cyou\u2019ve got to be kidding me\u201d moment.\n\nLast week, an episode of \u201cBetween Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis,\u201d which appears on the website Funny or Die and features a faux interview with Mr. Obama, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program. First posted on March 11, more than 22 million people have already viewed this skit. It has been credited in helping get more Americans interested in Obamacare and visit the Healthcare.gov website.\n\nLiberal media commentators couldn\u2019t stop wagging their tongues in anticipation of Mr. Obama becoming the first president to ever win an Emmy. (Jackie Kennedy had won a special Trustees\u2019 Award in 1962 for her tour of the White House on CBS.) Alas, their dreams were shattered when it was revealed that only the executive producers \u2014 Scott Aukerman, B.J. Porter, Mike Farah and Mr. Galifianakis \u2014 had been nominated.\n\nI\u2019ve watched the Galifianakis-Obama skit. It\u2019s mildly amusing in small doses, and fairly silly for the most part. While it\u2019s hard to know exactly what constitutes the criteria for an Emmy nomination, there\u2019s no doubt that politics play a role. Considering Hollywood\u2019s prevalent left-wing political behavior, we shouldn\u2019t be terribly surprised by a fake interview with a liberal president making the cut.\n\nEven so, I just can\u2019t believe that this long-term love affair continues to reach new lows. What\u2019s next? A Golden Globe, a Tony or perhaps a grass-roots effort to get him a second Nobel Peace Prize? Maybe they\u2019ll make a massive biopic as a sympathetic send-off. (I sure hope Andy Serkis is hired to play Mr. Obama\u2019s teleprompter in the voice of \u201cGollum.\u201d) Or they\u2019ll get behind an effort to produce what the world has been waiting for on pins and needles: \u201cObama: The Musical.\u201d\n\nThis whole experience has actually made Bill Clinton\u2019s incestuous relationship with Hollywood\u2019s elite look rather palatable at times.\n\nLook, we all know that Hollywood liberals live in their own little world. They support certain political and economic ideas, and quite a few prominent figures, that most sensible people would immediately reject.\n\nHere\u2019s a classic example that\u2019s always made me laugh.\n\nSome high-income earners in California, including actors Ed Asner and Richard Lewis, wrote a public letter in 2002 to then-Gov. Gray Davis and state legislative leaders. They literally begged their Democratic counterpart to reinstate top income tax brackets to balance the budget.\n\nIsn\u2019t that rich \u2014 the rich telling politicians what to do with their money and other people\u2019s money? For Tinseltown types like Mr. Asner and Mr. Lewis, it gives them a golden opportunity to claim expertise in an area they know absolutely nothing about.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Obama\u2019s time in office, Hollywood is clearly unable to read the tea leaves. Two recent public opinion polls by centrist organizations, Zogby and Quinnipiac University, showed that the president\u2019s approval rating is tanking and his \u201clegacy\u201d is waning.\n\nQuinnipiac also revealed Mr. Obama was now considered the \u201cworst president\u201d since World War II. His 33 percent disapproval rating was higher than that of George W. Bush (28 percent), Richard Nixon (13 percent) and Jimmy Carter (8 percent). In contrast, Ronald Reagan had a 35 percent approval rating as \u201cbest president,\u201d followed by Bill Clinton (18 percent), John F. Kennedy (15 percent) and Mr. Obama (8 percent).\n\nSay what you want about polling, and I\u2019ve made my fair share of negative assessments, but there\u2019s no doubt Mr. Obama is out of favor with most Americans.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to understand why the Hollywood elite, as jaded and as foolish as they are, still think this president walks on water and indirectly nominate him for an Emmy. It\u2019s also a wonder why we even bother to pay attention to them any longer.\n\nMichael Taube is a contributor to The Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Barack Obama leaves the White House in January 2017, he'll need to move on to another vocation.
