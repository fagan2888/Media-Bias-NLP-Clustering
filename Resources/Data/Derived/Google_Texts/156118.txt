In 1948, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights identified housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living. How is it that we (in Boulder, arguably one of the most prosperous places in the world and Colorado) have one of the highest annual homeless death rates?

Certainly with our brilliant academics, engineers, policy makers and problem solvers we can do the math on this one (together). It's not affordable housing, but jobs that prevent homelessness. And jobs that pay a livable wage that make housing affordable. Aside from a deep personal bond with another, work is the most important thing that gives life meaning. It is inconceivable that any might seek to deny this simple pleasure from human beings.

Unfortunately, too many resources may actually be dedicated to controlling parts of the work force and labor markets, preventing employment. Not all homeless people are crazy or disdainful of work, in fact, a fair number wish desperately to return to work. At some point, iron-fisted control of our economy (and population) is actually counterproductive as it fosters a desperate society that even the wealthiest of stakeholders may find undesirable.

When annual homeless death rates in a utopia like Boulder are nearly triple the national average, it says something about us as a community. Yes, lives do matter. Let's allow everyone opportunities in the coming year to work meaningful jobs commensurate with skill sets, experience and or education rather than perpetrating harassment or attempting to keep a portion of the population unemployed and or homeless.

The morally corrupt and wicked practice of keeping law abiding citizens unemployed or homeless serves no one and will eventually discredit the ideals we as Americans all hold dear. Happy New Year to all and to all basic rights!
