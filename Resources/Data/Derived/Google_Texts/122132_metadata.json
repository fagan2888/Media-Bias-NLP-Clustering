And they aren\u2019t expected to change that pattern any time soon.\n\n\u201cThey tend to overestimate the cost of this legislation because they\u2019re trying to be conservative, so you are not sticking the federal government with liability it didn\u2019t anticipate,\u201d Dan Mendelson, chief executive of the D.C.-based healthcare consulting firm Avalere Health, told Politico.\n\nThat\u2019s not a good sign for telemedicine advocates.\n\nIn 2001, the CBO anticipated that telemedicine services would cost the nation\u2019s Medicare budget some $150 million over the next five years. But according to the Center for Telehealth & eHealth Law, such services have only cost the program $57 million \u2013 in 14 years.\n\nThe CBO is well aware of the criticism. In a July 29 blog post that followed several days of contentious Congressional hearings, officials said it\u2019s difficult to predict how Medicare coverage for telemedicine services would affect the budget.\n\n\u201cIf all or most telemedicine services substituted for or prevented the use of more expensive services, coverage of telemedicine could reduce federal spending,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIf instead telemedicine services were mostly used in addition to currently covered services, coverage of telemedicine would tend to increase Medicare spending. Many proposals to expand coverage of telemedicine strive to facilitate enrollees\u2019 access to healthcare. Therefore, such proposals could increase spending by adding payments for new services instead of substituting for existing services.\u201d\n\nIn their defense of the budget-estimating process, the CBO officials followed the same argument that the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality would make in a report issued this month \u2013 that not enough studies have been done to prove telemedicine\u2019s value.\n\n\u201dBecause Medicare coverage of telemedicine is limited, CBO does not have extensive data that would help project how expanding such coverage would affect federal spending in the Medicare program,\u201d the blog post concluded. \u201cCBO\u2019s analysis would benefit from having the results of new and well-designed academic studies examining how introducing telemedicine services would affect healthcare spending in the Medicare population. The results of a demonstration project conducted in the fee-for-service Medicare program could be especially valuable in light of the particular challenges of controlling spending on new benefits in that program.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, the CBO is expected to see another telemedicine bill quite soon. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) is expected to submit a bill before the end of the year that would enable healthcare providers to use telemedicine technology in new, alternative payment programs overseen by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \u2013 including telestroke programs covered by Medicaid Advantage.\n\nThat bill and the Telehealth Innovation and Improvement Act, recently submitted by Sens. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), have officials at the American Telemedicine Association hopeful that Washington will finally come around to supporting \u2013 and paying for \u2013 telemedicine.\n\nDuring a webcast earlier this month, Gary Capistrant, the ATA\u2019s senior director for public policy, and Jonathan Linkous, the organization\u2019s CEO, said Schatz\u2019s bill in particular would compel the CBO to take a good hard look at telemedicine \u2013 something it hasn\u2019t really done since making the initial estimation of the technology\u2019s costs in 2001.\n\nThey might not like what they hear, though.\n\n\u201cCBO\u2019s bias is, it is pretty sure people are trying to get a free lunch,\u201d Phil Joyce, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland who wrote a 2011 book on the CBO, told Politico. \u201cSo it tends to be skeptical of claims that something is going to save money unless it has been proven that it will, which creates a potential bias against new technologies or new approaches.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Telemedicine bills to face budget office scrutiny", "author": "mHealthIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/news/will-the-cbo-give-telemedicine-a-fair-shake", "site_name": "mHealthIntelligence", "image": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/images/site/articles/stethoscope_money.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Will the CBO Give Telemedicine a Fair Shake?"}, "twitter": {"description": "Telemedicine bills to face budget office scrutiny", "creator": "@mHealthIntel", "image": {"src": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/images/site/articles/stethoscope_money.jpg"}, "title": "Will the CBO Give Telemedicine a Fair Shake?", "site": "@mHealthIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf instead telemedicine services were mostly used in addition to currently covered services, coverage of telemedicine would tend to increase Medicare spending.\n\u201cIf all or most telemedicine services substituted for or prevented the use of more expensive services, coverage of telemedicine could reduce federal spending,\u201d they wrote.\nIn 2001, the CBO anticipated that telemedicine services would cost the nation\u2019s Medicare budget some $150 million over the next five years.\nWith Congress soon to see proposed legislation that would allow more Medicaid coverage of telehealth services, some are wondering if those bills will get a fair shake from those in control of the purse strings.\nIn a July 29 blog post that followed several days of contentious Congressional hearings, officials said it\u2019s difficult to predict how Medicare coverage for telemedicine services would affect the budget."}
