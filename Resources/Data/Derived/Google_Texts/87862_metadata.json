While his military would continue to expand and be supplied with more and newer equipment, it\u2019s only because \u201ca strong army that is equipped with modern weapons is a guarantor of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Russia, guarantor of peaceful and calm life of millions of our compatriots.\u201d\n\nAccording to the government-run news organization TASS, Putin said in remarks to graduates of Russia\u2019s military academies that the Kremlin would continue to invest in newer and more technologically advanced weaponry. However, he added, \u201cWe do not have and cannot have any aggressive plans. We threaten no one and are trying to resolve any disputable issues exclusively by political means, we respect international law and the interests of other countries.\"\n\nRelated: Why Vladimir Putin Wants Texas to Secede from the U.S.\n\nThis last comment probably seemed a bit rich to the people of Ukraine, who saw Russian troops invade and occupy that country\u2019s Crimean peninsula last year in advance of a \u201cvote\u201d \u2013 conducted under the supervision of Russian troops \u2013 to join the Russian Federation. They might also have rolled their eyes because of Russia\u2019s ill-disguised participation in an ongoing armed revolt in their country\u2019s eastern Donbas region, where separatists are shockingly well-armed and where many of those captured turn out to be in possession of Russian passports.\n\nBut Putin need not have gone so far afield as Ukraine to find people puzzled by his remarks. The idea that Russia will continue investing in new and better weaponry was also hard to square with remarks on Wednesday by the country\u2019s Finance Minister, Anton Siluanov, in which he announced that the military budget would be cut in the coming year.\n\nAccording to most analyses, Russia, battered by low oil prices and a raft of international sanctions, is at the beginning of what is likely to be a severe recession. Most parts of the government are facing spending cuts of up to 10 percent, the government has indicated.\n\nRelated: More Pain for Putin \u2013 EU Extends Sanctions\n\nHowever this plays out, the Russian president has repeatedly said that the country needs to preserve its capacity to defend itself against what it views as an increasingly threatening NATO presence on its borders.\n\nThe U.S. this week confirmed that it will be stationing heavy equipment, including tanks and armored fighting vehicles, in a number of Eastern European countries on or near Russia\u2019s borders. Russia has portrayed the decision as an act of naked aggression, while the U.S. and its allies in Europe have said that it is an unfortunate but necessary response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea and its continued support of rebels there.\n\nIf Putin\u2019s remarks seem difficult to reconcile with the realities on the ground in Ukraine and with the fiscal realities facing the Russian treasury, it may be a while before that has much effect on his status with the Russian people.\n\nOn Wednesday, state-run media outlet Russia Today reported that a \u201cRussian independent pollster, the Levada Center, says the share of Russians who are happy with Vladimir Putin\u2019s work as president has reached 89 percent, which is his highest-ever approval rating.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Vladimir Putin wants to keep spending more on military equipment, but his foreign minister is promising cuts to the country\u2019s defense budget.
