Chris Christie\u2019s earlier veto of a gay marriage bill.\n\n\u201cThe votes are beginning to be counted,\u201d said Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex). \u201cBy Monday, you will see marriages being performed in New Jersey. That\u2019s going to influence those sitting on the fence.\u201d\n\nThe Legislature has never reversed a Christie veto.\n\nAlthough the court\u2019s ruling on gay marriage would seem to make such action a moot point, proponents say the ultimate ruling is no sure thing and that the law on who may marry is codified in legislation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to get the legislative change on the books,\u201d said state Sen. Raymond Lesniak (D-Union). \u201cThis court was unanimous in its decision that there is not a likelihood the appeal will succeed. On the other hand, courts ultimately do change and Supreme Courts do reverse themselves.\u201d\n\nWhile lawmakers counted, same-sex couples were starting to show up for licenses at city halls and clerk\u2019s offices across the state yesterday, with the first marriages set for a minute after midnight tonight.\n\nLesniak will be hosting a ceremony at his home in Elizabeth, where Marsha Shapiro and Louise Walpin \u2014 two of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit at the center of the Supreme Court ruling \u2014 will be married at 12:01 a.m. Newark Mayor Cory Booker and Lambertville Mayor David DelVecchio also plan to lead ceremonies for gay couples after midnight, when the bar to gay marriage in New Jersey is lifted.\n\nExtra office hours\n\nStill, there was no immediate sign that couples were rushing to tie the knot. City halls in several New Jersey cities and towns added extra office hours yesterday to accept marriage license applications, including Jersey City and Hoboken.\n\nAsbury Park City Clerk Kiki Tomek, who opened her office at 10 a.m., said she saw only five couples in the first half hour \u2014 all of whom she had to turn away because they were from out of town. Couples must obtain license applications from the town in which they live and they must be accompanied by a witness.\n\nAmong those who did get licenses were Nancy Cotter of Montclair and Lisa Bartoli of Asbury Park, who arrived with witnesses Anthony Greco and Frank Rowe of Tinton Falls.\n\nJanell Pyzik and Jill Dolan of Asbury Park said they\u2019re getting married as soon as possible to make sure they have all the benefits in place for their 5-month-old daughter, Navy.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s about her now. The quicker the better,\u201d Dolan said.\n\nStarlett Gomez of Long Branch and Yvonne Belinfanti of Asbury Park said they will be married Oct. 27. The two joined in a civil union in August, complete with a 130-person reception and a honeymoon cruise to the Bahamas. Their wedding and reception will be much more low key.\n\n\u201cIt may be a quiet day because financially we just can\u2019t afford it right now,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll be celebrating both dates as our anniversary because this is monumental,\u201d she said.\n\nThe proposal\n\nTom Ziering, a physician in Bernardsville, said he proposed to his partner of more than two decades yesterday in the back of a car as they were being driven home from the airport.\n\n\u201cWe are married in New York already and had a commitment ceremony by a rabbi 19 years ago,\u201d Ziering said. \u201cBut to be able to get married in our own state means we can actually have a wonderful, legally recognized ceremony. On May 20, we will be together 24 years, so that will be our target date!\u201d\n\nUnder state law, couples must normally wait 72 hours after applying for a marriage license before they can tie the knot. Troy Stevenson, the executive director of the gay rights group Garden State Equality, said he was trying to line up judges who could waive the waiting period for individual couples so they could exchange vows after the stroke of midnight.\n\nThe lifting of the bar to same-sex marriage in New Jersey came after the Supreme Court on Friday refused a request by the Christie administration to stay a lower court decision that allowed gay marriage until the matter could be reviewed in a pending appeal to the high court. Although that appeal has been fast-tracked with oral arguments scheduled for early January, the court\u2019s opinion suggested it had all but decided the matter.\n\n\u201cThe state has advanced a number of arguments, but none of them overcome this reality: same-sex couples who cannot marry are not treated equally under the law today. The harm to them is real, not abstract or speculative,\u201d said the court, in an opinion written by Chief Justice Stuart Rabner.\n\nStill, proponents of same-sex marriage say they will continue to push for the Legislature to act, even before the court takes up the appeal. Michael Premo, campaign manager for New Jersey United for Marriage, said while the court has temporarily opened the way for gay marriage, there is no certainty the decision will stand.\n\n\u201cEven though we think we have a strong case, the way to guarantee freedom for these folks \u2014 to make it count, to make it last, is through the override of the governor\u2019s veto,\u201d Premo said.\n\nChristie\u2019s veto\n\nChristie nearly two years ago vetoed a landmark gay marriage bill that had passed both houses of the Legislature. His position has been that the issue should be decided by voters through a referendum.\n\nThe Legislature has until January to attempt an override, but with a 24-16 vote in the Senate and a 42-33 vote in the Assembly, supporters were short of the necessary two-thirds majority to override the governor and never attempted to bring back the bill.\n\nThey need 54 votes in the Assembly and 27 in the Senate.\n\nPremo, whose group has been talking with individual legislators for months in an effort to sway votes toward supporting an override, says the court decision on Friday gave a powerful kick toward reversal.\n\n\u201cIt will spark folks to change their votes,\u201d he said.\n\nAssemblyman Timothy Eustace (D-Bergen) said the court had empowered the Legislature to act. \u201cPeople who were reticent last time will be ready to vote their conscience,\u201d he said.\n\nOliver, meanwhile, said there has been no real aggressive push in the Statehouse by those against same-sex marriage. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen no barrage of letters, e-mails, postcards or picketing. No lobbying for one-on-one meetings. We\u2019ve heard nothing,\u201d she said.\n\nAssembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick (R-Union) said he has not heard of any vote on a possible override, but believes the issue at this point is over for all practical purposes.\n\n\u201cWhether or not they post it for a vote, I doubt the Supreme Court will override,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a legal standpoint, not a political one, this issue looks moot. There is not much left to discuss as to whether this is going to be legal in New Jersey.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the governor declined comment.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@politics','@river','@starledger','gay-marriage','nj-supreme-court'", "title": "Same-sex weddings in N.J. set to begin; Legislature looking to override veto on marriage bill", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Same-sex weddings in N.J. set to begin; Legislature looking to override veto on marriage bill\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/same-sex_weddings_set_to_begin_legislature_looking_to_override_veto_on_marriage_bill.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/10/13612135-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11465884\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-20T04:01:46Z\", \"author\": \"Ted Sherman | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@politics\",\"@river\",\"@starledger\",\"gay-marriage\",\"nj-supreme-court\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/10/13612135-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@TedShermanSL", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Buoyed by the strong language of the state's highest court Friday refusing to put a hold on same-sex marriage, several lawmakers are hoping the decision will sway lawmakers to overturn Gov.
