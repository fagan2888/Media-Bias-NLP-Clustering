The Co-Op also offers new healthcare coverage options to those opting not to enroll in Nevada\u2019s state exchange. It is sponsored by self-insurance groups with a long history of providing excellent and affordable member-focused healthcare in Southern Nevada and the Washoe County areas. The Co-Op is currently enrolling members statewide for 2014.\n\n\u201cThe Co-Op is a great new option for Nevadans to consider as they look at all of the healthcare programs available to them in 2014,\u201d said Darrell Smith, regional vice president of Word & Brown Nevada. \u201cAs always, we strongly suggest working through independent brokers who can fully explain the Co-Op, compare it with other options and help find the best health-benefits solution for a company or individual.\u201d\n\nWord & Brown is Nevada\u2019s premier general agency and supports independent, licensed brokers to quote, analyze, present and enroll groups in health-benefits products. By contracting with Word & Brown and leveraging the existing relationships these brokers have with Nevada\u2019s small and mid-size group market, the Nevada Health Co-Op is now better positioned to reach the commercial market and meet its enrollment goals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that as more brokers come to know the Nevada Health Co-Op and start including it in their proposals, the Co-Op will earn its fair share of the commercial, off-exchange group market,\u201d Smith said.\n\nNevada has one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation with 545,000 uninsured Nevadans. Under the ACA most of these residents will be required to have health insurance, and the Co-Op is being viewed as one viable route to achieving this.\n\nFor nearly 30 years, the Word & Brown General Agency has been recognized as an insurance industry and technology leader as well as a trusted resource for brokers selling individual and family health and ancillary insurance, Medicare coverage and group insurance solutions. The Word & Brown General Agency is part of The Word & Brown Companies, which provide insurance services nationwide through more than 50,000 brokers to hundreds of thousands of consumers and approximately 60,000 employers with nearly 6.5 million eligible employees.\n\nAbout Nevada Health Co-Op\n\nThe Nevada Health Co-Op is a not-for-profit health insurance alternative created under the Affordable Care Act administered by Nevadans for Nevadans. \u201cSimply Better\u201d is the mission of the Co-Op. The not-for-profit is focused on creating a simple consumer-owned health plan that works easily for patients, doctors, employers and the community. Headquartered in the heart of Las Vegas, the Co-Op serves the Nevada community directly with great understanding of the needs of the people, particularly among diverse populations and small businesses struggling to access and provide healthcare coverage.\n\nThe Nevada Health Co-Op is now making appointments for enrollment.
