All U.S. games at the Bell Centre or Toronto\u2019s Air Canada Centre will be televised by the NHL Network.\n\nButcher, an Avalanche-drafted sophomore defenseman for the University of Denver, is among six U.S. veterans from the 2014 WJC team. He is serving as an alternate captain, along with forward John Hayden, under captain Jack Eichel. Hayden (a sophomore at Yale) and Eichel (a freshman forward at Boston University) are among 16 NCAA players on the 24-man roster. The other eight play under the Canadian Hockey League\u2019s major-junior umbrella or will begin playing NCAA or major-junior hockey next season.\n\n\u201cThis team is a close-knit group that I believe can jell and become a gold medal contender,\u201d Butcher, 19, said via text Thursday. \u201cI am very proud to represent my country. It\u2019s always a huge honor. The WJC is a big stage that I\u2019m fortunate to be a part of.\u201d\n\nButcher, from Sun Prairie, Wis., is partnered with 18-year-old Brandon Carlo of Colorado Springs at even strength. The 6-foot-5 Carlo played his midget hockey for the Colorado Thunderbirds and is in his second season with the Tri-City Americans of the Western Hockey League (major junior).\n\nButcher was selected by the Avalanche in the fifth round (123rd overall) of the 2013 NHL draft. Carlo will be eligible for the draft next summer.\n\nButcher is the Avs\u2019 only WJC participant this year, another example of how they haven\u2019t drafted well outside the first round recently. Nathan MacKinnon, the Avs\u2019 first pick in the 2013 draft (first overall), is eligible to play for Canada but, for the second consecutive year, the 19-year-old\u2019s NHL contract will prevent his WJC participation.\n\nThe 5-10, 200-pound Butcher probably will sign with the Avalanche within the next 2\u00bd years, possibly before his senior year. He has eight points (two goals) in 15 games as one of DU\u2019s youngest players.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty special to play in a city like Denver,\u201d Butcher said. \u201cBeing able to enjoy the city and its attractions have been an awesome experience. Having the team that drafted me right down the road is also something that helps motivate me to reaching my goal of playing professional hockey.\u201d\n\nTeam USA\u2019s final Group A preliminary game is Wednesday against Canada in Montreal, and the Pioneers aren\u2019t expecting Butcher to rejoin them when they resume play from the holiday break Jan. 2 at Dartmouth. The WJC quarterfinals also begin Jan. 2, and the Americans are expected to be there.\n\nAt the 2014 tournament in Malmo, Sweden, Team USA went 3-1 before losing to Russia 5-3 in the quarterfinals and failing to medal. Finland defeated Sweden 3-2 in overtime for the gold medal and Russia upset Canada 2-1 for the bronze.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Will Butcher fitting in well with Team USA, DU Pioneers", "title": "Will Butcher fitting in well with Team USA, DU Pioneers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/25/will-butcher-fitting-in-well-with-team-usa-du-pioneers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141225_072950_colorado-avalanche.jpg", "height": 471}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141225_072950_colorado-avalanche.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-25T19:28:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:56:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "NCAA hockey, University of Denver"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e8e\"", "article_summary": "Butcher, an Avalanche-drafted sophomore defenseman for the University of Denver, is among six U.S. veterans from the 2014 WJC team.\nButcher was selected by the Avalanche in the fifth round (123rd overall) of the 2013 NHL draft.\n\u201cThis team is a close-knit group that I believe can jell and become a gold medal contender,\u201d Butcher, 19, said via text Thursday.\nAt the 2014 tournament in Malmo, Sweden, Team USA went 3-1 before losing to Russia 5-3 in the quarterfinals and failing to medal.\nThe 5-10, 200-pound Butcher probably will sign with the Avalanche within the next 2\u00bd years, possibly before his senior year."}
