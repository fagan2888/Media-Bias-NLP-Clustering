U.S. News & World Report will be holding its inaugural Hospital of Tomorrow event this Nov. 4-6 in Washington, D.C. The forum will gather top health care executives and leading health care innovators who will address the most complex issues facing America's hospitals in 2014. These include the real impact of the Affordable Care Act and hospital executives' expectations for the rollout of new technologies and business practices.

To further the conversation and to guide consumers' choices, U.S. News is holding a live Twitter chat about the future of America's hospitals â€” their challenges, changes and solutions. This chat will include experts from American Hospital Association, Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, Cleveland Clinic and The Economist.

Experts are prepared to discuss such topics as growing competition, strategies for reducing readmission rates, how hospitals are responding to lower reimbursement rates, how hospitals will manage an influx of newly insured patients and ways that patients are seeking care outside of hospitals.
