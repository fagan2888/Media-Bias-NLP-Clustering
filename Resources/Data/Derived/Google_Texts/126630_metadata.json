Those people who have doctor appointments have priority over shopping trips,\" said Executive Director Barbara Berge, who began the position in mid-February.\n\nShe said the nonprofit organization, which began in 1987, receives a great deal of positive feedback from the drivers.\n\n\"(They) say that it's actually very rewarding because they get to meet some very nice people,\" Berge said. \"Some of them develop quite a rapport with our clients. In some cases, we can spend six weeks with our clients. We just finished up with a lady who had chemotherapy in Pueblo every day for six weeks.\"\n\nShe said without the drivers, SSSP would be \"basically nonexistent.\"\n\n\"We're always looking for more drivers and donations,\" Berge said. \"We have an increase in clients, but we can't take on more clients unless we have more volunteers. Last year, I think the drivers clocked something like 3,500 volunteer hours of driving time. We have about 25 to 30 drivers and about 100 clients at the moment.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrivers must have a clean driving record, a car with insurance and a valid driver's license.\n\n\"We do provide a small stipend to our drivers for gas reimbursement, just for the out-of-town drives,\" she said. \"You can pick and choose the days that you want and the trips that you want.\"\n\nThe organization also offers other services.\n\n\"We have a room that we rent out for meetings and such,\" Berge said. \"We have a lot of medical equipment like walkers, bath benches, canes, crutches, bath rails, commodes.\"\n\nThe equipment is for sale by donation.\n\nSSSP is located at 321 North Cottonwood Ave. Donations can be mailed to that address.
