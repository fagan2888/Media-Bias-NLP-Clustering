Green lasers, which travel farther than lasers of other colors because of color frequency, are considered a safety risk for pilots.\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFour of the aircrafts leaving John F. Kennedy International Airport were flying at approximately 8,000 feet over Long Island when they were illuminated by the lasers, the FAA said.A fifth flight was reportedly hit by a laser 14 miles southwest of JFK, federal aviation officials said, adding that no injuries were reported in any of the cases.
