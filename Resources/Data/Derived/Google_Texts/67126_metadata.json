Profitability is a result of productivity. That\u2019s one reason why almost half of the employers in the United States offer wellness programs. Since more workers plan to continue in the workforce past age 65, businesses that institute wellness programs to meet the needs of aging employees \u201cwill see big dividends,\u201d states a white paper published in June by the Transamerica Center for Retirement. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides a second reason. Workplace wellness programs are supported as a means of reducing chronic illness by improving health and controlling health care costs. The latest data shows an employer\u2019s ROI (return on investment) is $6 for every $1 spent on workplace wellness. Also, a study published in the January 2013 issue of the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine showed workplace health promotion programs can reduce average worker health costs by 18 percent. Savings are even larger for programs involving older workers, reported the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM). Jonathan P. Dugas, Ph.D., and colleagues at The Vitality Group, Chicago, combined data from two major studies to estimate savings from reductions in seven risk factors or medical conditions typically addressed by workplace wellness programs: physical inactivity, low fruit and vegetable intake, smoking, overweight/obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and alcohol abuse. \u201cThe results suggested that \u2014 if all heightened risk factors could be reduced to their \u2018theoretical minimums\u2019\u2014 total medical care expenses per person for all working age adults would be reduced by about $650, or approximately 18 percent. The possible savings increased with age up to 28 percent for older working adults and retirees,\u201d according to the ACOEM news release. Employees ages 55 to 65 \u201care the fastest-growing component of the workforce,\u201d says Kristin Tugman, senior director of health and productivity at Unum, a large Maine-based provider of disability insurance. \u201cThey represent significant skills and experience,\u201d she adds. \u201cEmployers don\u2019t want to lose this expertise.\u201d To support this older generation, employers need to set up \u201cproductive aging\u201d programs, advocates Tugman. \u201cMany employers have the building blocks of a productive aging program,\u201d she notes. \u201cThey just haven\u2019t been able to connect the dots.\u201d Productive-aging programs include at least five components: 1. A rigorous demographic analysis of an employer\u2019s aging workforce today and projected into the future. This knowledge is an essential foundation for productive aging efforts. 2. Employee wellness programs with specific older-employee components. View as one page 1 | 2 Next\n\n(page 2 of 2) 3. Chronic-condition management, perhaps with special emphasis on obesity. A third of all U.S. workers have at least one chronic health issue, and the percentage is higher among older employees. 4. Flexible work environment. Flexibility for older employees is broadly seen as a needed employee-retention and job-enrichment benefit. 5. Job-enrichment programs. \u201cPrograms that value older workers and seek to leverage their motivation with respect to their return to work and their staying at work can be effective in this effort,\u201d Tugman wrote in her research paper. As an example, she referred to job transition programs that took physical pressure off older workers while allowing them to make greater contributions of their skills. \u201cHow do we use her brain instead of just her brawn?\u201d she stated. Kaiser Permanente\u2019s employee workplace-wellness activities have only been operating since 2010, but the effort is already returning real health gains. From 2009 to 2012 among its estimated 200,000 employees, the health care company documented a 5 percent overall improvement in blood pressure levels, a 7 percent improvement in cholesterol levels, a 12 percent decrease in smoking, and a constant body mass index average even while the rest of the nation was getting heavier.
