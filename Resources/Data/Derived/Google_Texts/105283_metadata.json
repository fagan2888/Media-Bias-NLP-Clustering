The group, known as the Partnership for Open and Fair Skies, has said the foreign airline subsidies put U.S. carriers at a disadvantage when they compete for international passengers.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the U.S. government is taking the next step to further examine the issue of massive subsidies that Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates receive from their governments,\u201d said Jill Zuckman, a spokeswoman for the airline coalition.\n\n\u201cThis process is an opportunity for more transparency and we urge the Gulf carriers to adhere to the same standards of financial disclosure and accountability as the U.S. carriers,\u201d Zuckman continued. \u201cTheir $42 billion of state support, a clear violation of Open Skies policy, has been well-documented. They should open their books if they have nothing to hide.\u201d\n\nTravel industry and consumer groups have accused the airlines of hypocrisy, arguing that they have also received subsidies from the U.S. government at various points in their histories.\n\n\"The Big Three U.S. airlines have constructed themselves an enormous glass house, and their amnesia about their own subsidies has now cost them the credibility of their own core argument for breaking Open Skies agreements,\" U.S. Travel Association Executive Vice President for Public Affairs Jonathan Grella said on Wednesday.\n\n\"This exposes the fiction that the U.S. airline cartel's furious and expensive assault on Open Skies is about subsidies,\" he continued. We hope this prompts policymakers and the public to ask: OK, what's really motivating the campaign to break these agreements? We hope there is something else to dissuade us from by far the most likely conclusion: the Big Three airlines hate competition, and rather than cope with it in the marketplace they will undertake extreme means to stamp it out politically.\"\n\nGrella cited a report from the Library of Congress's independent Congressional Research Service that said domestic airlines received $155 billion in subsidies from 1919 to 1998.\n\nThe airline coalition has said the comparison between current foreign airline subsidies and older payments to U.S. carriers is unfair because the distributions to domestic carriers were made before the Open Skies agreements were signed.\n\n\"It is laughable that a two-decade-old unpublished paper examining U.S. aviation since 1918 is being trumpeted as \u2018evidence\u2019 that U.S. airlines are supported the way that the United Arab Emirates and Qatar routinely subsidize their airlines,\" Zuckman said when the CRS report became public.\n\n\"Funding for air mail, Post Office support, and the National Weather Service is a far cry from the well-documented $42 billion dollars in direct subsidies and other unfair state support the Middle East carriers receive,\u201d she continued.\n\nThe Obama administration said Friday both sides would have their chance to weigh in on the dispute during its review.\n\n\u201cBeginning today, any interested person or group may submit information, responses to existing materials, or any other analysis that they might wish to provide the U.S. government on this subject on the www.regulations.gov website,\u201d the agencies said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "U.S. airlines say foreign carriers have received $42 million from the U.S.", "description": "U.S. airlines say foreign carriers have received $42 million from the U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "U.S. airlines say foreign carriers have received $42 million from the U.S.", "title": "Feds to review Middle Eastern airline subsidy claims", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/238503-feds-to-review-middle-eastern-airline-subsidy-claims", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/qatar_air.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/238503-feds-to-review-middle-eastern-airline-subsidy-claims", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-10T17:44-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, Emirates Airlines, Open skies,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-10T17:44:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/238503-feds-to-review-middle-eastern-airline-subsidy-claims", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "U.S. airlines say foreign carriers have received $42 million from the U.S.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds to review Middle Eastern airline subsidy claims"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds to review Middle Eastern airline subsidy claims"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe09d1\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration is wading into a dispute over foreign airline subsidies that has roiled the U.S. aviation industry.\n\u201cTheir $42 billion of state support, a clear violation of Open Skies policy, has been well-documented.\n\"This exposes the fiction that the U.S. airline cartel's furious and expensive assault on Open Skies is about subsidies,\" he continued.\nThe airline coalition has said the comparison between current foreign airline subsidies and older payments to U.S. carriers is unfair because the distributions to domestic carriers were made before the Open Skies agreements were signed.\nUnions that represent parts of the U.S. airline industry have alleged Middle Eastern airlines like Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates Airlines have received more than $42 billion in subsidies since 2004."}
