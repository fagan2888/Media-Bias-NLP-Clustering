Just 16 percent of all Americans want lawmakers to repeal the Affordable Care Act outright, and not replace it with another health-care law.

And only 13 percent favor repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a Republican-crafted alternative. In other words, only 29 percent of the public agrees with one of the two options that are favored by the leading Republican candidates for president.

Despite their fervid opposition to the ACA ever since it became law in 2010, Republicans in Congress have found it impossible to agree on a replacement plan for Obamacare, much less to pass a bill for repeal or replacement that would be able to survive a veto from President Barack Obama, or any other Democratic president.

The ACA mandated that nearly all Americans have some form of health coverage or pay a fine. The law also barred insurers from denying coverage to people because of pre-existing medical conditions, and created government-run marketplaces that sell private individual insurance plans to people who do not have health coverage from their employers or from a government program like Medicare and Medicaid.

Congressional Democrats have been criticized by more liberal members of their party for not passing a law that would create a single-payer health-care system for all Americans. Such a program, sometimes called "Medicare for all," would have the government take the place of insurers in providing health coverage to all Americans.
