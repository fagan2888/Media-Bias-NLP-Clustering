The FCC\u2019s new rules would ensure that the smaller wireless companies follow suit.\n\nThe rules would also apply to \u201cinterconnected\u201d texting apps that can send messages to phone numbers \u2014 like Apple\u2019s iMessage \u2014 on devices that are connected to a wireless carrier\u2019s network.\n\nLast year, the FCC voted to require carriers and interconnected texting apps to send a bounce back message if a user tries to send a text to 911 but the text cannot be delivered.\n\nThe new rules would not apply to texting apps that send messages to registered usernames \u2014 like WhatsApp, which was recently acquired by Facebook for $19 billion \u2014 or texting apps on devices that are connected to the Internet through a Wi-Fi network.\n\nBut some question whether the agency has the authority to regulate apps at all.\n\nThe Voice Over the Net Coalition \u2014 which represents AT&T, Google, Skype and Vonage \u2014 questioned the agency\u2019s jurisdiction in a filing earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThere is not a sufficient link between the requirement that [interconnected text] providers provide text-to-911 capability and the Commission\u2019s existing legal authority,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe coalition also warned the FCC against creating costly regulatory burdens for text messaging companies.\n\nIn a filing last month, Microsoft, which owns Skype, urged the agency to \u201cbe cautious not to get ahead of technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cMicrosoft believes it is premature to set a date certain by which such apps will be required to provide text-to-911 capability,\u201d the company said.\n\nInstead, the agency should bring companies together to create \u201ca voluntary industry commitment to work toward text-to-911 capability for interconnected apps,\u201d Microsoft said.\n\nOn the other side of the issue, the wireless companies don\u2019t want to be held responsible for what the text messaging apps do.\n\nThe agency\u2019s new rules would allow the text apps to use the wireless company\u2019s network to deliver messages to 911 call centers.\n\nIn a meeting with FCC officials late last month, the four major wireless companies argued that the agency\u2019s new rules should only ensure that companies don\u2019t impede text-to-911 messages sent through an app.\n\nThe text message apps should be responsible for making sure the service works on the device and educating users, the companies said.\n\nCritics were also quick to note that many of the country\u2019s emergency call centers also don\u2019t have the equipment or the trained personnel to receive and respond to text messages.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ways to go before this is readily available to consumers even though the carriers are ready nationwide,\u201d one wireless industry official said.\n\nThe FCC is hoping to change that with its vote next week.\n\nAccording to an FCC official, one intended result of the new rules will be to encourage the emergency call centers to update their equipment and training once text-to-911 becomes more widely available from wireless companies and apps.\n\n\u201cBy providing stability, it will create more incentives for [emergency call centers] to adopt text-to-911,\u201d the official said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Tech companies question if the proposed rules go beyond FCC's jurisdiction.",
