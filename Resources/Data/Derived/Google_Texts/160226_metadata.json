Mr. Gordon is currently the only declared Democrat in the election race that has sparked national interest with the announced retirement of incumbent Rep. Richard Hanna (R).\n\nIn a phone interview, we were able to speak with the one-term Oneida County Legislator about many of the issues that face whomever wins the election in November. An insurance agent and bar owner, Mr. Gordon is proud of his small business roots and his self-described stance as a conservative Democrat. His definition of a conservative Democrat includes his conservative view on fiscal issues and a more traditional Democrat view on social issues. But as we found in the interview, Mr. Gordon does not fit snugly in any of the traditional categories most candidates fall into.\n\nMr. Gordon was clear in describing himself as a political outsider to establishment Democrat politics. He went on to confirm this as he spoke about his view on transparency in Government, the Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare), ISIS and Middle East policy, and the NY SAFE Act, among other issues. In fact, beyond his support of single payer healthcare that is being promoted by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, Mr. Gordon takes a very unique view on most issues.\n\nWhen it comes to the Republican candidates in the race, Mr. Gordon is generally positive in describing them. He noted his familiarity with Aaron Price, and bemoaned the lack of news media coverage on the first-time candidates run for Congress. In reference to frontrunner Assemblywoman Claudia Tenney, he noted her willingness to work openly with Democrats to address issues of concern for constituents. The only candidate that Mr. Gordon had nothing to say about was George Phillips, of whom he apparently knew nothing about. Still, such open-handed comments about direct competitors is in a contested election is uncommon in this highly partisan age.\n\nMr. Gordon confirmed that he has filed with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC). But he has not crossed the $5,000 threshold for a congressional campaign. Though Mr. Gordon announced his intent to run on December 30, 2015, he has not filed a financial statement yet. He states that his campaign has received \"thousands\" of in-kind (non-cash) donations to create his website and speaking to the 8 Democratic committees throughout the district.\n\nWhen it came to the subject of the issues, things get a bit murky, as it did when he made general accusations against unnamed politicians on their sexual orientation in December 2015. On the campaign website, davegordonforcongress.com, Mr. Gordon lists his main political issues he seeks to champion. These issues include taxes and the budget, health care, immigration, and the environment. We had time to cover 3 of these issues, as well as the 2nd Amendment, and international policy.\n\nIn terms of health care, Mr. Gordon had a lot to say. Perhaps surprisingly for a Democrat, David Gordon was unabashed in his disapproval of Obamacare. He was very direct in his disclosure that the signature law of President Obama was flawed, failing to provide help to those who need it most, and the nature of the law to provide catastrophic coverage as opposed to helping the poor on less devastating but important coverage. But while he supports amending Obamacare, he is opposed to a full repeal and replacement of the law. [video part 2]\n\n\"I believe charging people a fee for not having health insurance, that undermines democracy... I'm a bigger advocate for single payer [health care system], yes...\"\n\nDavid Gordon was also clear in his dislike for passage of legislation without review. After initially stating that he was unaware of the controversy over how Obamacare was hurriedly passed by the Democrat-led Congress in 2010, he opposed the way that Obamacare had been passed without time for the law to be read by members of Congress. He clearly stated that he would not vote for any Bill that he did not have time to read, and that was not available for constituents. [video part 2]\n\n\"... I think that transparency, especially in Government, is the most important aspect of public service... To be honest with you, going to Congress, unless I had prior information about every Bill, I would vote against every Bill that was shoved down my throat before I had adequate answers to several questions... Michael Vasquez: In reference to the Obamacare, which had 24 hours before it was passed you would have voted no, because you didn't get a chance to read it? That would probably be a true statement.\"\n\nWhen asked about how this standard for transparency might be applied to others in Government, Mr. Gordon wavered a bit. When asked about his thoughts on Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and the email scandal that has plagued her campaign of a year, Mr. Gordon was at first unfamiliar with the issue at hand. He seemed to be unaware that Mrs. Clinton had deleted 30,000 emails and wiped her private servers prior to the FBI taking those servers for an on-going investigation into violations of State Department regulations when she served as Secretary of State. Mr. Gordon further stated that because Mrs. Clinton had apologized for her violations that nothing more should be done on the issue, even though it obstructed the very transparency that he advocates. [video part 3]\n\n\"I don't think she should be indicted for it [personal server/delete emails/secret documents], you know there was a vetting process for that and you know and through that process. I mean, should she have, she came out and apologized for it, she should not have had that information on her personal server... It's a tough call because perhaps, her position as Secretary of State is even higher above, her clearance is higher than that of the FBI.\"\n\nEqually confusing was David Gordon's thoughts on the budget, one of the issues on his website. When asked about the Omnibus Spending Bill that was recently passed, Mr. Gordon was unfamiliar with the Bill. Surprisingly he was also unaware of the controversial components of the Bill: the increase in H2b visas, and the funding of Planned Parenthood (that Mr. Gordon supports). [video part 2]\n\n\"I don't really know enough about the Bill. I'd have to really sit down and delve into it. It's one of the luxuries of not being elected to it yet... I will say I've always been an avid supporter of Planned Parenthood...\"\n\nYet the subject that may be the weakest subject for Mr. Gordon could be ISIS and international policy. Apparently unaware of the Syrian refugee non-binding resolution that was stalled in Utica (and failed to pass in Binghamton as well) Mr. Gordon took both sides of the issue in a conflicting statement of support. Mr. Gordon told us that he equally wants to welcome refugees, and felt that the standard timeframe of 18-24 months was \"like a prison sentence.\" [ video part 3]\n\n\"I don't necessarily oppose it. I just believe that as long as more guidelines are established and better technology is used for these background checks and that people are properly vetted, if they can do it in a shorter period of time by cutting out some of the red tape ... there's always duplication to the process that delay in action... 18-24 months is exorbitant amount of time for people seeking refugee... that's like a prison sentence...\"\n\nThis led to discussion about ISIS and the Middle East. Mr. Gordon opposes placing troops in Syria, apparently supporting the Obama Administration's actions to date. But the key to defeating ISIS and other terrorist groups was described as imposing sanctions. Mr. Gordon confirmed and expanded his idea that international sanctions should be placed on ISIS and any nation that supports it. It seemed that Mr. Gordon is unaware that ISIS is not a nation and sanctions cannot be placed upon the organization like a country. In addition, it seems that Mr. Gordon is unaware of the UN sanctions that were put in place in December 2015 to ban terrorist groups from international banking. [video part 3]\n\n\"That's correct. I want us to put sanctions on the group of ISIS... the biggest driver in the Middle East of terrorism, is our dependency on foreign fuel.\"\n\nFurther, Mr. Gordon was completely unaware that ISIS is fighting against Iran in Syria. It was a scenario that we presented and Mr. Gordon did not correct. When we suggested that, by his stated position, if ISIS were getting support from Iran (which it is fighting) that this would be terms to violate the Iran Nuclear Deal, Mr. Gordon balked. He stated that the Iran deal was necessary and regardless of support of terrorist organizations (in this case incorrectly ISIS) should be maintained. All of which calls to question exactly where Mr. Gordon stands in regard to US international policy, and his knowledge of on-going current events in the region.\n\nFinally, David Gordon brought up the issue of the 2nd Amendment, which is one of the issues that appears on his website. Mr. Gordon (a gun owner himself) claims that he is not a supporter of the NY SAFE Act, which he believes must be repealed. When asked about any public declarations of this, he cited a pledge with the Conservative Party that he signed in 2013 (which is not linked to or shown on his website) and an interview with WUTQ in January 2015. Mr. Gordon also appeared to be unaware that the creation of the NY SAFE Act was a Democrat-led legislation. In addition, Mr. Gordon opposes the most recent Executive Order of President Obama. [video part 4]\n\n\"I'm obviously against the President's Executive Order for, his Executive Order that was trying to make stronger policy when it comes to gun shows and the sale of firearms at gun shows... The statistics are very low, and to punish all of the legal law abiding firearm citizens for that is ludicrous. I just think it's another attempt to try to disband people from their right to bear arms.\"\n\nIn conclusion, David Gordon is clearly not the typical Democrat candidate. He holds several positions that oppose his Party's national agenda, as well as directly rebuking actions and policy of President Obama. But that is not to say that Mr. Gordon is a closet Republican either, as he does support issues that many Republicans strongly reject. But what is most clear, is that Mr. Gordon is either unaware or confused on many of the on-going current issues facing the nation. That is not only apparent in this interview, but was also prominent in his interview on WIBX on December 31, 2015 http://wibx950.com/democrat-dave-gordon-is-running-for-congress/. It remains to be seen on how the Democratic Party will react when David Gordon appears before the 8 committees seeking their endorsement for his run, especially if no other challenger in their Party appears.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a continuation of our comprehensive coverage of the 2016 New York 22nd congressional district race, we were able to speak exclusively with David Gordon on Fe", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/exclusive-interview-with-david-gordon-democrat-candidate-for-the-ny-22", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/eb/99/eb99dcb5b637bd49f6bfe709f5a6dcf8.jpg?itok=t_wS0vZi", "type": "article", "title": "Exclusive interview with David Gordon, Democrat candidate for the NY-22"}, "twitter": {"site": "@examinercom", "description": "In a continuation of our comprehensive coverage of the 2016 New York 22nd congressional district race, we were able to speak exclusively with David Gordon on February 5, 2016.
