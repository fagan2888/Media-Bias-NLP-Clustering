Enjoy the time with your family and friends instead,\u201d said American Atheists President David Silverman. \u201cToday\u2019s adults have no obligation to pretend to believe the lies their parents believed. It\u2019s OK to admit that your parents were wrong about God, and it\u2019s definitely OK to tell your children the truth.\u201d\n\nNow here's one from the Telegraph:\n\n\"Today's adults have no obligation to pretend to believe the lies their parents believed. It's OK to admit that your parents were wrong about God, and it's definitely OK to tell your children the truth,\" said David Silverman, the group's president, as he launched the campaign.\n\nAgain, from the atheist website:\n\nDespite multiple attempts, American Atheists was unable to secure a billboard advertising space in Jackson, Mississippi, as area lessors rejected the design due to content. \u201cThe fact that billboard companies would turn away business because they are so concerned about the reaction by the community to a simple message that not everyone goes to church and not everyone believes in gods shows just how much education and activism on behalf of atheists is needed in the South,\u201d said Public Relations Director Danielle Muscato.\n\nBack to the Telegraph:\n\nIn a sign of the hostility the adverts are expected to generate, American Atheists said that it had failed secure a single billboard site in Jackson, Mississippi after leasing companies collectively refused to offer space, fearing a community backlash.\n\n\"The fact that billboard companies would turn away business because they are so concerned about the reaction by the community shows just how much education and activism on behalf of atheists is needed in the South,\" added Danielle Muscato, the group's spokesperson.\n\nI can see only one major difference between the versions: The Telegraph ascribed hostility only to Christians (and without any quotes or evidence, mind you). Apparently, holiday-bashing billboards in the most religious region of the U.S. don\u2019t count as hostility.\n\nNor did the Telegraph ask any billboard companies why they turned down the atheist ads. Did the companies truly fear a \"community backlash\"? Newspapers are supposed to report hostility, not assume it.\n\nAnd how about pastors or other Christian leaders? Or maybe those potential community backlashers? Do their views count? Or does the Telegraph regard them as guilty until proven innocent?\n\nThirdly, the newspaper showed no curiosity about the cost of the billboard campaign. That's a standard question whenever Christian leaders announce a major initiative. And remember that, like every church, American Atheists is a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization.\n\nAnd it's not like space or time was tight. Half of the Telegraph story recites boilerplate facts on the rise of the \"Nones,\" the slide in church attendance, and the lack of atheists in Congress. If there was time to dig all that up, why not take time to get more than one side?\n\nBut let's be fair. The Telegraph probably didn't give that much thought to this story. It's Christmastime, and the newspaper needs timely stories, and American Atheists had handy copy and art. A match made in heaven, assuming there is one.\n\nAnd what harm could any of this do? Except, you know, to the sensibilities of devout communities. And to the credibility of a major newspaper.\n\nPhoto: Billboard ad from American Atheist's current anti-Christmas campaign.
