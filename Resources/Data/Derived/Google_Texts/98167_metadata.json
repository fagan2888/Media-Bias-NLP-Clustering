The reality is that most guides tend to use the same 15 or so flies all year anyway.\n\n\u201cIf I could only fish with one dry fly for the rest of my life? I couldn\u2019t live without a parachute Adams,\u201d said Robert \u201cThe Bug Guy\u201d Younghanz, a fly-fishing guide and instructor who stars in the top-selling DVD, \u201cThe Bug Guy: Entomology for the Fly Fisher.\u201d \u201cOne nymph? A flashback pheasant tail. It covers so many different orders. Most important lake fly? Callibaetis.\u201d\n\nAnyone interested in taking up fly-fishing will want to develop at least a general knowledge of insects. At minimum, they should recognize the difference between a mayfly, a stonefly, a caddis fly and a midge. It helps to understand terrestrials (ants, beetles, grasshoppers and the like) and streamers (minnows, leeches and such). But most important is paying enough attention to the natural world to recognize when to try which fly.\n\nIn fishing jargon, it\u2019s known as \u201cmatching the hatch,\u201d imitating the size, shape and color of insects on the water with a lifelike replica. Some believe any realistic fly will do, however, as long as it\u2019s presented properly to the fish.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that presentation is more important than fly selection,\u201d says Landon Mayer, author of \u201cColorado\u2019s Best Fly Fishing.\u201d \u201cInstead of relying on the fly to catch the fish, I make sure every drift counts.\u201d\n\nMayer has whittled his fly box down to 25 patterns in three sizes. By carrying fewer patterns that represent different food forms based on how they are presented, it allows the fisherman to focus more on technique.\n\nThe three key ingredients for a fly to make it into Mayer\u2019s box are versatility (Barr\u2019s Vis-A-Dun mimics many insects), durability (a tube midge will often last through a full day of fishing) and realism (if you\u2019re not sure a fly is a good match, wet it to see what it really looks like).\n\nBeyond the aforementioned Adams and pheasant tail, the age-old standards for most fly boxes include various sizes of bead-head Prince nymphs, black Woolly Buggers, elk-hair caddis, hare\u2019s ears, Copper Johns and some larger form of black/brown/golden stonefly nymph, rubber legs optional. Maybe throw in a few Stimulators, a reliable grasshopper pattern, eggs, midges, San Juan worms and a classic attractor/indicator fly like a Royal Wulff, and you\u2019ve got most of the bases covered.\n\nBear in mind during the modern era of fly-tying nomenclature that it\u2019s increasingly difficult to classify a fly by name these days.\n\nFor example, here\u2019s Mayer\u2019s list: Rojo Midge, Jujubee Midge, Griffith\u2019s Gnat, BWO Barr Emerger, JujuBaetis, Stalcup\u2019s Baetis, Mathew\u2019s BWO Sparkle Dun, Barr\u2019s Graphic Caddis, Breadcrust, Landon\u2019s Larva, Puterbaugh\u2019s Foam Caddis, Mercer\u2019s PoxyBack Little Yellow Stone, Barr\u2019s Tungstone, Pat\u2019s Rubber Legs, Crystal Stimulator, Rogue Stone, PMD Barr Emerger, Copper John, Mathew\u2019s PMD Sparkle Dun, Parachute Adams, Foam Flying Ant, Flashtail Mini Egg, Slumpbuster, Lawson\u2019s Conehead Sculpin and Meat Whistle.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re still wondering what a callibaetis is, just tie on a parachute Adams trailed by a pheasant tail, toss it into the lake and see what happens.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Basics are key in stocking a good fly box, but presentation counts, too", "title": "Basics are key in stocking a good fly box, but presentation counts, too", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/21/basics-are-key-in-stocking-a-good-fly-box-but-presentation-counts-too/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140621__20140622_C10_SP22OUTMAINp2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140621__20140622_C10_SP22OUTMAINp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-21T16:44:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:37:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd13f6\"", "article_summary": "At minimum, they should recognize the difference between a mayfly, a stonefly, a caddis fly and a midge.\nA flashback pheasant tail.\nAnd if you\u2019re still wondering what a callibaetis is, just tie on a parachute Adams trailed by a pheasant tail, toss it into the lake and see what happens.\nBear in mind during the modern era of fly-tying nomenclature that it\u2019s increasingly difficult to classify a fly by name these days.\nIf fly-fishing is so simple, how come it seems like every guide in Colorado carries 5,000 flies to the river?"}
