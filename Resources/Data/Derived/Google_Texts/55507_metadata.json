During his time in the House, Moran\u2019s career has been awfully tumultuous, filled with police investigations, offensive remarks, gaffes, and a naughty son. Here\u2019s a look:\n\nPolice in Moran\u2019s home county of Arlington, Va., were called to the scene in 1994 after the congressman grabbed a man for handing out anti-Moran leaflets at one of his events.\n\nIn 1995, Moran sparred with California Republican Duke Cunningham on the House floor over Operation Desert Storm. Moran asked him to step outside with him and as the two left the chamber, Moran shoved Cunningham.\n\nAfter revelations of Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelities with Monica Lewinsky, Moran told first lady Hillary Clinton that if she were his sister, he would have punched the president in the nose.\n\nMoran was plagued with a handful of controversial, questionable financial dealings while serving. A 1998 near-$500,000 loan he received from MBNA Corp. during a time in which he supported legislation backed by the company earned him criticism from Virginia\u2019s Democratic lieutenant governor\u200b (and current senator) Tim Kaine. A year later, he borrowed $25,000 from a drug lobbyist who also backed legislation supported by Moran. He, along with other members of Congress, were investigated by the House Ethics Committee for his involvement in granting clients of lobbying group PMA Group government contracts; PMA Group had donated to Moran\u2019s campaign, as well as to his brother\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.\n\nMoran and his second wife filed for divorce after she called police because he pushed her during an argument. Moran claimed he did so in self-defense. Ultimately, no charges were filed.\n\nIn 2000, Moran was involved in a physical conflict with an eight-year-old boy, who he claimed was trying to carjack him with a gun in the parking lot of a recreation center. The congressman grabbed the kid and brought him into the center \u201cin a choke hold,\u201d according to a witness; the boy recounted the episode by saying he was \u201cchoked\u201d and \u201ccussed at\u201d by Moran. The boy\u2019s mother threatened to sue Moran because all the boy did was compliment the congressman\u2019s car, and he had only a toy baby bottle with candy on him at the time.\n\nIn 2003, Moran was pressured to step down from a leadership position after what were considered anti-Semitic remarks: He said the Jewish community\u2019s influence led to the Iraq War. \u201cIf it were not for the strong support of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq, we would not be doing this,\u201d he told an audience.\n\nIn 2010, Moran dismissed his Republican opponent Patrick Murray\u2019s 24 years in the military as not amounting to \u201cpublic service.\u201d \u201cWhat [Republicans] do is find candidates, usually stealth candidates, that haven\u2019t been in office, haven\u2019t served or performed in any kind of public service,\u201d he said. Moran later apologized and said he misspoke.\n\nThe Washington Post endorsed Moran in 2010, but it wasn\u2019t an endorsement to be proud of: \u201cMr. Moran, a Democrat who has long represented the heavily Democratic 8th District, has embarrassed himself, and his constituents, with ill-considered comments in the past. But he is conscientious and constituent-oriented, and his opposition in this election, as in past contests, is weak.\u201d\n\nWhen former Florida Republican Allen West, who is black, criticized President Obama, Moran said, that West was \u201cnot representative of the African-American community.\u201d Moran went on to say that West was ignoring that he had \u201cclimbed this ladder of opportunity that was constructed by so many of his ancestors\u2019 sweat, sacrifice, blood\u201d when he criticized the president\u2019s policies.\n\nIn 2011, Moran told the Arabic-language news organization Alhurra that the reason Democrats had lost control of the House that year was \u201cthe same reason [during] the Civil War.\u201d \u201cA lot of people in the United States don\u2019t want to be governed by an African-American,\u201d he explained, \u201cparticularly one who is liberal, who wants to spend money, and who wants to reach out to include everyone in our society.\u201d\n\nJust a few weeks before the 2012 election, James O\u2019Keefe and Project Veritas released a video of Patrick Moran, the congressman\u2019s son, explaining to an operative how he could forge utility bills in order to vote using the names of inactive voters. The younger Moran resigned that day, but used the excuse that he gave the operative tips out of an \u201cinstinct to be helpful.\u201d A month later, the younger Moran pled guilty to an assault after an argument with his girlfriend in which he reportedly slammed her head into a trashcan cage.\n\nWhen pressed about President Obama\u2019s broken and misleading promise that people could keep their health-care plans under Obamacare last year, Moran said the president was \u201crightfully excited\u201d about the new law so he \u201cengage[d] in a little hyperbole.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re all human,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Wed, 2014-01-15 17:41", "sailthru.author": "Andrew Johnson", "description": "As Jim noted earlier, longtime Virginia Democrat Jim Moran announced today that he will step away from Congress and not seek reelection.
