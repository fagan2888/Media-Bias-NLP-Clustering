But Obama took the opportunity at least three times in the first half of his final State of the Union.\n\n1. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is [about] filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we\u2019ll still have coverage. Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far. Health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cFood stamp recipients didn\u2019t cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cImmigrants aren\u2019t the reason wages haven\u2019t gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns.\n\nRefreshing.
