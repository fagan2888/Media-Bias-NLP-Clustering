Through this Law we were all given our unique languages, songs, ceremonies, ways of life, teachings and stories. We were all given our ways of loving and taking care of Mother Earth.\n\nKizhay Manitou put spirit in Mother Earth and all of life. We come from the spirit world and flow through the Earth. We will all return to the spirit world and to the Earth when our journey on Earth has been completed.\n\nThrough Mother Earth, Kizhay Manitou planted the seeds of life, with Original Instructions on how to be and how to sustain our relationship with Mother Earth. Mother Earth gave birth to the plants, the animals, the birds and finally to the human being. Kizhay Manitou gave us medicines for everything that can affect us.\n\nMother Earth is alive and she is the Original Mother of life. She has a living spirit and she is sacred. Mother Earth is so beautiful \u2013 she is the most beautiful creation \u2013 the most beautiful woman of all.\n\nAs the Mother of life, Mother Earth gives birth, and gives us everything we need to live \u2013 the food, the water, the medicines, the clothing, the shelter, and most of all, the love, kindness and teachings that a mother gives to her child.\n\nHer teachings are reflected in Natural Laws \u2013 the balance of nature in the rising and setting of the sun, the patterns of the weather through the winds, the rains, and the elements of life, the natural flow of the blood of the Earth through the rivers and the oil beneath her, the cycles of the moon and the breaking of the waters when a child comes, as woman gives life in the most natural of ways. As long as we are breathing this beautiful air, whether we realize it or not, there is an invisible umbilical cord that always connects us to our Original Mother \u2013 our life source, Mother Earth.\n\nIn Nehetho, the word Waskaawe siweno (WAS-KAAH-WAY-SEE-WIN) means \u201cEverything around you\u201d and describes how we are all connected.\n\nIn Dakota, Mitakuye Owasana means \u201cAll my relations \u2013 we are related.\u201d We are related to the stars in the sky, the birds, the fish, the animals and the plant life.\n\nIn Anishinaabe, Nikanisitook acknowledges \u201cAll my relatives in life.\u201d\n\nWith the exception of the human being, all of the other living beings of creation have continued to follow their Original Instructions and live in balance and harmony with Natural Laws. It is only the human being that has severed its natural connection to Mother Earth and lost its connection to her Natural Laws.\n\nWe cannot continue to disrupt the Natural Laws of life. If even one of us disrespects that Great Binding Law, it affects us all, and it will come back to us. Nature\u2019s Laws are self-enforcing. What we put into our circle always returns to our web of life. Mother Earth will have the final say because she is the Mother to us all.\n\nNature is always giving us signs to bring us messages. Right now, the human beings are behaving out of balance, and Mother Earth is reflecting that imbalance through climate change.\n\nWe are the Earth. We are the voice of the Earth. In our Original Instructions as human beings, Kizhay Manitou gave us the responsibility to respect, take care of, and most importantly to make a journey to Mother Earth, to connect to the land and learn how to live.\n\nWe are the free and independent Original People of this land. As the roots of this land, we are the true leaders of our ancestral lands \u2013 Manito Ka Apit \u2013 Where Kizhay Manitou \u2013 the Great Spirit \u2013 sits.\n\nWe come from the Dakota, Nehetho, and Anishinaabe Nations who have lived on our ancestral lands since Kizhay Manitou placed us here with our languages, songs, ceremonies, teachings and ways of life. We have always been here.\n\nAs unique Dakota, Nehetho, and Anishinaabe Peoples, we speak with one voice. We have respect for each other. As the Original People we welcome you. We come forward to share with you. We come to share that love with you. We bring our shared understanding and that is this:\n\nWe are all brothers and sisters and we all have a sacred responsibility to take care of and make an alliance with Mother Earth.\n\nWe are a peaceful people. We are not asking for anything for ourselves. The human being was the last part of creation to be created. It is our spiritual responsibility to take care of that life.\n\nKizhay Manitou had a vision of a world filled with peace and love. It is through the land that we can find that peace and love.\n\nAll of humanity needs to make a journey to the land, to the sacred sites, places of healing, teaching and connection, to find peace.\n\nWe make an invitation to the whole human family, and all the children, to come to our lodges so we can teach them to love the land, connect to the land, and take care of the land. Our journey begins with gratitude to the Earth and to the Spirit. Kizhay Manitou gave all of us gifts to share with each other, to take care of the Earth and all life.\n\nIn our lodges, the children will hear the teachings, feel the ceremonies and feel the love for Mother Earth.\n\nOur ancestors prophesized of this time \u2013 a time of climate change, a time of crossroads, a time of self-examination, and a time of choice. Our choice is not a choice of words, it is a choice of action. We need to stand strong now in alliance with Mother Earth.\n\nWe are all in this together. Today, we call on all Nations of the world to join us in the spirit of our Original Instructions to care for Mother Earth together, and find true peace.\n\nIt will require a peaceful journey back to the Earth, to find our direction for our survival.\n\nAs one of our great Lakota leaders of the past, Crazy Horse, said:\n\nUpon suffering beyond suffering;\n\nThe Red Nation shall rise again.\n\nIt will be a blessing for a sick world\n\nA world filled with broken promises, selfishness and separations\n\nA world longing for light again!\n\nI see a time, long after the skies have grown dark and dirty\n\nAnd the Water has become bad-smelling\n\nI see a time of seventh generation,\n\nWhen all the colours of mankind\n\nWill gather under the Sacred Tree of Life\n\nAnd one whole Earth will become one Circle again.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A stirring statement on the Law that binds us all, from the elders of Manitoba, written and spoken at Turtle Lodge spiritual center.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/12/25/turtle-lodge-great-binding-law-statement-manitoba-elders-162881", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/great_binding_law_poster-turtle_lodge.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "From Turtle Lodge: The Great Binding Law (Statement of Manitoba Elders)"}, "abstract": "A stirring statement on the Law that binds us all, from the elders of Manitoba, written and spoken at Turtle Lodge spiritual center.", "dc": {"title": "From Turtle Lodge: The Great Binding Law (Statement of Manitoba Elders)"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/12/25/turtle-lodge-great-binding-law-statement-manitoba-elders-162881", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Spirituality, Traditional Spirituality, Manitoba, Turtle Lodge, Dave Courchene, Earth, Mother Earth, elders", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.date": "2015-12-25T10:30-05:00", "dcterms.title": "From Turtle Lodge: The Great Binding Law (Statement of Manitoba Elders)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd28f4\"", "article_summary": "Mother Earth is alive and she is the Original Mother of life.\nThrough Mother Earth, Kizhay Manitou planted the seeds of life, with Original Instructions on how to be and how to sustain our relationship with Mother Earth.\nMother Earth is so beautiful \u2013 she is the most beautiful creation \u2013 the most beautiful woman of all.\nIn our lodges, the children will hear the teachings, feel the ceremonies and feel the love for Mother Earth.\nWe were all given our ways of loving and taking care of Mother Earth."}
