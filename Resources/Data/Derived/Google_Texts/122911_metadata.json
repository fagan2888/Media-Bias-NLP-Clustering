According to Yale French student John Sununu, the readings were planned as a multilingual event. \"We have one student reading in Haitian Creole; we have people reading in Russian; one who signed up in German; one in Italian; Spanish; and supposedly, we have a professor in the French department that will be reading in Chinese,\" said Sununu. \"Proust is a French author at heart, but is very universal.\"\n\nSununu said what made this event truly remarkable is that participants were to read Proust on a bed in an exact replica of the cork-lined bedroom where Proust penned his famous work. \"It's got this beautiful bed in the center,\" he said. \"[The set designer] has actually put in cork on the walls of the theater. It's going to be filled with chaises and tables.\" Also adding to the authenticity: organizers planned to offer food mentioned in Proust's novel, including madeleines (small, shell-shaped sponge cakes), asparagus, and baked chicken.\n\nIn Search of Lost Time was first published in France 100 years ago this month. The Proust marathon, a free event, took place at the Saybrook Underbrook Theatre, 242 Elm Street in New Haven.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Arts/Culture", "description": "The Yale University French Department celebrated the 100th anniversary of French writer Marcel Proust's \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu, or In Search of Lost", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/marathon-celebration-proust", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201311/Proust_set.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Yale University French Department celebrated the 100th anniversary of French writer Marcel Proust's \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu, or In Search of Lost", "title": "A Marathon Celebration of Proust"}, "story_id": 245802775, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "Ray Hardman", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "A Marathon Celebration of Proust"}, "nid": 12472, "datePublished": "2013-11-17", "keywords": "Yale University, New Haven Region, The Daily", "wordCount": 327, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ead\"", "article_summary": "The Proust marathon, a free event, took place at the Saybrook Underbrook Theatre, 242 Elm Street in New Haven.\nStarting Saturday Morning at 7:30 pm, and continuing until 3:30 am Sunday, 100 people read aloud from Swann's Way.\nAccording to Yale French student John Sununu, the readings were planned as a multilingual event.\nSununu said what made this event truly remarkable is that participants were to read Proust on a bed in an exact replica of the cork-lined bedroom where Proust penned his famous work.\n\"Proust is a French author at heart, but is very universal.\""}
