It was home to thousands of students and young professionals for nearly seven decades.\n\nIt\u2019s coming down next month, destined to be replaced by something fancier.\n\nMeanwhile, the old building is offering one final gift to the community \u2014 possibly the gift of life for those caught in house fires.\n\nThe Charleston Fire Department is using the 14-story building as a training center for its 330 firefighters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare anywhere in the country to get a 14-story building to have your way with,\u201d said Ryan Kunitzer, the department\u2019s community educator. \u201cWe try to get as close to real-world conditions as possible.\u201d\n\nIn a few weeks, the department will bring in smoke machines to simulate an actual fire.\n\nFirefighters have been going through its narrow halls this week, forcing opening doors to the small apartments, practicing rescuing a downed comrade, working drills that will make them more effective against a real fire.\n\nThe Charleston County Sheriff\u2019s Office also has been using the building for SWAT team training.\n\nCharleston has few high-rises. The top floor of the Sergeant Jasper is the 15th, even though it\u2019s a 14-story building, because there is no 13th floor. The views from those windows on a sunny day are stunning \u2014 Colonial Lake and the Ravenel Bridge from one side, the Ashley River and the marina from the other.\n\nThe Beach Co., which is redeveloping the site, has said the next buildings will be four to seven stories. Plans include some apartments, but the price range has not been announced. It\u2019s highly unlikely they will be as affordable as Sergeant Jasper. When residents were told last year that they had to vacate the 220 apartments, a studio was renting for $835 a month, water and electricity included.\n\nThe last residents moved out in August. The apartments already have been gutted.\n\nThe building is screened off to limit public access. Firetrucks are parked in the back.\n\nIt will be taken down floor by floor, starting from the top. No explosives will be used, according to the Beach Co.\n\nReach Dave Munday at 937-5553.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Sergeant Jasper, iconic Charleston apartment building slated for demolition, offers final gift to the community, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nVideos, \r\nVideos, Beach Co.,Charleston Fire Department,Sergeant Jasper", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "There was nothing else like it in downtown Charleston, and it\u2019s not likely to be replicated \u2014 affordable apartments in a safe location within walking distance of downtown, right by the most scenic lake in the city, with some of the best", "title": "Sergeant Jasper, iconic Charleston apartment building slated for demolition, offers final gift to the community", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150129/150129342/sergeant-jasper-iconic-charleston-apartment-building-slated-for-demolition-offers-final-gift-to-the-community", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150129/PC16/150129342/AR/0/AR-150129342.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150129/PC16/150129342/AR/0/AR-150129342.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There was nothing else like it in downtown Charleston, and it\u2019s not likely to be replicated \u2014 affordable apartments in a safe location within walking distance of downtown, right by the most scenic lake in the city, with some of the best", "title": "Sergeant Jasper, iconic Charleston apartment building slated for demolition, offers final gift to the community", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150129/PC16/150129342/AR/0/AR-150129342.jpg?201501291846", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150129342}}, "keywords": "Sergeant Jasper, iconic Charleston apartment building slated for demolition, offers final gift to the community , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nVideos, \r\nVideos, Beach Co.,Charleston Fire Department,Sergeant Jasper", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-29T13:11:55Z", "modified_time": "2015-01-29T18:46:00Z", "author": "Dave Munday"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "There was nothing else like it in downtown Charleston, and it\u2019s not likely to be replicated \u2014 affordable apartments in a safe location within walking distance of downtown, right by the most scenic lake in the city, with some of the best"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s very rare anywhere in the country to get a 14-story building to have your way with,\u201d said Ryan Kunitzer, the department\u2019s community educator.\nThe Charleston Fire Department is using the 14-story building as a training center for its 330 firefighters.\nThe top floor of the Sergeant Jasper is the 15th, even though it\u2019s a 14-story building, because there is no 13th floor.\nSergeant Jasper apartments opened by Colonial Lake on Broad Street in 1950.\nMeanwhile, the old building is offering one final gift to the community \u2014 possibly the gift of life for those caught in house fires."}
