Jessica De Samito is one of those pregnant women. A young veteran who suffers from PTSD and was on parole following a drug possession charge related to her self-medication, De Samito found herself using opiates earlier this year to manage her ongoing PTSD, but sought treatment when she discovered she was pregnant. She soon found a treatment program, and had been undergoing methadone maintenance treatment \u2014 which is medically recommended for opioid dependent pregnant women \u2014 since then.\n\nBut De Samito knew that she would test positive in a drug screening because she had used opiates before she was able to enroll in treatment, and she knew that might compromise her parole. As it turned out, she was right. This week, De Samito was re-incarcerated at the Guadalupe County Jail while a panel decides whether or not to revoke her parole as a result of the positive screen. She is currently 24 weeks pregnant, and was denied her methadone treatment for two days.\n\nThe decision to disrupt De Samito\u2019s methadone treatment was cruel, but it was also incredibly dangerous for her pregnancy. Withdrawal can cause uterine contractions, miscarriage and early labor, which is why consistency in treatment is so important. After two days of being denied medical care \u2014 as a result of her own advocacy and the help of a team from the National Advocates for Pregnant Women and a Texas-based human rights lawyer named Alicia Perez \u2014 she was given her appropriate dosage. But the issue is far from settled.\n\n\u201cShe had a hearing on Monday, and the parole panel has 41 days to issue their decision,\u201d Kylee Sunderlin from NAPW told Salon. \u201cThe decision could be to re-incarcerate her, send her to an intermediate sanction facility [a private prison] or release her with stricter supervision. They have 41 days to decide what they\u2019ll ultimately do.\u201d\n\nBut why detain De Samito at all? She is currently in county jail on a technical violation of her parole, not a legal violation. And prior to being put in jail, she was undergoing medically recommended and supervised treatment for opioid dependence. Detaining her \u2014 even for the 41 days the parole panel may take to decide on her case \u2014 serves no actual purpose. It\u2019s also dangerous. The jail has given no official indication that it intends to fully comply with De Samito\u2019s methadone treatment. \u201cThey certainly haven\u2019t made it clear that they are going to continue doing that for the duration of the 41 days,\u201d Sunderlin explained.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UPDATED: Jessica De Samito has been released to her home where she will remain under electronic supervision", "title": "Rick Perry\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d hypocrisy: How Texas puts pregnant women at risk", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "UPDATED: Jessica De Samito has been released to her home where she will remain under electronic supervision", "title": "Rick Perry\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d hypocrisy: How Texas puts pregnant women at risk", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/11/rick_perrys_pro_life_hypocrisy_how_texas_sticks_it_to_pregnant_women/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/rick_perry.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UPDATED: Jessica De Samito has been released to her home where she will remain under electronic supervision", "title": "Rick Perry\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d hypocrisy: How Texas puts pregnant women at risk", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/rick_perry.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Criminal Justice System, drug treatment, Editor's Picks, Incarceration, Medicaid, Methadone, Pregnancy, Prison, reproductive health, reproductive justice, Reproductive Rights, Rick Perry, Texas", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The decision to disrupt De Samito\u2019s methadone treatment was cruel, but it was also incredibly dangerous for her pregnancy.\n\u201cThey certainly haven\u2019t made it clear that they are going to continue doing that for the duration of the 41 days,\u201d Sunderlin explained.\nShe soon found a treatment program, and had been undergoing methadone maintenance treatment \u2014 which is medically recommended for opioid dependent pregnant women \u2014 since then.\nJessica De Samito is one of those pregnant women.\nDetaining her \u2014 even for the 41 days the parole panel may take to decide on her case \u2014 serves no actual purpose."}
