Ledecky\u2019s time of 15 minutes, 15.17 seconds was more than 9 seconds faster than the previous American record of 15:24.35 set by Katie Hoff in 2008.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting 15:15,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cI knew I was going pretty fast, but I couldn\u2019t really tell exactly how fast. I was pretty shocked.\u201d\n\nLedecky, a 16-year-old from Bethesda, Md., beat all her competitors Saturday by at least 39\u00bd seconds. She turned in that record performance two days after winning the 500 freestyle in 4:32.37.\n\nNot bad for someone who felt a little tuckered out at the start of the day.\n\n\u201cI woke up a little tired today, but I got a good nap in after prelims,\u201d said Ledecky, the 2012 Olympic gold medal winner in the 800-meter freestyle. \u201cI was feeling pretty good tonight.\u201d\n\nLedecky wasn\u2019t the only swimmer feeling good.\n\nNathan Adrian celebrated his 25th birthday Saturday by winning the 100 freestyle in 41.39 to edge Adam Brown (41.89) and fellow Olympic gold medalists Matt Grevers (41.99) and Darian Townsend (42.13). Adrian won the 50 freestyle Thursday.\n\nAs soon as Adrian finished, California\u2019s swimmers sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to the former Golden Bears star.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many things I feel that are more special than your teammates \u2014 although I\u2019m not on a college team anymore \u2014 singing \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 after you win a race,\u201d Adrian said. \u201cThat was really cool and special for me.\u201d\n\nMissy Franklin closed a productive meet by joining California teammates Rachael Acker, Elizabeth Pelton and Kaylin Bing on a women\u2019s 400 freestyle relay team that set a meet record (3:13.45). Franklin also finished second in the 200 backstroke (1:49.59) and third in the 100 freestyle (47.42) on Saturday. The four-time Olympic gold medalist won two individual events \u2014 the 200 freestyle and 100 backstroke \u2014 and was part of three first-place relay teams this week.\n\nFranklin now returns to campus, where the California freshman will take semester exams later this month.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier at Berkeley,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cIt\u2019s been absolutely incredible. I love practices. I love school. I love my new coaches, my team. It\u2019s been such a blast.\u201d\n\nPelton won the 200 backstroke in 1:49.59 to cap a meet in which she also had finished first in the 200 individual medley and had competed on the winning 400 medley relay team and 400 freestyle relay team. Natalie Coughlin won the 100 freestyle (47.19) two days after placing first in the 50 freestyle.\n\nConnor Jaeger won the men\u2019s 1,650 freestyle in 14:39.02 after finishing first in the 500 freestyle two days earlier. Alia Atkinson won the women\u2019s 200 breaststroke in 2:06.22 to follow up her victory Friday in the 100 breaststroke.\n\nThe final day of competition at the University of Tennessee\u2019s Allan Jones Aquatic Center also featured a first-place performance from Brad Craig, who swam collegiately at Tennessee and still trains in Knoxville. Craig won the men\u2019s 200 breaststroke in 1:52.99. Members of the Tennessee swim team cheered Craig on as he led from start to finish.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice change being kind of back in a team environment, having all them behind me,\u201d Craig said. \u201cI\u2019ve got some friends from out of town that came in. Just having kind of that home-pool advantage and everything, it\u2019s a great feeling.\u201d\n\nOther individual winners Saturday included Arkady Vyatchanin in the men\u2019s 200 backstroke (1:37.87), Kelsi Worrell in the women\u2019s 200 butterfly (1:54.12) and Dylan Bosch in the men\u2019s 200 butterfly (1:41.01). Tyler Messerschmidt, Ryan Murphy, Fabio Gimondi and Seth Stubblefield set a meet record in the men\u2019s 400 freestyle relay (2:51.16).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ledecky continued her banner year Saturday by shattering the American record in the 1,650-yard freestyle at the Winter National Championships.
