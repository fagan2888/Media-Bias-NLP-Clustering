Workers cite the top three reasons for stress as inadequate staffing, low pay and unclear job expectations.\n\nWhile employers recognize the difficulties caused by inadequate staffing, their other top two priorities are not the same as the employees\u2019 priorities. Instead, they\u2019re focused on work/life balance issues and on technology that expands employee availability during non-work hours.\n\nEmployers ranked low pay ninth among 10 drivers of workplace stress.\n\n\u201cEmployees seem to be saying, \u2018Support me, pay me, direct me,\u2019 but employers are focused on other stress factors,\u201d Towers Watson senior health care consultant Shelly Wolff said in a statement.\n\nRELATED: WHY A 72-HOUR WORK WEEK IS THE NEW NORMAL\n\nWorkplace stress can lead to increased employee illness, higher medical costs and lost productivity, but only about 40 percent of employers offer stress management services to employees. The survey found that workers looking for relief turn to leisure activities, social support and physical activities.\n\nA separate study by the Integrated Benefits Institute found that stress at work contributes to poor job performance more than stress at home or financial worries. Just 41 percent of workers who experience workplace stress are able to perform at an above-average level, compared to 68 percent of workers who don\u2019t experience workplace stress.\n\nThat study also found that healthier employees are less likely to experience work-related stress, with those in excellent health the least likely to be stressed out.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Worker stress is the number- one lifestyle risk issue for employers, ranking above obesity, smoking, and poor nutrition, according to a new report by Towers Watson.", "title": "Stress at Work: What Employees Know That Bosses Don't", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/13/Stress-Work-What-Employees-Know-Bosses-Dont", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04072010_Paperwork_pile_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/13/Stress-Work-What-Employees-Know-Bosses-Dont", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04072010_Paperwork_pile_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@bethbrav"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Worker stress is the number- one lifestyle risk issue for employers, ranking above obesity, smoking, and poor nutrition, according to a new report by Towers Watson.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d63\"", "article_summary": "Just 41 percent of workers who experience workplace stress are able to perform at an above-average level, compared to 68 percent of workers who don\u2019t experience workplace stress.\nA disconnect exists between what employees say causes stress and what employers believe causes it, according to the 2013/2014 Towers Watson Staying@Work Survey.\nA separate study by the Integrated Benefits Institute found that stress at work contributes to poor job performance more than stress at home or financial worries.\nWorker stress is the number-one lifestyle risk issue for employers \u2013 ranking above obesity, smoking and poor nutrition, according to a new report by Towers Watson.\nEmployers ranked low pay ninth among 10 drivers of workplace stress."}
