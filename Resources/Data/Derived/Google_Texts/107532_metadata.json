Now a new toy will allow you to take a peek at your lady parts with its built-in camera. YouTube/ Zoemmm.com\n\nWhen it comes to our lady parts, many women are too shy or don\u2019t care enough to take a look at what\u2019s going on below the belt. Well, a new toy has decided to combat this issue by combining pleasure with information. The U.S.-based adult sex toy company with factories in China and Thailand, Svakom, has invented a vibrator \u2014 the Gaga \u2014 with a built-in camera lens tip.\n\nThe Gaga is designed like almost any other vibrator. It\u2019s a thin, sleek design, and the silicone-based covering makes it waterproof. It also comes with a USB charger cable for your laptop, so you can plug it in, turn on the light, and see yourself up close and personal. The vibrator can also be controlled by another person using the wireless app.\n\nWhile the idea might seem strange \u2014 Why would you want a camera inspection when you\u2019re trying to self-please? \u2014 the outcome might be beneficial. Self-inspections are a great way for women to understand their bodies and notice positive and negative changes. It can help women learn what is normal for them individually. It can also help them to check for abnormal discharge or anything else that\u2019s not supposed to be there.\n\nSvakom has been making toys since 2006, and its main focus is on design, research, development, manufacturing, and sales of sex toys around the world. Each Gaga costs $180 each and comes in three different colors: khaki, black, and fire.\n\nThis is the first vibrator of its kind with a camera attached to the end of it. However, the vibrator has been around since the 19th century. Before it was a sex toy, it was used for \u201cmedical purposes\u201d as a way for women to cure their \u201chysteria.\u201d Doctors or midwives would stimulate a woman\u2019s clitoris using their hands along with some vegetable oil. The women would then experience an orgasm and be \u201ccured\u201d of their hysteria.\n\nThis technique, however, was painful for the doctors and midwives performing them \u2014 their hands would often cramp up and go numb. This is when physicians began experimenting with the idea of a mechanical way to stimulate a woman\u2019s clitoris in the doctor's office. In 1880, the first vibrator was born. It was invented by Dr. Joseph Mortimer Granville, who patented the electromechanical vibrator.\n\nCenturies later, business is booming. The sex toy industry rakes in over $15 billion annually. The Gaga might be the first of its kind, but it\u2019s certainly not the last.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sex toy, vibrator, orgasm, female sex toy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new sex toy will allow you to take a peek inside your lady parts with its built-in camera.", "title": "Dual-Use Vibrator Has A Camera Attached To See What's Going On", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vibrator-has-built-camera-help-women-see-whats-going-down-there-292100", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/vibrator-camera.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new sex toy will allow you to take a peek inside your lady parts with its built-in camera.", "title": "Dual-Use Vibrator Has A Camera Attached To See What's Going On", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vibrator-has-built-camera-help-women-see-whats-going-down-there-292100", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/vibrator-camera.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/vibrator-camera.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-07-09T11:49:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T12:07:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new sex toy will allow you to take a peek inside your lady parts with its built-in camera."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0db1\"", "article_summary": "YouTube/ Zoemmm.comWhen it comes to our lady parts, many women are too shy or don\u2019t care enough to take a look at what\u2019s going on below the belt.\nNow a new toy will allow you to take a peek at your lady parts with its built-in camera.\nThe U.S.-based adult sex toy company with factories in China and Thailand, Svakom, has invented a vibrator \u2014 the Gaga \u2014 with a built-in camera lens tip.\nSvakom has been making toys since 2006, and its main focus is on design, research, development, manufacturing, and sales of sex toys around the world.\nSex toys have been around since the late 1800s."}
