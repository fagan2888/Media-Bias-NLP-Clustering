Oshkosh won the competition to build the Humvee successor for the Army and Marine Corps last August, beating out defense industry giant Lockheed Martin and AM General for a contract that is expected to total $30 billion over its lifetime.\n\nWork froze for about 100 days when Lockheed protested the contract selection to the Government Accountability Office; the company also filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The court filing prompted GAO to chuck the challenge and allow Oshkosh to get its production line up and running while the lawsuit played out in court. Lockheed dropped its lawsuit last month.\n\nThe once vaunted Humvee lost some of its luster as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan dragged on and the services moved toward heavily armored mine resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles to better protect soldiers from roadside bombs. Military officials believe the lighter JLTV will help them regain some flexibility, and speed, on the battlefield.\n\nRelated: The Army\u2019s $30 Billion Humvee Replacement Program Goes Off Road\n\nThe Army wants to buy around 49,000 JLTV vehicles, with acquisition slated to wrap up in 2040.
