Aberdeen, SD

Authorities say a man who set fire to a three-story house in Aberdeen with five people inside in 2013 is not following the terms of his probation.



Twenty-one-year-old Isaiah Barse previously pleaded guilty to reckless burning. As part of his sentence, he was ordered to make more than $220,000 in restitution and complete 1,000 hours of community service.



Authorities say Barse has failed to make restitution payments and hasn't shown he's worked any service hours since August 2014. Barse requested a court-appointed attorney this week.



Barse's reckless burning charge stems from starting a bag of garbage on fire in a home following a fight involving his roommate in April 2013. The fire spread but Barse said he only meant to scare the residents.
