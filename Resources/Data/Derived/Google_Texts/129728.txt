Sioux Falls, SD

While many didn't like the snowfall that hit Sioux Falls last week, it helped one KELOLAND business. The snow paired with cold temperatures let Great Bear Recreation Park open its hill today.

Manager Dan Grider said today was the earliest Great Bear has opened since he started working for the park in 1992.

Grider says riders were lined up at 8:30 this morning ready to hit the hill. Skiers and snowboarders say the hill was in pretty good shape with just a few issues of slush and mud. It took a lot of effort to put together today's opening day, as Grider says his staff was just trained yesterday. Not all the hills are ready to be shredded yet, but with the colder temperatures on the horizon, Great Bear will be fully up and running soon.

“We'll have the tubing hills open here in another ten to 15 days. The bunny hill is open. We've got our terrain park open so it's a pretty good start for November 23,” Grider said.

The park will be open Monday and Tuesday from 3-10 p.m. and from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Wednesday and Friday.

We will hear from some skiers and snowboarders, including a nine-year-old girl that was the first one on the lift today, coming up tonight on KELOLAND Weekend News.
