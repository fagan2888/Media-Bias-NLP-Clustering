Federal officials have indicated some of the money might be cut off if state lawmakers do not expand the Texas Medicaid program to provide health insurance to more low-income Texans \u2014 a key provision of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s signature health law.\n\nIf the hospital reimbursement money were not renewed, \u201cI would call it an upheaval to our health care system,\u201d HHSC Chief Deputy Commissioner Chris Traylor told the House Appropriations Committee. \u201cIt has been, we believe, a significant benefit to health care delivery in the state.\u201d\n\nHouse lawmakers heard from HHSC and hospital representatives about the waiver\u2019s role in funding health care programs for poor Texans. One pool of money under the five-year waiver pays more than $3 billion per year for \u201cuncompensated care.\u201d HHSC officials said that money is used to shore up the \u201cMedicaid shortfall\u201d \u2014 the amount of hospital costs not covered by Medicaid reimbursement rates, which are low in Texas compared to other states \u2014 and to reimburse hospitals for the \u201ccharity care\u201d they provide in the emergency room to low-income people without insurance. That prompted some lawmakers to ask whether the state had a contingency plan if the feds choose not to renew the uncompensated care funding.\n\n\u201cThe potential interruption in federal sources of payment would make me extremely uncomfortable,\u201d said state Rep. John Zerwas, R-Richmond. \u201cYou see a whole lot of potential dark clouds circulating up there.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have a Plan B should this waiver not be renewed?\u201d asked state Rep. Armando Walle, D-Houston.\n\nTraylor said a non-renewal would force the commission to \u201cregroup\u201d and decide how to provide care. Among other things, the waiver transformed how the state provides Medicaid services, helping to facilitate the privatized \u201cmanaged care\u201d model across the state.\n\nThe Obama administration has encouraged Texas to expand its Medicaid program to cover adults living below 138 percent of the poverty line, saying that money would lessen the need for the waiver\u2019s uncompensated care pool because roughly a million more Texans could be covered by health insurance. But with less than a month remaining in the legislative session, Texas leaders have showed no inclination of doing so.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, who have criticized the Medicaid program as inefficient, announced early in the session that they would not expand Medicaid. Bills proposed by Democrats that would expand health insurance coverage to low-income Texans have languished in committee without being heard. In the Senate, Democrats attempted to work Medicaid expansion into an amendment on a different health care bill, but that move failed along party lines.\n\nHouse budget writers said Thursday that they needed to address the state\u2019s safety net while acknowledging the political opposition to \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no conversation on doing any kind of Medicaid expansion right now,\u201d said Zerwas, who last session offered an alternative plan to expand health coverage with federal Medicaid expansion money. That plan failed.\n\n\u201cI think it would be prudent on our part to prepare for the uncompensated care portion going away,\u201d said state Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Houston. \u201cWe knew it was not going to be up there forever.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Cecil Bell, R-Magnolia, suggested there could be \u201creason to be apprehensive\u201d about programs financed with federal money, because that money could be discontinued, leaving state budget writers on the hook. Conservatives have used a similar argument against Medicaid expansion, saying the rate of federal reimbursement could be reduced later.\n\nJohn Hawkins, the senior vice president of the Texas Hospital Association, told the committee that with the question of waiver renewal up in the air, the state\u2019s safety net was \u201cvery tenuous.\u201d Hawkins said Texas hospitals are already losing about $1.2 billion per year in federal cuts to Medicare under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 money the hospitals expected to recoup under a coverage expansion. Texas leads the nation in the rate of people without health insurance.\n\nHawkins said it was not the hospital association\u2019s preference that lawmakers continued to oppose Medicaid expansion. \u201cBut we can certainly see the political reality,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
