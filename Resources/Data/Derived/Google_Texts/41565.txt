NEW YORK (AP) — Hundreds of men, women and children including fashion designer Donna Karan marched across the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday demanding stricter gun laws and offering a litany of violent stories to show why such laws are needed.

Held on the eve of Mother’s Day, the third annual march from Brooklyn to Manhattan was organized by the group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.

“Progress is being made, one day at a time,” said Abbey Clements, a teacher from the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012.

Clements said about 40 percent of all gun sales are completed without a background check. She accused Congress of lacking the courage “to vote on their conscience instead of allowing themselves to be bullied by the gun lobby.”

But she noted that some states have tightened background check requirements. Connecticut already has strong gun laws, with relatively fewer gun deaths, she said.

The National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest gun rights lobbying group, opposes expanding background checks. The organization says many people sent to prison because of gun crimes get their guns through theft or the black market, and no amount of background checks can stop those criminals.

Legislation that sought to expand background checks to all commercial firearms sales failed to get a hearing in the U.S. House last session. With the GOP expanding its majority and winning control of the U.S. Senate, prospects for the bill may be even more unlikely this session.

Under the current system, cashiers at stores selling guns call in to check with the FBI or other designated agencies to ensure the customer doesn’t have a criminal background. Some lawmakers want to expand such checks to sales at gun shows and purchases made through the Internet.
