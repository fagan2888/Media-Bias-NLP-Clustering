(Bridge file photo)\n\nDebate over gay and abortion rights has been percolating in the Michigan Legislature and courts for years. Here are some key issues and legislation that have framed the debate:\n\nGay marriage ban: In November 2004, state voters approved a constitutional ban against same-sex marriage. The ban will remain in effect unless voters choose to undo the ban in the Constitution, or the ban is ruled unconstitutional. Federal judges have struck down gay-marriage bans in a number of states, and a federal judge is currently holding a trial in downtown Detroit on its constitutionality in a lawsuit brought by two female Oakland County nurses. Gay rights advocates say that they are prepared to move forward with a petition drive seeking to amend the Constitution in 2016 should the court not rule in their favor.\n\nDomestic partner benefits: Public Act 297 of 2011 prohibits most public employers (schools, cities, etc.) from offering domestic partner benefits to unmarried couples. Since gay and lesbian marriages are banned, the law effectively prevents an Michigan employee\u2019s same-sex partner from receiving health coverage as part of his or her benefits. The benefits law doesn\u2019t apply to universities because they are overseen by autonomous boards.\n\nLast June, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the law while a court challenge is heard. On Feb. 14, lawyers for Gov. Rick Snyder filed a motion asking the judge to uphold the benefits ban, which Snyder said eliminates irrational and unfair programs and is financially sound. No hearing date has been set.\n\nSame-sex couple adoption: Michigan\u2019s adoption law only allows for joint adoptions or second-parent adoptions (someone adopting a partner\u2019s child) by married couples. Gays can adopt individually, but their partner generally lacks legal standing as a parent. This can be an especially significant problem when the legal parent (biological or adoptive) dies or the couple separates, and the partner has no custody rights. Supporters of Michigan\u2019s current law say children are best served in homes with a father and mother.\n\nThe prohibition on gay adoption is also being challenged in the court case brought by the Oakland County nurses, who are in a longstanding relationship and individually adopted three special needs children (one child by one partner, two by the other). They sued for the right to adopt each other\u2019s children. On the judge\u2019s recommendation, the couple expanded the suit to challenge the constitutional ban on gay marriage. A trial on these issues is playing out this week in U.S. District Court in Detroit.\n\nEmployment and housing protection: Under Michigan law, individuals can be fired or denied housing because they are gay. That\u2019s because sexual orientation is not protected by the state\u2019s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, which currently bans discrimination on the basis of race, gender and other classifications.\n\nLegislation has been proposed (for instance by state Rep. Rebekah Warren, D-Ann Arbor in 2012) to bar discrimination based on sexual orientation, but supporters have so far been unable to prevail. Republican House Speaker Jase Bolger has said he would like to find a way to address the issue but is struggling to find the balance between the rights of the gay and lesbian communities and religious rights. The ACLU of Michigan has been working with Bolger as well as some state businesses to find a solution.\n\nIt is not yet clear what impact the recent controversy in Arizona will have on the debate in Michigan. Last week, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed legislation that would have given businesses the right to effectively refuse service to gays and others based on religious objections. The bill\u2019s demise was notable for the near-universal opposition to the legislation mounted by mainstream Republicans and the business community in Arizona, and through much of the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, about 30 Michigan cities and townships have approved local ordinances barring discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nAbortion insurance rider: The Michigan Legislature last year enacted legislation to bar insurance plans from covering most abortions, unless women or their employers buy a separate abortion rider. Women who did not separately purchase the rider wouldn\u2019t be covered even in cases of abortion and incest, which has caused some opponents to call it \u201crape insurance.\u201d Supporters of the new law say businesses and companies shouldn\u2019t have to pay for a procedure they oppose. Governor Rick Snyder vetoed the measure initially, but supporters were able to get around that by collecting signatures for a citizens\u2019 initiative, which isn\u2019t subject to a veto. Public Act 182 of 2013 takes effect March 14.\n\nAbortion regulations: House Bill 5711, the legislation that stirred the \u201cVaginagate\u201d controversy, would among other things require many abortion providers to operate in more costly freestanding surgical facilities and prohibit the dispensing of abortion medication (abortion pills) through telemedicine. Supporters say the measure includes necessary regulations to protect women against substandard medical practices and to prevent coercion. Opponents say it is all part of a strategy to limit abortion and drive abortion providers out of much of the state. After Snyder signed the bill into law, he called the decision one of the most difficult he has made since taking office.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Bridge Michigan", "description": "Debate over gay and abortion rights has been percolating in the Michigan Legislature and courts for years.
