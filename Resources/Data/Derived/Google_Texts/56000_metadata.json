Two more governors are about to formally enter the race: Louisiana\u2019s Bobby Jindal will announce his candidacy today, and New Jersey\u2019s Chris Christie is reportedly ready to join as early as next week. There will end up being as many as four current governors in the race (those two, plus Scott Walker and John Kasich), plus four former governors (Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, George Pataki).\n\nLet\u2019s put the former governors aside for the moment. There\u2019s something curious going on with the sitting governors: three of them are extremely unpopular at home, and the fourth may be the one who provides the explanation why.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the new entrants. Bobby Jindal has long been regarded as a future presidential candidate, but his current profile makes you wonder why he\u2019s bothering to run for president. It\u2019s not just that he\u2019s currently averaging 0.7 percent in presidential polls, putting him in 15th place. Jindal just got through a budget crisis with a ridiculous tax gimmick that made him an object of national ridicule, and nobody is arguing they need to emulate Louisiana\u2019s record of success. One recent poll put his approval in the state at 31 percent.\n\nChris Christie isn\u2019t doing any better. His approval is now at 30 percent, and it\u2019s pretty clear his tough-guy schtick wore thin a while ago, even in New Jersey (let alone in places like Iowa).\n\nThen there\u2019s Scott Walker, who\u2019s in the first tier of presidential candidates, but has the approval of only 41 percent of Wisconsinites. As the New York Times describes today, he\u2019s in a battle with Republicans in the state legislature:\n\nLeaders of Mr. Walker\u2019s party, which controls the Legislature, are balking at his demands for the state\u2019s budget. Critics say the governor\u2019s spending blueprint is aimed more at appealing to conservatives in early-voting states like Iowa than doing what is best for Wisconsin. Lawmakers are stymied over how to pay for road and bridge repairs without raising taxes or fees, which Mr. Walker has ruled out. The governor\u2019s fellow Republicans rejected his proposal to borrow $1.3 billion for the roadwork, arguing that adding to the state\u2019s debt is irresponsible.\n\nAnd therein lies part of the problem: appealing to the GOP primary electorate means, among other things, never raising taxes, even when refusing to do so initiates a budget crisis. It also means rejecting the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, which shoots your state in the foot for the purpose of ideological anti-Obama purity.\n\nIn many ways, Walker has governed from the outset like someone thinking about a presidential primary. He set out to destroy the state\u2019s public employee unions, and now wants to slash hundreds of millions of dollars from the University of Wisconsin budget, not to mention going after tenure (take that, elitists!), which would make it much harder to recruit quality faculty to the state\u2019s beloved university. Those kinds of moves guarantee that he\u2019ll always be a divisive governor, cheering members of his own party and alienating those in the opposing party.\n\nBut that\u2019s how you need to govern if you\u2019re going to be able to mount a presidential campaign that isn\u2019t consumed by explaining your heresies. Which brings us to Ohio governor John Kasich, who not only accepted the Medicaid expansion, he invoked a religious imperative to explain his decision to do so. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, lady,\u201d he told a GOP donor who criticized him for it, \u201cbut when I get to the pearly gates, I\u2019m going to have an answer for what I\u2019ve done for the poor.\u201d\n\nChris Christie accepted the Medicaid expansion too, but at least he can argue that he did so under pressure from a Democratic legislature. And he has attempted to make up for his sin of allowing 400,000 low-income people to get health insurance by proposing to cut Social Security. But Kasich could find himself explaining over and over that he\u2019s a real conservative despite his accommodation to the ACA.\n\nKasich might try this argument: If this was so terrible, how come I\u2019m the only governor in this race with approval ratings at home over 50 percent?\n\nThe problem is that GOP primary voters will probably reply, Who cares? As far as they\u2019re concerned, \u201csuccess\u201d isn\u2019t defined by whether your constituents are happy with the job you\u2019ve done. Practical achievements like improving the health of your state or even fostering strong job creation are all well and good, but they have to take a back seat to ideological achievements like crushing a labor union, fighting Obamacare, or resisting tax increases.\n\nGovernors who run for president are happy to tell you that being a governor is the best preparation for being president, and they have a point. While senators can get away with just making self-aggrandizing speeches without actually accomplishing anything (see Cruz, Ted), governors have no choice but to make similar kinds of decisions to the ones presidents make. They have to set priorities, formulate budgets, and work with a legislature, not to mention the fact that most governors eventually face some kind of crisis that tests their ability to act in trying circumstances. While senators can say \u201cI sponsored some nice bills,\u201d governors have lengthier records to run on.\n\nBut it may be no accident that most of the Republican governors currently running for president aren\u2019t popular at home. They\u2019re products of today\u2019s Republican Party, where unflagging commitment to conservative doctrine is what counts as success.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An unflagging commitment to conservative doctrine doesn't produce success.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "An unflagging commitment to conservative doctrine doesn't produce success.", "title": "The only way GOP governors can run for president is by shafting their own states", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/24/the-only-way-gop-governors-can-run-for-president-is-by-shafting-their-own-states/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/27/National-Politics/Images/2015-03-14T194538Z_01_DR010_RTRIDSP_3_USA-POLITICS-3647.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/06/24/the-only-way-gop-governors-can-run-for-president-is-by-shafting-their-own-states/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "scott walker, gop governors, 2016 presidential race, john kasich", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "scott walker, gop governors, 2016 presidential race, john kasich"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2dba\"", "article_summary": "Governors who run for president are happy to tell you that being a governor is the best preparation for being president, and they have a point.\nBut it may be no accident that most of the Republican governors currently running for president aren\u2019t popular at home.\nBobby Jindal has long been regarded as a future presidential candidate, but his current profile makes you wonder why he\u2019s bothering to run for president.\nGiven that there are currently 31 Republican governors, it\u2019s natural that more than a few of them would be both successful enough and ambitious enough to run for president.\nWhile senators can say \u201cI sponsored some nice bills,\u201d governors have lengthier records to run on."}
