The Clear Lake Emergency Medical Corp (CLEMC) serves the south end of Pasadena and the Tyler-based company East Texas Medical Center (ETMC) serves the area north of Underwood Street.\n\nBoth companies bill patients for ambulance services and both receive a subsidy from the city to help cover costs brought on by uninsured or underinsured patients who do not pay.\n\nUnder the new proposal, the city would part with CLEMC and have only one ambulance service.\n\nVice President of ETMC Ron Schwartz met with the council and outlined the new plan, which he said was needed to offset decreasing revenues caused by rising personnel costs and healthcare reforms.\n\n\u201cWe have been seeing an increase in call volume. We think that is due to healthcare reform because many people have lost their health insurance over the last couple of years,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a huge percentage of people drop to no insurance and then it makes it difficult to access healthcare.\n\n\u201cSo what they do is dial 911 to access healthcare. Many people have figured out, that if you dial 911, you are never refused service,\u201d he said.\n\nMonthly water bill fee proposed\n\nUnder the new proposal, residents would be billed $4 a month on their water bill as part of an EMS service subscription. In return, those with insurance would bear no out-of-pocket expenses and those without insurance would be given a 50 percent discount on the standard rate. Residents would be automatically enrolled in the program but would be able to opt out.\n\nOf the city\u2019s 50,674 water customers, ETMC officials anticipate revenues of roughly $1.8 million if approximately 74 percent of the city\u2019s 50,674 water customers participate in the program.\n\nUnder the proposed terms of the plan, the City of Pasadena would keep any revenues above $1.8 million, Schwartz said.\n\nIncreased costs due to competition for trained medical personnel was another reason ETMC officials proposed the water bill subscription plan.\n\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s a critical shortage of paramedics and EMTs in this area and a lot of it we believe is due to the workload and the schedule we operate with today,\u201d Schwartz told the council.\n\nETMC paramedics and EMTs currently work alternating 24-hour shifts. The new proposal would allow the company to move to rotating 12-hour shifts.\n\nSalaries and signing bonuses are another factor. ETMC offers paramedics a $7,500 signing bonus. However, a rival company recently began offering a $10,000 signing bonus, Schwartz said, making even more difficult to attract and retain trained workers.\n\n\u201cParamedics are leaving us and going to work for companies that pay four or five dollars more,\u201d he said.\n\nThe increased revenues from the water bill subscription proposal would allow the company to invest in equipment, increase salaries to be more competitive and be able to transition paramedics and EMTS away from 24 hour shifts to 12 hour rotating shifts. The salary for paramedics would go from approximately $13 an-hour to roughly $19 an-hour and EMT\u2019s salaries would increase from roughly $8 an-hour to $12 an-hour.\n\nCouncilmember Sammy Casados asked if the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, would increase the number of people with insurance.\n\n\u201cDo you foresee the people who don\u2019t have insurance having to purchase policies because of the fees?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what people believe, but to be honest with you we\u2019ve not experienced that yet because the penalties for not having it are pretty miniscule,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cBut that was the plan. President Obama was convinced everybody was going to have insurance. But, we\u2019ve not seen everybody get insurance. We\u2019ve seen people shift from commercial or third-party insurance to Medicaid in some cases and then some people lost their insurance. You would have thought that, and that\u2019s why the government went down this trail, they thought the cost of insurance would go down. That\u2019s how they sold it to everybody. But, it hasn\u2019t happened that way.\u201d\n\nThe council took no action on the proposed measure.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.yourpasadenanews.com", "description": "The Pasadena City Council gathered for a special meeting to consider a new ambulance program Tuesday (July 21).", "title": "Pasadena City Council considers new ambulance program", "url": "http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/pasadena/news/pasadena-city-council-considers-new-ambulance-program/article_f8c19741-4cf9-503c-8be3-e6a8a1625aa9.html", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/yourhoustonnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/e0/3e01937f-ab10-5797-a71d-84703cb2dcb8/55b25ffa05d7a.image.jpg?resize=800%2C602", "height": 602}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ScoopHouston", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The Pasadena City Council gathered for a special meeting to consider a new ambulance program Tuesday (July 21).", "msvalidate.01": "29516177700BA7C06DA5A4D58A12C04C", "fb": {"app_id": 191454774240451}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "lqzy3EyAvgVvWDlrVhCm69f7Q1GER22OmU5rYfmsBh8", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "The Pasadena City Council gathered for a special meeting to consider a new ambulance program Tuesday (July 21).\nMonthly water bill fee proposedUnder the new proposal, residents would be billed $4 a month on their water bill as part of an EMS service subscription.\nUnder the new proposal, the city would part with CLEMC and have only one ambulance service.\nUnder the proposed terms of the plan, the City of Pasadena would keep any revenues above $1.8 million, Schwartz said.\nIncreased costs due to competition for trained medical personnel was another reason ETMC officials proposed the water bill subscription plan."}
