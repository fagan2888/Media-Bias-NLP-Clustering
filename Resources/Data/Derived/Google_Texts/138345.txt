Santa Claus slimmed down this year, in response to health advice from his good friend, First Lady Michelle Obama. But the weight loss also resulted in the loss of his ho-ho-ho spirit.

On this week’s Saturday Night Live, actor Paul Rudd played the new and ‘improved’ Jolly Old St. Nick. After spending time at a spa and dropping 150 pounds — the ‘Let’s Move‘ initiative really worked for him — Santa returned to the North Pole to get the elves geared up for the upcoming holiday. But the little toymakers didn’t quite understand the changes in Mr. Claus and asked about what happened.

“You know what, I knew I needed to make better choices, and it paid off,” Santa told the elves. “And then my friend Michelle got me exercising, and viola! I’m talking about my good friend Michelle Obama.”

Mr. Claus then turned around to show off his new derrière.

“Hey, check out these glutes, huh?” he exclaimed. “You could crack a tooth on this bumper!”

The elves didn’t like Santa’s new look and behavior. But it didn’t stop there. Mrs. Claus was also given the boot, in favor of a Chili’s bartender named Candice. And the only toys the elves will be allowed to make are the Easy-Bake Juicer and Pilates Barbie.

Plus, one of the leanest meats is reindeer.

Looks like children around the world won’t have much to be merry and bright about this Christmas. And they can thank the First Lady for that.
