Friday on “The Alan Colmes Show,” Alan welcomed former Republican Vice Presidential Candidate and current Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan to the show to talk about his new book,The Way Forward: Renewing The American Idea.

Alan joked with the Congressman about him coming on a show with a liberal (Rep. Ryan laughed and said he was rethinking his appearance), then they covered a variety of topics including being chosen by Mitt Romney, Obamacare, and if Rep. Ryan plans on running in 2016:

COLMES: Were you shocked at such a young age to be asked to be on the national ticket? RYAN: Oh yeah, I didn’t think he was going to pick me…We never really planned on being picked because I’m the guy with all the budget cuts, right? Most consultants will tell you don’t pick that guy with all those specific policies.

******** RYAN: It’s a good thing that people who don’t have insurance get insurance. Let’s focus on that, but why disrupt the insurance people had and now lost as a result of Obamacare. That was unnecessary. By the way, why do you think they’re delaying the employer mandate? Because it makes good policy? No, they’re delaying it because it’s really unpopular because people are going to lose their employer based health insurance.

******* COLMES: This sounds like the kind of book you write just before you announce for President…I’d like to give you the opportunity now to make that announcement. RYAN: Hey! That’s so kind of you, so big of you Alan. COLMES: You got to be looking at 2016, right? RYAN: No, I am. I’m going to make that decision in 2015.
