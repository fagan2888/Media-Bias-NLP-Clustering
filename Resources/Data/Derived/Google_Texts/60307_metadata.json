He\u2019s one of the oldest linebackers on the Broncos.\n\n\u201cI am a veteran now,\u201d Miller said following Thursday\u2019s first training camp practice.\n\nWith age comes responsibility. Miller says he\u2019s learned from last season\u2019s mistakes \u2014 a six-game drug suspension, and added bulk following his return. His body provides proof before his words. Miller weighs in the mid 250-pound range, compared to 270 last December, the former a significant number for two reasons: it\u2019s closer to where he played as a havoc-causing rookie, and it\u2019s the same weight he carried when he left OTAs four weeks ago.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a coach telling me. I just knew I had to keep grinding and doing what I have doing with my workouts and my diet,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMiller participated in one-one-one drills and 11-on-11 work. He will be closely monitored, but seven months after the ACL in his right knee was repaired he remains on track.\n\n\u201cIt feels 100 percent. It\u2019s great. I don\u2019t think it could be in any better spot today,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI have been on a great game plan. I am just following the schedule. I am doing what they tell me to do.\u201d\n\nMiller said his preference is not to wear a brace but will if the protocol requires it. He remains anxious to team with rush end DeMarcus Ware, the player he idolized while growing up in Texas. Miller, like Ware, has ambitious goals this season.\n\n\u201cI want to be the best. That\u2019s my mission. I am aiming for it,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI am working hard for it.\u201d\n\nHIGHLIGHT: Cody Latimer on the mark\n\nCody Latimer showed no issues with the broken left foot that limited him during OTAs. The rookie receiver caught a long touchdown pass from backup quarterback Brock Osweiler. The play-action pass fooled the safety and Latimer beat first-round pick Bradley Roby down the middle in the broken coverage. \u201cThe coaches called a great play,\u201d said Latimer, who ran a 4.45 at the NFL combine with the foot injury and led all receivers with 23 reps on the 225-pound bench press. The Broncos considered him the best blocking receiver in the draft.\n\nLOWLIGHT: Rough play on offense\n\nIf the Broncos were any more serious about ball security, the practice pigskins would be kept in an armored car. They repeated the message Thursday, but perfection remained elusive. Osweiler threw an interception to cornerback Louis Young, a deflected pass tight end Jacob Tamme couldn\u2019t corral. And receiver Greg Wilson fumbled on an underneath route, which was recovered by defensive back Omar Bolden.\n\nPOSITION BATTLE: Right tackle\n\nIn an attempt to get their five best linemen on the field following Ryan Clady\u2019s return from injury, the Broncos switched Orlando Franklin to left guard, creating competition at the right tackle spot. Chris Clark, who filled in for Clady last year, started Thursday and remained with the first-team during drill work. During OTAs, Winston Justice received starting reps, so his participation bears watching Friday in relation to the depth-chart discussion.\n\nHarris could be cleared Monday\n\nOn Aug. 6, cornerback Chris Harris will be six months removed from surgery to repair the ACL in his left knee. \u201cThat\u2019s the golden date,\u201d he said. Harris has made encouraging progress and will visit Dr. James Andrews on Monday. \u201cI am hopeful that Andrews will clear me. But I should be ready to go on the six-month mark and start doing what Von\u2019s doing. I am pretty much doing the individuals they are already doing.\u201d\n\nFootnotes\n\nThe Broncos opened their team stretch to music Thursday, a nice touch since Dove Valley is eerily quiet with no fans permitted because of the $35-million renovation. The Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cStart Me Up\u201d was followed by U2\u2019s \u201cWhere the Streets Have No Name.\u201d \u2026 Cornerback Kayvon Webster, getting first team reps with Harris out, made multiple solid plays in coverage. \u2026 Bubba Caldwell started in place of Demaryius Thomas, who will miss the first four days of camp following the death of his grandmother in Georgia. \u201cDemaryius let me know last night he wouldn\u2019t be here. It\u2019s just an opportunity for me to be out there with Peyton (Manning) and the first team and prove my worth.\u201d \u2026 Defensive back Louis Young intercepted a high pass from Osweiler that Jacob Tamme couldn\u2019t pull down. \u2026 Wes Welker was clinical in his efficiency during drill work, toasting young cornerbacks.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brock Osweiler,Chris Harris,Cody Latimer,Louis Young,Training Camp,Von Miller,Wesley Woodyard", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "On Day 1 of training camp at Dove Valley, Von Miller said he feels \"100 percent\" after participating in one-one-one drills and 11-on-11 work.", "title": "Von Miller says he's \"on a mission to be the best\" on first day of Broncos training camp", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/07/24/dove-valley-days-von-miller-says-mission-best-notes-chris-harris-cody-latimer/28383/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/07/von1.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "On Day 1 of training camp at Dove Valley, Von Miller said he feels \"100 percent\" after participating in one-one-one drills and 11-on-11 work.", "title": "Dove Valley Days: Von Miller \u201con a mission to be the best,\u201d plus more on Chris Harris and Cody Latimer", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/07/24/dove-valley-days-von-miller-says-mission-best-notes-chris-harris-cody-latimer/28383/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/07/von1.jpg", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "On Day 1 of training camp at Dove Valley, Von Miller said he feels \"100 percent\" after participating in one-one-one drills and 11-on-11 work."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2143\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI am a veteran now,\u201d Miller said following Thursday\u2019s first training camp practice.\nMiller says he\u2019s learned from last season\u2019s mistakes \u2014 a six-game drug suspension, and added bulk following his return.\nI just knew I had to keep grinding and doing what I have doing with my workouts and my diet,\u201d Miller said.\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this videoDuring a recent conversation with good friend and former teammate Wesley Woodyard, the reality struck Von Miller.\nBut I should be ready to go on the six-month mark and start doing what Von\u2019s doing."}
