Mike Lee (R-UT), who used the opportunity to tell the conservative activists in the CPAC audience that Republican politics too often becomes an embarrassing parade of sideshow clowns and that they are part of the problem.\n\nOkay, he didn\u2019t put it that starkly, but that was more or less the message he delivered to the conservative faithful as he called for the GOP to support and elect \u201cprincipled, positive, and proven\u201d conservative candidates, and not to reward candidates whose sole talents are stimulating the reptilian sectors of the conservative brain with empty slogans and buzzwords:\n\nLEE: We have a job to do, and that job is not just to find the guy who can shout \u201cfreedom\u201d the loudest. \u2026 If that that\u2019s what conservatives reward, and that\u2019s all they reward in the next year and over the next two days here at CPAC, if that\u2019s what they reward with cheers and standing ovations and straw poll votes, then that\u2019s all that we, as conservatives, will ever get. Talking points, and platitudes, and empty promises. But when conservatives elevate unserious presidential candidates \u2013 candidates who are not principled, positive, and proven \u2013 it\u2019s not the media\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not the establishment\u2019s fault. It\u2019s our fault, and we can\u2019t let that happen.\n\nLee also had a challenge for the crowd: \u201cImagine for a moment the impression this audience could leave a candidate if each of you refused to give a standing ovation to every trite one-liner, every empty platitude, or every hollow political slogan that you hear over the next day and a half \u2013 and yeah, you will hear some of those.\u201d\n\nIt was a bold message, a clarion call for seriousness in political discourse and a sober approach to elections and policymaking, and it was rewarded with a smattering of perfunctory applause from the people on hand to hear it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mike Lee challenges CPAC to stop rewarding \"unserious\" candidates -- but that's what CPAC is all about", "title": "Mike Lee at CPAC: CPAC is dumb, stop being dumb", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Mike Lee challenges CPAC to stop rewarding \"unserious\" candidates -- but that's what CPAC is all about", "title": "Mike Lee at CPAC: CPAC is dumb, stop being dumb", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/26/mike_lee_at_cpac_cpac_is_dumb_stop_being_dumb/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/mike_lee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mike Lee challenges CPAC to stop rewarding \"unserious\" candidates -- but that's what CPAC is all about", "title": "Mike Lee at CPAC: CPAC is dumb, stop being dumb", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/mike_lee.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ben Carson, Bobby Jindal, conservative political action conference, Conservatives, CPAC, CPAC 2015, Mike Lee, Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5a1\"", "article_summary": "But when conservatives elevate unserious presidential candidates \u2013 candidates who are not principled, positive, and proven \u2013 it\u2019s not the media\u2019s fault.\nTopics: Ben Carson, Bobby Jindal, conservative political action conference, Conservatives, CPAC, CPAC 2015, Mike Lee, Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz, Politics NewsThe annual Conservative Political Action Conference kicked off this morning with a refreshing and necessary speech from Sen.
