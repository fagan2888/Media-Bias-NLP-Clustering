Barbara Mikulski wanted to do was to wear a pair of slacks on the Senate floor.\n\nThe problem for the Maryland Democrat \u2014 one of just two women in the Senate when she joined the chamber in the late 1980s \u2014 was that her simple request was unheard of in the traditionally male-dominated chamber. So Mikulski took on the antiquated dress code in the same manner she\u2019s done with a litany of legislative battles: She fought it until she won.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMikulski took her demand to then-Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) and the Senate parliamentarian, who looked through the rules of the floor to see if pants for women would be allowed.\n\n\u201cSo I walk on that day and you would have thought I was walking on the moon,\u201d Mikulski recalled during a 2010 interview with CNN. \u201cIt caused a big stir.\u201d\n\nThe simple way Mikulski got what she wanted as a newly minted senator is a testament to her no-nonsense, direct style that has carried her through nearly four decades on Capitol Hill. Mikulski, who announced Monday she will not run for reelection in 2016, shattered several barriers in the male-dominated bastions of Capitol Hill: She is the longest-serving woman ever in Congress, the first female Democrat to have served in both chambers, and the first woman who didn\u2019t succeed a husband or a father.\n\nBut Mikulski, long dubbed the dean of Senate women, has been more than a record-setter for the congressional history books. Female senators have long looked up to the 4-foot-11-inch senator as a mentor \u2014 one who distributed guidebooks on \u201cGetting Started in the Senate\u201d and a leader who fostered goodwill and cooperation among the small, yet growing, circle of women who serve in the chamber.\n\nThere were precious few role models, confidantes or mentors for women entering the Senate back then.\n\n\u201cThere were precious few role models, confidantes or mentors for women entering the Senate back then, so Sen. Mikulski played all three of those roles for so many of us,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who was elected in the so-called Year of the Woman in 1992. \u201cIn the two decades we have served together, she has always added to her list of roles, always made time for us, and always put the special bond we women senators share high on her priority list.\u201d\n\nWhen the Baltimore native first arrived in the Senate in 1987, the only other female senator was the since-retired Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas. Now, there are 20 female senators and more than 100 women in Congress.\n\nMikulski\u2019s seniority in the Senate also secured her the chairmanship of the powerful Appropriations Committee in 2012. She locked in government spending deals with her House counterpart, Hal Rogers \u2014 the genteel, soft-spoken conservative from Kentucky \u2014 at a time of stubborn congressional gridlock.\n\nPHOTOS: Barbara Mikulski career highlights\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a fighter,\u201d Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said in a phone interview Monday, adding that he was caught off-guard by Mikulski\u2019s decision when the two spoke Sunday. \u201cAnd she will take on any interest for working families. She\u2019s known as a strong spokesperson for blue-collar workers.\u201d\n\nThose fighter roots stem from her childhood in working-class Baltimore, where the daughter of Polish grocers and former social worker got her first taste of community activism when she helped halt construction of a 16-lane highway through the city\u2019s Fell\u2019s Point neighborhood.\n\nShe was first elected to the House in 1976 and promoted to the Senate a decade later. In March 2012, she became the longest-serving woman in Congress, surpassing Rep. Edith Nourse Rogers (R-Mass.), who served from 1925 to 1960. Along the way, Mikulski, now 78, became a champion of issues surrounding health care, education and pay equity.\n\nCardin recalled one Senate Democratic Caucus meeting during the early stages of the Obamacare debate, when a frustrated Mikulski stood up and declared that the original draft was insufficient when it came to women. She would later add language to the law focused on preventive health care services for women.\n\n\u201cIt changed the whole direction of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Cardin said, adding: \u201cShe started by stopping a highway and she\u2019s been building bridges ever since to get things done.\u201d\n\nMikulski\u2019s blunt personality was on display even as she began the final chapter of her Senate career on Monday. At a news conference announcing her retirement, she said one question ran through her head as she mulled running for reelection in 2016: \u201cDo I spend my time raising money? Or do I spend my time raising hell?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be around,\u201d Mikulski said. \u201cI\u2019m Senator Barb.\u201d\n\nNicknamed BAM among her staffers (her middle name is Ann), Mikulski is known around the Capitol for her brusque demeanor. She\u2019s repeatedly ranked among the \u201cmeanest\u201d senators in perennial surveys of Hill staffers by Washingtonian magazine. Her gruff style is also apparent to reporters who crowd around her in the Senate hallways to ask questions.\n\nBut she softens around the elevator operators, police officers and doorkeepers who keep the Capitol running, one former aide recalled Monday. Those staffers would often approach Mikulski telling her that they lived in Maryland \u2014 engaging in chitchat about home or asking the senator for constituent service help.\n\nShe showed off her negotiating acumen with two omnibus government spending bills she crafted with Hal Rogers during her two years as chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee. With the latest deal in December, Mikulski had to fend off criticism from fellow Democrats who were irate over a pro-Wall Street provision in the spending bill that rolled back a key provision of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.\n\nMikulski defended the bill as a product of compromise, arguing that while much of the attention was focused on the one rider that made its way in \u2014 which many Democrats said would undo protections in Dodd-Frank intended to prevent crises like the 2008 crash \u2014 half a dozen \u201cirresponsible\u201d Wall Street provisions were stripped out.\n\nBut she\u2019s most known for her influential role among female legislators. And through her nearly 40 years in Congress, Mikulski has built close ties to women of both parties.\n\nShe leads gatherings of Senate women for dinner roughly every other month, where the conversations revolve around family and other personal happenings in the female senators\u2019 lives. (Mikulski likes to serve crab cakes when she hosts, and she has posted a recipe on her website.)\n\nShe is also known for telling female colleagues to go \u201cearring to earring\u201d and to \u201cput on our lipstick, square our shoulders, suit up and fight!\u201d during legislative and political battles.\n\n\u201cEvery woman in the Senate has stories of Sen. Mikulski reaching out to us, mentoring us and helping us along the way,\u201d said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who has said that the second person she consulted on a Senate run, after her husband, was Mikulski. \u201cThe Senate used to be a lonely place for women, but Sen. Mikulski changed that.\u201d\n\nMikulski shares Baltimore roots with another powerful woman on Capitol Hill \u2014 Nancy Pelosi, the top House Democrat representing California who was the first female speaker of the House. Both women were products of the Institute of Notre Dame \u2014 a Catholic, all-girls high school.\n\nMikulski\u2019s legacy, the House Democratic leader said, \u201cwill stand as an enduring inspiration to all of America\u2019s daughters.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the state represented by former Rep.
