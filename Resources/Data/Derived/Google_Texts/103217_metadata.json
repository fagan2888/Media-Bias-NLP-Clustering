It is disgraceful.'\n\n\n\n'Poundland is one of the biggest shops in England - it is disgraceful'\n\n- Unnamed worker\n\n\n\nThe TUC's Ro b Johnston said the bonus was indicative of a wider problem in the economy.\n\n'While the Government is talking about recovery, working people aren't seeing the benefits,' he said.\n\n\n\n'In the run-up to Christmas, the least you can expect is for companies to reward staff and stop being miserly.\n\n'This is not an isolated case and is indicative of a broader problem of the economy turning a corner, but workers not getting the benefit.'\n\nHowever, a Poundland spokesman defended the bonus - claiming it would help make the festive season 'even more affordable'.\n\n\n\nHe said: 'To recognise the hard work and dedication of over 12,000 colleagues throughout the year and particularly during our busy festive period, Poundland is pleased to confirm that it has introduced a 10 per cent discount for employees across the business, to help make Christmas even more affordable.'\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Workers,Poundland,slam,miserly,Christmas,bonus,10,cent,discount", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2527456/Workers-Poundland-slam-miserly-Christmas-bonus-10-cent-discount.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "The offer - dubbed 'miserly' by union barons - gives staff members just 10p off each item at the bargain chain.", "title": "Workers at Poundland get a 'miserly' 10% discount as their Christmas bonus ...  but they can't use it on chocolate or fizzy drinks", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2527456/Workers-Poundland-slam-miserly-Christmas-bonus-10-cent-discount.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/21/article-0-0D446B7A00000578-833_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2527456, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Workers,Poundland,slam,miserly,Christmas,bonus,10,cent,discount", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2013-12-21T09:57:27.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Sophie+Jane+Evans", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-12-21T12:11:18.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Workers Poundland slam miserly Christmas bonus 10 cent discount"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "The offer - dubbed 'miserly' by union barons - gives staff members just 10p off each item at the bargain chain.", "title": "Workers at Poundland get a 'miserly' 10% discount as their Christmas bonus ...  but they can't use it on chocolate or fizzy drinks", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2527456/Workers-Poundland-slam-miserly-Christmas-bonus-10-cent-discount.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/21/article-0-0D446B7A00000578-833_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "The offer - dubbed 'miserly' by union barons - gives staff members just 10p off each item at the bargain chain."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c5d\"", "article_summary": "'Miserly' offer: Workers at Poundland have slammed their Christmas bonus of a 10 per cent store discountIn contrast, staff at other major retailers, such as BHS and Marks & Spencer, are granted a 20 per cent discount throughout the year.\nIssue: Rob Johnston, of the TUC (pictured), said the bonus was indicative of a wider problem in the economyMore than 12,000 Poundland workers were informed about their Christmas bonus by letter.\nWorkers at Poundland get a 'miserly' 10% discount as their Christmas bonus ... but they can't use it on chocolate or fizzy drinksChristmas offer gives Poundland workers just 10p off each itemBut it excludes festive treats such as fizzy drinks and chocolateBargain chain has just opened its 500th store with record salesWorkers at Poundland have slammed their Christmas bonus as 'miserly' after bosses offered them a 10 per cent store discount.\nHowever, a Poundland spokesman defended the bonus - claiming it would help make the festive season 'even more affordable'.\n'In the run-up to Christmas, the least you can expect is for companies to reward staff and stop being miserly."}
