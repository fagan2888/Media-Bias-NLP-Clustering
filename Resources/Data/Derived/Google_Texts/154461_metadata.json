The \u201cglue\u201d works by \u201cremaining near the damaged tissue longer than it normally would.\u201d\n\nResearchers led by Mika\u00ebl Martino and his team at the \u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland focused on what are known as growth factors, proteins that naturally assist in the body\u2019s healing process, and how they bind to extracellular matrix, or the substance that surrounds human cells. Growth factors are used in various ways, from helping a baby develop in the womb, to healing skin cuts and broken bones. Essentially, growth factors are one of the body\u2019s healing tools.\n\nThe researchers managed to engineer a particular growth factor to stick to the extracellular matrix by a set of chemical \u201chooks,\u201d in the hopes of creating a stronger, more effective growth factor that could help heal wounds faster than before. They then tested this growth factor on mutant mice carrying a genetic defect that prevented their wounds from healing quickly.\n\nThe researchers wounded the mice then \u201cpainted\u201d the growth factor onto their injuries. With the growth factor sticking in place, other cells began fixing the injury, which helped it to heal faster. This type of healing tool, which stimulates blood vessel growth, would be most helpful for people with chronic wounds that don\u2019t heal very easily, such as people with diabetes or compromised immune systems. Burn victims may also be aided by this new development, particularly for third-degree burns, which are difficult to treat because the cells that would normally release growth factors have been burned off.\n\nMartino and his team were able to develop the growth factor\u2019s ability to be applied in very small doses, up to 250 times smaller than growth factors used before. This is important because applying too much of growth factors to a wound could actually be harmful. \u201cYou get bone formation where you don\u2019t want it,\u201d Jeffrey Hubbell, professor of bioengineering at EPFL and co-author of the study, told LiveScience. If the doses of growth factor are too large, they could cause bruises.\n\nThere is still a long way to go before these growth factors will be able to be used clinically; currently there are only two other growth factors used in treatment.\n\nSource: Martino M, Briquez P, Guc E, et al.
