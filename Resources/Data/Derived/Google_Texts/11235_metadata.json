Indeed: unless Congress comes to a compromise, the government will shut down on Friday.\n\nThis will be Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s very first shutdown fight as House Speaker\u2014everyone, send him flowers to congratulate him!\u2014and according to CNN, the former budget hawk plans on making the entire messy process less \u201cdrama\u201d-filled than it has been in years past: in a closed-door meeting, he reportedly told the House Republicans that he would attempt to make this budget fight, poorly timed for the end of the year, less of a \u201ccrap sandwich\u201d than it normally is. (This involves handing over several of the negotiations to his committee chairs, reconciling Senate and House riders, and basically crossing his fingers, hoping that he\u2019ll get a somewhat reasonable bill to pass on to the president by Friday.)\n\nThough people initially believed that the fight would be over defunding Planned Parenthood and repealing Obamacare\u2014two things that would never happen as long as Barack Obama is around to veto those bills\u2014the 2016 budget fight\u2019s immediate focus will be on national security and managing the Syrian refugee crisis: several House conservatives want to dismantle Obama\u2019s program to resettle 10,000 refugees to America.\n\nWhile normal budget fights already have high stakes, this time, Congress cannot prolong it as much as they have in previous battles: the legislature officially goes on holiday starting December 18, giving them only one chance to extend funding past Friday, and no matter how passionate each side is about getting their special projects funded or defunded, no one wants to miss the holidays. No one. So basically, whoever continues to keep the government defunded will be shunned for their lack of holiday spirit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Ryan\u2019s looking to avoid adding one more \u201ccrap sandwich\u201d to an already growing pile of political crap sandwiches.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9Net 2016", "author": "Tina Nguyen", "og": {"site_name": "Vanity Fair", "description": "Paul Ryan\u2019s looking to avoid adding one more \u201ccrap sandwich\u201d to an already growing pile of political crap sandwiches.", "title": "Don\u2019t Forget, There\u2019s Another Government Shutdown Scheduled for Friday", "url": "http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/12/government-shutdown-congress-fight", "image": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/566598a4ff2f5268396f0d86/4:3/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/government-shutdown-potential-paul-ryan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.vanityfair.com", "description": "Paul Ryan\u2019s looking to avoid adding one more \u201ccrap sandwich\u201d to an already growing pile of political crap sandwiches.", "title": "Don\u2019t Forget, There\u2019s Another Government Shutdown Scheduled for Friday", "image": {"src": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/566598a4ff2f5268396f0d86/master/pass/government-shutdown-potential-paul-ryan.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 7802537, "app_id": 1591153417872059, "pages": 8810407571}, "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "budget cuts,congress,paul ryan", "pubdate": "2015-12-07T09:36:00Z", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "So basically, whoever continues to keep the government defunded will be shunned for their lack of holiday spirit.\nAmid all the talk about terrorism, mass shootings, a second war in Iraq, religious extremists, abortion, refugees, Chinese competition, income inequality, police brutality, and climate change, it\u2019s easy to forget that America faces yet another government shutdown.\nIndeed: unless Congress comes to a compromise, the government will shut down on Friday.\n(This involves handing over several of the negotiations to his committee chairs, reconciling Senate and House riders, and basically crossing his fingers, hoping that he\u2019ll get a somewhat reasonable bill to pass on to the president by Friday.)\nThough people initially believed that the fight would be over defunding Planned Parenthood and repealing Obamacare\u2014two things that would never happen as long as Barack Obama is around to veto those bills\u2014the 2016 budget fight\u2019s immediate focus will be on national security and managing the Syrian refugee crisis: several House conservatives want to dismantle Obama\u2019s program to resettle 10,000 refugees to America."}
