It is fitting that we take one day of the year, April 2, 2016, to shine a light on this growing neurological disorder across the State of Tennessee. This year, for the first time ever, the Tennessee State Capitol, will join hundreds of other iconic landmarks, in \u201cLight It Up Blue\u201d in honor of World Autism Day. I am grateful to Gov. Haslam, Sec. of State Hargett and the Capitol Building Commission for approving for the State Capitol to \u201cLight it Up\u201d Blue on April 2.\u201d\n\n- Rep. Kevin D. Brooks, R-Cleveland, Assistant Majority Leader, Tennessee House of Representatives\n\nAlmost every day I hear from or about families whose child has been singled out for bullying by their fellow students or is being \u201cpicked on\u201d by their teacher or other people in authority because of their disability.\n\nAs Executive Director of Autism Tennessee, I expect people to see beyond the autism diagnosis and embrace the child, not to have preconceived notions of what our child is like or capable of based strictly on a label.\n\nWe need to continue to raise awareness and educate our community that autism, the fastest growing developmental disability in the United States, represents just a part of the individual with that diagnosis.\n\nAt Autism Tennessee we often like to say, \u201cIf you\u2019ve met one child with autism\u2026you\u2019ve met one child with autism.\u201d They are all unique individuals whose differences help add to their classrooms, their workplaces, and our state\u2019s diversity.\n\nAutism Tennessee is a non-profit organization working to enrich the lives and experiences of individuals on the autism spectrum, their families and surrounding community through support, advocacy and education.\n\nThe Joint House Resolution commemorating World Autism Awareness Day in Tennessee and the efforts to light the State Capitol Building blue Saturday night make us feel that our community embraces us, accepts our differences and values individuals with autism as an important part of Tennessee.\n\nBabs Tierno is executive director of Autism Tennessee, and parent of child on the autism spectrum.
