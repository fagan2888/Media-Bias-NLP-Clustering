And, if an unequal distribution of income hinders growth, which solutions could do more harm than good, and which could make the economic pie bigger for all?\u201d\n\nRelated: Why the Bond Market Is Poised for a Plunge\n\nThe answer to the first question, they find, is an unequivocal yes. \u201cOur review of the data, as well as a wealth of research on this matter, leads us to conclude that the current level of income inequality in the U.S. is dampening GDP growth, at a time when the world's biggest economy is struggling to recover from the Great Recession and the government is in need of funds to support an aging population,\u201d they write.\n\nThe answer to the second question is more complicated, but it involves increasing both the taxes paid by the wealthy and an increase in government spending.\n\nThe report does not call for confiscatory taxation of the rich, but the elimination of tax breaks that benefit them disproportionately as well as \u201csome degree of rebalancing,\u201d which appears to be code for higher rates on the wealthy. One possibility raised in an International monetary Fund report cited by the authors, is increasing the \u201cinheritance tax\u201d rate and decreasing taxes on earned income.\n\nRelated: Market \u2018Black Swan\u2019 Fear at Record High\n\nIn addition to changes to the tax code, S&P finds that \u201cspending in the areas of education, health care, and infrastructure\u2026could help bring under control an income gap that, at its current level, threatens the stability of an economy still struggling to recover. This could take the form of reallocating fiscal resources toward those with a greater propensity to spend, or toward badly needed public resources like roads, ports, and transit. \u201c\n\nThe authors of the report go to great pains to sound apolitical \u2013 noting, for instance, that it is not necessary to eliminate inequality altogether.\n\n\u201cA degree of inequality is to be expected in any market economy,\u201d they write. \u201cIt can keep the economy functioning effectively, incentivizing investment and expansion--but too much inequality can undermine growth.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Next Financial Crisis Is Brewing Right Now, and Regulators Are Missing It\n\nHowever, it is hard to read the report as anything other than an implicit endorsement of the Obama administration\u2019s position on the need to reduce inequality.\n\nThe report\u2019s policy recommendations, while hinted at rather than expressly stated, are hardly something conservative Republicans are likely to welcome. Increasing taxes on the wealthy as a means of redistributing income is routinely referred to as \u201cclass warfare\u201d within the GOP \u2013 and the levy delicately referred to as the \u201cinheritance tax\u201d by the authors, is more popularly known, in conservative circles at least, as the \u201cdeath tax.\u201d\n\nWhether the S&P findings will have substantial impact on the public debate about income inequality remains to be seen, but the company\u2019s stock-in-trade is sober, reliable analysis and predictions. So, if this is what its experts are worried about, it seems likely that the same concern is on the minds of other mainstream economists.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Bond rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s on Monday took a stand on the politically loaded question of income inequality, declaring that the U.S. is approaching an extreme level of inequality that could harm long-term economic growth.", "title": "S&P: Income Inequality Threatens Long-Term Economic Growth", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/05/SP-Income-Inequality-Threatens-Long-Term-Economic-Growth", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03102014_Income_Inequality.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/05/SP-Income-Inequality-Threatens-Long-Term-Economic-Growth", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03102014_Income_Inequality.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Bond rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s on Monday took a stand on the politically loaded question of income inequality, declaring that the U.S. is approaching an extreme level of inequality that could harm long-term economic growth.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cA degree of inequality is to be expected in any market economy,\u201d they write.\n\u201cDespite the tendency to speak about this issue in moral terms, the central questions are economic ones: Would the U.S. economy be better off with a narrower income gap?\nOne possibility raised in an International monetary Fund report cited by the authors, is increasing the \u201cinheritance tax\u201d rate and decreasing taxes on earned income.\n\u201cThe authors of the report go to great pains to sound apolitical \u2013 noting, for instance, that it is not necessary to eliminate inequality altogether.\nEconomists at the bond rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s think the question needs to be reframed."}
