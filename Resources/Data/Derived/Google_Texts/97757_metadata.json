Javits Convention Center over the years \u2014 it\u2019s too small, too outdated, too gloomy \u2014 it never reported a bat invasion until its ambitious eco-friendly renovation was completed. The center now features a 6.75-acre living green roof, bird protective glass and a new population of insects that bats can\u2019t resist. Five species of bats have unexpectedly been attracted to this new urban habitat on the West Side along with a flurry of bird species like foraging American kestrels, according to delighted watchers at the New York City Audubon Society.\n\nThe center was once among the deadliest city buildings for migrating birds; fatalities are now down an estimated 90 percent among flocks that used to collide with the old reflective glass but now can better sense the new pixelated glass exterior. And for all the calls for demolition, the center has never seemed more lively, as conventioneers come and go below in sunlight freed through expansive new skylights and glass walls.\n\nThe enormous rooftop carpet of succulent, thirsty sedum plants \u2014 enough to cover more than five football fields \u2014 was designed to soak up millions of gallons of rainwater annually and better insulate the center in winter and summer. Energy consumption should be cut an estimated 25 percent by the green roof and energy-efficient glass designs of FXFowle Architects and Epstein Global. The sedum, a desert transplant, reduces damaging runoff to the city\u2019s overtaxed sewer system and cuts greenhouse gases.\n\nThree years ago, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signaled doom for the Javits Center with a plan to replace it with something much bigger in Queens, even as a previously begun renovation went forward. The result is a center that, whatever its limitations, is notably rich in eco-friendly innovations that deserve emulation as the city builds and rebuilds itself into the future.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150107204023, "twitter": {"description": "The living green roof and new populations of insects, birds and bats are testament to the success of the eco-friendly renovation.", "title": "More Life at the Javits Center", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/opinion/more-life-at-the-javits-center.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003436466"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/opinion/more-life-at-the-javits-center.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003436466", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/opinion/more-life-at-the-javits-center.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "More Life at the Javits Center", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 7, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "FXFowle Architects", "keywords": "Editorials,Architecture,Javits  Jacob K  Convention Center (Manhattan  NY),Sustainable Living,Epstein Global,FXFowle Architects,Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED),Birds,Javits  Jacob K  Convention Center (NYC)", "news_keywords": "Editorial,Architecture,Birds", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The living green roof and new populations of insects, birds and bats are testament to the success of the eco-friendly renovation.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The living green roof and new populations of insects, birds and bats are testament to the success of the eco-friendly renovation.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 7, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-09-08", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Birds", "published": "2015-01-07", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "08thu4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150908085723, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/opinion/more-life-at-the-javits-center.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The living green roof and new populations of insects, birds and bats are testament to the success of the eco-friendly renovation.", "title": "More Life at the Javits Center"}, "pdate": 20150107, "des": "Birds", "articleid": 100000003436466, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "More Life at the Javits Center", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcdd\"", "article_summary": "Andrew Cuomo signaled doom for the Javits Center with a plan to replace it with something much bigger in Queens, even as a previously begun renovation went forward.\nThe center now features a 6.75-acre living green roof, bird protective glass and a new population of insects that bats can\u2019t resist.\nFor all the complaints about the Jacob K.
