Aside from 1992\u2019s \u201cUnforgiven,\u201d Eastwood\u2019s searing anti-Western masterpiece, I\u2019m not a big fan of the Man With No Name\u2019s work, which I often find kitschy and generic. Still, my not having seen the film yet is due less to my qualms with the Chairman than the fact that, until recently, no one seemed to care much about the movie one way or the other. Funny what a $100 million opening weekend, and the \u201cliberal\u201d media\u2019s Pavlovian fear of conforming to the out-of-touch coastal elitist stereotype, can do.\n\nSo rather than engage in the questionable practice of reviewing a movie I have yet to see (and which has already been ably reviewed by Salon\u2019s Andrew O\u2019Hehir), I\u2019d like to focus instead on an analogy established in \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d that those who have had the opportunity to see it say is among its central themes. Namely, that all 7 billion-plus humans in the world can be separated into three groups: wolves, sheepdogs and sheep. The wolves are the bad guys, the theory holds, while the sheep are most everyone else. And sheepdogs? They act like wolves, but only in order to protect the sheep.\n\nThe lecture from Kyle\u2019s father that brings the schema into \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d is apparently a creation of the film\u2019s screenwriter, who may have borrowed it from former U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman, according to a piece from Slate. But whether or not Kyle actually held this mindset himself isn\u2019t too important, at least not for my purposes. What matters, instead, is the fact that the \u201csheep, sheepdogs, wolves\u201d breakdown resonates so powerfully with millions of Americans \u2014 and not just those who\u2019ve seen Eastwood\u2019s latest. It may sound nice, as formulas that promise to simplify our impossibly complex world often do; but it can take its adherents to some hideous extremes.\n\nAt heart, the sheepdog analogy, at least in the context of \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d and the Iraq War, is a kind of Aesopian repackaging of the hoary idea of American exceptionalism. Rather than view every human being as an individual, capable of making any number of decisions based off of their history and circumstance, the sheepdog worldview essentializes its targets, divorcing action from identity. It\u2019s not that wolves are wolves because they kill; sheepdogs do that, too. Wolves are wolves because, well, they just are. They\u2019re the \u201cbad guys.\u201d It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nSimilarly, the sheepdogs, who are the real protagonists in this morality play, also cannot be recognized as such by anything they\u2019ve actually done. Sheepdogs coerce, they intimidate, they bribe, they maim, they kill. The difference, of course, is that the sheepdogs\u2019 target is always a wolf. Except when it isn\u2019t. To take an example from the \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d trailer (which, as something of a movie-theater junkie, I\u2019ve seen more times than I can recount), there\u2019s at least one moment in the film when Kyle and his fellow sheepdogs have to decide how to treat the Iraqi women and children being manipulated or forced into helping the wolves.\n\nBut, at least in the trailer, when Kyle\u2019s got a prepubescent in his cross-hairs, there\u2019s little question of whether the child, if left unharmed, will be making it more likely that violence will befall a sheep or sheepdog in the near future. He will. He\u2019s carrying a weapon. Instead, the only question in that moment is whether Kyle has what it takes to assume the sheepdog\u2019s burden, knowing that, as one of his fellow-soldiers whispers, \u201cthey\u201d (presumably the sheep in Washington) will \u201cfry [him] if [he\u2019s] wrong.\u201d Having not seen the film, I don\u2019t know whether Bradley Cooper\u2019s Kyle ultimately shoots the little boy; but in the real world, in Afghanistan, soldiers were told to take lethal action against \u201cchildren with potential hostile intent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The runaway success of Eastwood's Iraq War melodrama says a lot about America \u2014 and it's disturbing and scary", "title": "Our \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d sickness: How American exceptionalism wrought Guantanamo", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The runaway success of Eastwood's Iraq War melodrama says a lot about America \u2014 and it's disturbing and scary", "title": "Our \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d sickness: How American exceptionalism wrought Guantanamo", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/24/our_american_sniper_sickness_how_american_exceptionalism_wrought_guantanamo/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/american_sniper31.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The runaway success of Eastwood's Iraq War melodrama says a lot about America \u2014 and it's disturbing and scary", "title": "Our \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d sickness: How American exceptionalism wrought Guantanamo", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/american_sniper31.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, America, American Exceptionalism, american sniper, Andrew O'Hehir, Bradley Cooper, brian turner, chris kyle, Clint Eastwood, Editor's Picks, guantanamo diary, Iraq war, Mohamedou Ould Slahi, sheepdog, Terrorism, Torture, War on Terror", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd378\"", "article_summary": "The lecture from Kyle\u2019s father that brings the schema into \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d is apparently a creation of the film\u2019s screenwriter, who may have borrowed it from former U.S.\nAt heart, the sheepdog analogy, at least in the context of \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d and the Iraq War, is a kind of Aesopian repackaging of the hoary idea of American exceptionalism.\nNamely, that all 7 billion-plus humans in the world can be separated into three groups: wolves, sheepdogs and sheep.\nWhat matters, instead, is the fact that the \u201csheep, sheepdogs, wolves\u201d breakdown resonates so powerfully with millions of Americans \u2014 and not just those who\u2019ve seen Eastwood\u2019s latest.\nIt\u2019s not that wolves are wolves because they kill; sheepdogs do that, too."}
