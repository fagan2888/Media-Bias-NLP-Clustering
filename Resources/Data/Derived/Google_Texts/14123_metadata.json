The genotype is the second-most prevalent version of the virus globally and is among the most difficult of the 6 genotypes to cure.He agreed that some physicians would be surprised that interferon was used in the trial, but said the results speak for themselves.\u201cInterferon\u2019s still part of the mix,\u201d Argarwal said at a news conference this morning, discussing the study. New HCV drugs are here and more are in the pipelin, he said.. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s a fast-moving field,\u201d he said, \u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t rush to discard interferon.\u201dDespite the drug\u2019s side effects, \u201cTwelve weeks is doable,\u201d he said.clincThat prospect raised concerns among others who treat liver disease. \u201cInterferon\u2019s back?\u201d said Fred Poordad, MD, clinical professor of medcine, and chief of hepatology at the University of Texas Health Science Center and vice president of academic and clinical affairs at the Texas Liver Insitute in San Antonio, TX. When asked in an interview for his reaction to the study, Poordad said,. \u201cInterferon is not a safe drug, it is very toxic.\u201dKnown side effects include severe fatigue, anemia, nausea, hair loss, headache and severe depression.Poordad favors other drug combinations, but said that since not all countries have access to them. He is due to report today on his own study known as ALLY-1, on the use of daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin for HCV patients with advanced cirrhosis or post-transplant recurrence of HCV.In the UK study, the genotype-3 patients who got the SOF+PEG/RBV drug combination had a higher rate of sustained virologic response (93% of patients) than at 24 weeks (84%) or 16 weeks (71%).The combination therapy should be considered for interferon-eligible genotype 3 patients particularly if they have cirrhosis, have failed other treatments, or both, said lead investigator Graham Foster, a professor of hepatology at Queen Mary\u2019s University in London, UK.Of 592 patients randomised and treated, 92% had genotype 3 HCV, 67% were male, 84% white, 53% had had other treatments, and 37% had cirrhosis.The study also evaluated the safety and efficacy of SOF+PEG/RBV for 12 weeks vs SOF+RBV for 16 or 24 weeks in treatment-experienced genotype-2 (GT-2) HCV-infected patients with cirrhosis.GT-2 treatment-experienced patients with cirrhosis had high SVR12 rates in all treatment arms; 87% of those receiving SOF+RBV for 16 weeks, 100% of those receiving SOF+RBV for 24 weeks and 94% of those receiving SOF+PEG/RBV for 12 weeks.Commenting on the study, Tom Hemming Karlsen, a member of the European Association for the Study of the Liver\u2019s scientific committee, called it \u201cground-breaking\u201d in that it showed the combination appears to work for patients with both genotypes 1 and 2 of the virus.Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief, Hepatology, University of Texas Health Science Center and VP, Academic and Clinical Affairs, The Texas Liver Institute", "article_metadata": {"description": "The use of interferon to treat hepatitis C infections has fallen out of favor with the advent of new antivirals and drug combinations that have fewer side effects.
