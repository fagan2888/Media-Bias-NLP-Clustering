Attorneys for the officer want to keep it that way: They asked a judge on Friday to bar the prosecution from releasing it.\n\nA preliminary hearing is scheduled for today to determine if there is enough evidence to send the case to trial. Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico said he plans to show the video if the hearing is held, though Officer Mearkle may waive it. A hearing on the defense motion to prevent the video\u2019s release is scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nOfficer Mearkle\u2019s lawyer, Brian Perry, describes her case as a matter of self-defense, arguing that Mr. Kassick repeatedly reached toward his waist while Officer Mearkle commanded him to show his hands. She told investigators she fired because she feared he was reaching into his jacket for a gun.\n\nMr. Kassick, however, was unarmed when he was shot after fleeing from the Feb. 2 traffic stop prompted by expired inspections and emissions stickers, authorities said.\n\nThe fatal encounter was recorded by the camera on the stun gun Officer Mearkle had already used in her bid to arrest Mr. Kassick. Such cameras are a popular feature on the devices.\n\nIn the South Carolina case, a witness\u2019 cell phone captured the April 4 shooting of Walter Scott. The video shows a former North Charleston officer, Michael Slager, firing eight times as Mr. Scott ran from a traffic stop that began over a broken tail light.\n\nMr. Perry, who said he has not seen the video in the Kassick case, said the situation does not resemble the South Carolina shooting.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s giving the guy repeated commands to stop, she\u2019s giving him repeated commands to show his hands. She Tased him four times. They\u2019re completely different facts than shooting a guy running away in the back,\u201d Mr. Perry said.\n\nMr. Slusser, however, said the video \u201cleaves nothing to the imagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether she would have been charged or not had the video not existed, I can\u2019t answer that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can tell you having that video, for me \u2014 I won\u2019t speak for the DA \u2014 but it made it very clear the DA had very little choice not to charge her.\u201d\n\nMr. Marsico said police have continued to investigate the matter and develop information about the case.\n\nOfficer Mearkle, 36, a 15-year veteran of the department, has been free on bail but is under electronic monitoring.
