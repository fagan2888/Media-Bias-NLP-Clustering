If you were squatting 125 pounds before donning maternity wear, then you can probably keep it up as elastic-waist pants take over your closet.\n\nYou may have to lower the weight as the pregnancy progresses, however, if you start developing back pain. It\u2019s common for pregnant women to suffer from lordosis, a curvature of the spine that can cause lower back pain during strength training, Artal said.\n\nProper technique is essential to prevent injury, especially at the tail-end of the pregnancy when your body will have a buildup in relaxin, a hormone that loosens ligaments for an easier delivery, said Michelle Mottola, director of the Exercise and Pregnancy Lab at the University of Western Ontario.\n\nJoints might be prone to injury because of the higher hormone levels. So it\u2019s best to cut out any exercises that require rapid changes in direction or bouncing \u2014 no split jumps or burpees. And isometric exercise \u2014 the sorts of moves that require hold periods \u2014 is best left for post-pregnancy workouts.\n\nStick to static moves such as squats, which are good for strengthening your abdominals and pelvic floor, the muscles and ligaments that support the womb, said Lisa Reed, a Washington trainer.\n\nExercising while lying on your back is a no-no after four months, Mottola said. Your enlarged uterus could either decrease the flow of blood returning from the lower half of your body as it presses on a major vein or decrease the flow to a major artery.\n\nReed said she advises her pregnant clients to avoid exercises such as knee lifts and high kicks that shift the pelvic floor. Anything that \u201cputs more stress on the pelvic floor and twisting of the body is not advised in the third trimester,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the other hand, swimming or any kind of exercising in the water is a great way for women to stay in shape throughout their pregnancies, Reed said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/09/hffit02.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd98ac\"", "article_summary": "Reed said she advises her pregnant clients to avoid exercises such as knee lifts and high kicks that shift the pelvic floor.\nAnything that \u201cputs more stress on the pelvic floor and twisting of the body is not advised in the third trimester,\u201d she said.\nIt\u2019s common for pregnant women to suffer from lordosis, a curvature of the spine that can cause lower back pain during strength training, Artal said.\nStick to static moves such as squats, which are good for strengthening your abdominals and pelvic floor, the muscles and ligaments that support the womb, said Lisa Reed, a Washington trainer.\nYou may have to lower the weight as the pregnancy progresses, however, if you start developing back pain."}
