Issues include healthcare, offshoring of call center jobs, temporary job relocations and pensions.\n\nIn the wireline business, consumer revenue of $4 billion was little changed from a year ago.\n\nNet income attributable to the company rose to $4.31 billion, or $1.06 per share, in the first quarter, meeting analysts' expectations.\n\nThe company stood by its full-year profit forecast.\n\nVerizon has been scaling back its Fios TV and Internet business, which represented about 29 percent of its 2015 revenue.\n\n\"Rather than investing in good jobs here at home, Verizon refuses to make Fios available to thousands of people ... throughout the East Coast and is embarking on a questionable path to acquire troubled Yahoo and other companies,\" Brooklyn-based Verizon field technician Anthony Finocchio, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nTo tap new revenue, the company has shifted its focus to the advertising-supported Internet business and acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion. It is seen as the front-runner in bidding for Yahoo Inc's core Internet business.\n\nThe company, known for its high-quality network, is locked in a battle for subscribers with competitors in the saturated U.S. wireless market. Smaller rival Sprint Corp has been offering half-off discounts, and T-Mobile US Inc has launched free music and video-streaming plans.\n\nVerizon reported strong subscriber net additions for the first quarter ended March 31, adding 640,000 wireless retail postpaid subscribers, helped by tablet promotions during a seasonally slow period for phone upgrades. That surpassed analysts' average estimate of 480,000, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.\n\nCustomer defections, or churn, in Verizon's wireless postpaid business, dropped to 0.96 percent from 1.03 percent a year earlier.\n\nTotal operating revenue rose 0.6 percent to $32.17 billion, falling slightly short of analysts' average estimate of $32.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\n(Reporting by Malathi Nayak in New York and Sai Sachin R in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Kshitiz Goliya in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernadette Baum)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said an ongoing strike by its wireline workers", "title": "Strike to pressure Verizon earnings; Q1 net income meets estimates", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/Verizons-quarterly-revenue-rises-06-percent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/verizon-results_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/Verizons-quarterly-revenue-rises-06-percent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/verizon-results_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said an ongoing strike by its wireline workers", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "It is seen as the front-runner in bidding for Yahoo Inc's core Internet business.\nVerizon has been scaling back its Fios TV and Internet business, which represented about 29 percent of its 2015 revenue.\nIn the wireline business, consumer revenue of $4 billion was little changed from a year ago.\nNet income attributable to the company rose to $4.31 billion, or $1.06 per share, in the first quarter, meeting analysts' expectations.\nTo tap new revenue, the company has shifted its focus to the advertising-supported Internet business and acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion."}
