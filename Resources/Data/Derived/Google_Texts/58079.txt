CARPI, Italy (AP) - Last-place Carpi has fired coach Fabrizio Castori six matches into its first Serie A season.

Carpi made the announcement Monday without immediately naming a replacement.

The move comes two days after a 5-1 loss to Roma left Carpi with just two points.

Itâ€™s the first firing in Serie A this season.

Former Siena, Palermo and Watford coach Giuseppe Sannino is reportedly in line to replace Castori.

Castori took over Carpi in June of last year and led the club to the Serie B title last season, promoting the squad to the top division for the first time in its 106-year history.

Carpi has scored six goals and conceded a league-worst 15. Its points have come from two draws, at Palermo and at home against Napoli.
