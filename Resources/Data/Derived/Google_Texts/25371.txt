President Barack Obama's recent approval ratings have been falling, the lowest numbers the President has seen so far.

Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer visited Iowa for the 2013 Progress Iowa holiday party. Schweitzer said that although the President's approval rating is down, it will go up. He said he's seen the same thing with many other presidents and that when a new, paradigm altering policy takes effect, it is bound to happen.

Schweitzer said that the Affordable Care Act was certainly a step in the right direction but the policy as it stands now is flawed. But, he added, that's the starting point to build it up. Medicare, for example, is an entirely different policy now than it was when it was originally passed.

He said Congress' job now needs to be improving it to the point where Americans have top rated health care instead of scraping the bottom of the barrel and paying through the nose to get it.
