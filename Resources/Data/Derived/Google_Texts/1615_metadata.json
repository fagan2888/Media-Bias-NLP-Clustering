Last month, the DC District Court ruled that Cause of Action, where I am executive director, can proceed with a lawsuit against the Department of Energy. We\u2019re suing the federal government for the blatant political favoritism in its $25 billion \u201cAdvanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn principle, this taxpayer-funded program was supposed to support the manufacture of energy-efficient cars. In practice, it rewarded a select few well-connected companies.\n\nSince the program was created in 2008, numerous businesses have applied for its taxpayer-backed financial support. Yet only a small number were approved. Among the lucky few were two electric car manufacturers: Tesla and Fisker.\n\nBoth companies\u2019 political connections run deep, especially Tesla\u2019s. The company\u2019s founder, Elon Musk, was a max donor for President Obama. One of its board members, Steven Westly, was appointed to a Department of Energy advisory board. And another Obama bundler, Tesla investor and adviser Steven Spinner, secured employment in the department\u2019s Loan Program Office\u2014the very office that gave the company a taxpayer-backed loan.\n\nFisker also has friends in high places. The company, which has since gone bankrupt, was backed by a San Francisco venture capital firm whose senior partners donated millions to the 2008 Obama campaign and other Democrat causes. One partner, John Doerr, parlayed his support into a seat on the President\u2019s Council of Jobs and Competitiveness.\n\nSuch connections can allow a company to exert political pressure to enrich itself. Unsurprisingly, Department of Energy emails show that such pressure was rampant in its loan programs.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of examples. The department\u2019s leaders\u2014including then-Secretary of Energy Steven Chu\u2014repeatedly promised to deliver results to politicians like Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Sen. Harry Reid Harry ReidMcCain files B amendment to boost defense spending Dems to GOP: Cancel Memorial Day break Sanders fundraises for Feingold in Wisconsin Senate race MORE (D-Nev.). One emails reads, \u201cDOE has made a political commitment\u201d to approve a company\u2019s loan. Another says the \u201cpressure is on real heavy\u201d from none other than Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenClinton urged to go liberal with vice presidential pick Biden will host cancer research summit in DC Reid throws wrench into Clinton vice presidential picks MORE. And still another shows an employee asking, \u201cwhat\u2019s another billion anyhow?\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Obama administration gave Tesla and Fisker preferential treatment, and then some.\n\nThe Department of Energy revised its review process in order finish the companies\u2019 applications faster. The government gave them extraordinary access to its staff and facilities\u2014even to the point of having government employees personally walk them through the loan application and approval process. The department ignored its own lending rules in order to approve the companies\u2019 loans. And it renegotiated the terms of some loans after the companies could not keep their original commitments or were experiencing financial difficulties. Tellingly, Fisker has since gone out of business, despite receiving over a billion dollars in loans through this federal program.\n\nNow contrast this preferential treatment with what happened to XP Vehicles and Limnia, neither of which have the same political connections. (My organization is suing the Department of Energy on their behalf). The two companies partnered to manufacture an energy-efficient sport utility vehicle that would have competed with Tesla and Fisker\u2019s cars. They applied for loans in 2008 and 2009 under the same loan program.\n\nThe department refused them both\u2014and it used bogus reasons to do so.\n\nFor starters, the department made claims that were laughably false. To take one example: It rejected XPV\u2019s application because its vehicle was powered by hydrogen. It was an electric SUV. It also raised objections that it didn\u2019t raise with other companies whose applications were approved. For instance: The bureaucracy criticized the proposed all-electric vehicle for not using a specific type of gasoline. Yet Tesla and Fisker received the loans despite producing similar all-electric cars.\n\nIn light of these obvious problems and hypocrisy, both companies presented the Department of Energy with detailed rebuttals. Yet the government failed to respond. To this day, both XPV and Limnia are awaiting a satisfactory reply. In the meantime, XPV has gone out of business, unable to compete against its politically connected\u2014and subsidized\u2014rivals.\n\nThis casts the Department of Energy\u2019s loan program in a new light. It was sold to the American public as a means of promoting energy-efficient vehicles. Instead, it was used to benefit a select few well-connected companies. It was a blatant crony handout, paid for by the U.S. taxpayer.\n\nSadly, similar examples are widespread in Washington. That\u2019s no surprise considering the feds spend roughly $100 billion a year in taxpayer-funded handouts to businesses. This breeds the sort of government-business collusion Americans think is rampant in Washington. In fact, over two-thirds of likely voters think the federal government helps businesses that hire the most lobbyists, shake the right hands, and pad the right pockets. They\u2019re right.\n\nThis points to a simple conclusion: Politicians and bureaucrats shouldn\u2019t use the public\u2019s money to pad private companies\u2019 bottom lines. As the Department of Energy\u2019s green-vehicle loan program shows, the capacity for corruption is immense\u2014and inevitable.\n\nEpstein is executive director of Cause of Action, a government watchdog.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "News flash: Government subsidies and special-interest favors go hand in hand.", "description": "News flash: Government subsidies and special-interest favors go hand in hand.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "News flash: Government subsidies and special-interest favors go hand in hand.", "title": "A case study in pay-to-play cronyism", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/250109-a-case-study-in-pay-to-play-cronyism", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/250109-a-case-study-in-pay-to-play-cronyism", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-04T11:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Dan Epstein", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-04T11:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Harry Reid, Joe Biden,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/250109-a-case-study-in-pay-to-play-cronyism", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "News flash: Government subsidies and special-interest favors go hand in hand.", "card": "summary", "title": "A case study in pay-to-play cronyism"}, "dcterms.title": "A case study in pay-to-play cronyism"}, "article_summary": "Both companies\u2019 political connections run deep, especially Tesla\u2019s.\nThe latest example comes from a federal green-energy loan program.\nAs the Department of Energy\u2019s green-vehicle loan program shows, the capacity for corruption is immense\u2014and inevitable.\nThe department ignored its own lending rules in order to approve the companies\u2019 loans.\nThis casts the Department of Energy\u2019s loan program in a new light."}
