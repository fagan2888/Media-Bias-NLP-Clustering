In low wage businesses, like fast food restaurants, some owners chose to reduce their workers to part time instead.

Two barbecue, two ketchup,\u201d one worker says, handing an order to a customer through the drive-thru window.\n\nTiana Mua has worked here almost a year. She\u2019s part time, but she\u2019d like to be full time.\n\n\u201cCause I want to become independent,\u201d she says.\n\nBut at this Burger King, only the managers are full time. Mua says it\u2019s like that at fast food joints all over town. It\u2019s hard to get full time work.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re cutting back on all the jobs, and a lot of people have been let go,\u201d she says.\n\nOne reason is the local economy is bad. People aren\u2019t eating out as much, and sales are down. So restaurants can\u2019t afford a robust staff.\n\nBut there\u2019s another reason that might explain why fast food employees aren\u2019t getting more hours: Obamacare.\n\nStarting January 1, businesses with 50 or more full time employees must offer health insurance to all full time staff or pay a hefty fine. Employers with 100 or more workers had to start offering coverage last year. But smaller businesses that operate on lower margins, especially restaurants, complained loudly about the cost. And some fast food franchise owners, figured out a way to avoid paying for coverage: just make everyone part time.\n\nNearly 60 percent of small franchise business owners said they would make personnel changes like this to avoid hitting the 50 employee threshhold, according to a 2013 U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey.\n\nBut, some of those restaurant owners who cut hours to sidestep the health law \u2013- now regret it, says Kaya Bromley, an attorney who consults with employers on how to comply with the Affordable Care Act, and author of The Employers\u2019 Guide to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cA lot of the fast food franchisees that did this are now coming back and saying, it was a great idea for reducing the number of people that I have to offer benefits, but now I can\u2019t run my restaurants,\u201d she says.\n\nThey tell her it\u2019s been a nightmare trying to manage a part time staff.\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ve got people who are less loyal, you\u2019ve got people who are less skilled who don\u2019t understand the business, and there\u2019s more turnover,\u201d she says.\n\nSo, Bromley has seen a lot of those restaurants reverse course.\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019re backtracking, saying, \u2018It\u2019s worth it to me to have a full of time staff of people in every restaurant and offer them benefits,\u2019\u201dshe says. \u201cEmployers think that there\u2019s a shortcut here or there, and then they realize, yeah, that shortcut really hurt me more than it helped me.\u201d\n\nThe people hurt most by all the workforce management gymnastics are the people at the bottom of the restaurant pecking order who want to advance, but can\u2019t, says Angelo Amador, vice president of labor and workforce policy for the National Restaurant Association.\n\n\u201cSomeone who\u2019s working part time, but wants more hours so they can move up the ladder, they can\u2019t get the hours,\u201d he says. \u201cIt ends up taking out that middle rung of employees.\u201d\n\nObamacare has made restaurants less flexible, he says, mainly because it defines full time work as 30 hours a week or more. Amador says most other laws restaurants have to comply with, like overtime pay, define full time as 40 hours. He thinks the Affordable Care Act should be changed for consistency.\n\n\u201cIt would be much easier if we could have one definition of full time,\u201d he says.\n\nSilvia Campos is relieved that she\u2019s allowed to keep as many workers full time as she can at the Carl\u2019s Junior she manages in Chowchilla.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small town. For me, it\u2019s hard to find a really good employee,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have employees, and for some reason, they don\u2019t like it and go. So it\u2019s really hard to keep good people.\u201d\n\nBut Campos says some workers don\u2019t want more hours. They get subsidized health care through Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace, or free coverage through Medi-Cal. If their income gets too high, they lose eligibility for public benefits.\n\n\u201cWe try but some people, they don\u2019t want the full time,\u201d she says. \u201cThey say no, keep me on part time and that\u2019s good with me.\u201d\n\nThe company does offer insurance, at a cost of about $300 a month, according to the workers. But some of them say they\u2019re better off making less money and getting their coverage free from the state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fast food restaurants are where the latest drama of the Affordable Care Act is playing out.
