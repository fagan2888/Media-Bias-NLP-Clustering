PANCEVO, Serbia (AP) — Normally, Leo would run away at the sight of a bigger dog. The small dachshund liked most to cuddle with his owners or ride in the back seat of the family car. But, one day Leo showed that true bravery knows no limits.

When a raging bull-mastiff cross-breed last year attacked a 10-year-old girl, Leo fearlessly jumped to her rescue, barking and biting at the dog way above his size and strength. Leo paid with his life, but the citizens of this northern Serbian town have not forgotten.

Two weeks ago, a life-size bronze statue of Leo was put up next to a children’s playground in Pancevo’s city park, honoring the dog and teaching kids about animal friendship and sacrifice. An alert-looking Leo, his head raised above his stretched paws, now rests proudly on a white base surrounded by flowers.

Nikolina Vucetic, the girl Leo defended, often comes by.

“I am so glad Leo has a monument, he turned out to be a real hero,” Vucetic told The Associated Press. “He helped me.”

The initiative to honor Leo was pushed through by an animal rights group after it gained widespread citizens’ support through social networks and local media. The “Pets” group says Leo’s is the first dog monument in Serbia, which has huge problems with stray dogs and notoriously low standards in animal welfare and protection.

“The idea was to raise awareness about how important animals are to us and how they are always there for us when we need them,” activist Ivan Kurajov explained.
