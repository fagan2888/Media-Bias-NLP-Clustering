Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa made a stop in Amarillo on Wednesday to visit Potter and Randall County Democrats.

Hinojosa talked about the minimum wage issue, noting that the Republican party refuses to increase hourly pay in Texas.

“They think it’s alright for one-quarter or more of the workers in the state of Texas to earn what is less than a living wage, and refuse to take action on it,” he said.

Hinojosa praised Obamacare for the ability to provide health care for those who did not have access to it in the past. “It has given them (Americans) the freedom to be healthy,” he said. “I think that’s a basic, human right.”

Discussing what it means to be a member of the Democratic Party, Hinojosa said, “We understand what’s important for Texas. We fight for what is good for all of our citizens, we are not selfish, and we understand what ‘liberty and justice for all’ means.”

In 2008, Hinojosa was elected to the Democratic National Committee and was appointed to the executive committee in 2009, becoming only the second Latino in this position.

Hinojosa said the Democratic Party thinks liberty means the right to be free economically, socially and educationally, and the right to succeed. “The things we fight for a good for everybody,” he said.

His trip to Amarillo was hosted by Potter-Randall Democratic Club at the Alamo Hispanic Cultural Center.
