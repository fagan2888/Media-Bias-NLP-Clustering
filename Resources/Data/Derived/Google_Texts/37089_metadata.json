You just can't.\n\n(And Wondolowski scores a lot of game-winning goals.

The U.S. Men's National Team is currently 13th in the FIFA world rankings, and UK bookmakers Skybet and Ladbrokes both give the team 1/250 odds of winning the tournament.)\n\nIf you do tune in, watch for Wondo -- he's an incredible talent who can change the course of a game.
