In an ACO, physicians are given bonuses or can share in savings achieved for lowering costs while keeping patients healthy, such as reducing unnecessary emergency room visits and hospital stays.\n\nMike Englehart, president of Advocate Physician Partners, a care management collaboration with Advocate that has about 4,900 physicians, said the goal for the bigger ACO with UnitedHealthcare is to be at least as successful as the ACO Advocate launched with Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois about four years ago. That effort with the state's dominant insurer has achieved up to 2 percent savings each year, Englehart said.\n\n\u201cThe one thing about UnitedHealthcare that we've come to greatly appreciate is they have outstanding data and analytics,\u201d Englehart said.\n\nUnitedHealthcare, which serves nearly 1.4 million Illinois residents, is a subsidiary of Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth Group. Downers Grove-based Advocate is the largest hospital network in the state, with 12 hospitals. Advocate could bulk up even more. The health system plans to merge with Evanston-based NorthShore University HealthSystem, a four-hospital network.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "timeCrawled": "20160526_03:21:31", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more.", "title": "UnitedHealthcare, Advocate Health Care to beef up coordinated care initiative", "taxo_Industries": "Hospitals", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150604/NEWS03/150609904/AR/0/AR-150609904.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "summary": "UnitedHealthcare, the second-largest insurer in Illinois, is expanding a key initiative with Advocate Health Care as the industry continues paying physicians to lower costs while improving care.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "UnitedHealthcare, the second-largest insurer in Illinois, is expanding a key initiative with Advocate Health Care as the industry continues paying physicians to lower costs while improving care.", "title": "UnitedHealthcare, Advocate to beef up coordinated care initiative", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150604/NEWS03/150609904/unitedhealthcare-advocate-to-beef-up-coordinated-care-initiative", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150604/NEWS03/150609904/AR/0/AR-150609904.jpg", "type": "article"}, "published_at": "2015-6-4", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/150609904", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "NorthShore University HealthSystem", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150604/NEWS03/150609904/AR/0/AR-150609904.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "UnitedHealthcare, Advocate Health Care to beef up coordinated care initiative"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb27a\"", "article_summary": "UnitedHealthcare, the second-largest insurer in Illinois, is expanding a key coordinated care initiative with Advocate Health Care to include more than 80,000 people.\nThe two entities last year launched a so-called accountable care organization covering about 5,500 patients with a Medicare Advantage plan through UnitedHealthcare.\nOn July 1, the ACO will expand to include more than 80,000 patients who have a UnitedHealthcare plan through their employers.\n\u201cThe one thing about UnitedHealthcare that we've come to greatly appreciate is they have outstanding data and analytics,\u201d Englehart said.\nThat effort with the state's dominant insurer has achieved up to 2 percent savings each year, Englehart said."}
