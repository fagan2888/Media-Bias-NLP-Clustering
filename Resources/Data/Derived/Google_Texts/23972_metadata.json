As temperatures rise, finds a new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, more and more of these creatures are being born female, creating a skewed sex ratio that could one day lead to the species\u2019 demise.\n\nUnlike humans, whose chromosomes determine their sex, sea turtles\u2019 gender is dictated by an external factor: the temperature of the sand in which the mother turtle buries her eggs. As the sand gets warmer, more females are typically produced. Carrying that out to its logical conclusion, study author Graeme Hays explained to the Guardian, suggests that a warmer world will mean the end of male turtles:\n\nAt the \u201cpivotal temperature\u201d, 29C [84F], the gender ratio of turtle hatchling is approximately 50:50. The ratio is upset as the sand temperature increases, until it reaches around 31C [88F]. Sand that hot will \u201calmost exclusively produce female hatchlings\u201d, Hays said. \u2026\u201cOver the next 20 to 30 years, it\u2019s not going to create problems,\u201d Hays said. \u201cIn fact there\u2019s going to be a benefit to the turtles, because there\u2019s going to be more females produced, which means more females laying eggs. More females will lead to a population expansion. \u201cBut ultimately, if you extrapolate long enough into the future \u2026 once you get 100 years or more into the future, then things start to look serious. You have so few males left that it\u2019s likely to be a problem. There will be heaps of female but not enough males to fertilise all those eggs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As temperatures rise, the population risks becoming entirely female, a new study finds", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As temperatures rise, the population risks becoming entirely female, a new study finds", "title": "Climate change is creating a sea turtle gender gap \u2014 and it could mean the end of the species", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/20/climate_change_is_creating_a_sea_turtle_gender_gap_and_it_could_mean_the_end_of_the_species/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shutterstock_126387773.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As temperatures rise, the population risks becoming entirely female, a new study finds", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shutterstock_126387773.jpg", "title": "Climate change is creating a sea turtle gender gap \u2014 and it could mean the end of the species", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Climate change is creating a sea turtle gender gap \u2014 and it could mean the end of the species", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Climate Change, endangered species, Gender Gap, sea turtles, wildlife", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaed0\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Climate Change, endangered species, Gender Gap, sea turtles, wildlife, Sustainability NewsIt\u2019s the end of men: sea turtle edition.\nUnlike humans, whose chromosomes determine their sex, sea turtles\u2019 gender is dictated by an external factor: the temperature of the sand in which the mother turtle buries her eggs.\nThe ratio is upset as the sand temperature increases, until it reaches around 31C [88F].\n\u201cIn fact there\u2019s going to be a benefit to the turtles, because there\u2019s going to be more females produced, which means more females laying eggs.\nCarrying that out to its logical conclusion, study author Graeme Hays explained to the Guardian, suggests that a warmer world will mean the end of male turtles:At the \u201cpivotal temperature\u201d, 29C [84F], the gender ratio of turtle hatchling is approximately 50:50."}
