A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini, said the priests were from the Vicenza diocese in northern Italy.\n\nBishop Phillippe Stevens of the parish of Maroua, Cameroon, identified the nun as Gilberte Bissiere, Reuters said. He said the three were taken by \u201cunknown people\u201d who broke open the doors of their residences.\n\nThe Rev. Henri Djongang, the vicar general of Maroua, said the kidnapping took place near Maroua in the village of Tch\u00e9r\u00e9, 37 miles from the border with Nigeria.\n\nThe kidnappers arrived in two cars and on five motorcycles, and \u201cthere were many of them,\u201d Father Djongang said. People nearby heard the sounds of a struggle, and the nun \u201ccried out a lot,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility for the kidnappings, although Boko Haram, an Islamist militant group based in Nigeria, has operated in the area.\n\n\u201cIt has not been excluded that the culprits of the kidnapping could belong to the Islamic militia Boko Haram,\u201d said Vatican Radio, the Vatican\u2019s news outlet.\n\nAn Italian Foreign Ministry press officer said the ministry\u2019s website cautions against traveling in the area, \u201cin consideration of the risk of kidnappings due to presence of jihadist elements coming from Nigeria.\u201d\n\nFather Benedettini said that Pope Francis was informed early Saturday about the abductions, and that the pope was praying for the three who had been taken.\n\nThe priests \u201chad been there for many years,\u201d Father Djongang said. \u201cThey were very kind. They liked the population, and they were well liked by the people, too. They helped a lot with the children, in the schools. They helped train teachers.\u201d\n\nHe said he suspected Boko Haram because it was \u201cthe same method\u201d they used in the kidnapping of a French priest, the Rev. Georges Vandenbeusch, in the same region in November. He was freed in late December.\n\nBoko Haram\u2019s insurgency has killed hundreds of Nigerian citizens in a campaign to undermine Nigeria\u2019s central government.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140405113550, "twitter": {"description": "The three were said to be taken by \u201cunknown people\u201d who broke open the doors of their residences in an area near the Nigerian border that is known for kidnappings.", "title": "2 Italian Priests and a Canadian Nun Are Abducted in Cameroon", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/world/africa/2-italian-priests-and-a-canadian-nun-are-abducted-in-cameroon.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002809351"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "gaia_pianigiani", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/world/africa/2-italian-priests-and-a-canadian-nun-are-abducted-in-cameroon.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002809351", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/world/africa/2-italian-priests-and-a-canadian-nun-are-abducted-in-cameroon.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "world/africa", "hdl_p": "2 Italian Priests and a Canadian Nun Are Abducted in Cameroon", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/africa/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 5, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Roman Catholic Church", "keywords": "Kidnapping,Roman Catholic Church,Cameroon,Marta  Giampaolo,Bissiere  Gilberte,Allegri  Gianantonio", "news_keywords": "Kidnapping,Cameroon", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Gaia Pianigiani", "SCG": "africa", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Allegri, Gianantonio", "byl": "By GAIA PIANIGIANI", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The three were said to be taken by \u201cunknown people\u201d who broke open the doors of their residences in an area near the Nigerian border that is known for kidnappings.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The three were said to be taken by \u201cunknown people\u201d who broke open the doors of their residences in an area near the Nigerian border that is known for kidnappings.", "CG": "world", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 5, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "Africa", "modified": "2014-04-10", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/africa/index.jsonp", "tag": "Allegri, Gianantonio", "published": "2014-04-05", "section-taxonomy-id": "9A43D8FC-F4CF-44D9-9B34-138D30468F8F"}, "geo": "Cameroon", "slug": "06cameroon", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140410102530, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/world/africa/2-italian-priests-and-a-canadian-nun-are-abducted-in-cameroon.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The three were said to be taken by \u201cunknown people\u201d who broke open the doors of their residences in an area near the Nigerian border that is known for kidnappings.", "title": "2 Italian Priests and a Canadian Nun Are Abducted in Cameroon"}, "pdate": 20140405, "des": "Kidnapping", "articleid": 100000002809351, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "2 Italian Priests and a Canadian Nun Are Abducted in Cameroon", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ffd\"", "article_summary": "ROME \u2014 Two Italian priests and a Canadian nun were abducted early Saturday from their mission in northern Cameroon, the Italian government and Vatican officials said.\nBishop Phillippe Stevens of the parish of Maroua, Cameroon, identified the nun as Gilberte Bissiere, Reuters said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyNo one immediately claimed responsibility for the kidnappings, although Boko Haram, an Islamist militant group based in Nigeria, has operated in the area.\nThe Italian Foreign Ministry identified the priests as Giampaolo Marta and Gianantonio Allegri.\n\u201cIt has not been excluded that the culprits of the kidnapping could belong to the Islamic militia Boko Haram,\u201d said Vatican Radio, the Vatican\u2019s news outlet."}
