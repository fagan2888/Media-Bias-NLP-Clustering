BOSTON — A man has come forward saying Philadelphia 76ers center Jahlil Okafor assaulted him during a fight in Boston that was recorded on cellphone video and posted online, police said.

The man filed a police report Friday saying he was punched and knocked to the ground outside a nightclub early Thursday morning, authorities said. The man said he needed stitches to close a cut above his eye, according to police.

The man told police that the fight broke out after some of his female friends refused the advances of two other men, including one believed to be Okafor.

Boston police said they are investigating the allegations. No charges have been announced.

The 19-year-old rookie said Friday that he was embarrassed about the scuffle and was dealing with the team and the NBA on possible discipline.

Okafor said he reacted to heckling about the Sixers, who lost to the Celtics Wednesday night to fall to 0-16 on the season.

“It was definitely dumb on my part,” Okafor said Friday.

A few hours later, the Sixers fell to the Houston Rockets, 116-114, to remain winless on the season. Okafor had 11 points and six rebounds.

TMZ posted cellphone video of the altercation on Thursday, showing Okafor yelling and later shoving a man outside the club.
