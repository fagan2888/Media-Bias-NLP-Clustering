Pixabay Public Domain\n\nMany Americans ritualistically schedule and check in to an annual physical examination. About one-third of American adults receive a physical every year, a practice that has recently been questioned more and more. Some doctors are calling for the once-a-year physical to be abandoned because of a lack of results, but others defend the practice as beneficial.\n\nTwo editorials published in the Oct. 15 New England Journal of Medicine battle it out, airing reasons for or against annual physicals.\n\nDr. Ateev Mehrotra, an associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, and Dr. Allan Prochazka, argue that eliminating the annual physical would improve the value of health care, and do away with a practice that really isn\u2019t beneficial \u2014 and may actually be harmful.\n\nThe content of the annual physical exam is \u201cpoorly defined and its focus has evolved over time,\u201d according to Mehrotra, but potential components include things like screening questions for history taking, physical aspects like urine tests and blood pressure measurements. The idea is that doctors would use this opportunity to detect problems in patients, and preemptively stop chronic illnesses from developing. This isn\u2019t really the case, though.\n\n\u201cIn good studies, in both randomized trials and observational studies, we have not found any of those benefits,\u201d said Mehrota to MedicineNet. \u201cWe have not seen people have less illness, and we have not seen any decrease in mortality.\u201d\n\nAnnual checkups cost over $10 billion a year, according to Mehrotra, and sometimes they even cause harm. Many tests in patients with no symptoms can yield false positives, leaving patients anxiety-ridden about a condition they don\u2019t actually have.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of trying to do anything that\u2019s going to help the health of the U.S.,\u201d Mehrotra said. \u201cBut in this case, we\u2019ve studied it, and it hasn\u2019t helped. We shouldn\u2019t waste time and money on this.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side, Dr. Allan Goroll penned an editorial in favor of the annual physical, citing important patient-doctor relationships as a reason to keep the practice. Learning about the various aspects of a patient\u2019s life \u2014 family and work stresses, financial pressures, habits \u2014 is important for a doctor to understand because they can affect health and well-being.\n\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be done in five minutes, and it can\u2019t be done by a questionnaire,\u201d Goroll said. \u201cIt\u2019s don\u2019e by looking a patient in the eye and giving them the feeling they aren\u2019t being rushed. By calling for the elimination of the annual checkup, they risk compromising the delivery of a comprehensive, whole-person approach to health care.\u201d\n\nBoth of the editorials, however, called for some reforms of the system.\n\nMehrotra said a computer can easily keep track of things like who needs a flu shot, and who needs to get their blood pressure checked again, eliminating the need for a universal annual checkup. However, regular checkups are more logical for patients who haven\u2019t seen their physician in a good amount of time.\n\n\u201cI do acknowledge for people who haven\u2019t seen a primary care doctor for several years, going in to maintain that relationship does make sense,\u201d he said.\n\nGoroll supports the idea of an annual physical, but in a team-based approach. This means that nurses, assistants, and care coordinators would be handling most of the preventive-care processes, freeing up doctors for more in-depth conversations with patients about their health.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not eliminate the annual physical, which is really an annual health review, but let\u2019s enhance it so it\u2019s a meaningful experience,\u201d he said.\n\nSources:\n\nMehrotrova A, Prochazka A.
