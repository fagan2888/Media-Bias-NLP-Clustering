Meacham and Mandel are Republicans.\n\nWith cooperation from early adopters like Meacham and the Mahoning County commissioners, Mandel expects to start publishing local checkbooks at OhioCheckbook.com \u201cby this summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t need to change anything to make this information public,\u201d Delaware County Auditor George Kaitsa told Ohio Watchdog. The treasurer\u2019s office has developed templates to simplify the process, he explained.\n\n\u201cIn our case, about 90 percent of the work is already done,\u201d Kaitsa added. Handing off local data to the treasurer and making sure personal information is redacted are Delaware County\u2019s only real concerns at this point.\n\nOnce local governments have worked out the data submission process, upkeep should take a trivial effort, Kaitsa said. And having one online transparency system instead of hundreds will save taxpayers money on web development costs.\n\nMandel\u2019s transparency project is supported by numerous lobbying groups for local governments, including the Ohio Municipal League, Ohio Township Association and Ohio Association of School Business Officials.\n\n\u201cIn this process of signing them up to put their checkbooks online, there\u2019s gonna be leaders and there\u2019s gonna be followers,\u201d Mandel said during a phone interview. \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be a tipping point where it becomes uncomfortable to be a straggler.\u201d\n\nBut persuading a critical mass of local governments to participate and getting their checkbooks into the treasurer\u2019s system will take time.\n\nMandel\u2019s office began the process in April, sending letters to 18,000 officials in 3,962 counties, cities, school districts and other local government bodies. More than 100 local governments have signed on, and 400 more have expressed interest.\n\nRELATED: School districts share spending data on Ohio\u2019s online checkbook\n\nThe process will be \u201ccomplicated and laborious\u201d because of big differences in local accounting systems, Mandel said.\n\n\u201cYou have some large cities and counties that are on very advanced accounting systems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you have some townships, we learned recently, that are still doing some of their accounting on legal pads.\u201d\n\nThe treasurer is optimistic about the benefits taxpayers will see as local data are processed and published. \u201cIt\u2019s all about taking everyday citizens who yesterday felt powerless, and today making them feel powerful,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting feedback his office received from an Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities employee who said OhioCheckbook.com is faster than their internal software, Mandel said he expects the system to help local officials with budgeting, too.\n\n\u201cNot only do I think this\u2019ll be a great tool for citizen watchdogs and those of us who wanna hold politicians accountable, it\u2019ll also be a great tool for elected leaders and fiscal officers to help them make better decisions when it comes to tax money,\u201d he said.\n\nHaving local government spending from throughout the state posted in a simple, standardized format will help public officials see where they may be overpaying for products or services or should consider bulk purchasing arrangements, Mandel explained.\n\nLocal officials who haven\u2019t followed up with the treasurer\u2019s office by Labor Day can expect \u201can aggressive follow-up push via phone, email and personal meetings\u201d encouraging them to submit their spending data for publication at OhioCheckbook.com\n\nHe doesn\u2019t expect it will be necessary, but Mandel plans to attend local government meetings as needed to remind \u201cdefiant\u201d officials, \u201cfirst of all, this is public information, second of all, it\u2019s public money and. third, taxpayers have a right to see it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taxpayers in Mahoning County, Delaware County and across Ohio will get a clearer look at local government spending starting this summer.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Taxpayers in Mahoning County, Delaware County and across Ohio will get a clearer look at local government spending starting this summer.", "title": "OhioCheckbook.com to spotlight local spending by August - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/josh-mandel-ohiocheckbook-ashville.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-26T15:00:25+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/219495/ohiocheckbook-local-spending/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Taxpayers in Mahoning County, Delaware County and across Ohio will get a clearer look at local government spending starting this summer.", "title": "OhioCheckbook.com to spotlight local spending by August - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/josh-mandel-ohiocheckbook-ashville.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Local Government", "published_time": "2015-05-27T04:00:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-26T15:00:25+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "ohiocheckbook, ohiocheckbook.com, local spending, government spending, ohio spending, ohio government spending. josh mandel, ralph meacham, george kaitsa"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8aa8\"", "article_summary": "By Jason Hart | Ohio WatchdogTaxpayers in Mahoning County, Delaware County and across Ohio will get a clearer look at local government spending starting this summer.\nRELATED: School districts share spending data on Ohio\u2019s online checkbookThe process will be \u201ccomplicated and laborious\u201d because of big differences in local accounting systems, Mandel said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to be efficient,\u201d Mahoning County Auditor Ralph Meacham told Ohio Watchdog.\nMahoning and Delaware are two of the first counties agreeing to post their checkbooks at Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel\u2019s OhioCheckbook.com, where public officials and taxpayers alike will be able to easily sort through county spending.\nHaving local government spending from throughout the state posted in a simple, standardized format will help public officials see where they may be overpaying for products or services or should consider bulk purchasing arrangements, Mandel explained."}
