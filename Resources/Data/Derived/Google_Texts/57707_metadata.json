Elijah Cummings (MD), the select committee\u2019s top Democrat, last February listing 20 witnesses he wanted to interview.\n\n\u201cWhile we are still waiting to receive crucial documents from the State Department and the CIA, and still waiting for important witnesses to be made available, the committee is diligently working to complete its thorough, fact-centered investigation and release a report with recommendations within the next few months,\u201d select committee press secretary Matt Wolking said in a statement.\n\nThe panel\u2019s investigation, which sparked months of headlines at the beginning of 2015 after it uncovered Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server while in the Obama administration, has largely faded from the public eye after Clinton appeared before the committee last October.\n\nThe former Secretary of State made no major slip-ups during the marathon 11-hour session, nor did the GOP-controlled select committee reveal a \u201csmoking gun\u201d that showed Clinton was negligent before, during or after the attack or attempted to cover up the truth about the siege that left four Americans dead, including the U.S. ambassador.\n\nRelated: With Clinton in the Rearview, What Now for the Benghazi Committee?\n\nClinton\u2019s performance seemingly put the controversy, which threatened to scuttle her presidential bid, behind her and she has largely regained the ground she lost to her Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nBut on New Year\u2019s Eve the State Department issued another 5,500 of the 55,000 total pages of Clinton's e-mails in its latest monthly release, thousands shy of the amount ordered by a federal judge. The steady drip will continue as voters in Iowa and New Hampshire prepare to cast the first votes of the 2016 presidential contest.\n\nAnd the FBI is still in possession of Clinton\u2019s \u201chomebrew\u201d server device for analysis, even though her lawyers claim it has been wiped clean.\n\nMeanwhile, the Benghazi panel itself has come under fire. Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump blasted the work of the committee and Gowdy, after the former federal prosecutor endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio (FL), a GOP rival, for president.\n\nRelated: An Unflappable Hillary Clinton Frustrates the Benghazi Committee\n\nGowdy \u201cdid not win those hearings,\u201d according to Trump.\n\n\u201cIt was not good for Republicans and for the country,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope he does a lot better for Marco than he did with the Benghazi hearings.\u201d\n\nDemocrats also pounced on Gowdy\u2019s endorsement, charging that it\u2019s further proof of the chairman\u2019s partisan nature, according to Politico. The select committee\u2019s investigation has cost taxpayers roughly $5.6 million and counting, according to panel Democrats.\n\nLast year a GOP spokesperson for the panel signaled its final report wouldn\u2019t be done until sometime in 2016, meaning it will continue to hover over Clinton\u2019s candidacy.\n\nGowdy himself has said the findings might not be definitive enough for some people.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The House panel investigating the 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi, Libya, will start t", "title": "Benghazi Panel Calls in Heavy Hitters to Start 2016", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/04/Benghazi-Panel-Calls-Heavy-Hitters-Start-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-12-20T163138Z_3_CBRE8BJ02AF00_RTROPTP_2_USA-BENGHAZI-CLINTON.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/04/Benghazi-Panel-Calls-Heavy-Hitters-Start-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-12-20T163138Z_3_CBRE8BJ02AF00_RTROPTP_2_USA-BENGHAZI-CLINTON.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The House panel investigating the 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi, Libya, will start t", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, the Benghazi panel itself has come under fire.\nThe House panel investigating the 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi, Libya, will start the New Year with a pair of high-profile interviews.\nRelated: With Clinton in the Rearview, What Now for the Benghazi Committee?\nRelated: An Unflappable Hillary Clinton Frustrates the Benghazi CommitteeGowdy \u201cdid not win those hearings,\u201d according to Trump.\nThe House Select Committee on Benghazi will hold a closed-door session with former CIA Director David Petraeus on Wednesday, followed by a private session with former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Friday, the panel announced late Monday."}
