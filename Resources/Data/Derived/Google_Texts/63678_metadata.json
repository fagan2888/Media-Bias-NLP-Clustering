On stage were the two women and their instruments, equipped with two open beers snug inside bright pink koozies.\n\nThe concept of this hilarious show is simple: Anderson and Frame portray two former prostitutes who sing about issues, such as birth control and sexual hangups, that most people (even those not in the sex industry) can relate to.\n\nThe scandalous duo dominated the stage for their hour set, part of the Piccolo Fringe Festival at Theatre 99, 280 Meeting St. Though the Reformed Whores are no strangers to Charleston, their lyrics and commentary still seemed to register as refreshingly raunchy. The crowd was howling from start to finish, as Marie and Katy sang about condoms, online dating and sexual experimentation. It seems these two very naughty girls are not afraid to go there... about anything... ever.\n\nAll of Reformed Whores\u2019 songs were delivered with a Southern twang, as if Dolly Parton had given whiskey-fueled vocal lessons to Scarlet O\u2019Hara in a brothel of the Wild West.\n\nThe duo was hilarious, but that\u2019s not to say that they lacked depth. Many of their songs have sexually empowered feminist messages. In \u201cWaxing Lesson,\u201d the girls draw attention to the widespread double standard of down-under grooming. In \u201cGirls Poop Too\u201d they challenge men\u2019s reluctance to associate women with the bathrooms they surely use.\n\nNot only are Anderson and Frame comically entertaining, they are musically talented as well. The women play guitar, accordion and ukulele as they sing along with powerful voices.\n\nFor those who \u201cjust like to watch,\u201d be sure to sit a few rows away from the stage: \u201cJust like an orgy we need everyone to participate,\u201d they say as they ask the crowd to stomp their feet and clap to form a beat over which they rap about \u2014 well, perhaps it\u2019s best left unsaid.\n\nThe Reformed Whores perform again at 6 p.m. Monday, 8 p.m. Tuesday and 7 p.m. Wednesday. Tickets are $16.
