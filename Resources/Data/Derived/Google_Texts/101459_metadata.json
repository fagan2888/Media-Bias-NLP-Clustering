Urge Russia to honor it\u2019s [sic] commitment,\u201d Twitchy first reported.\n\nAfter receiving swift backlash, the tweet was deleted, and Mr. Stengel sent out a terse explanation.\n\n\u201cEarlier tweet with wrong hashtag was a mistake. My bad,\u201d he said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately made clear how Mr. Stengel tweeted the wrong hashtag. He would have had to type it incorrectly, or copy and paste it incorrectly, and he would have had to then press the \u201ctweet\u201d button to send it out. Mr. Stengel sent out a subsequent, almost identical tweet, but instead with the hashtag #UnitedForUkraine.\n\nTwitter users weren\u2019t buying Mr. Stengel\u2019s apology.\n\n\u201cPlease, enlighten us as to how one incorrectly uses a hashtag like #UnitedForGaza. Maybe autocorrect changed #UnitedForGaga?\u201d tweeted Sean.\n\n\u201c\u2018My bad.\u2019 That\u2019s something a 12 yr old would say. Shameful that you represent this country,\u201d said Rachel Ward.\n\nMr. Stengel, who was the managing editor of Time magazine from 2006 to 2013, was sworn in on February 14 as Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.
