Speegle allegedly returned and stabbed a 24-year-old man at the party in the back with a 7-inch knife.\n\nThe victim\u2019s injuries are not life-threatening, officials said. While people at the party held Speegle down, McVay grabbed the backpack and ran away, witnesses told investigators.\n\nWhen sheriff\u2019s deputies caught up to her, she no longer had the backpack and refused to cooperate with investigators.\n\nThe Eagle County Drug Task Force is looking for the drugs. Anyone with information can call 970-328-8500 or Eagle County Crime Stoppers at 970-328-7007 or 1-800-972-8477.\n\nThere is a a $1,000 reward.\n\nSpeegle is being held on $7,500 bail in the Eagle County Detention Facility on several charges, including felony assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nMcVay is being held in the same facility on $2,000 bail on a felony charge of destruction of evidence and misdemeanor obstructing a peace officer.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Backpack full of drugs missing after stabbing at party in Beaver Creek", "title": "Backpack full of drugs missing after stabbing at party in Beaver Creek", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/16/backpack-full-of-drugs-missing-after-stabbing-at-party-in-beaver-creek/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140219__-Chase_Speeglep1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140219__-Chase_Speeglep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-16T22:18:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:52:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe475a\"", "article_summary": "While people at the party held Speegle down, McVay grabbed the backpack and ran away, witnesses told investigators.\nSheriff\u2019s deputies in Eagle County are looking for a backpack full of drugs that allegedly was whisked away from the scene of a stabbing early Sunday in Beaver Creek.\nThe Eagle County Drug Task Force is looking for the drugs.\nAnyone with information can call 970-328-8500 or Eagle County Crime Stoppers at 970-328-7007 or 1-800-972-8477.\nSpeegle is being held on $7,500 bail in the Eagle County Detention Facility on several charges, including felony assault with a deadly weapon."}
