Elementary report card (Photo: from JCPS)

The Courier-Journal has a story up about how Jefferson County Public Schools is exploring the idea of changing schools' grading scales to hypothetically make it easier for students to get As, Bs and Cs.

In addition to that discussion, JCPS is also looking at whether elementary and middle schools should go from sending out six report cards a year to only four.

The district is surveying parents, teachers and others about this idea, noting a few reasons why such a change may be beneficial.

For one, JCPS now gives four benchmark assessments throughout the year instead of six. Karen Branham, assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction, said changing the number of report cards could align them better with the benchmark assessments.

In addition, Branham said that parents now have access all the time to their children's grades through the online Parent Portal. "This allows parents to keep a pulse on how their child is doing in class," Branham said. "Some say it places a little less emphasis on the report card."

Changing the report cards to four times a year would mean parents would get updates about every nine weeks. The district said that would give parents and schools more time to respond to student needs in between each reporting period.

The potential change is only being looked at on the elementary and middle school level, in part because different high schools operate on different schedules, Branham said. For instance, four grading periods wouldn't work very well for a school on a trimester schedule.

What do you think? Did you take the survey? Should JCPS make this change?
