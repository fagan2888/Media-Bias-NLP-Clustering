Campbell\n\nAnyone who follows my Twitter feed (@ukprogressive) knows that for much of this current cycle I have been sceptical of political pollsters, even my guru Nate Silver and his fivethirtyeight.com site. Poll taking and politics have intersected in unseemly ways over the last six years. These polls now overtly reflect the bias of the political leanings of the poll taking organisation rendering much of the data we see meaningless. Simply, if worded correctly, one can get a poll to produce whatever result one wishes. Except polling fiction has been exposed over the last 20-months with alarming regularity.\n\nIn contests across the USA, politicians have been blindsided by their internal poll takers. None more so than Mitt Romney in 2012, who was convinced he was headed to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue by his internal pollsters. The worst tough was the recent \u2018surprise\u2019 loss in his primary by Majority Leader Eric Kantor. All of this leads me to believe the current conventional wisdom figures asserting with 55-65% certainty that the Republicans will take control of the US Senate in November\u2026 equally meaningless.\n\nThe Republican/GOP/Tea Party crazies will be out in full swing over the next 67 days threatening to shut down the government over any Immigration pronouncement by the White House and their threat to Impeach President Obama. House members for whom you consistently hear the Bugs Bunny Looney Tunes theme song playing in the background when they speak, Steve King, Louie Gohmert, Michelle Bachmann, former member Allan West and Tea Party Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, will ringlead this \u201cwe just can\u2019t help ourselves from speaking crazy\u2019 caucus.\n\nAdd in federal indictments on 2012 Iowa Caucuses bribes and the recent Texas indictment of Rick Perry (something the MSM fails to report was brought by a Republican appointed prosecution team), and blatantly bald faced lying party leaders will lead the electorate to tire of rote talking points. Indeed if Chris Jansing were to instead take over the moderator\u2019s chair of NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, they might actually be called to task on their nonsense, live on national TV. Why are they not currently called on their rubbish? The MSM desperately need memes to push during low turnout midterm elections.\n\nMy own prognostication history is pretty solid. I got Missouri wrong in the Presidential election of 2008 by 5,000 votes. That cost me a 100% clean sheet in that election. I then only blew North Carolina in 2012. So my current prediction is the Democrats lose four seats but control the Senate chamber 53-47 keeping seats in red states Alaska, Iowa, Louisiana and North Carolina. Here are my ten reasons why the Democrats will maintain control of the Senate.\n\n1. The Democratic \u2018ground game\u2019 vs. the GOP\n\nThe GOP announced with some fanfare they were spending $100 million dollars on get out the vote efforts. The key word is \u2018spending\u2019 as in trying to buy voter\u2019s love. As the Beatles famously intoned, \u2018Can\u2019t Buy Me Love.\u2019 The Dems will spend a similar amount but they know where every Democratic voter lives because of their superior data mining infrastructure. Their poll \u2018workers\u2019 are volunteers whose passion drives them to bring people to the polls. The GOP has a long history of failed local and state party machines that cannot deliver voters on Election Day because their people will only work if paid to, an example of trickle-down capitalism, at its very best.\n\n2. The Do-Nothing Congress\n\nEvery August for the last seven years candidate, then President Barack Obama, has had a miserable month of news and noise from the opposition Tea Party Town Halls. This year Gaza and ISIS kept the local crazies out of the headlines. And yet every year, just after Labor Day, the President goes on the attack and snatches victory from the jaws of MSM media predicted \u2018certain defeat.\u2019 Now with two years left, he has nothing to lose, so all fire will be aimed at the \u2018least productive Congress in history.\u2019 Whether scared Democrats want to see him on the trail with them or not, his is still the most powerful bully pulpit in the world. His tan suit Friday interrupted Ellen Degeneris\u2019 show, that is real power. Congress\u2019 continued failure to take action on behalf of jobs, wages, infrastructure, roadways, immigration\u2026 will seal the deal for Senate Democrats and in several close House races.\n\n3. The Minority Report: Mitch\u2019s Kentucky woes\n\nThe Minority Leader has had numerous challenges from a very strong Alison Lundgren Grimes. Every poll has them within the margin of error, something the very powerful Senior Senator from Kentucky is very worried about. Grimes\u2019 messaging supporting Kentucky\u2019s workers, Governor Basheer\u2019s enthusiastic embrace of Obamacare and 300,000+ Kentuckians getting healthcare for the first time resonates with likely voters. The news last week that premiums across the state could decrease by 2% next year was not good news for Mitch McConnell who fought to defeat Obamacare for six years. Add in his \u2018off the cuff\u2019 remarks to billionaires saying he and a GOP Senate would take care of them and his name in a growing Iowa Caucus bribery scandal, could lead to a very rough period for the Minority Leader.\n\n4. Republicans when arrogant/confident make mistakes\n\nMy Republican friends have been arrogantly and cockily predicting they would cut the legs out from under President Obama for almost six years. As the President\u2019s approval rating dipped to around 40% (something that has happened in every second term presidency from Reagan to Clinton to Bush), the President can be excused for using Mark Twain\u2019s misquote: \u201creports of my death are greatly exaggerated.\u201d RNC Chair Reince Preibus has looked giddy on television but\u2026 his fightbacks have been false talking point quotes repeated over and over again on FOX News. There are increasing signs the American public is on to this non-strategy strategy and it could backfire with independents who are eager to see something accomplished other than Congress suing the President; Benghazi and IRS investigations costing millions and going nowhere; and this groundless and silly impeachment drumbeat.\n\n5. Republican War on Women continues unabated\n\nNY Senator Kirsten Gilibrand wrote in her book about having her stomach grabbed by a male colleague and told, \u201cdon\u2019t lose too much weight, I like my women with a bit more on their bones.\u201d This Mad Men approach to women\u2019s reproductive freedoms, birth control, rape (Todd Akin: \u201ca woman\u2019s body can just shut that down\u201d), equal pay, forced transvaginal ultrasounds, and the elimination of women\u2019s health clinics across the USA have had a accumulative effect on the Republican Party. They brush off 51% of the electorate in their boys club but the women of America are livid that 50 years of progress are being wiped out by this party and the Supreme Court.\n\n6. Romneying Georgia\u2019s GOP\n\nConventional wisdom is Georgia is a SOLID Red State. But no one counted on running against former Senator Sam Nunn\u2019s daughter. Michelle is running a smart, focused campaign against financier David Purdue. What makes the race interesting are recent adverts portraying Purdue as an out-of-touch financier profiting from the woes of workers.\n\nThese adverts are very similar to the anti-Romney adverts about vulture capitalism at Bain that destroyed his Presidential candidacy.\n\nCould the same happen in Georgia?\n\n7. Arkansas, Obamacare and Pig Castration\n\nDemocratic Senator Mark Pryor is in the fight of his life in another presumably safe Red State. The GOP/Tea Party nominated perpetual gaffe machine State Senator Joni Ernst who was caught on tape suggesting the abolition of the minimum wage and was sketchy on her promise to protect Social Security, even though the GOP plans to convert it to a voucher system. This Tea Party darling was made famous by her pig castration advert in the primary.\n\nWhat makes this campaign interesting is that unlike most democrats who run away, incumbent Democratic Senator Mark Pryor is also openly embracing Obamacare in his campaign.\n\nJust like Republican attempts to defeat Majority Leader Harry Reid with Tea Party candidate Sharon (\u2018second amendment remedies\u2019) Engel, it\u2019s just a matter of time or soundbites before Ernst hangs herself.\n\n8. Hagan and Landrieu find a way to win by 6 votes\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s Republican Governor and the legislature\u2019s radically conservative agenda are incredibly unpopular in this purple state that voted FOR President Obama in 2008, but against him in 2012. The Landrieu family of New Orleans has a long history of wining VERY close elections in Red State Louisiana. Conventional wisdom is both Hagan and Landrieu will lose and yet\u2026 they always seem to find a way. I predict they will this time as well.\n\n9. Begich, Palin and the Dans\n\nAlaska has long been a state of controversy. A Red state by nature, in what seemed to be an anti-Sarah Palin backlash, they elected Democrat Mark Begich to the US Senate the year she ran with John McCain. This race is the most expensive per vote in the nation due to the low number of voters spread across a huge state. They seem ready to send Begich home. But with two Dan Sullivans on the ballot, the confusion factor coupled with a lingering distrust and hatred of Sister Sarah seems to indicate victory for Begich is not out of the question. One thing we can count on\u2026 in Alaska, the Republicans always overplay their hand, no matter how weak it is.\n\n10. They\u2019ve come to bury Hillary and Barack not praise them\n\nA lesson still to be learned by all political parties is it is not enough to just be against someone, you have to stand for something and be prepared to govern. Hatred of George W. Bush did not lead to wins for either Al Gore or John Kerry. The same can be said for John McCain and Mitt Romney. The GOP\u2019s Achilles Heel is its abject hatred of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. But as they fail to learn, you cannot govern if your agenda is to simply be blindly against the other candidate without ever offering a real alternative.\n\nThe American electorate is tired of the dysfunction and lack of work from this Congress. This is the biggest problem facing the Republican/GOP/Tea Party and why popping champagne corks is very premature, no matter what so-called \u2018expert pollsters\u2019 say!\n\nFasten your seatbelts. It\u2019s gonna be a bumpy ride to 04 November.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is The Monday Line by Denis G.
