Andrew Cuomo-led legislated action.\n\nBoth Ticonderoga and Hague residents are expected to see a 1.1 percent increase in the estimated tax rate per $1,000 of assessed property value (see box).\n\n\u201cI think the state needs to take a look at the tax cap formula,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cA lot of the expenses in our budget we have very little or no control over, like Affordable Care Act fees. We received a reduction in ERS and TRS (retirement system), but because of that they are not accounting those as an exemption in the tax cap.\u201d\n\nDespite the struggles, McDonald said the district was able to get some additions into the budget, including a new teacher in the middle school, a four-station lift system in the bus garage.\n\nSome of the additions come, in part, to the savings the district expects to see as it transitions to solar power.\n\n\u201cWe are estimating $30,000 in savings from solar, but it will be based on how soon we are able to get onto the new grid,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cWe also saw some savings in fuel over the past year.\u201d\n\nMcDonald said enrollment will remain about even between the 2015-16 and 16-17 school years, but there is an increase in special education services, which will cause a pinch on the budget.\n\n\u201cOur increase in special education exceeds what our state aid increased by,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cFull aid for special education students comes the following year, so you run into a cash flow problem.\u201d\n\nTiconderoga Central School 2016/17 School budget report\n\nAppropriations (What they spend)\n\n2015-16 $19,665,971\n\n2016-17 $20,114290\n\nDifference $448,319\n\n%-Change 2.28%\n\nRevenue (What they earn)\n\n2015-16 $8,522,849\n\n2016-17 $8,884,222\n\nDifference $321,373\n\n%-Change 3.77%\n\nState Aid received\n\n2015-16 $7,128,425\n\n2016-17 $7,222,824\n\nDifference $94,399\n\n%-Change 1.32%\n\nFund balance Used on gap\n\n2015-16 $324,424\n\n2016-17 $471,398\n\nDifference $146,974\n\n%-Change 45.30%\n\nTax levy (Your portion)\n\n2015-16 $11,143,122\n\n2016-17 $11,270,068\n\nDifference $126,946\n\n%-Change 1.14%\n\nTax rate - Ti * per$1k assessed\n\n2015-16 $10.339\n\n2016-17 $10.487\n\nDifference $0.12\n\n%-Change 1.1%\n\nTax rate - Hague * per$1k assessed\n\n2015-16 $12.939\n\n2016-17 $13.086\n\nDifference $0.15\n\n%-Change 1.1%\n\n* 2016/17 tax rates are estimated with a new assessment role due July 1.\n\nBudget Public Hearing\n\nThe public hearing on the adopted 2015/16 school budget will take place Tuesday, May 10, at 7 p.m. in the school cafeteria.\n\nB.O.E. election\n\nThree 3-year terms with three candidates:\n\nMark Russell (inc.), Tracy Cross-Baker (inc.), Marissa Palandrani\n\nTo be voted on May 17 with budget\n\nBudget vote\n\nThe vote on the 2016/17 school budget, along with school board and referendums, will take place Tuesday, May 17, from noon until 8 p.m. at the school and Hague Community Center.\n\nReferendums\n\nNone", "article_metadata": {"description": "TICONDEROGA \u2014 Superintendent Dr. John McDonald said what many school administrators and number-crunchers are thinking when it comes to the 2016-17 budget.", "generator": "Metro Publisher (www.metropublisher.com)", "og": {"site_name": "Sun Community News & Printing", "description": "TICONDEROGA \u2014 Superintendent Dr. John McDonald said what many school administrators and number-crunchers are thinking when it comes to the 2016-17 budget.", "title": "Ticonderoga budget at the state levy line", "url": "http://www.suncommunitynews.com/api/content/4fd6677a-0c81-11e6-a694-22000b078648/", "image": "http://www.suncommunitynews.com/downloads/46517/download/Ti_school.jpg?cb=eb393750c9b452297cb4eac7c191085d", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@suncmtynews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@suncmtynews"}, "keywords": "New York,Education & Learning,Headline Story,Keith Lobdell,Ticonderoga,School Taxes,Gov.
