Dolly, the Denver Zoo’s 7,000-pound, 51-year-old, female Asian elephant got to kick off this year’s Boo at the Zoo celebration Saturday by smashing a 450-pound pumpkin.

Giant pumpkin hobbyist Brian Deevy donated the big gourd, which was stuffed with Dolly’s favorite treats — romaine lettuce and biscuits made of grasses, vitamins and grains that look like dog biscuits.

This year, Boo at the Zoo will offer two weekends of Halloween fun. The event, which continues Sunday and Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, is free with regular zoo admission. It offers more than 25 trick-or-treat stations, creepy-crawly animal demonstrations and pumpkin carving demonstrations.

For traditionalists who prefer things that go bump in the night, the zoo also offers Boo After Dark, an after-hours event for $17 for adults and $12 for children from 6:30-9 p.m. Oct. 30 and 31. Children 2 and under are admitted free. The Denver Post
