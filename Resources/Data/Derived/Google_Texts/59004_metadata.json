This small plastic device, which is inserted into the vagina, works for three weeks at a time by releasing hormones similar to those used by birth control pills. She said her insurer told her she would be responsible for her contraceptive expenses unless she chooses an oral generic birth control pill. The NuvaRing costs between $15 and $80 a month, according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nUnder the health law, health plans have to cover the full range of FDA-approved birth control methods without any cost sharing by women, unless the plan falls into a limited number of categories that are excluded, either because it\u2019s grandfathered under the law or it\u2019s for is a religious employer or house of worship. Following the recent Supreme Court decision in the Hobby Lobby case, some private employers that have religious objections to providing birth control coverage as a free preventive benefit will also be excused from the requirement.\n\nIn addition, the federal government has given plans some flexibility by allowing them to use \"reasonable medical management techniques\" to keep their costs under control. So if there is both a generic and a brand-name version of a birth-control pill available, for example, a plan could decide to cover only the generic version without cost to the patient.\n\nAs for the NuvaRing, even though they may use the same hormones, the pill and the ring are different methods of birth control. As an official from the federal Department of Health and Human Services said in an email, \"The pill, the ring and the patch are different types of hormonal methods \u2026 It is not permissible to cover only the pill, but not the ring or the patch.\"\n\nGuidance from the federal government clearly states that the full range of FDA-approved methods of birth control must be covered as a preventive benefit without cost sharing. That includes birth control pills, the ring or patch, intrauterine devices and sterilization, among others.\n\nBut despite federal guidance, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen this happen, plenty,\u201d says Adam Sonfield, a senior public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and education organization. \u201cClearly insurance companies think things are ambiguous enough that they can get away with it.\u201d\n\nIf you are denied coverage, your defense is to appeal the decision, and get your state insurance department involved.\n\n\u201cThe state has the right and responsibility to enforce this law,\u201d says Sonfield.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Provided by Kaiser Health News.\n\nHow much leeway do employers and insurers have in deci...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-08-23 10:25:49 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Provided by Kaiser Health News.\n\nHow much leeway do employers and insurers have in deci...", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/birth-control-obamacare-mandate_n_5699234.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1980034/images/o-BIRTH-CONTROL-PILLS-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1980034/images/o-BIRTH-CONTROL-PILLS-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "site": "@HuffPostBiz", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Provided by Kaiser Health News.\n\nHow much leeway do employers and insurers have in deci..."}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-22 10:25:49 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5699234", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "business", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Nuva Ring,obamacare birth control mandate,hobby lobby,obamacare,obamacare birth control,birth control pills", "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "Nuva Ring,obamacare birth control mandate,hobby lobby,obamacare,obamacare birth control,birth control pills", "published_time": "2014-08-22 10:25:49 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-08-22 10:59:06 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb63b\"", "article_summary": "She said her insurer told her she would be responsible for her contraceptive expenses unless she chooses an oral generic birth control pill.\nKaiser Health News readers still write in regularly describing battles they\u2019re waging to get the birth control coverage they\u2019re entitled to.\nThis small plastic device, which is inserted into the vagina, works for three weeks at a time by releasing hormones similar to those used by birth control pills.\nThat includes birth control pills, the ring or patch, intrauterine devices and sterilization, among others.\nAs for the NuvaRing, even though they may use the same hormones, the pill and the ring are different methods of birth control."}
