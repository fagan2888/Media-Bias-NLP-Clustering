He could be sworn in as early as the Monday after next.\n\nIn McKinney, Branch\u2019s early lead in District 4 held out. He won by six points after all precincts were counted.\n\nTracy Rath\u2019s big lead in the at-large district held too. Rath will join the city council with a 20 point victory.\n\n\n\nUpdate 8:30 p.m. About half Irving\u2019s precincts are counted, and Putnam is winning the election day vote\u2014just barely, and not nearly enough to make up for the blow he took in early voting.\n\nAs it stands, Riddle\u2019s share has barely shrunk to 58 percent.\n\nNothing new to report in Collin County.\n\nIf you\u2019re following the Wylie City Council runoff, Candy Arrington is running away with it with 57 percent of the early vote.\n\nUpdate 7 p.m. with early voting results:\n\n\n\nEarly voting results (everything but ballots cast today) are in, and two races may already be decided.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over. The voters wanted change,\u201d said Irving City Council member Putnam after learning he was down nearly 20 points to Phil Riddle in the runoff.\n\nWith turnout so low, that amounts to a gap of fewer than 200 votes, but Putnam sees no way to make it up.\n\nPutnam said he thinks the anonymously funded attack ads hurt him, though they weren\u2019t the only factor. He thinks Riddle will make a fine council member.\n\nIn the McKinney races, Tracy Rath looks like a clear winner for the at-large seat, with 60 percent of the early vote over Campbell.\n\nAnd despite news of his arrests, Branch is edging out Ruiz with 52 percent of the early vote for District 4.\n\nIn the Collin College race, Jim Orr has about 4 points on Collin Kennedy.\n\nOriginal post:\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s election day! Again!\n\nNot sure if the exclamation points are warranted. Turnout in May\u2019s joint elections was dismal, and if history is any guide even fewer people will vote in today\u2019s runoffs to settle a few races where no candidate took a majority of votes.\n\nThat said, all elections are important. And we\u2019ve got two suburban races that have been more interesting than par.\n\nWatch this post for updates throughout the night\u2014the first probably in just a few minutes once polls close and early voting numbers are announced.\n\nAnd for the non-suburban (i.e., Dallas) runoffs, check our Dallas City Hall blog.\n\nIrving\n\nCouncil member Joe Putnam will try to hold south Irving\u2019s District 4 seat against retired firefighter Phil Riddle.\n\nA former mayor, Putnam has spent decades in Irving politics, but Riddle captured a slightly larger share of the vote in May\u2019s four-way election.\n\nWhile both candidates have run mild campaigns, a nonprofit linked to national political advisors has been flooding mailboxes with anonymously funded attack ads against Putnam\u2014a practice known by critics as \u201cdark money,\u201d rarely seen outside federal races.\n\nRiddle said he doesn\u2019t know who is paying for the attacks, and told voters that they \u201cdo not reflect my opinion of my opponent.\u201d\n\nMcKinney\n\nBill Campbell and Tracy Rath, who took the lion\u2019s share of vote in May\u2019s crowded election, are vying for McKinney\u2019s at-large council seat.\n\nMeanwhile, businessman Chuck Branch and engineer Pablo Ruiz face off for the District 4 seat.\n\nBranch finished 15 percentage points ahead of Ruiz in May\u2019s election. But since then, a local watchdog group revealed that Ruiz Branch had been arrested in the 1990s for misdeameanor crimes including driving while intoxicated.\n\nIn other races, Collin Kennedy and Jim Orr are seeking the Place 7 seat on the Collin College board of trustees.\n\nAnd in Wylie, Bennie Jones and Candy Arrington are running for the Place 4 seat on the City Council.\n\nStaff writer Wendey Hundley contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA2L2ZlaXN0eS1zdWJ1cmJhbi1jb3VuY2lsLXJ1bm9mZnMtd3JhcC11cC1pbi1pcnZpbmctYW5kLW1ja2lubmV5Lmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Avi Selk", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Update 8:45 p.m. The Irving and McKinney races are over.
