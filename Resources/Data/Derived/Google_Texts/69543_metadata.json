I would eliminate nearly every special-interest loophole. The plan also eliminates the payroll tax on workers and several federal taxes outright, including gift and estate taxes, telephone taxes, and all duties and tariffs.\u201d\n\nThe first $50,000 earned by a family of four would be exempt from taxation under the Paul plan. Additionally, the 14.5 percent rate would apply to all business income as well, replacing the 35 percent rate currently in place, which is higher than the rates in virtually all other developed countries.\n\nPaul says that he developed his plan in consultation with the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Stephen Moore, former presidential candidate Steve Forbes and Reagan administration economist Arthur Laffer, who are, depending on whom you ask, either an All-Star team of conservative economic thinkers, or a rogues gallery of charlatans peddling tax policy snake oil.\n\nThe Paul plan has more than a few holes that will have to be filled in with specific details. For instance, it completely eliminates payroll taxes, which among other things fund huge (and hugely popular) entitlement programs including Social Security and Medicare.\n\nRelated: Where Clinton, Sanders, and O\u2019Malley Stand on the Issues\n\nAlso, there\u2019s the matter of the $2 trillion in federal revenue that would be lost under the Paul plan.\n\nNot to worry, the Kentucky senator says.\n\n\u201cWe asked the experts at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation to estimate what this plan would mean for jobs, and whether we are raising enough money to fund the government. The analysis is positive news: The plan is an economic steroid injection. Because the Fair and Flat Tax rewards work, saving, investment and small business creation, the Tax Foundation estimates that in 10 years it will increase gross domestic product by about 10 percent, and create at least 1.4 million new jobs.\u201d\n\nThe Tax Foundation, while nominally non-partisan, is generally seen as a right-leaning think tank with a bias toward business-friendly tax cuts.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Gotta Trump: The Donald Is in for 2016\n\nAnd, as with virtually any candidate\u2019s promise to slash Americans\u2019 tax burden, the Paul plan comes with assurances that any budgetary shortfalls will be made up unspecified spending cuts to be proposed later.\n\nPaul also notes that some Americans may be bothered by the transition away from a system of progressive taxation. That is, away from a system where the wealthy pay a higher share of their income in taxes than the poor do. Paul\u2019s system would largely do away with that distinction for most of the U.S. middle class.\n\nYes, Paul admits, the wealthy will get a huge tax cut if his plan is implemented, and will pay the same marginal rate as everyone else. However, he offers:\n\n\u201c[M]ost of the loopholes in the tax code were designed by the rich and politically connected. Though the rich will pay a lower rate along with everyone else, they won\u2019t have special provisions to avoid paying lower than 14.5%.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s likely to be cold comfort to the janitor paying the same marginal tax rate as the CEO whose office he\u2019s cleaning, but of the two, the janitor isn\u2019t really Paul\u2019s audience here.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Kentucky senator and Republican presidential hopeful Rand Paul announced today that he would take up the mantle of former presidential candidate Steve Forbes and pursue the \u201cnoble cause\u201d of replacing the U.S. tax code with a one-size-fits-all \u201cflat tax\u201d of 14.5 percent.", "title": "Rand Paul \u2018s Plan: \u2018Blow Up the Tax Code\u2019 for a 14.5% Flat Tax", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/19/Rand-Paul-s-Plan-Blow-Tax-Code-145-Flat-Tax", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04192013_randpaul_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/19/Rand-Paul-s-Plan-Blow-Tax-Code-145-Flat-Tax", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04192013_randpaul_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Kentucky senator and Republican presidential hopeful Rand Paul announced today that he would take up the mantle of former presidential candidate Steve Forbes and pursue the \u201cnoble cause\u201d of replacing the U.S. tax code with a one-size-fits-all \u201cflat tax\u201d of 14.5 percent.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Paul plan has more than a few holes that will have to be filled in with specific details.\nRelated: Where Clinton, Sanders, and O\u2019Malley Stand on the IssuesAlso, there\u2019s the matter of the $2 trillion in federal revenue that would be lost under the Paul plan.\nKentucky senator and Republican presidential hopeful Rand Paul announced today that he would take up the mantle of former presidential candidate Steve Forbes and pursue the \u201cnoble cause\u201d of replacing the U.S. tax code with a one-size-fits-all \u201cflat tax\u201d of 14.5 percent.\n\u201cWe asked the experts at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation to estimate what this plan would mean for jobs, and whether we are raising enough money to fund the government.\nBecause the Fair and Flat Tax rewards work, saving, investment and small business creation, the Tax Foundation estimates that in 10 years it will increase gross domestic product by about 10 percent, and create at least 1.4 million new jobs.\u201dThe Tax Foundation, while nominally non-partisan, is generally seen as a right-leaning think tank with a bias toward business-friendly tax cuts."}
