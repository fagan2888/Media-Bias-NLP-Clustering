Bobby Jindal ready to take Iowa State Fair stage Saturday\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal ready to take Iowa State Fair stage Saturday\n\nLouisiana may be known for its many festivals, but here in Iowa, it\u2019s all about the State Fair.\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal is set to take the Iowa State Fair soapbox stage Saturday, with hopes of wooing a crowd of Iowa caucusgoers on the fair\u2019s final Saturday.\n\nJindal, 44, is one of the last presidential candidates to take the all-important fair stage this week, and a big showing at the fair could give Jindal an opportunity to set himself apart from the crowded pack aiming for the GOP nomination.\n\nThe fair has played host to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; neurosurgeon Ben Carson, of Maryland; U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, of Florida; and other Republican heavyweights in recent days.\n\nFor the uninitiated: The Iowa State Fair is a lot like a regular fair \u2014 but on steroids.\n\nThe fairground stretches on for what seems like miles: bright lights flashing, children running about and vendors handing out swag touting Iowa\u2019s corn and pork industries, among others.\n\nAnd politics is always a big feature at one of the biggest events in the state that hosts the nation\u2019s first presidential primary caucuses.\n\nNext year\u2019s Iowa caucuses start Feb. 1. Jindal has spent a lot of time in Iowa since formally launching his campaign for president June 24 and is betting that a surprise showing here could catapult his campaign. He\u2019s scheduled to continue on the Iowa campaign trail with more town hall meetings next week, following a two-day trip that took him to New Hampshire, South Carolina and Ohio earlier this week.\n\nLagging in polls on the crowded Republican presidential slate, Jindal has made Iowa central to his strategy toward boosting his standing in the GOP contest.\n\nAt the fair, attendees mingle on the grounds, sipping from oversized cups of lemonade \u2014 or oversized beers, in many cases \u2014 and munching on various foods served on wooden skewers and acquired from bright, flashing trailers.\n\nOn Thursday, the scent of fried foods \u2014 mixed with a faint whiff of livestock on display \u2014 hung in the air, despite a non-Louisiana cool August breeze.\n\nThe fair boasts some 70 foods served on sticks \u2014 everything from fried peanut butter sandwich on a stick to chocolate-covered deep-fried cheesecake on a stick.\n\nJindal has made no secret of his love of junk food \u2014 going so far to say in a recent interview that his first official meal as president would be nachos, if he could pick anything. He gave The Advocate several recommendations for fair food, too.\n\n\u201cYou can eat deep-fried anything,\u201d he said in Iowa earlier this week, specifically giving a shoutout to deep-fried butter on a stick as a must-try.\n\nHe also plugged the many bacon-wrapped goodies you can find at the fair \u2014 from the Ultimate Bacon Brisket Bomb, which won top honors in the fair food contest this year, to a double-bacon corn dog.\n\nBut he said he was hoping to try a pork chop on a stick this go-around.\n\nJindal\u2019s speech Saturday will immediately follow New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another Republican running for president, and Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz speaks earlier in the morning.\n\nTexas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz was the only presidential candidate to speak at the fair on Friday. He planned a \u201creligious freedom\u201d rally attended by thousands in downtown Des Moines later that evening.\n\nIn recent days \u2014 both in Iowa and on other stops outside Louisiana \u2014 Jindal has made a point to take specific aim at Walker, a candidate who once led the polls in Iowa but has since begun lagging behind real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump.\n\nThat likely will come up again in his fair speech Saturday. Candidates are given 20 minutes to speak in an area on the main concourse.\n\nAt an event in Ohio on Thursday, Jindal took aim at many of his GOP rivals, attempting to set himself apart from the pack.\n\nBy many accounts from the event, Jindal stole the show at the Americans for Prosperity-hosted Defending the American Dream Summit.\n\nWalker\u2019s campaign released an Affordable Care Act alternative plan earlier this week, and Jindal, who released his own health care proposal last year, quickly took issue with it. Both Jindal and Walker have been looking to Iowa to boost their chances of winning the GOP\u2019s nomination for president next year.\n\n\u201c(Walker\u2019s) plan would likely cost over $1 trillion, and he does not indicate how he would pay for it, which of course is the Washington way,\u201d Jindal told the summit crowd.\n\nHe took a more veiled aim at other GOP hopefuls.\n\n\u201cWhen did we decide to quit fighting for our conservative ideals? When did we throw in the towel? I didn\u2019t get the memo on that. Conservative ideals haven\u2019t died out here in America \u2026 but they are dead in Washington,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Elizabeth Crisp on Twitter, @elizabethcrisp.
