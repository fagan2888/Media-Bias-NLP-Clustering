One in every 691 babies in the United States is born with Down Syndrome, according to the National Down Syndrome Society.

There's a non-profit in KAKEland that helps families understand the diagnosis. The Down Syndrome Society of Wichita will help people of any age with Down Syndrome.

One way it does so is with a basket filled with books and toys that help families understand how to live with the diagnosis and not let it define them.

Interim Director Rebecca McCualey can relate to families. She's a parent of a child with Down Syndrome as well.

"I remember what I felt like when I got the diagnosis, and then to be able to help other families go through that, it's a really rewarding experience," said McCauley.

McCauley says the $500 grant from KAKEland and the DeVaughn James Injury Lawyers will go to train KAKEland physicians how to better give a diagnosis.

"It's not good to just go in and break the news, it's nice to give the parents some information and background before you do that," McCauley said.
