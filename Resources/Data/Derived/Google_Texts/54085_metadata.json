But the knee started acting up on the first day of Organized Team Activity in May and Dreessen, 31, wound up having two surgeries before the start of the regular season.\n\nThe injury, and emergence of Julius Thomas, limited Dreessen to just seven catches this past season and he was inactive from the Broncos\u2019 three postseason games.\n\nThat\u2019s no way to bow out. Dreessen wants a ninth NFL season.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly it,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, being inactive for the postseason was exceptionally disappointing. I want to find a way to have a more permanent role on this team and get one more year in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Joel Dreessen hopes knee surgery will provide one more year", "title": "Joel Dreessen hopes knee surgery will provide one more year", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/19/joel-dreessen-hopes-knee-surgery-will-provide-one-more-year/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140219_095700_joel-dreessen.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140219_095700_joel-dreessen.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-19T09:54:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:32:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd27b\"", "article_summary": "Joel Dreessen has enjoyed too good an NFL career to have it end from the sidelines.\nThe extent of the surgery will likely be determined as the Broncos\u2019 medical staff gathers at the NFL scouting combine this week in Indianapolis.\nI want to find a way to have a more permanent role on this team and get one more year in.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through the stages of getting various opinions on what the best course of action is for me to contribute in 2014,\u201d Dreessen said.\nThe injury, and emergence of Julius Thomas, limited Dreessen to just seven catches this past season and he was inactive from the Broncos\u2019 three postseason games."}
