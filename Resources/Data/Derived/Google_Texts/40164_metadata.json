In 2003, she was convicted of laundering money in New Jersey and placed on probation.\n\nNot long after, she became a labor broker.\n\nBy 2007, Navarro was operating a Los Angeles-based business called Universal Placement International. She recruited Filipino teachers for her American clients.\n\nNothing in U.S. Department of Labor regulations would have disqualified Navarro from working as a labor broker.\n\nHer criminal history came to light only after some of the Filipino teachers she recruited filed a class-action lawsuit against her in California court.\n\nReached by Reuters, Navarro declined to comment.\n\nMairi Nunag-Tanedo, 40, one of the victims, was outraged that Navarro had been able to establish a legitimate brokering practice despite her criminal past. When Nunag-Tanedo was recruited by Navarro, she said she assumed that brokers \u2013 especially one employed by a school district -- must have been vetted by authorities before being allowed to recruit.\n\n\u201cIt made me angry,\u201d said Nunag-Tanedo, who has remained in the United States on a visa for victims of human trafficking. \u201cShouldn\u2019t there be background checks of these people? We thought, \u2018Wow, if this can happen here, what else can happen?\u2019 \u201d\n\n(Edited by Blake Morrison.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sometimes, workers who are recruited for temporary jobs in Americ", "title": "Despite what some workers believe, U.S. government doesn't vet brokers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/19/Despite-what-some-workers-believe-US-government-doesnt-vet-brokers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/workers-brokers_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/19/Despite-what-some-workers-believe-US-government-doesnt-vet-brokers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/workers-brokers_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sometimes, workers who are recruited for temporary jobs in Americ", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "She recruited Filipino teachers for her American clients.\nHer criminal history came to light only after some of the Filipino teachers she recruited filed a class-action lawsuit against her in California court.\nMairi Nunag-Tanedo, 40, one of the victims, was outraged that Navarro had been able to establish a legitimate brokering practice despite her criminal past.\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Sometimes, workers who are recruited for temporary jobs in America assume that the U.S. government has vetted and is vouching for the brokers who help secure the visas.\nWe thought, \u2018Wow, if this can happen here, what else can happen?\u2019 \u201d(Edited by Blake Morrison.)"}
