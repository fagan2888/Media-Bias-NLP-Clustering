The first is access. Online education allows students around the world to learn from recognized leaders in higher education, regardless of where they live. Online courses, like MOOCs, are challenging the foundations of traditional education institutions. With the cost of college prohibitively high in the U.S. and nearly half of our nation\u2019s youth unsure that their college education has improved their chances of finding a job (McKinsey), access to free online courses provides another avenue for students and the unemployed to acquire and/or upgrade their skills as they look for employment. The second advantage is adaptability. The very nature of online education allows it to quickly adjust to the ever changing needs of industry. Online education companies like Udacity, have formed partnerships not only with traditional education institutions, but also with businesses. For example, Udacity recently formed a partnership with AT&T and Georgia Tech for a Master\u2019s degree in Computer Science\u2013for only $7,000. This ability to quickly bring new courses to students can help ensure that they are being trained in the latest technologies that are required in the workplace.\n\nBy providing access and speed to market, this new learning environment will ultimately change the business model for higher education overall.\n\nEric Spiegel (@ericspiegel) is the president and CEO of Siemens USA and the author of the 2009 book \u201cEnergy Shift: Game-changing Options for Fueling the Future.\u201d\n\nRead the related article.\n\nRead the latest Leadership Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "There are two major advantages to the online education business model.", "title": "MOOCs Will Change the University Business Model", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/10/12/moocs-will-change-the-university-business-model/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "MOOCs Will Change the University Business Model", "description": "There are two major advantages to the online education business model.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "There are two major advantages to the online education business model.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-12T14:52:29-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/10/12/moocs-will-change-the-university-business-model/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-1194", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "There are two major advantages to the online education business model.", "title": "MOOCs Will Change the University Business Model", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/10/12/moocs-will-change-the-university-business-model/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-1194", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-12T14:56:56-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6146\"", "article_summary": "ERIC SPIEGEL: There are two major advantages to the online education business model.\nBy providing access and speed to market, this new learning environment will ultimately change the business model for higher education overall.\nOnline courses, like MOOCs, are challenging the foundations of traditional education institutions.\nOnline education allows students around the world to learn from recognized leaders in higher education, regardless of where they live.\nOnline education companies like Udacity, have formed partnerships not only with traditional education institutions, but also with businesses."}
