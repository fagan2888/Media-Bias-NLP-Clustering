From the Washington Examiner:

AARP, the nation’s leading senior citizen lobby group, said it was “deeply disappointed” by the Obama administration’s new rules for employer-run workplace wellness programs. The lobby group said the rules “violate both the letter and the spirit” of civil rights laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and indicated it would likely challenge them in court.
