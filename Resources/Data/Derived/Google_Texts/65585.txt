BAY SHORE, N.Y. (AP) - A man and his two young children were killed early Sunday when another vehicle rear-ended their car on Long Island and caused a fiery crash, police said.

The mother of the family survived.

Ancio Ostane, 37, of Queens, and his children were Andy, 8, and Sephora, 4, were killed in the crash at 1:30 a.m. on the Southern State Parkway in Bay Shore.

Newsday reports (http://nwsdy.li/1eTPvK1) they were returning home from a barbecue in Central Islip.

The driver of the other car, Oneil Sharpe Jr., of Queens, was later arrested on charges of driving while intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident.

It wasn’t clear if Sharpe had an attorney who could comment on the charges.

Newsday says Ostane’s wife, Lucnie Bouaz-Ostane, was joined by other family members at her home later Sunday.

“I want my family back,” she said. “All I want is my family back.”

Bouaz-Ostane said she was not injured in the crash but was unable to help her family.
