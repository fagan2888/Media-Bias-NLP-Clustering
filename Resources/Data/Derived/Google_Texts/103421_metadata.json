But a gap persists. NerdWallet analyzed the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau to compare the median earnings of male full-time workers with the amount that female full-time workers make for all industries. We found that women take home about 80 cents for every $1 that men earn.\n\nHowever, in some cities, women make nearly as much as, if not more than, men. To identify these places, NerdWallet examined data for 529 U.S. cities and ranked them based on the environment for working women.\n\nOur analysis factors in 2014 census data on women\u2019s earnings and labor force participation rate, as well as the cost of living by examining rent costs. It also includes the average 2015 unemployment rate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nIndustry makes a difference. Scan the top 10 list, and you\u2019ll see a common thread: opportunities for women in health care and education at hospital systems and universities. This makes sense, given that a disproportionate number of women work in these fields.\n\nRelated: Is Your Workplace Too Hot or Too Cold? Men and Women Can't Agree\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau\u2019s 2014 American Community Survey, women hold 78.4% of jobs in the health care and social assistance industry, in workplaces such as physicians\u2019 offices, hospitals and rehabilitation centers. Women also work in 68.5% of jobs in educational services, which includes positions in schools, colleges and trade schools.\n\nIn a few cities, women earn more than men. In 17 of the 529 cities analyzed, women\u2019s median earnings were higher than men\u2019s earnings. Three of those cities also saw high scores for women in other measures and made our top 10. These cities include Durham, North Carolina; Skokie, Illinois; and Redwood City, California.\n\nMinnesota dominates the top 10. Rochester (No. 1), Minneapolis (No. 2) and St. Paul (No. 3) lock down the top spots in our rankings. In each city, women\u2019s median earnings are more than 90% of men\u2019s, unemployment is lower than the national average, and the cost of living is also lower than other places in our analysis.\n\nBest cities for women in the workforce 2016\n\n1. Rochester, Minnesota\n\nIn our top city, women\u2019s median earnings in 2014 were 92.3% of men\u2019s \u2014 well above the 79.8% national rate reported in the 2014 American Community Survey. Plus, women living in Rochester don\u2019t have to overspend on housing: Median monthly rent is 22.2% of monthly earnings, the lowest percentage of the top 10. For context, federal guidelines advise spending no more than 30% of gross income on housing. The Mayo Clinic is the largest employer in Rochester and in the state, according to the Rochester Area Economic Development Inc. The medical center employs more than 32,000 people in Minnesota. Other major Rochester employers include Rochester Public Schools, Olmsted Medical Center and IBM.\n\nRelated: Women Now More Likely Than Men to AchieveThis Big Life Milestone\n\n2. Minneapolis\n\nWomen\u2019s median earnings in Minneapolis were 94% of men\u2019s in 2014. And while Minneapolis is the most populous city in our top 10, with more than 400,000 residents, workers won\u2019t find big-city rents. Paying the median monthly rent in Minneapolis takes 22.4% of women\u2019s median earnings. Target is headquartered in Minneapolis and is the city\u2019s largest employer. Financial institutions including Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp and Ameriprise Financial also employ thousands of residents, according to the Minneapolis Downtown Council.\n\n3. St. Paul, Minnesota\n\nMinneapolis\u2019 twin city, St. Paul, rounds out Minnesota\u2019s domination of the top three. In St. Paul, women participate in the workforce at almost the same rate as men, lagging by only 0.6%, which suggests that the working environment is a strong one for women. On a national scale, the difference in the workforce participation rate for men and women is a full 10 percentage points. The St. Paul area is home to Fortune 500 companies such as 3M Co., Ecolab and St. Jude Medical.\n\n4. Iowa City, Iowa\n\nOf the 529 cities NerdWallet analyzed, there are 24 places where the percentage of women in the workforce is higher than the participation rate of men.

Here, women\u2019s median earnings are 101.9% of men\u2019s median earnings, compared with the national rate of 79.8%. The city\u2019s main industries are education and health care, with Duke University and its health system employing more than 35,000 people. The tech industry is a force in Durham, too.

Ann Arbor, Michigan\n\nNationwide, the workforce participation rate for women is 10 percentage points lower than that for men. In Ann Arbor, however, the difference is 3.6%.

Skokie, Illinois\n\nIn Skokie, a village of 65,000 residents about 16 miles northwest of Chicago, women\u2019s median earnings trump men\u2019s by 3.6%.

Redwood City, California\n\nIn Redwood City, the median salary for women is nearly 10% higher than that of men. Of all 529 cities NerdWallet analyzed, there were only two places \u2014 Santa Barbara, California, and Gaithersburg, Maryland \u2014 where women outearned men by a higher percentage. Something to note about Redwood City, however, is that men\u2019s workplace participation rates are 15.3 percentage points higher than women\u2019s, compared with the national difference of 10 percentage points.
