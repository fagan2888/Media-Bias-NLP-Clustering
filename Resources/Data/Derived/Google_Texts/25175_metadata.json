Another shiny building!\u201d\n\nThe United Arab Emirates perfected the art of glossing over human rights abuses years ago by spotlighting its triumphs of capitalism and touting its strategic role in regional security.\n\nThe country buys its citizens\u2019 obedience with free healthcare and higher education, subsidized utilities and even a plush wedding stipend. It appeases wealthy expats with tax breaks and an unofficial laissez-faire attitude. All of these perks come at a hefty price in terms of freedoms and human rights.\n\nI\u2019ve been writing about this trade-off since first moving to Dubai in 2008 and continue to watch \u2014 with amusement and disgust \u2014 as leaders and local media put positive spin on even the most troubling developments.\n\nGulf News, based in Dubai, has spent the past 24 hours reporting how Emiratis, expats and experts are \u201cpraising\u201d a new law issued by royal decree that prohibits discrimination against individuals or groups on the basis of religion, caste, doctrine, race, color or ethnic origin. Sounds good\u2026until you look at the actual text.\n\nWhile most of the law is relatively benign, Section 2 \u201cCriminalizes any act that insults religion through any form of expression, be it speech or the written word, books, pamphlets or online\u201d and Section 8 \u201cProhibits any act that would be considered as insulting God, His prophets or apostles or holy books or houses of worship or graveyards.\u201d People who break the law face up to 10 years in prison and more than half a million dollars in fines.\n\nAnti-discrimination laws should protect people \u2014 people who hold ideas and beliefs \u2014 but not the ideas and beliefs themselves.\n\nPackaging glossy platitudes (\u201ctolerance, broad-mindedness and acceptance\u201d) with serious assaults on freedom of expression allows the government to shout \u201clook at our shiny tolerance\u201d while continuing to stifle dissent and to bury human rights abuses.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the positive headlines. This law is a clear violation of our internationally protected right to freedom of expression and should be summarily scrapped.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Opinion, Abu Dhabi, anti-discrimination, blasphemy, defamation, Dubai, freedom of expression, Freethought (Atheist, Humanist, Agnostic)", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "Anti-discrimination laws should protect people.
