I would like to bring everyone at least one positive story every day so that we can all have a reason to smile.\n\nBut some days, it\u2019s really tough.\n\nToday is not one of those.\n\nI\u2019ve got some good news, if you haven\u2019t already considered it.\n\nBarack Obama will no longer be president of the United States in less than eight months.\n\nHey, we endured nearly eight years. This is the home stretch. I feel like I can almost do this standing on my head \u2013 though I know he has some very bad plans in store for the country in his last 240 days in office (legitimately or illegitimately).\n\nHe has already tipped his hand that these last few months are going to be ugly \u2013 and they are sure to get worse between Election Day and Jan. 20, his last day in office.\n\nThere will be lots of pardons \u2013 take my word for it. Every low life, con artist, drug dealer and Democrat (but I repeat myself) is going to be let out of jail, get their voting rights restored and be cleared for jury duty. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe showed how it is going to be done on a national scale when he cleared the records of some 206,000 felons last month. Obama will want to out-do McAuliffe. Mark my words.\n\nWe\u2019ll see more executive orders in the last eight months than we\u2019ve seen in eight years.\n\nIt will be hell.\n\nBut the good news is he\u2019ll be gone Jan. 20. Done, finished, completed \u2013 and America will have a chance to recover if the election is not totally fixed.\n\nIsn\u2019t that a reason to feel good today? Don\u2019t you just want to breathe a sigh of relief?\n\nExperience more of Joseph Farah\u2019s no-nonsense truth-telling in his books, audio and video products, featured in the WND Superstore\n\nIf we\u2019re lucky, it will mean an end to the use of the Internal Revenue Service as a vicious political attack dog.\n\nIf we\u2019re lucky, we can repair the economy, repeal Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood, appoint a suitable replacement on the Supreme Court for Justice Antonin Scalia, get on with the business of destroying ISIS and, most importantly of all, sealing the border with a BIG WALL.\n\nIt could all begin as soon as 240 days from now.\n\nI\u2019m feeling absolutely giddy about the prospects.\n\nNot to put a damper on the good wishes, but there are crises on the horizon Obama is sure to exacerbate.\n\nHis buddies in Iran are working overtime to finish their work on a nuclear weapons arsenal and the delivery systems for them. They are using the hundred-billion Obama let them have for a worthless promise not to build them for 10 years. Instead, they are working overtime to finish before he even leaves office. A day doesn\u2019t go by now in which the Iranian mullahs don\u2019t explain how they are ready to annihilate Israel with those weapons.\n\nI don\u2019t believe Israel is going to wait to be nuked.\n\nMy gut tells me they have contingency plans at work.\n\nIf I\u2019m right, this will not be an attack that is neat and clean like the one Israel directed at the Iraqi nuclear program during Saddam Hussein\u2019s reign of terror.\n\nThis pre-emptive strike would entail massive casualties, because the Iranians built their nuclear facilities close to civilian population centers.\n\nAnd we all know, just one nuclear bomb can ruin your entire day.\n\nDo you see how hard it is to present good news with Obama in the White House?\n\nThis column meant to bring some cheer to your life today, yet, with Obama still around, even the silver linings come with dark clouds \u2013 sometimes mushroom clouds.\n\nAnyway, for what it\u2019s worth, the countdown to ecstasy has begun.\n\nIn 240 days, it will be \u201cNo more Obama, no more Michelle, no more transgendered bathrooms, except maybe in hell.\u201d\n\nCheer up. The end is near.\n\nMedia wishing to interview Joseph Farah, please contact media@wnd.com.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/need-a-reason-to-celebrate/", "site_name": "WND", "type": "article", "description": "I\u2019m an eternal optimist, but, let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s not a lot of good news out there these days.
