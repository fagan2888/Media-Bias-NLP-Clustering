She made 14 of her last 17 shots, including 7 of 9 3s.\n\n\u201cThat was contagious for the rest of the team,\u201d guard Sydney Wiese said.\n\n\u201cShe willed us to win tonight,\u201d said center Ruth Hamblin, another Beavers senior. \u201cTo have a competitor and a teammate like that, it makes you want to work harder and to do more for her and for the team.\u201d\n\nThe Beavers (31-4), the No. 2 seed in the Dallas Regional, play top seed Baylor (36-1) on Monday night with a Final Four berth on the line.\n\nWiese and Hamblin both scored 13 points. Wiese had consecutive early 3-pointers right before the Beavers went ahead to stay.\n\nDePaul (27-9) was in its fourth Sweet 16 under 30-year coach Doug Bruno, but has never gotten farther in the tournament.\n\nJessica January had 20 points for sixth-seeded DePaul, while Jacqui Grant had 15 and Mart\u2019e Grays 14.\n\nGrant scored her team\u2019s first seven points as the Blue Demons jumped out to a quick 9-2 lead before Wiese hit consecutive 3s in 32 seconds and Deven Hunter - who finished with nine points and 12 rebounds - made a go-ahead layup.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re obviously a lot bigger than us and it made it difficult to get to the rim as we have in other games,\u201d January said. \u201cJust a good team all around, they own their match-ups and they\u2019re just really aggressive.\u201d\n\nWeisner then had her 11 straight points, including three 3s for a 21-14 lead. Her previous career highs had been 27 points and six 3s.\n\n\u201cShe is the ultimate competitor. She gives everybody in the room confidence. Her confidence is earned,\u201d Rueck said. \u201cShe just brings this infectious energy to every situation. \u2026 You just want to be around it, so you would be crazy not to just smile and enjoy it.\u201d\n\nWith a roster filled with seniors and juniors recruited by Rueck, the Beavers are in a regional final nearly six years after he had to conduct open tryouts to fill his first roster.\n\nOregon State has won 21 of its last 22 games and has already set a school record for victories this season. They won the Pac-12 Tournament and shared the regular-season title, after last season winning the crown outright to end Stanford\u2019s run of 14 championships in a row.\n\n\u201cThere are four No. 1s in this tournament, and the fifth team is Oregon State,\u201d Bruno said. \u201cIt should be a really good game on Monday night.\u201d\n\nBaylor has a 23-game winning streak after a 78-58 win over Florida State earlier Saturday in the NBA Dallas Mavericks\u2019 arena that is only about 100 miles from the Lady Bears\u2019 campus in Waco.\n\nThe Lady Bears are trying to get to its fourth Final Four in coach Kim Mulkey\u2019s 16 seasons after losing in regional finals to Notre Dame each of the past two seasons.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nDePaul: The Blue Demons also lost Sweet 16 games in 2006, 2011 and 2014. \u2026 Chanise Jenkins has 10 points on 3-of-12 shooting. \u2026 DePaul had 18 assists on 27 field goals, matching their season average of assists on two-thirds of their field goals. \u2026\n\nOregon State: This is the first win for Oregon State for the season while allowing its opponent to score 70 points. \u2026 The Beavers are 2-0 against Baylor, but those games were in 1983 and 1995. \u2026 Oregon State is 26-0 this season when leading at halftime. \u2026 Hunter had six offensive and six defensive rebounds. \u2026 The Beavers had a 42-31 rebounding advantage.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOregon State plays Baylor in the Dallas Regional final Monday night.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An elite performance by Jamie Weisner and a first-ever regional final for Oregon State in the women's NCAA Tournament.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An elite performance by Jamie Weisner and a first-ever regional final for Oregon State in the women\u2019s NCAA Tournament.", "title": "Oregon State women first Elite 8 after 83-71 win over DePaul", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/26/oregon-state-women-first-elite-8-after-83-71-win-o/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/26/ncaa_depaul_oregon_st_basketball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/26/ncaa_depaul_oregon_st_basketball.jpeg", "description": "An elite performance by Jamie Weisner and a first-ever regional final for Oregon State in the women's NCAA Tournament.", "card": "summary", "title": "Oregon State women first Elite 8 after 83-71 win over DePaul"}, "Author": "STEPHEN HAWKINS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u2026Oregon State: This is the first win for Oregon State for the season while allowing its opponent to score 70 points.\nDALLAS (AP) - An elite performance by Jamie Weisner and a first-ever regional final for Oregon State in the women\u2019s NCAA Tournament.\n1s in this tournament, and the fifth team is Oregon State,\u201d Bruno said.\nOregon State has won 21 of its last 22 games and has already set a school record for victories this season.\n\u2026 Oregon State is 26-0 this season when leading at halftime."}
