[Investor’s Business Daily] Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG)(TREND ANALYSIS) is better positioned than other restaurants as the sector grapples with rising labor costs, a report said. Wage pressure has been a theme within restaurants this year and will continue to be one due to minimum-wage increases, rising healthcare costs under ObamaCare mandates and intensifying competition for qualified labor, said analysts at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

“Chipotle Mexican Grill has the lowest labor cost as a percentage of company sales of any publicly traded restaurant company that we track,” SunTrust analyst Jake Bartlett wrote in a note Wednesday.

At 22% of sales in 2014, Chipotle’s relative labor costs are about three-fourths of the 30.1% average of SunTrust’s restaurant coverage. Panera’s (NASDAQ:PNRA) labor costs in 2014 were 30.7% of sales, Noodles’ (NASDAQ:NDLS) were 30% and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) were 28.6%, Bartlett said.
