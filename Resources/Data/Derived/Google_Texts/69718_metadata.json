A full-service health system comprised of acute care hospitals, a psychiatric hospital, cancer, surgical and imaging centers, employed-physician practices and disease management programs, Baptist is using analytics to drive better patient outcomes, reduce financial risk and improve the revenue cycle \u2013 particularly around denials management.\n\n[Also: 2015 brings big paydays for CFOs]\n\nThe predictive algorithms in Baptist\u2019s analytics technology makes it possible to alert medical teams to a specific patient\u2019s likelihood of experiencing complications from an illness, acquiring an infection, or experiencing a recurrence or extension of a problem that could lead to readmission.\n\n\u201cDoing more in real-time while the patient is still with the care team is imperative if we are going to learn to educate patients and address them holistically, instead of treating individual disease processes or incidents one at a time,\u201d said Katrina Keefer Belt, Baptist Health\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\n[Also: What CFOs think about revenue cycle]\n\nThe holistic approach matters as much to putting the patient on the path to continued wellness as it does to a health system\u2019s ability to continue operating on a sound financial footing. The Affordable Care Act can now penalize hospitals for excessive 30-day readmissions for certain health conditions, even as it incentivizes them to keep patients healthy.\n\nThe fee-for-service environment under which hospitals have long operated has made it hard for many of them to yet grasp how important predictive analytics will be to \u201csurviving in [this] reformed environment,\u201d said Belt.\n\nBaptist Health is poised to get even more value out of its predictive analytics tool, which is supplied by Suwanee, Georgia-based Jvion. Belt says the health system is evolving its use of the technology to deal with revenue cycle issues related to denials management. Baptist will use the technology to cull through data in search of clinical, technical or administrative error patterns that lead to claims rejections.\n\n\u201cWe need to embed triggers in the medical record for caregivers upstream so that we don't rework claims,\u201d Belt said.\n\nGetting to predictive analytics\n\nCurrently, the quickest adopters of predictive analytics in the hospital sector are large academic and major medical centers, said Jeff Deal, vice president of operations at data science and predictive analytics consultancy Elder Research.\n\nA variety of factors hold other institutions back. Costs are among them, as \u201cthe development and application of an advanced analytics program can be an expensive and time-consuming endeavor,\u201d he said. Large medical centers are likely to have more resources to apply to an analytics program than more modestly sized organizations. Deal said academic medical centers are moving into advanced analytics as a matter of mission. \u201cThey want and need to be leading on medical innovation.\u201d\n\nOn the clinical side, obstacles extend to clinicians\u2019 reservations about the technology\u2019s impact on the practice of medicine. Analytics can encourage a physician to act against his intuition when the data demonstrates that a particular action or decision could result in a better outcome than the action the physician wants to take without that data-driven input, Deal said.\n\n\u201cIt is hard for all humans to act against training, experience, and intuition. But it can make a difference when the decision is supported by the sound application of analytic science on good data,\u201d he explained.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nThere may also be physician resentment if they feel they are being asked by the business office to incorporate advanced analytics into their decision making only to save money. \u201cThey need to see the impact on care delivery and health outcomes,\u201d Deal said.\n\nAt Baptist Health, Belt said physicians find it a \u201cscary prospect\u201d to have access to information that they otherwise wouldn't. \u201cHospitals need to be careful in how they present the information to the care team,\u201d she said. She recommends having the chief medical officer or a well-respected physician help spearhead predictive analytics efforts. Deal agrees that key stakeholders should be engaged early in the process, and advocates for strong leadership from high levels of the organization.\n\nA last piece of advice from both Belt and Deal is to make sure that the IT vendors, consultants or other parties brought on board to help implement predictive analytics really are experts in the technology. \u201cMost solutions that say they are \u2018predictive\u2019 are actually after-the-fact reporting, not truly predictive,\u201d cautioned Belt.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to say they do it,\u201d noted Deal, but in his experience he\u2019s found that they\u2019re not all shooting straight. If a vendor says they do predictive analytics, \u201cthe CFO needs to drill down and find out what the vendor means by \u2018predictive analytics,\u2019 and what actual experience that vendor has,\u201d he said.\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/baptist-health-sees-big-payoff-using-predictive-analytics", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Katrina-baptist-montgomery-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "But new area of business intelligence does not come without challenges.", "title": "Baptist Health sees big payoff using predictive analytics"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Katrina-baptist-montgomery-feature.gif"}, "title": "Baptist Health sees big payoff using predictive analytics", "description": "But new area of business intelligence does not come without challenges.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Hospitals and health systems can be quite good at leveraging business intelligence tools to better understand their organizations, from analyzing the demographics of the patients they serve to assessing breakdowns of operational expenditures.&#13; But most organizations haven\u2019t yet taken the next step: to predictive analytics.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "If a vendor says they do predictive analytics, \u201cthe CFO needs to drill down and find out what the vendor means by \u2018predictive analytics,\u2019 and what actual experience that vendor has,\u201d he said.\nBaptist Health in Montgomery, Alabama, is among the early adopters of predictive analytics.\nBaptist Health is poised to get even more value out of its predictive analytics tool, which is supplied by Suwanee, Georgia-based Jvion.\nAt Baptist Health, Belt said physicians find it a \u201cscary prospect\u201d to have access to information that they otherwise wouldn't.\nThe CFO needs to drill down and find out what the vendor means by \u2018predictive analytics."}
