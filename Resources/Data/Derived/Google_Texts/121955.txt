(ShanghaiDaily) A hospital in central China was demolished by force this morning when doctors and patients inside were nearly buried, police said.

A bulldozer suddenly broke the wall of the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University in Henan Provinceâ€™s Zhengzhou City that damaged medical equipment and buried six bodies in the morgue, according to Dahe Daily, a Henan-based newspaper.

About 30 people in camouflage uniform rushed to the hospital at 9:20am with the bulldozer when many patients were still receiving radiological inspections, a press officer with the hospital surnamed Yuan said.
