But it can be done in limited circumstances. However, the potentially discriminatory nature of this firing was a little too obvious for the EEOC to overlook.\n\nMeet Doug Johnson. He drove a van and took nursing home patients to medical appointments for his employer Paloma Blanca Health Care Associates, a health and rehabilitation center in Albuquerque, NM.\n\nAlmost three years into his tenure, Johnson suffered a heart attack and was diagnosed with a number of other cardiovascular conditions.\n\nHe then requested a reasonable accommodation under the ADA in the form of a request for FMLA leave.\n\nPaloma Blanca approved him for 12 weeks of FMLA leave.\n\nSo far so good, right?\n\nFired as part of an \u2018RIF\u2019\n\nFive weeks into his medical leave things took a sharp turn.\n\nJohnson was terminated.\n\nFiring a person while on medical leave is enough to perk up the EEOC\u2019s antenna. But Paloma Blanca didn\u2019t stop there.\n\nIt notified Johnson that it had eliminated his position and was laying him off due to a \u201creduction in force.\u201d\n\nGranted, a legitimate RIF is actually one of the ways employers can terminate individuals on medical leave \u2014 assuming it could be proven those workers would\u2019ve been let go regardless of their medical condition or leave of absence.\n\nBut problem for Paloma Blanca was this looked like anything but a legitimate RIF, at least according to the info contained in the EEOC\u2019s press release on the matter.\n\nNo other Paloma Blanca employees were subjected to an RIF at that time, the EEOC said, and there were no department- or facility-wide reductions in force around that time either.\n\nSo the EEOC sued Paloma Blanca under the ADA for disability discrimination and for failing to provide reasonable accommodations to a disabled individual.\n\nPerhaps seeing how bad this looked, Paloma Blanca decided to settle the lawsuit by providing Johnson $145,000 in monetary relief.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Paloma also agreed to:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "Firing a disabled employee while he\u2019s out on medical leave is usually\u00a0a recipe for disaster.
