Tulsa police say a "shots fired" call led them to a drug bust late Thursday night. Two people were arrested in a midtown Tulsa apartment just before 10 p.m. November 21, 2013.



Police say they were called to the 1200 block of South Quaker Avenue, and several witnesses pointed out the apartment from which they'd heard the gunshots. Officers looked into a window and saw someone moving around inside with a flashlight.

Officers talked to Kenneth L. Etter, 24, who said he lived in the apartment. Etter said no one else was at home, but officers say they caught Magen Marie Ansart trying to leave through the back door.

Ansart, 22, was carrying three bottles of crystal methamphetamine, one bag of marijuana, a bottle of Adderall (amphetamine) and smoking paraphernalia, according to an arrest report.

"Due to the shots heard and the dishonesty of Etter, a protective sweep was done inside the residence to ensure no one was injured," the arresting officer said in his report. When they found guns in plain sight, officers got a search warrant for the apartment.

They then found several firearms including two AK-47s, a .223 rifle, a shotgun, several handguns, ammunition and a Kevlar vest. Scales, baggies and a large sum of cash were also discovered.

In an arrest report, Ansart said Etter told her to "grab the dope and get out of the back of the house" when police arrived Thursday night.

Kenneth Etter was booked on complaints of possession of a firearm in commission of a felony, possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, possession of meth and committing a felony with body armor. He had some outstanding traffic offenses as well. He was booked on a $33,768 bond.
