Henry Waxman just retired after serving 20 terms in Congress, but was apparently unable to convert that experience into a lucrative lobbying job on K Street.\n\nWaxman was considered one of the most successful legislators in Congress, and authored key legislation including Obamacare and The Clean Air Act. But after marketing himself to large lobbying firms for a month, he announced last week he decided to take a job at his son\u2019s four-man PR firm, Waxman Strategies.\n\nA National Law Journal report suggests the move wasn\u2019t really his choice. \u201c[Waxman] is a prickly guy for everybody,\u201d former congressman and now lobbyist Jim Walsh told The Journal.\n\nAs a congressman, Waxman successfully battled big industries, including the tobacco, coal and pharmaceutical industries. He wrote and circulated a business plan to Washington lobbying firms, thinking his extensive knowledge and experience would make him a good adviser.\n\nBut lobbyists told The Journal they weren\u2019t sure he would fit into their corporate-defense culture.\n\nWaxman said he voluntarily chose not to take a job on K Street, in part because he doesn\u2019t want to compromise his values. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want a firm to represent something I didn\u2019t agree with,\u201d he told The Journal. \u201cThere are many special interest groups that I often found myself opposed to in my congressional career.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt got be more of a morass than I had wanted to deal with,\u201d he added.\n\nFollow Rachel on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
