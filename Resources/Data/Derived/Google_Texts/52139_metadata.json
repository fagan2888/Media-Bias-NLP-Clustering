He says we need more high-skilled immigrants. How is it that the richest country on Earth and the world\u2019s greatest superpower can\u2019t educate H-1B-level citizens? He says more immigrants will ease the Social Security problem and greater population will increase GDP and mitigate the size disadvantage with China. Absurd.
