(AP) \u2014 As supporters of the federal health care reforms push for final signups, a handful of states are trying to press the reset button.\n\nThey have botched their handling of the process so badly that they already are looking beyond Monday\u2019s enrollment deadline to the next enrollment period starting in the fall.\n\nMany states and the federal government experienced technical problems with the enrollment websites, but implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act has been a relative disaster in Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Vermont.\n\nRather than focusing on meeting enrollment targets, officials in those states find themselves consumed with replacing top officials, cancelling contracts with software companies, dealing with state or federal investigations, and spending tens of millions of dollars on fixes and new contractors. The core of the problem has been the difficulty in building an online health insurance marketplace that syncs up with myriad state and federal databases.\n\nEarly projections for those five states were to sign up a combined 800,000 Americans for private health insurance coverage by March 31, 11 percent of the Obama administration\u2019s original target for national enrollment. Yet with just days to go before the six-month enrollment period ends, achieving 25 percent of that target would be considered a success.\n\nOverseers of Nevada Health Link have called that state\u2019s program a \u201cfull failure\u201d and a \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d Some officials have suggested dumping Xerox, which was awarded a $75 million contract to develop the system.\n\nWhile Xerox remains on the job, a state board earlier this month approved up to $1.5 million to hire another tech firm, Deloitte Consulting, to assess the Xerox system and recommend fixes.\n\nLast month Nevada officials cut their target enrollment from 118,000 to 50,000 and conceded that meeting even the lower goal would be a challenge. That drew the ire of board members, who lashed out about the thousands of people who will remain uninsured after Monday\u2019s deadline.\n\n\u201cThese are not numbers. These are people throughout the state who don\u2019t have health insurance,\u201d said Lynn Etkins, an attorney and vice chairwoman of the board overseeing the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange.\n\nA week later, Nevada exchange executive director Jon Hager announced his resignation to pursue \u201cnew opportunities.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story in Oregon, where the exchange\u2019s executive director and two officials who oversaw the early technology development resigned. As of last week, 47,000 Oregonians had signed up for private insurance, less than a quarter of initial projections for the full enrollment period.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s website was so badly bungled that applications at the beginning had to be processed manually, a process that remains partially in use. Cover Oregon has withheld $26 million of the $160 million billed by Oracle, which designed the website.\n\nThe federal Government Accountability Office has announced an investigation, and a state-funded audit released last week found a failure by the exchange\u2019s managers to heed reports of problems, poor communication and what it described as \u201cunrealistic optimism.\u201d In announcing results of the audit, Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber said he was angry and disappointed in a process that had caused so much confusion and uncertainty among consumers.\n\nMaryland\u2019s exchange crashed at the start of open enrollment on Oct. 1 and has been rocky ever since. The exchange\u2019s initial executive director, Rebecca Pearce, quit two months into open enrollment, and last month Maryland fired the state\u2019s prime information technology contractor, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, after paying it $65 million.\n\nU.S. Rep. Andy Harris, the only Republican in Maryland\u2019s congressional delegation, called for a review by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services into how $250 million in federal money was used in the botched exchange. The department\u2019s inspector general informed Harris that it will conduct the review.\n\n\u201cI mean, this is an immense amount of money on a project that I think in the end, if I were betting right now, I would bet that they will abandon the Maryland exchange and either import another state exchange like Connecticut\u2019s that works or go to the federal exchange,\u201d Harris said.\n\nIn addition to making major fixes, Maryland officials are considering whether to adopt technology developed by another state, join a consortium of other states running their own exchanges or partner with the federal exchange.\n\nIn Massachusetts, where health care reform implemented under then-Gov. Mitt Romney was used as a model for President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, officials announced earlier this month that they were cutting ties with CGI Group Inc. The Montreal-based firm also was the lead contractor on the troubled federal health care website that operates in 36 states.\n\nCGI was hired last year under a $68 million contract to develop a website transitioning Massachusetts\u2019 previous health insurance program to reflect requirements under the federal law.\n\nBut technical problems quickly led to a backlog of 50,000 paper applications, a pile that has since been whittled to about 21,000. The state hired Optum, another health care technology firm, to come up with short- and long-term solutions for the website, for which it was to be paid at least $16.4 million through the end of March.\n\n\u201cThe picture we are painting is that we have a long way to go,\u201d said Sarah Iselin, a health care executive hired by Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick to oversee fixing the website. \u201cWe are not going to sugarcoat anything.\u201d\n\nVermont changed from Oracle to a subsidiary of CGI only months before Vermont Health Connect was to go live. The system is slow, does not allow users to correct mistakes and cannot process premium payments.\n\n\u201cNo one is more disappointed than I am that we fell short in our rollout of the exchange, and I take responsibility for those failures,\u201d said Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat.\n\nVermont Republican leaders have asked for an investigation by federal prosecutors and are hoping to capitalize on the bumbling exchange by targeting Democrats, who control both houses of the state Legislature, in this year\u2019s elections.\n\n\u201cPeople are just disgusted with it,\u201d said Rep. Brian Savage, the assistant House minority leader.\n\nSome states, including Nevada, are giving consumers extra time to get through the process if technical problems prevented them from completing their enrollment by Monday. As of last week, only 22,000 successfully purchased private coverage in Nevada.\n\nIn all five states, officials are trying to limp through the end of this year\u2019s signup period while focusing on fixing problems so the exchanges run more smoothly when the next open enrollment period begins in November.\n\nNevada officials said they will push Xerox for improvements and await the assessment from Deloitte, but officials concede there will be a lot on the line.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go through this again,\u201d Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to wake up every morning seeing stories of Nevadans who can\u2019t navigate through the system; that aren\u2019t getting insurance cards; the gentleman who had a heart attack who is still sitting in limbo not knowing what his status is.\n\n\u201cThis has cascaded to absolute worst-case scenario.\u201d\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.
