Low, single digit increases and I think that's great for Utahns,\" said Representative Jim Dunnigan, (R) Taylorsville.\n\n\n\nThat trend may not last long.\n\n\n\nThe insurance department warns of a change in the near future when some of the subsidies expire for the individual market.\n\n\n\n\"There won't be any artificial subsidies for the individual market for 2017 forward and so we do expect to see a higher increase in those premiums at that time,\" said Northrup.\n\n\n\nDunnigan, who co-chairs the task force, says when that happens premiums will have to go up to cover about $60,000,000.\n\n\n\nHe says in the long run there is nothing affordable about it.\n\n\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act is pulling about $900,000,000 a year out of Utah in taxes and fees. We're getting some of that back in subsides and stuff. It's a huge array of taxes built into it,\" said Dunnigan.\n\n\n\nThis year the federal government chose to auto renew all the policies on the individual market.\n\n\n\nYou may receive a letter explaining that, but the insurance department says that's not wise.\n\n\n\nThey suggest bypassing auto renew and shopping your plan against others in the market.\n\n\n\nYou may find a better and even cheaper plan that way.\n\n\n\nOpen enrollment begins November 15, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2016 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
