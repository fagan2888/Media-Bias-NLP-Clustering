Rather, Robinson and Pederson had shared the field in 2014 with the Albuquerque Isotopes, the Dodgers\u2018 former Triple-A affiliate.\n\nIt is evident Pederson has already risen to national attention. He boasts an all-star appearance in his rookie season, along with being runner-up in the Home Run Derby. He\u2019s also a top candidate for National League Rookie of the Year.\n\nThe 23-year-old posted a .303 batting average with 33 home runs and 78 RBI in 2014 with Albuquerque, however, many didn\u2019t see that translating over to his rookie season in the big leagues. It\u2019s no shock to Robinson.\n\n\u201c[This is] pretty much what I expected from him,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of power and talent and he\u2019s showing that. The batting average doesn\u2019t really show what he can do, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going through a learning curve, you know, being a rookie. I expect for him to get even better.\u201d\n\nPederson has earned the spotlight, with his 20 home runs after the Dodgers\u2018 5-0 victory over the Washington National on Sunday the most of any rookie. What\u2019s even more impressive is Pederson\u2019s RBI total. As a leadoff hitter, Pederson has driven in 40 runs, ranking third among rookies.\n\nThe Dodgers expected success from the Palo Alto, California native, but maybe not to this extent. Dodgers manager Don Mattingly knew his glove was ready, but his bat was the surprise.\n\n\u201cOffensively he\u2019s been way better than we thought,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cBut the jumps that he gets on fly balls, he gets to them fairly easily, and you don\u2019t see them on ESPN. That\u2019s because he gets to balls easier than a lot of other guys. I think the biggest thing is how good he\u2019s been in center.\u201d\n\nPederson has totaled two errors on the season. In a position like center field, there\u2019s more than enough ground to cover. He flashed his range Saturday by making a tumbling catch on a Tyler Moore line drive in the third inning.\n\nOne thing that worries Mattingly is Pederson\u2019s contact hitting. Even with Pederson\u2019s power, he has 112 strikeouts on the season, which is the most of any rookie.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a way,\u201d Mattingly said when asked if Pederson can cut down on strikeouts. \u201cI think we could do him a better service by giving him a better chance to put the ball in play and score a runner here and there. \u2026 I think there\u2019s a misconception that all he does is swing as hard as he can. It may look like that, but it\u2019s definitely not all he\u2019s trying to do.\u201d\n\nPederson participated in this year\u2019s Home Run Derby, which has its positives \u2014 in terms of confidence \u2014 but can also lead to drawbacks. Many believe that the Home Run Derby can create problems with a player\u2019s swing and approach at the plate.\n\nMattingly had no problem with Pederson\u2019s involvement in the Derby.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really believe it,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing as taking [batting practice]. What he was doing wasn\u2019t any different than what he does on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nAlthough Pederson didn\u2019t finish on top, he still had a great deal of support.\n\n\u201cI picked [Pederson] on Twitter before it even started,\u201d Robinson said, when asked if he watched the Home Run Derby. \u201cI said I was going out on a limb. I hit behind him in Albuquerque all last year, so I know what he\u2019s capable of.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pederson was selected as an all-star in his rookie season and was the runner-up in the Home Run Derby last week, hinting that big things are ahead for the center fielder.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Pederson was selected as an all-star in his rookie season and was the runner-up in the Home Run Derby last week, hinting that big things are ahead for the center fielder.", "title": "Dodgers rookie Joc Pederson making successful transition to major leagues", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/19/dodgers-rookie-joc-pederson-making-successful-tran/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/18/09e1a9550ada94207c0f6a706700e567.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/18/09e1a9550ada94207c0f6a706700e567.jpg", "description": "Pederson was selected as an all-star in his rookie season and was the runner-up in the Home Run Derby last week, hinting that big things are ahead for the center fielder.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dodgers rookie Joc Pederson making successful transition to major leag"}, "Author": "Andrew Walsh", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Joc Pederson, Clint Robinson, Derby, Home Run Derby"}, "article_summary": "He boasts an all-star appearance in his rookie season, along with being runner-up in the Home Run Derby.\nRather, Robinson and Pederson had shared the field in 2014 with the Albuquerque Isotopes, the Dodgers\u2018 former Triple-A affiliate.\nThe 23-year-old posted a .303 batting average with 33 home runs and 78 RBI in 2014 with Albuquerque, however, many didn\u2019t see that translating over to his rookie season in the big leagues.\nDuring the power outage delay in Friday night\u2019s game between the Washington Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers, Clint Robinson and Joc Pederson conversed in center field.\n\u201cI picked [Pederson] on Twitter before it even started,\u201d Robinson said, when asked if he watched the Home Run Derby."}
