A woman told police the dog, a pit bull-Labrador mix jumped a six-foot fence and was attacking her and her children.\n\nWhen an officer arrived on scene, the dog began attacking the patrol car, and the officer was unable to get out. Sgt. Roger Runft said the officer used pepper spray to no avail.\n\nWhen the dog turned its aggression toward another neighbor, the officer exited his vehicle and again used pepper spray, which had no effect. Sgt. Runft said the officer then shot the dog.\n\nAfter being shot, the dog ran and jumped the fence back into its yard.\n\nAnimal control arrived on scene and took the dog. Sgt. Runft said he wasn't sure whether the dog was taken to a veterinarian or back to the shelter.\n\nNo one was hurt in the attack. Sgt. Runft said its too early in the investigation to know whether the dog will be euthanized.\n\nSgt. Runft said the dog's owner was on scene and was made aware of the situation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A woman told police the dog, a pit bull-Labrador mix jumped a six-foot fence and was attacking her and her children.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-officer-shoots-dog-that-jumped-fence-attacked-neighbors-318539751.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/bonn+dog+attack.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A woman told police the dog, a pit bull-Labrador mix jumped a six-foot fence and was attacking her and her children.", "title": "Wichita officer shoots dog that jumped fence, attacked neighbors"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A woman told police the dog, a pit bull-Labrador mix jumped a six-foot fence and was attacking her and her children.", "title": "Wichita officer shoots dog that jumped fence, attacked neighbors", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-officer-shoots-dog-that-jumped-fence-attacked-neighbors-318539751.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/bonn+dog+attack.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Wichita officer shoots dog that jumped fence, attacked neighbors", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Wichita officer shoots dog that, jumped fence"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8e6\"", "article_summary": "A Wichita police officer shot an aggressive dog Friday evening after the dog jumped a fence and attacked neighbors.\nWhen an officer arrived on scene, the dog began attacking the patrol car, and the officer was unable to get out.\nA woman told police the dog, a pit bull-Labrador mix jumped a six-foot fence and was attacking her and her children.\nAfter being shot, the dog ran and jumped the fence back into its yard.\nRoger Runft said the officer used pepper spray to no avail."}
