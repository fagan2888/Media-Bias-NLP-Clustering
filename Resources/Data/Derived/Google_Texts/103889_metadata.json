Before killing them, he shot his ex-girlfriend Shaneka Thompson in the stomach, after breaking into her building and arguing with her about their past relationship. Because the shooter, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, bragged on Instagram about avenging the deaths of various black men killed by police in the last several months, many commentators began falsely equating the act of a deranged vigilante with the politics of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nWhipped into a predictable but regrettable frenzy, the NYPD blamed the mayor for showing empathy with protestors, declared themselves a \u201cwartime police department,\u201d and promised that they would \u201cact accordingly.\u201d In the midst of understandable grief and perhaps fear, the NYPD and those who support them uncritically have chosen to engage in the kind of dishonest, incendiary rhetoric that only inflames an already volatile situation. Let us not forget that the same police who claim protestors have gone to war against them antagonized demonstrators by wearing shirts proclaiming, \u201cI can breathe\u201d in the midst of demonstrations last week. Police also held #BlueLivesMatter rallies. Their callous disregard for Eric Garner\u2019s life should be set alongside their demand for our automatic grief and empathy for these slain officers.\n\nTo be clear, I am deeply disheartened by the pain and grief that the families of Officers Liu and Ramos must now endure. Those officers did not deserve to lose their lives. But the families of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Akai Gurley, John Crawford and Tamir Rice are worthy of equal empathy. These men and boys did not deserve to lose their lives either. Their families\u2019 grief matters just as much. Their communities\u2019 sense of an injustice having been done is just as legitimate. The truth about the magnitude of unjust and unjustifiable black death perpetrated at the hands of police officers does not go away because of the misguided, wrongheaded act of a lone gunman.\n\nI resent the pressure now placed on black people to make a public show of condemning this act of violence against the police. Many of my friends obliged with pithy statements, with assertions that #AllLivesMatter, and even by posting blue ribbon memes to their pages. I will be doing no such thing. I reject the implicit argument that if I don\u2019t publicly express outrage over two dead police officers that I must agree with them having been killed. I do not agree with the actions of a mentally ill killer. I wish Officers Liu and Ramos were home with their families this holiday season.\n\nThere is a disingenuousness to the argument that those who disagree with the ways that the police serve black and brown communities are complicit in these killings. Nothing could be further from the truth. We do not blame the white community when young white men shoot up movie theaters, schools and public events. We do not argue that because those on the right have stridently resisted passing stricter gun control laws that they must have wanted the children at Newtown to be slaughtered. Yet, when Brinsley murdered these officers, too many white people took it as a sign of things to come, a signal that a band of black vigilantes would emerge from the darkness to slaughter \u201cinnocent\u201d white people.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of white privilege is the presumption of individuality given to each white person, so that their acts are never taken as indicative of a group. Yet, as soon as one mentally unstable black person rants about killing police as an act of revenge and acts on it, suddenly the entire black community is viewed as dangerous. We don\u2019t talk about Ismaaiyl Brinsley in the way that we have discussed any number of white mass murderers over the years.\n\nWhen I argued that Elliot Rodger, the mixed-race UC Santa Barbara shooter, suffered from a heady combination of white privilege, male privilege and mental instability, the mere attempt to think about the political dimensions of his delusions netted me death threats. In Brinsley\u2019s case, it is clear that his delusions were intertwined with the political struggles of the current moment. That does not in any way mitigate the severity of his mental illness. And it cannot become an excuse for the police to police black and brown communities more harshly.\n\nIt should, however, become an opportunity for us to get honest about the fears we have around racially charged situations. The thing we are not saying here, the thing that must be said, particularly as commentators leapfrog over clear mental health issues to malign Black Lives Matter protestors, is that white people deeply fear black anger. Many fear that at any moment black rage could boil over into deadly forms of violence. It is the reason that professional black people have a running internal joke about the things white people say to us, whenever they see more than three black people gathered together talking at school or at work. On more than one occasion, white people have been known to respond to such mundane conversations by asking if we were \u201cplotting the revolution.\u201d This fear of the unpredictability of black rage is the reason that black people are frequently characterized as angry when we aren\u2019t smiling. Toni Morrison famously wrote about the ways that Clarence Thomas\u2019 Supreme Court confirmation hearings had far more references to his warm smile and laughter than to his history as a legal scholar.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I'm deeply pained by the murder of those officers -- but the dishonest rhetoric that followed must be called out", "author": "Brittney Cooper", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "I'm deeply pained by the murder of those officers -- but the dishonest rhetoric that followed must be called out", "title": "America\u2019s fear of black rage: Why tragic NYPD shootings are so misunderstood", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/24/americas_fear_of_black_rage_why_tragic_nypd_shootings_are_so_misunderstood/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/pataki_giuliani_kelly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I'm deeply pained by the murder of those officers -- but the dishonest rhetoric that followed must be called out", "creator": "@professorcrunk", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/pataki_giuliani_kelly.jpg", "title": "America\u2019s fear of black rage: Why tragic NYPD shootings are so misunderstood", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "America\u2019s fear of black rage: Why tragic NYPD shootings are so misunderstood", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bill de Blasio, black lives matter, Editor's Picks, eric garner, Ferguson, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, michael brown, Police, Race, Racism, Rafael Ramos, Wenjian Liu", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d7f\"", "article_summary": "Many fear that at any moment black rage could boil over into deadly forms of violence.\nTo be clear, I am deeply disheartened by the pain and grief that the families of Officers Liu and Ramos must now endure.\nI wish Officers Liu and Ramos were home with their families this holiday season.\nThe thing we are not saying here, the thing that must be said, particularly as commentators leapfrog over clear mental health issues to malign Black Lives Matter protestors, is that white people deeply fear black anger.\nWe do not blame the white community when young white men shoot up movie theaters, schools and public events."}
