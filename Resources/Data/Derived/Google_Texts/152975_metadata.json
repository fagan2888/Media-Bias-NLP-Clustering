She went to the third level of the parking garage and stood on the edge. Santa Rosa police said witnesses below tried to talk her down, but she said nothing and let herself fall.\n\nDenny Ragan said he believes his wife, who retired from Kaiser in South San Francisco more than two decades ago, was trying to make a statement. The only identification she had with her was her Kaiser medical card and her driver\u2019s license, her family said.\n\n\u201cShe drove right over to Kaiser \u2026 16 years working there \u2026 she was very upset about them. She went right up to the parking area near the emergency room,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s a statement of what they\u2019re doing out there, how they treat people.\u201d\n\nKaiser said this week that it extended its condolences to the Ragan family, but after thoroughly reviewing the case found that Barbara Ragan had received a \u201ctremendous amount of care\u201d in the weeks before her death. Officials said Kaiser mental health providers were in frequent contact with Ragan regarding her condition and the medications she was taking.\n\n\u201cWe extend our deepest sympathies to the family,\u201d said Dr. Mason Turner, Kaiser Permanente Northern California\u2019s director of outpatient services for regional mental health.\n\n\u201cThe care Ms. Ragan was receiving was exceptional care,\u201d Turner said, adding that Kaiser was willing to work with the family to address their concerns.\n\nBut Ragan\u2019s suicide has once again raised questions about what critics say are serious gaps in the company\u2019s mental health services.\n\nSpecifically, critics say Kaiser fails to provide timely individual appointments to see a mental health therapist or psychiatrist. In recent years, Kaiser has been penalized by the state Department of Managed Health Care for serious \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in its mental health care offerings.\n\nKaiser this week rejected such claims. Turner said the health plan has made great strides in expanding its network by hiring more mental health providers and contracting with an outside network to supplement its staff. The health plan said it hopes to become a national model for mental health care.\n\nWorsening condition\n\nFor more than two decades, Barbara Ragan had been taking Prozac. But Denny Ragan said that his wife only recently began feeling like it was wasn\u2019t working for her.\n\n\u201cYou could always tell something was always there, but it was livable,\u201d Ragan said, adding that about a month ago his wife\u2019s condition was worsening.\n\nOn June 15, the couple were at the Trader Joe\u2019s on Cleveland Avenue when Barbara Ragan said she didn\u2019t think she could continue shopping. She got extremely quiet, her mood worsened and she asked her husband to take her to the \u201cemergency hospital,\u201d Denny Ragan said. He said he didn\u2019t know exactly what his wife was going through; her condition changed so rapidly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Before she jumped to her death from the top of the parking", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "Sonoma County\u2019s largest health care provider and the family of a patient who committed suicide are at odds over the level of mental health care the woman received leading up to her suicide.", "title": "Kaiser Permanente faces renewed criticism over mental health services after Santa Rosa suicide", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/4257827-181/kaiser-permanente-faces-renewed-criticism", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=Ey104e5EIMd2czWlZfAzZs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYsWzurn10$G9cDXL$bHKHkVWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2015-08-01T02:19:01-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In recent years, Kaiser has been penalized by the state Department of Managed Health Care for serious \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in its mental health care offerings.\nThe health plan said it hopes to become a national model for mental health care.\nBut Ragan\u2019s suicide has once again raised questions about what critics say are serious gaps in the company\u2019s mental health services.\nOfficials said Kaiser mental health providers were in frequent contact with Ragan regarding her condition and the medications she was taking.\n\u201cWe extend our deepest sympathies to the family,\u201d said Dr. Mason Turner, Kaiser Permanente Northern California\u2019s director of outpatient services for regional mental health."}
