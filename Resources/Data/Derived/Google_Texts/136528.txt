Roadside theme parks were often a last minute decision made by families as they drove through quaint little towns, but for Will Russell, owning one was a lifelong goal.

"It's always been my dream to have a roadside attraction of my very own. Here it is, and in just a few short weeks, it'll be all mine."

But the vision Russell had reached far beyond his own "Funtown Mountain."

"We are making efforts to brand Cave City as the "Roadside Attraction Capital of America, and it really does work."

Russell cited the close proximity of the businesses as one reason he felt the branding efforts would succeed, but that was far from the only reason.

He felt strongly that families already viewed Cave City as an affordable and family-fun environment, and he said having the interstate nearby didn't hurt, either.

"I-65 is one of the most heavily trafficked arteries in the country, and we know that 2 million visitors go to Mammoth Cave annually. About a quarter of those will get off at Exit 53 here in Cave City, and go through Cave City."

It was obvious that Russell had done his research, and he said he had plenty of time to think everything over. Though his life was full of excitement on Saturday, he hadn't always been so fortunate.

"You know, my life has been very interesting. In the 90s I was homeless for a period, got into a lot of trouble. I kind of straightened up my act, went back to school, got a degree and then started working."

Saturday, there were no signs of those struggles written across his face.

"I think that you would have a hard time arguing that I am not the luckiest man in Kentucky."

Russell was set to officially close on the property on Wednesday, May 27, and the park had an opening date of June 19.
