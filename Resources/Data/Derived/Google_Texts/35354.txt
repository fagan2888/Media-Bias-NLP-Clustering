Every Black Friday Paris takes us to find some of the best deals in town and once again he didn't disappoint.

Home Depot on 23rd Street is offering a number of sales but their most popular item by far was the Martha Stewart Living Christmas tree being sold for only $79. It stands 7'5" and come pre-lit in your choice of either clear or multi-colored lights.

Sam's Club is also offering great deals on hot items. They're selling iPhone 6's for only $99 with a 2-year contract.

Both stores were very popular Friday with people lining up outside hours before opening to get the best deals. Likewise, both stores offered hot chocolate and coffee to warm their customers on such a chilly morning.
