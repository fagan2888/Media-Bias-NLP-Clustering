He still pulls his braids back in a ponytail. He still wears wristbands and white socks that come midway up his calves. And he\u2019s still the most energetic guy in the room.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the Kenneth Faried that the NBA saw last season.\n\nFor starters, he now has a gold medal around his neck.\n\nThe Nuggets forward recently returned to Denver \u2014 for the start of training camp Tuesday \u2014 after spending the summer in Spain with Team USA in the FIBA World Cup.\n\nFew people thought he had a chance to make the U.S. team, let alone star.\n\nBut on the heels of a breakout couple of months last season with the Nuggets \u2014 he averaged 18.8 points and 10.1 rebounds after the all-star break \u2014 Faried continued his streak overseas, averaging 12.2 points and 7.7 rebounds in nine games at the World Cup.\n\nThe numbers were important \u2014 for Team USA, but especially him. The numbers were validation to his ever improving game.\n\n\u201cI believed I was going to do it and everybody that didn\u2019t believe me said, \u2018You\u2019re selling a pipe dream to yourself. Snap back to reality,\u2019 \u201d Faried said. \u201cWell, this is reality. I have this medal around my neck and I\u2019m proud of that.\u201d\n\nIt also may have also helped his contract negotiations.\n\nNuggets general manager Tim Connelly said Monday that he\u2019s hopeful the sides can agree on a contract extension before the Oct. 31 deadline, at which point Faried would have to play out the season and enter restricted free agency next summer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no gun to our head,\u201d Connelly said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking to Kenneth\u2019s representatives and we\u2019re hopeful we can get a deal done prior to the deadline, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a distraction. We have plenty of time. I think he knows how much we value him.\u201d\n\nBut earlier last season, that wasn\u2019t the case. Faried said he questioned just how much the Nuggets really did want him.\n\n\u201cI thought as though I wasn\u2019t in the bigger plan for this team,\u201d Faried said. \u201cThat the team didn\u2019t want me here or want me to be a part of the bigger plan that they had.\u201d\n\nNow he says he would love to be a Nuggets lifer, but that he\u2019s also a realist, that \u201cif things don\u2019t work out then I have to move on.\u201d\n\nFaried, who said he has played the underdog role much of his life, finally got the recognition he sought with Team USA \u2014 and from a guy whose praise carries significant weight.\n\n\u201cCoach K (Mike Krzyzewski) was talking to me and said I needed to be that leader in practice and on the court, he needs me to bring that energy to be that leader that I should be,\u201d Faried said.\n\n\u201cTo hear it from one of the greatest coaches in the world, a Hall of Famer \u2026 it just registered like, \u2018Hey, you can do anything, Kenneth. You can go out there and win a gold. You can go out there and compete with these guys, and in the NBA, you can do the same thing.\u2019 \u201c\n\nNuggets coach Brian Shaw said he\u2019s had several conversations with Faried about how to improve his game at both ends of the court. Shaw also wants Faried to convert his high-energy style into something sustainable. They talked about former NBA star Dennis Rodman, an undersized power forward Faried idolizes, and how he would hop on a treadmill after a game to stay in shape for his style of play.\n\nAmong the other notable conversations the two had: attacking the defensive boards as hard as he does the offensive ones.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember or noticed \u2014 but the second half of the season I (told) Kenneth, \u2018If you get the defensive rebound, you can bust out and push it yourself. As long as you\u2019re making the right choices at the end of it and it turns into something positive for us, I\u2019ll allow you to do it,\u2019 \u201d Shaw said.\n\nPHOTOS: Denver Nuggets Media Day\n\n\u201cAnd I think he started to take off, and that made him go as tenaciously after defensive rebounds as he did after offensive rebounds, and gave him the freedom to use that raw energy and athleticism to get our break going.\u201d\n\nFaried\u2019s summer abroad reinforced that mentality, but the added time on the court comes at a cost. He said he\u2019ll ease his way into training camp to avoid injury or fatigue later in the season, a plan that doesn\u2019t really mesh well with his mind-set.\n\nBut he knows what\u2019s at stake. And he knows there are still those doubters.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kenneth Faried of 2014 comes with newfound swagger \u2014 and a gold medal", "title": "Kenneth Faried of 2014 comes with newfound swagger \u2014 and a gold medal", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/29/kenneth-faried-of-2014-comes-with-newfound-swagger-and-a-gold-medal/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131227__kenneth-faried-nuggets-122713ap1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131227__kenneth-faried-nuggets-122713ap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-29T16:02:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:55:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf284\"", "article_summary": "Kenneth Faried still wears No.\n\u201cI thought as though I wasn\u2019t in the bigger plan for this team,\u201d Faried said.\nBut this isn\u2019t the Kenneth Faried that the NBA saw last season.\nThe numbers were important \u2014 for Team USA, but especially him.\nThe Nuggets forward recently returned to Denver \u2014 for the start of training camp Tuesday \u2014 after spending the summer in Spain with Team USA in the FIBA World Cup."}
