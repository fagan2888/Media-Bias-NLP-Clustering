Now, in \u201cHow Not to Calm a Child on a Plane: And Other Lessons in Parenting from a Highly Questionable Source,\u201d the actress and TV writer has delivered a revealing, funny look at motherhood, sex, breastfeeding, dead dogs \u2014 and the vicious lie that is: \u201cEnjoy it. It goes so fast.\u201d\n\nStein resolutely takes the stance of \u201cquestionable source\u201d on the subject of parenting advice, which is part of what makes her book so much fun. Her writing makes it clear she\u2019s exactly the sort of person you\u2019d want to share comic misadventures and weird thoughts with; within minutes of our recent conversation, she and I were swapping tales of our most irrational fears when our daughters were babies.\n\nWhen your book came out, I immediately remembered you as the lady with the barf bag story.\n\nA friend said it\u2019s like the barf bag that got a book deal. All you have to do is cover yourself in vomit, and you too can write a book!\n\nThere are already many humorous parenting blogs and books out there. Were you concerned about going into such a crowded field?\n\nI do remember when I was working on the proposal and wondering, is anybody going to be interested in another so-called funny book about being a mom?\n\nI\u2019m not an op-ed kind of writer. I\u2019m not a \u201cHere\u2019s my opinion, here\u2019s what I think\u201d writer. My subtext is always, \u201cCan\u2019t we just relax and ease off?\u201d Comedy is the shortest distance to the truth. It\u2019s ridiculous, the pressure that comes from the world right now and all of these books to be the perfect parent, so I\u2019m just laughing at it.\n\nYou\u2019ve put a lot of intimate things in the book. What\u2019s been the response from readers?\n\nPeople are not scandalized. The most interesting response has been from non-parents. Non-parents find it surprisingly relatable. I guess people are moved by the level of disclosure. There\u2019s a level of relatability that\u2019s a relief. People say, \u201cOh my God, that story of yours reminded me of that time my family wound up covered in shit,\u201d and that\u2019s really heartwarming.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Johanna Stein talks babies, bodily functions and why she swore she'd never let her daughter wear pink", "title": "A barf bag got me a book deal: A mom offers up her questionable parenting advice", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Johanna Stein talks babies, bodily functions and why she swore she'd never let her daughter wear pink", "title": "A barf bag got me a book deal: A mom offers up her questionable parenting advice", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/17/a_barf_bag_got_me_a_book_deal_a_mom_offers_up_her_questionable_parenting_advice/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/Johanna-Stein-Headshot-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Johanna Stein talks babies, bodily functions and why she swore she'd never let her daughter wear pink", "title": "A barf bag got me a book deal: A mom offers up her questionable parenting advice", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/Johanna-Stein-Headshot-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Author Interviews, How Not to Calm a Child on a Plane, Johanna Stein, Memoirs, Parenting", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A friend said it\u2019s like the barf bag that got a book deal.\nWhen your book came out, I immediately remembered you as the lady with the barf bag story.\nIt goes so fast.\u201dStein resolutely takes the stance of \u201cquestionable source\u201d on the subject of parenting advice, which is part of what makes her book so much fun.\nAll you have to do is cover yourself in vomit, and you too can write a book!\nI do remember when I was working on the proposal and wondering, is anybody going to be interested in another so-called funny book about being a mom?"}
