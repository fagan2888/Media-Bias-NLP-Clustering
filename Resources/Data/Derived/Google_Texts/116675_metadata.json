They were within three points with the ball three times in the final 1:19, but potential game-tying 3-pointers by Elin Gustavsson, Jamie Patrick and Sofie Tryggedsson all missed.\n\nPatrick\u2019s miss came with 6 seconds left, and that appeared to seal the Rams\u2019 fate. But a steal by Hannah Tvrdy gave CSU new life.\n\nTryggedsson had a good look from the corner but her shot missed just to the right.\n\nUSF (24-9) advances to face No. 3 seed UCLA (25-8) in the second round Monday.\n\nWith USF star guard Courtney Williams benched to start the game, CSU stormed out to a 10-0 lead on the strength of consecutive 3-pointers by Patrick. But Williams entered the game soon after, and her impact was immediate and significant the rest of the way.\n\nAfter coming off the bench with her team down 10-1 with 4:41 to go in the first quarter, the Wooden Award finalist led a 20-5 USF run that gave the Bulls a five-point lead in the second quarter.\n\nCSU was able to weather the storm, ending the first half on a 9-3 run to take a 24-23 lead at the break, but the Williams-led Bulls controlled most of the second half until the Rams\u2019 late run.\n\nThe 5-foot-8 Williams scored a game-best 31 points in 35 minutes to go with six rebounds and four steals.\n\nNo other Bulls player scored in double figures.\n\nPatrick paced CSU with 17 points, while Ellen Nystrom added 12 points, eight rebounds and six assists.\n\nThe loss ends the Rams\u2019 program-record win streak at 28, nine more than the mark the team beat a month ago.\n\nCSU finished the season 31-2, the best single-season winning percentage (.939) in team history. The 31 wins are second only to the Becky Hammon-led squad that went 33-3 in 1998-99, ending its run in the Sweet 16 in Los Angeles.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado State women\u2019s record-setting year ends in first round NCAA Tournament loss", "title": "Colorado State women\u2019s record-setting year ends in first round NCAA Tournament loss", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/colorado-state-womens-record-setting-year-ends-in-first-round-ncaa-tournament-loss/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__ca89e8a97c58aa0e930f6a7067004352p1.jpg", "height": 449}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__ca89e8a97c58aa0e930f6a7067004352p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T21:16:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:43:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 This season has felt almost scripted for the Colorado State women\u2019s basketball team.\nThe loss ends the Rams\u2019 program-record win streak at 28, nine more than the mark the team beat a month ago.\nAfter trailing by 12 points in the fourth quarter, the Rams nearly pulled off an incredible comeback.\nPatrick paced CSU with 17 points, while Ellen Nystrom added 12 points, eight rebounds and six assists.\nThe 5-foot-8 Williams scored a game-best 31 points in 35 minutes to go with six rebounds and four steals."}
