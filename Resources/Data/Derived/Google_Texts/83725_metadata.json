Phone number: 909-388-8108 Website: irs.gov\n\nThe procrastinators\u2019 ritual of trying to get an April 15 postmark on a midnight envelope to the Internal Revenue Service has been largely abolished by technology.\n\nAccording to the IRS, almost all of the 96,992,000 individual income tax returns it received by April 3 of this year were by electronic filing, either through a professional tax preparer or self-prepared.\n\nBut if U.S. Postal Service workers are getting a break, taxpayers who need help from the IRS are not.\n\nPeople are flocking to the IRS office in San Bernardino, where on Monday there was a line stretching half a block, from the building to the corner of D and Third streets.\n\nAt 11:30 a.m., Ryan Fernandez of Rancho Cucamonga said it had taken him since 9 a.m. to get to the front door, and there were more lines inside.\n\nHe said staff members came out two or three times every hour to keep people informed how things are going.\n\nIn the wake of budget and staffing cuts, the IRS has fewer people available to assist taxpayers with their questions.\n\nThe IRS is not providing live phone assistance at this location. Instead, it has a phone message with instructions on how to find information at the IRS website.\n\nTaxpayers don\u2019t need appointments to visit the office but are at the mercy of the line. To get assistance, they should bring a photo ID and their Social Security number.\n\nTaxpayers who need help but don\u2019t have time to get it should consider requesting a six-month extension at the IRS\u2019s Free File Web page. An extension would make the last day to file Oct. 15, 2015.\n\nEven with an extension, taxpayers who owe money to the IRS have to pay up by one second before midnight on April 15.\n\nIf taxpayers can\u2019t pay all that they owe, they should make a partial payment. The IRS points out that penalties for failing to file can be 10 times higher than late-payment penalties.\n\nContact the writer: fbuck@pe.com or 951-368-9551.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "sailthru.author": "FIELDING BUCK", "content_author": "FIELDING BUCK", "ICBM": "33.948100, -117.396100", "sailthru.tags": "business, irs, taxpayers, april, file, extension, need, people, tax, pay, service", "content_section": "business", "content_title": "TAX SEASON: What are your last-minute filing options?", "geo.position": "33.948100;-117.396100", "author": "FIELDING BUCK", "section": "business", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-13 15:29:07", "sailthru.title": "TAX SEASON: What are your last-minute filing options?", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nmrnwu-b88382328z.120150413152907000gv2959do.10.jpg", "geo.placename": "Riverside", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nmrnwu-b88382328z.120150413152907000gv2959do.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "publication_date": "2015-04-13", "Description": "Business: TAX SEASON: What are your last-minute filing options? | irs, taxpayers, april, file, extension, need, people, tax, pay, service", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "Business: TAX SEASON: What are your last-minute filing options? | irs, taxpayers, april, file, extension, need, people, tax, pay, service", "title": "TAX SEASON: What are your last-minute filing options?", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/nmrnwu-b88382328z.120150413152907000gv2959do.10.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/irs-764650-taxpayers-april.html", "type": "article"}, "Keywords": "irs, taxpayers, april, file, extension, need, people, tax, pay, service", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nmrnwu-b88382328z.120150413152907000gv2959do.10.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd007f\"", "article_summary": "The San Bernardino Processing and Distribution Center, 1900 W.
