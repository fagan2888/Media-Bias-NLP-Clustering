Gov. Pat McCrory has decided against spending up to $230,000 in taxpayer funds remodeling bathrooms in his private living quarters at North Carolina's Executive Mansion.

McCrory spokesman Kim Genardo issued a statement Saturday saying the scope of the work would now be scaled back to "very limited amount of funds" used to repair potential code violations, remediate mold and fix broken faucets.

The Associated Press reported Friday on plans to remodel six bathrooms in the Republican governor's private living area at the historic downtown Raleigh manor. A written estimate showed more than $100,000 of planned work to the master bathroom, including new marble, woodwork, bath fixtures and a ventilated water closet.

McCrory had faced criticism for planning bathroom upgrades amid demands for belt tightening from public schools and social programs.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Gov. Pat McCrory plans to spend up to $230,000 in taxpayer funds remodeling bathrooms in his private living quarters at North Carolina's Executive Mansion even as he demands belt-tightening for public schools and social programs.

Upgrades include new marble, tubs and fixtures for six bathrooms on the upper floors of the historic Victorian-era home in Raleigh. The changes were briefly noted five pages into a long list containing $90 million in repairs and renovations sent to legislative leaders last week by State Budget Director Art Pope.

Department of Administration spokesman Chris Mears says the bathrooms were last remodeled in the 1970s, though they're in working order.

North Carolina Democratic Party spokesman Ben Ray recounted that teachers received no raises this year and suggested the Republican governor's budgeting priorities are skewed.
