What I can say is that the recognition of the Storm right throughout Victoria has certainly improved since I have been there.\n\nThe early players did a great job and were very successful but even in 2003 some people still thought we were a basketball team. The success and publicity, both good and bad, has put us on the map and we are held in high regard.\n\nDid people really mistake you for a basketball team?\n\nYes. I actually had someone say that to me. He must have thought we were a pretty short basketball team.\n\nI saw once you said you used to start work as a trackwork rider and stablehand for Gai Waterhouse at 2.30am. That sounds obscenely early!\n\nWe started at 3am but I took a little bit longer to do my stalls than everyone else so I would start at 2.30am and we would normally be finished by 8.30-9.\n\nThen we would start again at midday and go to 2.30pm. They were not great hours but horses don\u2019t know when the weekends are. We were working pretty much seven days a week. It taught me a lot about work ethic. You had to work pretty hard.\n\nTAKE PART IN OUR SUPERCOACH CHALLENGE!\n\nDid you have a racing moment that really moved you?\n\nI never saw Kingston Town run but I get goosebumps when I watch the replay when he won the Cox Plate and the racecaller said he could not win and he did. It just sends shivers down my spine.\n\nWhat did you learn from Gai Waterhouse?\n\nThe biggest thing was how diligent she was. She was always excited and enthusiastic when she came to work in the mornings. From the time she got there to the time she left she was always doing something and making sure everything was in tip top condition. It stretched all the way down to the stables being swept properly and the brass knobs on the stable doors being properly polished. It typified the lady that she was and the trainer that she is that she left no stone unturned and made sure everything was done properly.\n\nSo that stood you in good stead for you football?\n\nYes because when I came down and played with Melbourne, Craig Bellamy was just starting out and he had a very similar mindset to Gai in terms of work ethic.\n\nDid you have many blow-ups with Craig because he is so structured and you are more of a free spirit?\n\nIf I had had any blow-ups with Craig in my early years there he would have probably hailed the next cab and sent me to the airport. You didn\u2019t really have much choice when I was young but I was a young guy who wanted to work hard and Craig appreciated that sort of stuff.\n\nYour whole body shape must have expanded since you were a trackwork rider. How much did you weigh then?\n\nI have put on about 20kgm. I was about 68kg then and about 88kg now.\n\nI\u2019ve heard you still live with the dream of maybe training a few nags when you retire and maybe even racing them at the picnic races. True?\n\nIt certainly appeals to me. It\u2019s not just the racing but the breeding. I like horses in general, whether they are racehorses or leisure.\n\nI will always have that passion. One day maybe I will settle down, put the feet up and train a few.\n\nSome of the best fun I have ever had was spending Easter at a races rodeo weekend when I was a kid. To be able to do that with your family is something that definitely appeals to me.\n\nAs a boy you used to play in puddles with a Cowboys jersey on. Do you ever ponder what might have happened if you had stayed in the far north?\n\nThey are all hypotheticals. I am very happy and feel very fortunate to be associated with the Melbourne Storm. I have no regrets. If I had my time over I would be doing exactly the same thing. I feel fortunate to land on my feet in Melbourne.\n\nWho was your first football hero?\n\nAllan Langer for sure. He was a small guy and very courageous and I was quite a small kid growing up and had that in common with him.\n\nIt was interesting how you slipped through North Queensland\u2019s net because you did play rep footy in the far north didn\u2019t you?\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t play much rep footy. I made the Innisfail side but I didn\u2019t make the North Queensland sides or even the Peninsula sides in school.\n\nI didn\u2019t play in any of the carnivals so I dare say the scouts would not have been watching the Innisfail junior rugby league teams go around. That is the way it goes.\n\nI hold no grudges. You get what you are given and you get what you deserve sometimes too.\n\nWill the knee injury you are fighting at the moment threaten your longevity?\n\nI am just working pretty hard at it at the moment. It is improving at the time. Hopefully it won\u2019t jeopardise how long I play football. It is going along really nicely at the moment.\u2019\n\nMelbourne have done brilliantly to defy gravity over the past few years but there seems to be a feeling this could be the year you come back to earth. Your thoughts?\n\nThey are all tough years. The NRL is a tough competition. We would like to think we are a consistent side and we don\u2019t really look at outside perceptions and where we are going to finish.\n\nYou and Cam Smith were born on the same day. Do you give each other presents or share celebrations?\n\nWe don\u2019t give each other presents. We don\u2019t do too much because we are normally playing that weekend and it is normally around the second Origin game. Last year our 30th birthday was the day we went into Origin camp and our families surprised us by coming into camp and we had a cake. It was a very special birthday.\n\n'Simply Obsessed' with the NRL 1:01 Play video The new FOXTEL promo for the NRL 2014 season is a funny take on Tina Turner's 'Simply the Best' with must-watch cameos from Matty Johns and Nathan Hindmarsh.\n\nWho do you think will play longer?\n\nIf you went by how we were looking I might play a bit longer but he is pretty durable, old Smithy. Nothing seems to faze him. He can make 50 tackles a game do a lot of work in the middle but it does not look as if he will be bowing out any time soon.\n\nYour wife Nicole has her own career as an artist. Do you feel when you retire she will take over as the breadwinner?\n\nYes, I might have to take care of the kids and let Nicole take the reins for a while. I am very proud of what she has achieved and her ability. She is dabbling in her photography at the moment and is a very driven person. She strives for goals and works very hard to get them. She always has something on the go and is doing very nicely in her own right.\n\nNRL season officially launched 1:11 Play video 'The most exciting competition in the world' has officially launched, according to the face of the NRL, Anthony Minichiello.\n\nAre your attacking skills just a natural gift or manufactured?\n\nTo some sort of degree you have to have talent to play our game but there has to be a lot of dedication and willingness to work hard. It is a mixture.\n\nYou twice won Australia\u2019s Greatest Athlete competition. What was the main skill that got you there?\n\nProbably my competitiveness. Any successful sportsperson has to be competitive whether it be a ping pong game at training or playing rugby league. I am there to win and I will think about tactics and I did that in Australia\u2019s Greatest Athlete. In every competition I thought through what would be the best way to attack it. I am a thinker and I make sure I am on the right track.\u2019\u2019\n\nAny areas in which you really surprised yourself?\n\nProbably rock climbing. It was just helter-skelter up the wall. I surprised myself in that one a bit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BILLY Slater is one of rugby league&#8217;s most potent weapons and greatest crowd drawcards.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "CourierMail", "description": "BILLY Slater is one of rugby league&#8217;s most potent weapons and greatest crowd drawcards.", "title": "Melbourne star Billy Slater from under the radar to on top of the rugby league world", "url": "http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/melbourne-star-billy-slater-from-under-the-radar-to-on-top-of-the-rugby-league-world/story-fniabjcr-1226842378188", "image": "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2014/03/01/1226842/381774-064d974c-9f85-11e3-b163-d60ea6e39be3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2014/03/01/1226842/381774-064d974c-9f85-11e3-b163-d60ea6e39be3.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@couriermail", "id": "@couriermail"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 134856659877884}, "articleid": 1226842378188, "keywords": "rep footy, talent scouts, playing rugby league, junior rugby league, rugby league teams, peninsula sides, play rep footy, potent weapons, attacking skills, driven person, right track, football hero, ,,,Australia, Melbourne Storm, Getty Images Inc., Triple M Sydney, New South Wales, Kingston Town, Tina Turner, tough competition, rugby league, basketball team, trackwork rider, work ethic, races rodeo weekend, consistent side, outside perceptions, real answer, share celebrations, racing moment, picnic races, knee injury, body shape, natural gift, ,,,South Africa, ,Melbourne,Victoria,Australia, Anthony Minichiello, Nicole, Billy Slater, Colleen Petch, Craig Bellamy, Robert Craddock", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Mar 01 22:24:01 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sat Mar 01 22:24:01 EST 2014", "author": "Robert Craddock  Sunday Session"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37b6\"", "article_summary": "You had to work pretty hard.\nI didn\u2019t play in any of the carnivals so I dare say the scouts would not have been watching the Innisfail junior rugby league teams go around.\nAny successful sportsperson has to be competitive whether it be a ping pong game at training or playing rugby league.\nNo, I didn\u2019t play much rep footy.\nBILLY Slater is one of rugby league\u2019s most potent weapons and greatest crowd drawcards."}
