In recent years, employers have increasingly turned to wellness programs as a tool to help improve employee health and hopefully reduce or limit health care expenditures over time. In fact, according to a 2013 Rand Health study, about 50 percent of U.S. employers offer wellness programs to their employees, and the number has been on the rise.

The EEOC’s Role in Wellness Programs Nonetheless, while the ACA and the Triagency regulations trumpeted the positive benefits of wellness programs and guidelines for their use, another federal agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), is in the picture because of its enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Under the ADA, employer medical inquiries and exams are prohibited unless they are a business necessity or are “voluntary.” The connection between the ADA and many wellness programs is that the programs frequently require the completion of a health risk assessment (HRA) and some biometric screening for things like body mass index, cholesterol, blood pressure, glucose, etc., as a condition of receiving the incentive.
