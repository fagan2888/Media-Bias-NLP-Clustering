But the development at Harvard is higher overall health-insurance costs \u2014 no one favors that. Harvard chose to pass some of the higher cost on to its employees through out-of-pocket increases, which has nothing to do with the fundamental structure of Obamacare except inasmuch as it forces costs up almost everywhere.\n\nThe deductible increase is so small that it\u2019s hard to imagine that\u2019s where most of the cost increases are even ending up. One of Obamacare\u2019s financing mechanisms, the Cadillac tax, will force pricey plans like Harvard\u2019s to do more out-of-pocket financing some day, but other parts of Obamacare are driving costs up right now \u2014 Harvard refers to the Cadillac tax as a \u201cpotential\u201d cost.\n\nChait is right the Harvard example shows us that increases in out-of-pocket health spending can be really unpopular. This is a political challenge for conservative health reforms \u2014 and for liberal reforms to the extent that this is how they expand coverage.
