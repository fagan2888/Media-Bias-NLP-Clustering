However, he also said, that is not a good enough reason for him to run again in 2016.\n\nThe 2012 Republican presidential candidate says his time has come and gone and it is time for someone else to pick up that baton. And that person is very much undefined at this time.\n\nPaul Ryan, his former VP running mate says he thought Romney should run again in 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken at this time and time again,\u201d said Romney on Fox News Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m not running. I\u2019m not planning on running. I\u2019m going to be helping the person who takes the banner for us.\u201d\n\nAll that said, Romney does not feel Clinton is the best choice for America.\n\nREAD ALSO: Hillary and Mitt: Once and future front runners?\n\nPolls suggest Romney could do well, particularly considering the things President Obama derided him for that have come back to burn Obama and vindicate Romney.\n\nFor example, Obama mocked Romney\u2019s concerns over Russia, saying \u201cThe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back. The Cold War has been over for twenty years.\u201d\n\nRomney said the United States should leave a presence in Iraq and take a more proactive role in Syria. In a debate on foreign policy Obama clearly said that he did not support leaving any troops in Iraq.\n\n\u201cEvery time you\u2019ve offered an opinion, you\u2019ve been wrong,\u201d Obama said to Mitt Romney. \u201cYou said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.\u201d\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t wrong about Russia, he wasn\u2019t wrong about Iraq, and he was right when he warned that Obamacare would force millions to lose their health plans.\n\nIt is Obama who was wrong about Russia, Iraq, the terrorist spinoffs of al-Qaeda, and lost health plans. He was wrong for America then and, according to polls, now.\n\nAll of this adds luster to Romney. A recent USA /Today poll of Iowa voters shows Romney with a huge lead over other possible Republican candidates.\n\nRomney feels Clinton will be wrong for America; he says she lacks the qualifications for the job.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve also got to have people who\u2019ve actually run something,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government of the United States is the largest enterprise in the world. You watched a president who just doesn\u2019t understand how to make an administration work, how to interact with Congress, how to get things done. You have to have those things. I don\u2019t think Hillary Clinton has that experience.\u201d\n\nHe says he won\u2019t run again, though he stops short of saying \u201cnever.\u201d He hedges his bets, saying that he is \u201cnot planning on running\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are other good people who I\u2019m sure will be able to lead the country in the future. I wish it were me,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cIt was a great experience running for president. I loved that. But my time has \u2026 come and gone. I had that opportunity. I ran, I didn\u2019t win. And now, it\u2019s time for someone else to pick up the baton.\u201d\n\nPat Buchanan\u2019s appearance on The McLaughlin Group could be entitled \u201cHe that doeth protest too much,\u201d as he predicts Romney is going to run in 2016.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Mitt Romney are in the establishment category or bracket that are headed for the finals,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cI think Mitt would come out first but I really don\u2019t see Bush as really having the drive or inner drive. And I think, then you get Mitt Romney against someone like a Cruz, or someone like that, and I think that would be the finals. And I think that Mitt has got it in his heart to do this thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only cure for presidential fever is embalming fluid. I think he\u2019s going to run,\u201d Buchanan said to host John McLaughlin.\n\nBuchanan cautioned the GOP about nominating Romney, saying that he doubted Romney could \u201cmake the kind of historic comeback Nixon accomplished in 1968.\u201d But that comment might have been more about his recent book, The Greatest Comeback: How Richard Nixon Rose from Defeat to Create the New Majority, than about Mitt Romney\n\nRomney lost a race he should have won because of a series of verbal missteps, not substance. Comments about his wife\u2019s Cadillacs and not being concerned over the \u201cvery poor\u201d played badly with voters.\n\nBut are voters willing to forgive those statements now that our White House is in such disarray?\n\nREAD ALSO: August 2014 update to the Obama scandals handbook\n\n\n\nThere is an illegal immigration crisis at the border. ISIS has exploded from what Obama called a \u201cJV squad\u201d to a serious national threat. Crises in Ukraine and Syria make it plain that Russia remains a serious foe. And let\u2019s not forget the too-quiet-all-summer Trey Gowdy and his commission to investigate Benghazi, the IRS scandal that has Lois Lerner in contempt, the ongoing Veterans Administration scandal, Bowe Bergdahl, EPA harrassments, HHS and Obamacare, NSA spying, and the unresolved Fast and Furious.\n\nAll of this could taint Democrats in the 2014 midterm elections, as well as hurting Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential run.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Polls say Americans would prefer Romney over Obama.
