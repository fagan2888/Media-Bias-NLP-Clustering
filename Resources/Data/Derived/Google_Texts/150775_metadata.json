Terry McAuliffe\u2019s top legislative priority.\n\nAs midnight approached, the plan moved over for consideration by the House of Delegates, where it quickly passed. It was expected to then head to McAuliffe\u2019s desk, but with no certainty that he would approve it and avert a government shutdown before July 1.\n\nMcAuliffe quickly issued a statement after the House vote: \u201cWhen this budget reaches my desk I will evaluate it carefully and take the actions that I deem necessary, but this fight is far from over. This is the right thing to do for Virginia, and I will not rest until we get it done.\u201d\n\nThe Senate vote came after Republicans huddled behind closed doors and argued \u2014 at times yelling, two participants said \u2014 over whether they should tinker with the budget deal and risk undermining it.\n\nSome were incensed that legislators had returned to the Capitol from the farthest reaches of the commonwealth, expecting to pass a spending plan in time to avert a July 1 government shutdown, only to risk sinking the deal by amending it.\n\nSen. Richard H. Black (R-Loudoun) wanted to introduce a floor amendment intended to prevent McAuliffe (D) \u2014 or an independent Medicaid commission \u2014 from expanding Medicaid without the General Assembly\u2019s explicit approval. Black\u2019s caucus eventually settled on an alternative that eliminates the wording Black had been concerned with and would require that the General Assembly authorize any increased spending on Medicaid.\n\nEither way, Democrats said the amendments would kill any chance of Medicaid expansion for the next two years. \u201cIt was nonsense,\u201d Sen. Chap Petersen said. \u201cWe are actually increasing taxes on our citizens by rejecting $2 billion in federal money. Stupidest thing I ever heard of.\u201d\n\nCountered Black: \u201cThis was a stunning victory for the Republicans. We passed a budget in a single night and we have effectively blocked Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nA single Democrat, Lynwood Lewis, voted for the budget.\n\nSenate Republicans found themselves divided over Black\u2019s amendment just three days after they gained control of the chamber, and two days after House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) suffered a stunning primary loss to Dave Brat, an underfunded, little-known candidate backed by the tea party.\n\nThe discontent that felled Cantor loomed over the GOP meeting, with some explicitly invoking the loss as a caution against passing anything that might be construed as supporting the Affordable Care Act, said one senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss private caucus matters.\n\nNews of the GOP discord leaked out via Twitter even as the party\u2019s Senate caucus was privately fighting it out. A tweet from Sen. Tom Garrett (R-Louisa) said, \u201c#blackorbust I WON\u2019T vote for a budget that lacks #dickblack amendment,\u201d and \u201cThe full GA should vote up or down on #medicaidexpansion. No tricks.\u201d\n\nBlack\u2019s push came after expansion opponents have argued for months that Medicaid expansion and the budget should be considered separately.\n\nMcAuliffe, who made Medicaid expansion the centerpiece of his campaign last fall, vowed during the race and at some points as governor that he would not sign a budget that did not provide health insurance to 400,000 uninsured Virginians.\n\nHis office has not indicated whether he would go along with the current budget plan, which House and Senate budget negotiators started hashing out behind the scenes a few weeks ago after new state revenue forecasts projected a $1.5 billion shortfall over the two-year budget period.\n\n\u201cObviously, he wants Medicaid in there \u2014 he thinks it\u2019s the right thing for Virginia. But right now, it\u2019s the General Assembly\u2019s responsibility to send him a budget, and the governor will review it carefully,\u201d McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy said earlier in the week. \u201cWe will make announcements about whatever actions he takes when the review is complete.\u201d\n\nBlack raised concerns the previous day about language in the budget that he feared would allow McAuliffe to expand Medicaid administration. The language states: \u201cThere is hereby appropriated sum sufficient nongeneral funds for such costs as may be incurred to implement coverage for newly eligible individuals pursuant to . . . the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nMatthew Moran, a spokesman for House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford), has said the language would not give a governor authority to expand Medicaid on his own. He said it was carried over from the previous budget. Its purpose is to authorize additional Medicaid spending if \u2014 and only if \u2014 a state Medicaid commission set up by the legislature agrees to expansion, he said.\n\nThe budget plan calls for holding most state spending at current levels to account for a projected budget shortfall. The rival budget plans produced by the House and Senate during the regular General Assembly session were both more flush, with extra money for state employee pay raises, universities, hospitals and K-12 education.\n\nBut those plans died when legislators failed to strike a budget deal before the regular session concluded March 8. McAuliffe, Senate Democrats and three moderate Republicans in that chamber support expanding health-care coverage to as many as 400,000 uninsured Virginians. The GOP-dominated House is firmly opposed, questioning whether Washington can afford to keep its promise to pick up most of the $2 billion-a-year tab.\n\nState budget officials said the cause of the shortfall was primarily a miscalculation of capital gains tax revenue; forecasters misinterpreted a one-time spike, triggered by an anticipated change in federal tax policy, as a long-term rise that they could count on in the current budget and beyond.\n\nThe projected shortfall added urgency to the long-stalled negotiations. So did the fast-approaching July 1 deadline.\n\nThe breakthrough came Monday, when a Democratic senator stepped down, suddenly giving Republicans a 20-to-19 edge in the chamber.\n\nThe three moderate Senate Republicans continue to support a form of Medicaid expansion. Even with the departure of Sen. Phillip P. Puckett (D-Russell), expansion supporters still outnumber opponents in that chamber 22 to 17.\n\nBut with the House showing no signs of budging and a potential shutdown looming, they have agreed that the budget must come first. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles J. Colgan (D-Prince William), has also indicated that he thinks the state needs to get a budget in place first.\n\nIt remains to be seen how McAuliffe will react to the budget. Once it reaches his desk, he will have seven days to make changes and send the bill back to the legislature.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If approved by full Senate and House later Thursday, it will head to McAuliffe\u2019s desk", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "If approved by full Senate and House later Thursday, it will head to McAuliffe\u2019s desk", "title": "Virginia Senate passes state budget after rancorous debate over Medicaid expansion", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/in-virginia-senate-panel-approves-budget-without-medicaid-in-effort-to-avert-shutdown/2014/06/12/326d071a-f1b3-11e3-914c-1fbd0614e2d4_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, virginia medicaid, virginia budget, terry mcauliffe", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "news_keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, virginia medicaid, virginia budget, terry mcauliffe", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "326d071a-f1b3-11e3-914c-1fbd0614e2d4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6d5d\"", "article_summary": "No tricks.\u201dBlack\u2019s push came after expansion opponents have argued for months that Medicaid expansion and the budget should be considered separately.\nEither way, Democrats said the amendments would kill any chance of Medicaid expansion for the next two years.\nThe budget plan calls for holding most state spending at current levels to account for a projected budget shortfall.\nIts purpose is to authorize additional Medicaid spending if \u2014 and only if \u2014 a state Medicaid commission set up by the legislature agrees to expansion, he said.\nThe three moderate Senate Republicans continue to support a form of Medicaid expansion."}
