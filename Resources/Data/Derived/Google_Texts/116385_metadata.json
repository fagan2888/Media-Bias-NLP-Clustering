A sign of life. On the news, I caught glimpses of David Wright making those loose, easy first throws of training camp. George Harrison\u2019s voice filled my head.\n\nThe emails should start coming any week now. As soon as the blades of grass outnumber the snowflakes, somebody is going to try to get our Sunday softball game up and running. It took about 60 inches of snow to finally put the game down for the winter, after some of the boys tried to keep playing even after temperatures started dipping into the 30s.\n\n\u201cGame on!\u201d the subject lines would say, sometimes in all caps, sometimes with multiple exclamation points. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be clear and in the 40s! Who\u2019s in for softball on Sunday?\u201d\n\nAt 40 degrees, I was most certainly not in for softball. I can just imagine the sound of my rotator cuff tearing on a frosty December morning, like a frozen branch snapping off a tree.\n\nSo I didn\u2019t respond, even as enthusiastic replies flooded my inbox. Almost enough for a full game.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon guys, it\u2019s big-boy time,\u201d the next email said. It was from George. \u201cDrag yourselves down to the field like the beer-swilling, [expletive], football-watching, [expletive], meat-eating, hammer-swinging men that we are.\u201d\n\nMore emails followed. They urged and implored, cajoled and castigated. To not want to play softball, they reminded us, was to call into question our masculinity and sexuality, our patriotism, our belief system and moral code. I was fine with that.\n\nI have, instead, spent the off-season reading about 19th-century baseball (and watching so-called \u201cMets Classics\u201d on television: \u201cBenny Agbayani\u2019s Big Day!\u201d), and I have been struck by the direct genetic relationship between our weekly softball doubleheader and the antebellum game of town ball.\n\nIt was named, at least in part, because a game was most likely to spring up when all the outliers had occasion to venture into town \u2014 for the Fourth of July, say, or Election Day. Tied into such events, the game was inherently nationalistic, even without the bump from the born-in-America myths. It was an organic happening, a reaffirming of community, when friends and neighbors bonded through the shared experience of physical game play. Toward the middle of the century, clubs were formed for men to play town ball or the modified \u201cbase-ball\u201d \u2014 mostly as intramural affairs but eventually expanding to include interclub challenges.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom March to December (generally), our group performs the same kind of ritualistic gathering every Sunday morning at an elementary school ball field in Port Washington. Players drive in from all over Long Island \u2014 from Syosset and Massapequa and, in George\u2019s case, from Mastic, a little more than an hour away. Some have been playing the game for decades; some watched their fathers play. At 44, I\u2019m somewhere in the middle of our age curve. We have contractors and mechanics, cardiologists and dentists, graphic designers, bankers and lawyers. Try arguing the infield-fly rule with a lawyer.\n\nIt is a self-governed game, with teams divided into comparable sides and playing by an amalgam of baseball, softball and schoolyard rules. Disputes arise. The strike zone is something of a free-form abstraction. And we have a fouling-out rule that is a bottomless wellspring of constitutional-style debate.\n\nThe peace is kept in large part by our de facto commissioner, Mark, who puts his skills as a legal marketing executive to good use. He\u2019s just one of our characters. Jarrod \u2014 J-Rod \u2014 is the dispenser of nicknames as well as some of the vilest infield banter ever heard; Hugh dives headfirst for every fly ball and into every base; Spence sprinkles outfield chatter with Yiddish; and Rich \u2014 Tino \u2014 is a pull-hitting left-handed first baseman with the demeanor of an oversize puppy (shake a ball and throw it, and he\u2019ll run after it).\n\nThen there is George.\n\nGeorge drove tanks in the Army; now George is a tank, a regular Old Hoss Radbourn, pitching for both teams in both games when we are short players. He swings a wood bat, and he has the Yankees logo and Thurman Munson\u2019s No. 15 tattooed on his arm. Every week he takes line drives to the arms, thighs and belly. He proudly displays his hideous bruises, gimps around the mound and keeps pitching.\n\nGruff as he appears, George is the consummate town ball gentleman, tirelessly serving up hittable pitches. He pitches me low and away, where I like it, but he\u2019ll happily go high and inside to Chris, a savage tomahawker who petitions to play more innings every week. Chris would have loved town ball, with games sometimes played to 100 runs.\n\nIn those formative years, winning was not the presiding objective. More so, the men were there to compete, to bond in a healthful, upstanding manner. For professional men in the urban centers, it became a valued source of clean, wholesome recreation. For us, their descendants, it may not always be that. But it\u2019s as close as it gets.\n\nCertainly we play to win, but that\u2019s not why we play. We play to make that one backhanded stab deep in the hole or to rip that one double into the gap \u2014 or even just to land that one good zinger and draw a laugh. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s schoolyard softball or basketball at the Y or midnight hockey: All games have their stories and their characters. It is a universal and archetypal experience.\n\nThis has been a long, cold, lonely winter. The ice is slowly melting. I know the boys are eager to play ball. I am, too. And every day that patch of grass sprouting out of the ice becomes a little bit larger.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140301160045, "twitter": {"description": "A softball player on Long Island sees the game and its characters as a reaffirmation of community.", "title": "Yearning for the Fields of Summer", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/sports/yearning-for-the-fields-of-summer.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002742603"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/02/sports/SOFTBALLdog/SOFTBALLdog-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/sports/yearning-for-the-fields-of-summer.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002742603", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/sports/yearning-for-the-fields-of-summer.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sports", "hdl_p": "Yearning for the Fields of Summer", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 1, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Softball,Long Island (NY)", "news_keywords": "Softball", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "David Vecsey", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/02/sports/SOFTBALLdog/SOFTBALLdog-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By DAVID VECSEY", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A softball player on Long Island sees the game and its characters as a reaffirmation of community.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/02/sports/SOFTBALLdog/SOFTBALLdog-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "A softball player on Long Island sees the game and its characters as a reaffirmation of community.", "CG": "sports", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 1, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/sports/index.html", "section": "Sports", "modified": "2014-04-09", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/index.jsonp", "tag": "Long Island (NY)", "published": "2014-03-01", "section-taxonomy-id": "DE2B278B-2783-4506-AAD5-C15A5BB6DA1A"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Long Island (NY)", "slug": "02softball", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140409101256, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/sports/yearning-for-the-fields-of-summer.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/02/sports/SOFTBALLdog/SOFTBALLdog-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A softball player on Long Island sees the game and its characters as a reaffirmation of community.", "title": "Yearning for the Fields of Summer"}, "pdate": 20140301, "des": "Softball", "articleid": 100000002742603, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Yearning for the Fields of Summer", "col": "Essay", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3357\"", "article_summary": "As soon as the blades of grass outnumber the snowflakes, somebody is going to try to get our Sunday softball game up and running.\nIt was an organic happening, a reaffirming of community, when friends and neighbors bonded through the shared experience of physical game play.\nTo not want to play softball, they reminded us, was to call into question our masculinity and sexuality, our patriotism, our belief system and moral code.\nChris would have loved town ball, with games sometimes played to 100 runs.\nI know the boys are eager to play ball."}
