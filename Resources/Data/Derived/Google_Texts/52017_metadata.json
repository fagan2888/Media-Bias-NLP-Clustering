But, the logistics of that arrangement mean kids more often have to play in a field or have recess indoors, Assistant Principal David VanDyke said Monday.\n\nThe school corporation\u2019s property insurance has a $100,000 deductible per incident, spokeswoman Sue Coney said. So, the entire cost of rebuilding the playground must be borne by the corporation and the school.\n\nOn Monday, Coney said lowering or eliminating those deductibles has not been considered because to do so would drive up the cost of premiums.\n\nInitial cost estimates to replace the playground were more than $95,000, but a smaller alternative plan has been pegged at about $18,000.\n\nOfficials have said the district will pay $7,500 toward that if Harrison can raise the rest.\n\nSo far, the school has $1,000 toward that goal. But efforts are still underway, the assistant principal said.\n\nA special fundraising event called \u201cRestore Our Playground\u201d will begin at 6 p.m. Friday at the South Bend Eagles at 61601 S. Ironwood Drive.\n\nIt\u2019ll feature food, drink, a silent auction and the music of The VanDyke Revue, Assistant Principal VanDyke\u2019s own band. Tickets can be obtained at the door, if the event is not sold out, or in advance by calling 574-235-7325. Anyone wishing to contribute to the silent auction or toward the playground restoration fund, can call the school at 574-283-7300 to do so.\n\nSchool officials hope to have a new playground installed by the time the 2015-16 school year begins in August.\n\nFor Harrison students, 94 percent of whom come from backgrounds of poverty, VanDyke said, it\u2019ll undoubtedly be a welcome sight.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "SOUTH BEND \u2014 It\u2019s been more than a year since a playground at Harrison Primary Center was set on fire and destroyed by three young children.", "title": "Harrison playground fundraiser", "url": "http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/education/harrison-playground-fundraiser/article_e50bb703-1022-529d-a3de-5bb0628905d5.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/7c/87ce8adf-bbc6-55b7-990a-5a0511dae864/553f190d0b8fd.image.jpg?resize=760%2C507", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/7c/87ce8adf-bbc6-55b7-990a-5a0511dae864/553f190d0b8fd.image.jpg?resize=760%2C507", "description": "SOUTH BEND \u2014 It\u2019s been more than a year since a playground at Harrison Primary Center was set on fire and destroyed by three young children.", "site": "@sbtribune", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Harrison playground fundraiser"}, "description": "SOUTH BEND \u2014 It\u2019s been more than a year since a playground at Harrison Primary Center was set on fire and destroyed by three young children.", "Published Date": "2015-04-28T06:00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 368553839952510}, "google-site-verification": "3g1dW83HuQbWT4MB-AtH0czzqvwh0eF8rwGwC6sjOhM", "keywords": "#loc,education,local", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/292274944144605"}, "news_keywords": "#loc,education,local"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd82f6\"", "article_summary": "For Harrison students, 94 percent of whom come from backgrounds of poverty, VanDyke said, it\u2019ll undoubtedly be a welcome sight.\nSOUTH BEND \u2014 It\u2019s been more than a year since a playground at Harrison Primary Center was set on fire and destroyed by three young children.\nThe students who previously used the playground switch on and off using another one designed for older students at the west-side school.\nSchool officials hope to have a new playground installed by the time the 2015-16 school year begins in August.\nSo, the entire cost of rebuilding the playground must be borne by the corporation and the school."}
