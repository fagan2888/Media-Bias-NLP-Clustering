(It\u2019s not an issue for the primaries. Even her closest rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, admits he\u2019s not well known in the black community).\n\n\u201cThe question is the degree to which she can really generate enthusiasm among African-Americans,\u201d says David Bositis, a political analyst who wrote a book on the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nRecommended: How much do you know about Hillary Rodham Clinton? Take our quiz.\n\nWhat Clinton may not be able to generate through enthusiasm, however, she\u2019s trying to make up for through sheer hard work \u2013 outreach, mobilization, messaging.\n\n\u201cAfrican-American turnout is an issue, and it\u2019s very smart to start early,\u201d says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake in an e-mail.\n\nAfrican-Americans may vote in fewer numbers in 2016 not only because Mr. Obama is no longer on the ballot, but because new black voters, especially, have become frustrated, analysts say. Their high hopes have been dashed by high unemployment and racial violence in places such as Baltimore, Md., and Charleston, S.C.\n\nOther issues may come into play, such as insensitive remarks by the Clintons in the 2008 presidential campaign about then-candidate Obama and President Clinton\u2019s tough-on-crime policies that have been widely criticized as having contributed to high incarceration rates for blacks. African-American votes for Obama overpowered Hillary Clinton in the southern states during their 2008 contest.\n\nClinton has tried to counter that with speeches on voting rights and criminal justice reform, by bringing African-Americans into top posts in her campaign, reaching out to key figures such as the Rev. Al Sharpton, and building black support in early states \u2013 for instance meeting local NAACP members in Iowa.\n\nHer Monday economic speech on the middle class and income inequality, in which she praised Obama for his policies but said the nation had to go further on issues such as wages and pay inequality for women \u2013 particularly women of color \u2013 speaks to African-American concerns, analysts say.\n\n\u201cClinton is making the effort to reach out to the Democratic Party's most loyal voting bloc because she doesn't want to take their vote for granted \u2013 a charge that is often levied against Democrats,\u201d writes Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta, in an e-mail.\n\nSome analysts don\u2019t think the challenge for Clinton with black voters is as great as it\u2019s made out to be. Yes, African-Americans may have been frustrated with joblessness under the Obama administration, but their turnout in 2012 was about the same as in 2008, points out Cornell Belcher, a former Obama pollster.\n\n\u201cI heard all this talk about the African-Americans disappointed with Obama in 2012,\u201d says Mr. Belcher. \u201cYou hear that from the chattering classes.\u201d\n\nBlack approval of Obama has remained high throughout his presidency, and African-Americans have benefited from policies such as the Affordable Care Act and the auto industry bailout. This week, the president commuted the sentences of 46 nonviolent federal drug offenders in an effort to make the criminal justice system fairer.\n\nClinton is smart to build on Obama\u2019s legacy, Belcher says.\n\nThe marks against the Clintons from the 2008 campaign and earlier are also not indelible, according to pollsters.\n\n\u201cWater under the bridge,\u201d comments Mr. Bositis, while Ms. Lake says the Clintons are still \u201cvery popular\u201d with African-American voters. Those voters believe the economy was much better for them under the Clinton presidency and they think \u201cit\u2019s great\u201d that Hillary Clinton worked for Obama as secretary of State even after a hard-fought battle.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton may actually have an edge among African-American voters because 60 percent of that electorate is female.\n\n\u201cThe Hillary campaign has some challenges. Yes, you want to see enthusiasm. But the minority electorate is determined not to turn the clock back,\u201d says pollster Belcher. \u201cI like determination over enthusiasm.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "58d3c730c807a5755f3390c22488d012", "sailthru.author": "Francine Kiefer", "description": "African-American voters came out in historic numbers for Barack Obama and some analysts have posited that Clinton may not attract the same enthusiasm from the critical voting bloc.", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/07/921408_1_0712-HILLARY-SPEECH-sized.jpg_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "African-American voters came out in historic numbers for Barack Obama and some analysts have posited that Clinton may not attract the same enthusiasm from the critical voting bloc.", "title": "Can Hillary Clinton generate enthusiasm among black voters?", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2015/0714/Can-Hillary-Clinton-generate-enthusiasm-among-black-voters", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/07/921408_1_0712-HILLARY-SPEECH-sized.jpg_standard.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@csmonitor", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/07/921408_1_0712-HILLARY-SPEECH-sized.jpg_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "description": "African-American voters came out in historic numbers for Barack Obama and some analysts have posited that Clinton may not attract the same enthusiasm from the critical voting bloc.", "card": "summary", "title": "Can Hillary Clinton generate enthusiasm among black voters?"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-14", "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-14T10:04:43-04:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/USA/Politics/2015/0714/Can-Hillary-Clinton-generate-enthusiasm-among-black-voters", "sailthru.tags": "section-politics,section-usa,class-article,storysource-monitor", "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-07-14T10:04-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "Seth Wenig/AP"}, "article_summary": "Some analysts don\u2019t think the challenge for Clinton with black voters is as great as it\u2019s made out to be.\nMeanwhile, Clinton may actually have an edge among African-American voters because 60 percent of that electorate is female.\nAfrican-American votes for Obama overpowered Hillary Clinton in the southern states during their 2008 contest.\n\u201cWater under the bridge,\u201d comments Mr. Bositis, while Ms. Lake says the Clintons are still \u201cvery popular\u201d with African-American voters.\nAfrican-American voters came out in historic numbers for Barack Obama and some analysts have posited that Clinton may not attract the same enthusiasm from the critical voting bloc."}
