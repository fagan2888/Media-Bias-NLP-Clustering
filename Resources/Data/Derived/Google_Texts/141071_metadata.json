Expenses were high the previous month, and while the kids are getting stoked for turkey, it falls to their mom to tell them the truth: There will be no turkey this year. Little Tommy is incredulous: \"No turkey for Thanksgiving?\" Dick, the oldest, notes that everyone else on the block will have a turkey. \"A fat lot we're gonna have to be thankful for,\" he sulks.\n\nWhat follows, predictably, is a heartwarming meditation on the true meaning of the holiday. But the film is unusual among feel-good holiday fare in that it falls into the Orwellian-sounding genre of \u201cmental hygiene\u201d movies which, according to The New York Times' Ken Smith, had its roots in World War II-era propaganda films. This movie, A Day of Thanksgiving, was produced by the Lawrence, Kansas-based Centron Corporation, a studio that churned out educational films aimed at molding the character of America\u2019s youth. Other installments, paid for in part by state governments, dealt with such societal ills as bullying, prejudice, and venereal disease.\n\nA Day of Thanksgiving came out in 1951, in the context of the early Cold War, with American troops battling communists in Korea and Senator Joseph McCarthy kicking his investigations of suspected American communists into high gear. As such, the film extolls the virtues of capitalist democracy\u2014even, as in the Johnsons' case, when you can't afford turkey. After all, Thanksgiving, as O. Henry pointed out at the turn of the 20th century, \"is the one day of the year that is purely American.\" And America, per Mr. Johnson, is a set of freedoms and privileges that, by the 1950s, has produced abundance beyond the pilgrims' imaginings. \"Do you know,\" Johnson asks his kids, \"that there are some places in the world today where you have to get along without just about everything else\" besides life itself?", "article_metadata": {"description": "A heartwarming 1950s holiday film about the virtues of capitalism", "author": "Kathy Gilsinan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A heartwarming 1950s holiday film about the virtues of capitalism", "title": "The Meaning of Thanksgiving, as Told Through Cold War Propaganda", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/11/Screen_Shot_2014_11_26_at_2.32.12_PM/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/the-meaning-of-thanksgiving-as-told-through-cold-war-propaganda/383221/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf80\"", "article_summary": "But the film is unusual among feel-good holiday fare in that it falls into the Orwellian-sounding genre of \u201cmental hygiene\u201d movies which, according to The New York Times' Ken Smith, had its roots in World War II-era propaganda films.\nThe Johnsons, a fictional Midwestern family, are in for a letdown one Thanksgiving in the 1950s.\nLittle Tommy is incredulous: \"No turkey for Thanksgiving?\"\nA Day of Thanksgiving came out in 1951, in the context of the early Cold War, with American troops battling communists in Korea and Senator Joseph McCarthy kicking his investigations of suspected American communists into high gear.\nThis movie, A Day of Thanksgiving, was produced by the Lawrence, Kansas-based Centron Corporation, a studio that churned out educational films aimed at molding the character of America\u2019s youth."}
