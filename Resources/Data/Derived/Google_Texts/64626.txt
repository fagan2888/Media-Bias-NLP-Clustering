PA-12: McClelland Endorsed by USW Local 1196

Written by Nick Field, Contributing Writer

Democratic Congressional candidate Erin McClelland received the endorsement today of the United Steelworkers Local 1196.

The 1196 is the oldest USW local in the United States and it represents the workers of the ATI Allegheny Ludlum.

“I grew up in the Alle-Kiski Valley and have friends and family that have worked at Allegheny Ludlum,” McClelland responded. “USW 1196 represents the heart of what was once called ‘Death Valley’ due to the many men and women who died fighting for safe working conditions, fair wages, and a reasonable workday. I am honored to stand with the United Steelworkers as we fight to maintain the economy ladder of opportunity that leads to prosperity, allowing the children of labor everywhere to inherit a better country than they found.”

“The brothers and sisters of USW 1196 are proud to endorse Erin McClelland in her bid to be the next representative of Pennsylvania’s 12th Congressional district,” USW 1196 President Fran Arabia said. “We need more people like that in Congress, and we’re confident Erin McClelland will be a champion for working families.”

The McClelland campaign noted that the Gamesa USA wind turbine plant in Cambria County recently closed, a development they blamed on GOP Rep. Keith Rothfus and his complicity in letting a wind energy tax credit expire.

This is the second union endorsement of the week for McClelland, who also earned the backing of the IBEW 29 on Tuesday.

McClelland is currently competing against John Hugya, former Rep. John Murtha’s Chief of Staff and a Korean War veteran, for the Democratic nomination in the 12th district.
