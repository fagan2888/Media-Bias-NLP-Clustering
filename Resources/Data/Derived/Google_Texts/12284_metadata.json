KSN\u2019s Darren Dedo and KSNT\u2019s Natalie Davis sat down with Governor Sam Brownback for an exclusive interview. We talked about the issues facing our state. We are presenting the entire interview without editing or cuts so that the people of Kansas can see our full conversation with the Governor. He talked about tax cuts, education funding, welfare reform and other topics.\n\n1) Tax Plan\n\nKSN\u2019s Darren Dedo: \u201cThank you for joining us today, Governor. We appreciate it. Let\u2019s talk about your economic experiment, built on massive tax cuts. Now this year, the state did have to deal with that $600 million deficit. Could a change in your economic policies have prevented that?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Kansas has been on this long-term, downward trajectory. Bob Dole\u2019s first elected into the U.S. Congress in the old Sixth Congressional District. We\u2019re down to four now, we\u2019re headed to three. We were the 28th most populous state in the nation, we\u2019re 32nd now. And so you could say, \u2018Well, all right, let\u2019s just stay with that and we\u2019ll continue in the decline\u2019. And we said, \u2018no, let\u2019s try to change it\u2019. One of the big, several of the big, problems right now is oil and gas is doing really poorly. We\u2019re a big oil and gas state. Agriculture is doing poorly right now. We\u2019re a big agriculture state. Small jets, we\u2019re not selling small jets. So, none of that, all of that is there and in place. I think our policy is working. We\u2019re getting more small businesses than ever before to register in the state of Kansas. We\u2019ve had a 40 percent increase in flow of funds from Missouri into the state of Kansas. We\u2019ve got an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent. We\u2019ve created over 70,000 new private sector jobs. Most of that in the small business space. So, you\u2019ve got some big mega-factors that we can\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cOf course, the businesses are not taxed in Kansas and if they were?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cThe LLC\u2019s and Sub S\u2019s \u2014 big businesses continue taxed \u2014 your C Corp.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cSo, if the smaller businesses were taxed \u2014 I think I\u2019ve seen somewhere that maybe $200 million would be generated?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cIf you didn\u2019t allow deductions for losses.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cI guess what I\u2019m trying to get at, is, you know the state\u2019s bond rating has been downgraded. We have about $6 million, I believe, in reserves. When do we get to a critical point when something drastic has to be done because the state\u2019s running out of money?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cMy hope is, I think, that we\u2019re past that. We had this situation now that we\u2019re in. We just came forward with, here\u2019s a series of things that we\u2019re trying to do to fix the issues that we\u2019ve had. Our objective all along has been to grow the economy, not the government. So we\u2019re trying to get more money out to the private sector and that\u2019s happening. Our wage rates are going up in the state of Kansas. Our income for small businesses are going up in the state of Kansas. Our net increase of family income has gone up in the state of Kansas. So our objective is to get more money and to keep it in the people\u2019s hands in the state of Kansas. And then long-term that grows you. Your fastest growing states in the country, by and large, are those with no income tax. Nine states have no income tax.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cLike Texas and Florida?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cTexas, Florida, South Dakota, Tennessee, State of Washington, Alaska, Nevada. These are your fastest growing states in the country \u2014 by and large, not exclusively \u2014 and your slowest growing states, by and large, are those with the highest income tax rates. So, we\u2019re trying to get from a high income tax state to a low, or no income tax state.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cLet\u2019s go back to that because the state added just less than 9,000 jobs over the past year. That was a rate of 0.6 percent, the eighth worst rate in the country over that time period, while the rest of the U.S. has seen a growth rate of two percent. Why do you think Kansas is lagging behind in that?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cYou can look at this last period of time and we were one of the fastest growing states in the country. It depends on the data point that you go from, and we go up and down in this. But we\u2019ve had 70,000+ new private sector jobs. We are starting now to get up higher in our region average when you look at it over a period of time. Plus, oil and gas is shedding jobs, agriculture is shedding jobs, the small jets still haven\u2019t picked up. Your, three of your big\u2019s are still not doing well in this state.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cBut are you worried that that trend will continue, and then we get to a point where maybe you have to revisit your tax cuts and maybe eliminate them? Do we ever get to that point?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cWell, you\u2019re always looking at tax policy. But the thrust of this tax policy \u2014 which is to grow small business, because that\u2019s where 70 percent of the people work \u2014 is working by the numbers. It\u2019s not working to raise the price of oil, or to increase the sale of small jets. It is working in the Kansas City market aggressively, which is one of our best opportunities to grow, is in that Kansas City region where we share a major metropolitan area with another state.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cThese numbers came out for October recently that revenue receipts were down $15 million below expectations, and since the current fiscal year began back in July, collections have been short of expectations by about $78 million which is 4.1 percent. It seems like this trend is continuing. What can we do to stop the bleeding? What needs to be done to stop that?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cA great Christmas season would be wonderful because most of that is sales tax. It\u2019s not income taxes which were off.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cWhich you raised. Right?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cThe sales tax has gone from, when I started, 6.3 percent. It\u2019s now 6.5. It was supposed to dip, it did dip down to 6.1. It was supposed to be a penny off. That kept and now it\u2019s 6.5 on the sales tax rate. My point of it is, people look at this and say \u2018Your income tax isn\u2019t producing\u2019. No, the income tax is hitting the revenue projections, it\u2019s the sales tax. And this happens to be a nationwide feature. people are not spending right now. There\u2019s a nervousness in the economy that we\u2019re certainly feeling and a lot of states are too. \u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cAnd I\u2019m wondering, do we have enough population in our state to have enough people spend to generate enough money to fill some of these holes?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cWe need more people. Kansas needs more people. We\u2019ve got an unemployment rate.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cWhich you\u2019re trying to get more businesses here.\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cAnd we actually got in-migration in 2014 into the state of Kansas. The first time we\u2019ve had it, really, since the recession, well the last several years. We\u2019re starting to get it but these things take time to do it. I can tell you if we stayed on the old trajectory, I could tell you where we\u2019re going to stay, and that was continuing a long-term decline relative to the rest of the country. Our population has increased but not at the rate of the rest of the nation.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cSo as we quickly wrap things up here, in your opinion, your estimation, do you feel good where the state is right now economically?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cI think we are well positioned to grow. You\u2019re going to need some breaks in getting some jets sold in this state. We\u2019re going to need to continue to be very competitive in the Kansas City market, and we need some of these commodity prices to go up for us, but I think we are well positioned for what we can do in growth and particularly for small business.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cYou see a path to prosperity it sounds like.\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cI do \u2014 a path for growth. And our people are getting more income. Our small businesses are making more income. Our individuals, they\u2019re growing. Their family income is growing, overall, by the numbers.\u201d\n\nRELATED LINK | Local officials react to the governor\u2019s comments about aviation and the state\u2019s economy\n\n2) Education Funding\n\nKSNT\u2019s Natalie Davis: \u201cLets start with what was in the news recently on Monday. Twenty five school districts requested and received emergency state funding. Is this a concern to you that this many school districts needed emergency aid?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cNo, because this is a new process that they didn\u2019t have before. Before, when these sort of things happened, where they had a huge devaluation like, what\u2019s happening in oil and gas regions of the state. You\u2019ve got half the valuation knocked out. School districts just had to deal with it. Now, you\u2019ve got a process where, if you lose a lot of valuation, you can come and appeal to the state, and they filled in most of the hole. The other thing that\u2019s really nice about it is, prior, whenever you lost student enrollment, well you had a loss of funding from the state, but yet your costs are pretty fixed by that point in time. Well, now that money isn\u2019t taken away by the state, you keep it because basically your costs are set. I think this is a much improved process for the school districts to be able to have that flexibility in the system whereas before you didn\u2019t, and the flexibility was there actually took money away from you which doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nNatalie Davis: \u201cAnd that process you\u2019re talking about is the block grand funding that is in place, correct?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cWell, block grants, and then there\u2019s this extraordinary needs fund that they built into it and what they did is that took, the legislature took, a piece of the funding in K-12 and said, \u2018okay, we\u2019re going to set this aside for extraordinary needs. And then we\u2019re going to have a process where the executive council, the state basically, and you\u2019ve got your leadership \u2014 House, Senate and Governor \u2014 looking at this and then trying to make these adjustments. And the total pool of funds is about $12 million.\u201d\n\nNatalie Davis: \u201cLets go back to the block grant funding. The Kansas Speaks Spring 2015 Statewide Public Opinion Survey came out, and it showed that almost two-thirds of respondents felt that the state block grant system actually lowered the quality of education in Kansas. Do you feel that the quality of education in Kansas is where it should be?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cNo, I think it needs to be better. I think we need to get more money into the classroom. I think average teacher salary needs to go up for the state. I think we need to get more merit pay. But what you\u2019ve seen over the last 10 years, we\u2019ve added about a billion dollars of funding to K-12. Student population hasn\u2019t gone up much. But most of that money has gone into, um, front office costs, it\u2019s gone into administration. A lot of it\u2019s gone into capital improvements because you bifurcated the funding. You said, okay, certain amount of funding has to go into capital amounts, so its football stadiums, its school buildings. A certain amount has to go into the classroom. The block grant broke those walls down. Because most people in the state, they want this money to go into the classroom. That\u2019s where, now, the money can go. Now, people are hesitant because they\u2019re saying \u2018well, I kind of like the old system, I\u2019m not sure\u2019. But now you don\u2019t have to spend $40,000 on a piano because you can\u2019t put into the teachers. You can say, \u2018no, let\u2019s put that into the teacher.'\u201d\n\nRELATED LINK | USD 259 Superintendent John Allison responds to the governor\u2019s comments school districts\n\nNatalie Davis: \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the specific money. I\u2019ve got numbers here; $283 million has been increased into the school funding system in the last six years. The number of dollars has increased, that\u2019s great, but the per pupil increase in state aid has only been half the rate of inflation. Is that good enough? How is that sustainable for the Kansas education system?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s sustainable if you move it into the classroom. I\u2019ve got the chart (pictured right) that kind of shows this amount of increase that we\u2019ve done. And there\u2019s basically three areas of funding increase that we\u2019ve done in the state of Kansas. One\u2019s K-12. The other is the KPERS system, which was in the bankruptcy zone when I came into office, and the third is Medicaid. Those are your three growth areas. And I think what we\u2019ve got to really do is get more of that money getting into the classroom. You shouldn\u2019t put it into administration. And you shouldn\u2019t put it into \u2013we\u2019ve built a lot of new buildings in the state of Kansas and that\u2019s wonderful. My youngest two children go to Washburn Rural. Beautiful operation and great teachers there as well but I want that money to be flexible to get into the classroom, because that\u2019s where Kansans want it. They want it in the classroom.\u201d\n\nRELATED LINK | Education Chart Nov 2015\n\nNatalie Davis: \u201cThat\u2019s something you and I talked about when you first got elected to this next term. You talked the desire to put money into the classroom, but if you look at that $283 million increase over the last six years, more than 65 percent of the increased funds have gone into KPERS, and they went to bond and intrastate aid. It\u2019s not going into the classroom. So is that acceptable to you?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cWell in that bond and intrastate aid, no. That bond and intrastate aid, we want to pull that back and let that money get into the classroom. KPERS, that system has been underfunded for 20 years. I was just in Detroit two weeks ago. They went through the bankruptcy, the city of Detroit. There are going to be other cities going through bankruptcy. You know who takes it? Who gets hit when the bankruptcy happens? It\u2019s the pensioners. That\u2019s a big piece of where the loss takes place. Now a lot of your borrowing \u2014 you wipe off bond holders \u2014 but you also go with the pensioners and that\u2019s not fair. And for 20 years, the KPERS system has been underfunded. We were the second least funded pension system in America when I came in. Illinois was the least funded. They remain there. We have moved our rank up substantially, we are out of the bankruptcy zone. This is critical long-term. You kind of get no real interest in it because people say I\u2019m still getting my KPERS payment, and they are.\u201d\n\nNatalie Davis: \u201cBut long-term, you\u2019ve improved sustainability.\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cLong term, this is where you go bankrupt because we had a $10 billion hole in KPERS.\u201d\n\nNatalie Davis: \u201cDefinitely. And there\u2019s no disputing that we\u2019re seeing huge improvements. But back to the focus on the classroom that involves teachers and students. I have a quote here from a teacher who has worked in the community here in Kansas for more than a decade. They described teacher relationships with lawmakers and you as abusive. They said, \u2018Sadly, in the end, a lot of teachers \u2014 even school districts \u2014 are so afraid of further cuts they just shut up and let him continue his lies which is how abusers get power, rather than standing up and saying something because they don\u2019t want to get hit again.\u2019 What\u2019s your reaction to that?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cContinuous cuts? Has it been? I mean, you said in your own numbers it hasn\u2019t been continuous cuts that have taken place.\u201d\n\nNatalie Davis: \u201cThe number of dollars has increased but it hasn\u2019t been sustainable with the rate of inflation. You mention merit pay as a possibility for teachers and teachers don\u2019t trust that. How do you regain teachers trust in Kansas? I know that\u2019s your desire.\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cIt is and I would appreciate, thank you actually for citing that money has increased in K-12, because I think if you ask the general public, \u2018do you think money has increased or decreased over the last five years,\u2019 most would say it\u2019s decreased.\u201d\n\nNatalie Davis: \u201cBut it\u2019s not in a sustainable way?\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cBut it has increased has it not?\u201d\n\nNatalie Davis: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cThat\u2019s my point. And I think what we\u2019ve got to do is get more money out of the administration, out of the buildings, and put it into the classroom and I don\u2019t think anybody would disagree with that. And if you look at your total level of student increase of numbers, it\u2019s not been growing as fast as the amount of money.\u201d\n\n3) Welfare Reform\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the Hope Act, you\u2019re sweeping welfare reform that was signed into law back in April. How does this program help end government dependency here in Kansas?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cIt gets people off of public assistance and into the job market. And we have had fantastic results. We\u2019ve had over 6,000 people this last year go from welfare dependency to a job. And the numbers of this have been extraordinary. And it\u2019s pretty simple. We\u2019re just saying if you\u2019re able-bodied and capable you have to apply for a job or get a job when you come in for support, and then if you\u2019re asking for food stamps, we provide job training programs. And it is a much more likely way that you\u2019ll get out of poverty, if you\u2019re working than the little pittance than the government gives you,\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cAnd you try to make that program work with your mentoring program too? Do they kind of work in conjunction with each other?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cWe need that because we\u2019ve done that for people coming out of prison. We\u2019ve got 6,000 mentor matches for people coming out of prison, and it\u2019s cut our recidivism rate in half in year one results. Now that\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019d be beautiful to track that for three or four years so we don\u2019t know \u2014 but that\u2019s worked in our prison population. We want to get it into our population that\u2019s in poverty. I want to get people out of poverty. I don\u2019t want to just keep them with a dependency, we want to get them out of poverty, and that involves education, work, and family structure.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cSome of your critics have been concerned about the cap on assistance, that it\u2019s 36 months instead of 48 months. Does that put too much pressure on Kansas families that are in need right now to try to get back on their feet?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cYou know, it\u2019s still three years, and the data shows that the best thing you can do, once you\u2019re out of work and you\u2019re getting public assistance, is get back into the job market as soon as possible so you don\u2019t lose those soft skills, so you don\u2019t lose the abilities that had you in that work market in the first place. The way out of poverty is work, it\u2019s not the money from government. And so the quicker you can make that transition back into the work environment, the better off you are.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cAnother thing that caused a kind of controversy was how those coupons can be used. They can\u2019t be used for movies, or massage parlors, or cruise ships. Why do you think we needed something like that here in Kansas? I\u2019m not sure you can use $20 on a cruise ship, you know what I mean? \u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cI agree, And some of those things, I think, were questionable. Some of it isn\u2019t. Some of it was wasted money that people were using, plus I think the public looks at this and says, \u2018Look, you need some help, I want to help you out. I don\u2019t want you to blow the money on things you don\u2019t need. I want you to spend it on food and shelter and clothing and things for your children, not on entertainment.\u2019 And, not that entertainment is bad, but look, we\u2019re talking about a situation where we\u2019re trying to help you out of a situation that is difficult for you and we don\u2019t think you should spend it on these other things.\u201d\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cSo your policy is more like a hand up instead of a hand out is what it sounds like.\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cIt\u2019s not only a hand up, it\u2019s also help giving you the tools. There are some people that you say, \u2018you need to pull yourself up by the bootstraps\u2019. Well, some people don\u2019t have bootstraps, so it\u2019s helping them get bootstraps and that\u2019s what our technical education program is about. We provide that free now while you\u2019re in K-12, and the whole idea is that we want to give you a skill so you can make more than minimum wage. So you can be an electrician or a plumber or an IT or CNA and you can be above the minimum wage and you have a skill to sell. And this has worked fabulously. We\u2019ve had over 200 percent enrollment increase in that program.\n\nDarren Dedo: \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to get more Kansans back to work, hopefully, right?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cThat\u2019s the whole objective here. And we\u2019ve got jobs. We need people, really more skilled, and we need the soft skills too. Being able to show up and being able to work with other people well.\u201d\n\n4) State\u2019s Rights\n\nSame-Sex Marriage\n\nNatalie Davis: \u201cMr. Governor, we\u2019re going to talk about state\u2019s rights. We\u2019re going to go through a number of topics kind of quickly. We\u2019ll start with same-sex marriage. Big in the news this year, the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage across the board. Kansas has a ban in its Constitution. How do you feel about federal law trumping state law and do you have any plans to stand up for state\u2019s rights in this area, perhaps a religious liberty law this legislative session?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cWell, the State of Kansas, the people of Kansas voted nearly 70 percent to define marriage in their Constitution as the union of a man and a woman. The Supreme Court said \u2018That\u2019s not Constitutional\u2019 in their ruling. A number of people disagree with that. A number of people disagree with Roe v. Wade on the abortion standard that the Supreme Court found a constitutional right to an abortion. But we\u2019re implementing the law as it stands with the Supreme Court ruling. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in the state of Kansas and will continue to do.\u201d\n\nGun Rights\n\nNatalie Davis: \u201cLet\u2019s move on to gun rights. You\u2019ve been a strong proponent of Second Amendment rights. You\u2019ve passed a lot of flexibility in terms of gun ownership here in Kansas. But in light of recent mass shootings, there\u2019s been a lot of talk about increasing regulation, increasing stricter background checks. If a federal law came into play that increased regulations on guns, what would your thought on that be? Do you think that would be breaking the constitution, and how would you react to that?\u201d\n\nGovernor Brownback: \u201cWell, you\u2019d have to see what the specifics are, so I won\u2019t answer something in the abstract because you always have to see what those specifics are. But you have a Second Amendment right. And it\u2019s the same as, it\u2019s in the Constitution like the First Amendment is in it. And you have that constitutional right. Kansans treasure that. I think most Americans treasure that, and their rights under the Constitution and the U.S. Supreme Court has determined this is an individual right \u2014 your Second Amendment right. I stand by that.\u201d\n\nHealth Care\n\nNatalie Davis: \u201cLet\u2019s talk health care. Kansas, Texas and Louisiana filed a lawsuit. They\u2019re challenging the federal government\u2019s legal authority, basically, to force a tax on the state under the Affordable Care Act. The Attorney General is calling it \u201can accounting trick\u201d. He\u2019s asking for $32.8 million in refunds. Are you opposed to the Affordable Care Act, and if so, why is this bad for Kansans in your opinion?\u201d\n\nGovernor Bownback: \u201cI\u2019ve been opposed to the Affordable Care Act since the President proposed it when I was in the Senate. I fought against it in the United States Senate. I think this not working. I don\u2019t think it was designed where it could work. I think we\u2019re in an entitlement system in the United States that currently in hugely over committed, probably in the tune of $30-40 trillion, where we don\u2019t have the money and we have promised people this promise. And here is another one to put on top of that. It\u2019s driven up costs in health care, costs to the State of Kansas. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve joined this lawsuit, why the Attorney General is a part of it. And it\u2019s just not working, and we can\u2019t afford for it to continue to not work and to drive up our healthcare costs.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\nNatalie Davis: One last question with a quick answer, I hope.
