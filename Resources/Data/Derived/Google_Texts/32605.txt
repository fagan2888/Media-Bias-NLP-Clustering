The emergence of public and private health insurance exchanges, as well as the ongoing shift toward placing more responsibility on workers for health plan decisions, is creating a new normal for employers and employees alike.

As the Affordable Care Acts public health exchanges boasted roughly 8 million enrollees during its first signup period, and the Small Business Health Options Program marketplaces are expected to be fully operational by years end, the introduction of choice to employee populations is a major disruptor, says Paul Lambdin, a director at Deloitte Consulting.
