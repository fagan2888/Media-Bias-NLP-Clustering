Clinton also said she would like to boost Social Security benefits for some family caregivers who leave their jobs.\n\nThe campaign estimates that the price tag for the new benefit will run about $10 billion over the course of a decade. But as The Washington Examiner notes, Clinton hasn\u2019t detailed exactly how she\u2019ll pay for it, saying only that it would be paid for with tax hikes of some kind.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Clinton has proposed billions in new spending without providing all the details. There\u2019s also Clinton\u2019s higher-ed plan, which she\u2019s pitched as a way to make college more affordable (but which might have the opposite effect). Her campaign estimates that it would cost about $350 billion over a decade. The plan will be \u201cfully paid for,\u201d she promises, \u201cby limiting certain tax expenditures for high-income taxpayers.\u201d So she\u2019d raise the tax bills on the wealthy, but, once again, she doesn\u2019t say how she\u2019d do so. Clinton has also said that, somehow, her mandatory family leave plan should be paid for the by the wealthy, though it\u2019s not clear what the mechanism would be.\n\nIt\u2019s not that there\u2019s no possible way to raise the revenue to pay for these programs. But paying for all of them together becomes much harder, especially given that Clinton has boxed herself in to some extent by promising not to raise taxes on households earning less than $250,000, and in fact has called for tax cuts for the broad middle class.\n\nThat promise itself shows how difficult the politics of revenue-raising are right now: Clinton has ruled almost every household in the country off-limits.\n\nSure, there are still some pay-fors floating around in Washington, but the fact that they haven't been used yet (the Affordable Care Act, for one, used up a lot of them) suggests that we're beginning to scrape the bottom of the barrel. There just aren't that many obvious untapped revenue sources left, and the interest groups who are likely to be targeted have already mobilized heavily against them.\n\nClinton's political calculation here is obvious: Promising to provide broad new benefits that few people have to pay for is always popular in politics. But it suggests how difficult it will be to settle on workable, politically plausible revenue raisers or other offsets to pay for new programs. It\u2019s easy for candidates to propose new programs and spending, and much harder to find ways to pay for them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign rolled out new policy proposal today: a $6,000 tax credit for home caregivers, designed to offset the cost families", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Plan to Pay for Everything: New, Unspecified Taxes", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/11/23/hillary-clintons-plan-to-pay-for-everyth", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14483034161885.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign rolled out new policy proposal today: a $6,000 tax credit for home caregivers, designed to offset the cost families incur when caring for elderly relatives.
