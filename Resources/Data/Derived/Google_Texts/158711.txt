The Hollywood Reporter executive editor Matthew Belloni noticed something peculiar during AC/DC’s performance opening Sunday night’s 57th Annual Grammy Awards:

The legendary Aussie rockers released their 15th studio record, Rock or Bust, late last year, and this was the title track. So it’s understandable if vocalist Brian Johnson might need a little help with such new songs. And, to be fair, even marathon live performers like Bruce Springsteen use a teleprompter on-stage.

Then again, the Boss sometimes plays 35 songs in one night.

Watch the performance below, which also includes a slowed-down “Highway to Hell,” via CBS:
