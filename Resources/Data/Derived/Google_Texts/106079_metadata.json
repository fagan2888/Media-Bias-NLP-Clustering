The bottom line of the medical device manufacturer has been hit hard by a 2.3 percent tax levied as part of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n\nBy Michael Collins of the Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nWASHINGTON ? A tax that manufacturers of medical devices say is costing them millions of dollars could be headed for repeal next year when Republicans take control of both chambers of Congress.\n\nGOP lawmakers in both the U.S. House and Senate plan to make abolishing the medical device tax one of their first priorities in the new Congress that begins in January. And, in an encouraging sign for opponents of the tax, President Barack Obama has suggested that might be an area in which he and the incoming GOP majority in Congress can work together.\n\n\"We are cautiously optimistic there is a good opportunity the tax will be repealed in the new Congress,\" said J.C. Scott, senior executive vice president of government affairs for the Advanced Medical Technology Association, or AvaMed, a Washington-based trade association that has been fighting the tax.\n\nThe 2.3 percent tax was levied on most medical devices sold in the United States as part of the Affordable Care Act to help offset other expenses with the health care reforms. Eyeglasses, contact lenses and hearing aids are exempted, as are other items generally sold directly to the public. The tax took effect last year and is projected to bring $38 billion in revenues over the next 10 years.\n\nFrom the start, the tax has been unpopular with manufacturers of medical devices, who argue it harms job creation, deters medical innovation and increases the cost of health care.\n\n\"It's the largest cost increase in the 41 years we've been in business,\" said Bill Pittman, president and chief operating officer of DeRoyal Industries, which is based in Powell and makes operating room trays, surgical accessories and other medical products.\n\n\"Most people hear 2.3 percent, they think it's 2.3 percent of profits,\" Pittman said. \"But it's not. It's a top-line tax\" levied on a company's gross revenues.\n\nAn industry survey showed the tax resulted in the loss of 33,000 jobs in its first year alone. \"It's really an egregious tax,\" Pittman said.\n\nIn Congress, the tax has long been the target of Republicans and has attracted opposition from some high-profile Democrats, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The GOP-controlled House has voted three times in the past two years to repeal the tax. The Senate, currently controlled by Democrats, voted 79-20 earlier this year to kill the tax, with 34 Democrats coming down on the side of repeal. That vote, however, was part of a nonbinding resolution.\n\nAll of the East Tennesseans in Congress favor repealing the tax.\n\n\"It shouldn't have taken an election for the Senate to end this onerous $30 billion tax on revenue that has cost 33,000 jobs, discouraged innovation, and raised the price tag on lifesaving medical devices, but the new Republican Senate majority will finally pass a bill to end it,\" U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Maryville, said.\n\nU.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Chattanooga, said the tax \"is an area where there is strong bipartisan support for repeal, and my hope is that the new Congress finally will be able to fix this and other damaging effects of the health care law.\"\n\nYet a recent study by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service challenged opponents' claims the tax could have significant, negative consequences for the medical device industry and jobs.\n\nWhile the tax is difficult to justify, the study said, its effects likely will be \"fairly minor\" and its impact on the price of health care will most likely be negligible.\n\nAvaMed calls that study \"fundamentally flawed\" and argues that many of its conclusions are inaccurate. For example, the report assumes most of the tax can easily be passed on to customers.\n\nBut, \"that just ignores the realities of the marketplace,\" Scott said. \"It's a very competitive market, and there are a lot of downward pressures that are already being put on companies. So in reality, there is not a whole lot of wiggle room.\"\n\n\"It's fundamentally a poorly designed tax that's not easy to apply to a diverse industry like the medical device industry,\" he added.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Medical device tax may be heading for repeal", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/business/medical-device-tax-may-be-heading-for-repeal-ep-783713690-353915441.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/deroyal02_mp_9693167_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 383}, "type": "article", "description": "A tax that manufacturers of medical devices say is costing them millions of dollars could be headed for repeal next year when Republicans take control of both chambers of Congress.", "title": "Medical device tax may be heading for repeal"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/deroyal02_mp_9693167_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "A tax that manufacturers of medical devices say is costing them millions of dollars could be headed for repeal next year when Republicans take control of both chambers of Congress.", "site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Medical device tax may be heading for repeal"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4ab2\"", "article_summary": "\"It's fundamentally a poorly designed tax that's not easy to apply to a diverse industry like the medical device industry,\" he added.\nYet a recent study by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service challenged opponents' claims the tax could have significant, negative consequences for the medical device industry and jobs.\nGOP lawmakers in both the U.S. House and Senate plan to make abolishing the medical device tax one of their first priorities in the new Congress that begins in January.\nFrom the start, the tax has been unpopular with manufacturers of medical devices, who argue it harms job creation, deters medical innovation and increases the cost of health care.\nA tax that manufacturers of medical devices say is costing them millions of dollars could be headed for repeal next year when Republicans take control of both chambers of Congress."}
