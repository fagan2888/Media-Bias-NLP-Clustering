It looks strikingly similar to the sickle, hammer, and gold star of the Soviet Union.\n\n[A]s visitors look at the logo in the upper right of the page, they may be surprised to see a symbol that, while one could argue is \u2018merely\u2019 a check mark wrapped in a blue hand, appears strikingly similar to the symbol of the former Soviet union\u2014except, instead of the yellow hammer and sickle on a red background, a red hammer is wrapped by a blue hand and the star has the Obama campaign symbol within it\u2026 Whether or not the AFL-CIO\u2019s symbol on its voting rights page was designed to intentionally resemble the Soviet symbol is unknown. However, given the close ties between unions and Marxist groups these days and with many of today\u2019s union members too young to remember an enemy from a bygone era, the symbolism will likely escape most of them.\n\nSee for yourself.\n\nThe site is designed to ease voter registration and \u201craise awareness on voting rights, educate voters on new voting laws, ensure voters are able to vote fairly and without intimidation and that all votes are counted.\u201d\n\nAFL-CIO says that the effort is \u201cnon-partisan,\u201d but the union\u2019s political donations are very much one-sided. The union is shelling out big money to help Democrats hold the Senate in 2014. It has contributed more than $6 million with almost all of that money going to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Get out the (communist) vote", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The AFL-CIO\u2019s get-out-the-vote logo is raising eyebrows for its similarity to the Soviet flag, according to RedState.
