A mother and her baby narrowly escaped tragedy after their vehicle landed in a Lehigh Acres canal on Friday.

A witness said the crash occurred at East 12 Street and Moore Avenue when the mom lost control of her car after she hit drainage dips in the road.

Two Lehigh Acres residents, who didn't want to be identified, said Saturday they were shocked by what happened in front of their home.

"She told us she lost control of the car and that she ended up in the canal."

After the woman climbed out of the car and pulled out her baby son, she went to the nearest residence.

"I saw this young woman standing with a bundle that looked like mud and dirt, and it turned out to be a young baby," the resident said.

"I realized it was a baby, and I realize I had to offer them to get inside because they were trembling and dripping mud and water."

After surveying the scene, the neighbors said they're surprised the two made it out.

"I wanted to clean the baby of the mud to see if there were any injuries," the resident said.

"Not a single scratch or hurt, nothing bleeding, nothing broken. The baby was in perfect condition, not even crying."

They said firefighters and medics confirmed neither mom nor baby had serious injuries.

"There's all the evidence in the world that the baby if not the woman herself were extremely lucky to be alive and well," the neighbor said.
