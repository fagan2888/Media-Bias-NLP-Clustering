Nationalizing the election isn\u2019t an automatic guarantee of victory, but the \u201cstand for nothing\u201d strategy usually adopted by establishment Republicans IS a guarantee of defeat.\n\nTony Lee reports that Matt Walsh, who has a conservative talk show on radio station WLAP and blogs at TheMattWalshBlog.com has much the same analysis of the Bevin vs. McConnell primary.\n\nAppearing on Breitbart News Sunday on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125 with host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, Walsh noted that a female Democrat like the Democrats\u2019 Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes can win when establishment Republicans do not fight back on the false \"war on women\" rhetoric, and he feared McConnell would not fight back against Grimes while Bevin would.\n\nWalsh also said Democrat Grimes \"shrinks away\" from issues, and even though she \"might bring Hollywood money\" to Kentucky, she still has to connect with voters in the arena, which Grimes has not shown the ability to do yet.\u201d\n\nShrinking away from the issues makes Grimes the perfect empty vessel into which the national Democrats can pour the despicable rhetoric of their \u201cwar on women\u201d campaign.\n\nWalsh also said all Grimes really has going for her is that she is a \"woman, kind of attractive, [and] young.\"\n\n\"She doesn't have ideas as far as I can tell,\" he said, noting that Grimes hides out on Obamacare and all the other big issues.\n\nWe would tend to offer the same analysis of Mitch McConnell\u2019s record \u2013 he brings a lot of inside-the-Beltway special interest money to the campaign and a reputation for bringing a lot of pork to Kentucky.\n\nMcConnell's favorability ratings in Kentucky have been extremely low, thus making him vulnerable in a general election. Even though McConnell is adept at maneuvering pork back home to Kentucky he\u2019s never going to outbid the Democrats for the votes of the clients of big government or defeat the Democrats\u2019 war on women campaign with another dam on the Ohio River.\n\nBeyond pork, on the big issues that nationalize a campaign and draw a sharp distinction between the conservative world view and the liberal world view Mitch McConnell is in trouble because -- let\u2019s face it \u2013 McConnell is not a conservative.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ConservativeHQ.com", "title": "Mitch McConnell \u2013 Destined to Lose?"}}, "article_summary": "Beyond pork, on the big issues that nationalize a campaign and draw a sharp distinction between the conservative world view and the liberal world view Mitch McConnell is in trouble because -- let\u2019s face it \u2013 McConnell is not a conservative.\nWalsh also said all Grimes really has going for her is that she is a \"woman, kind of attractive, [and] young.\"\nTony Lee reports that Matt Walsh, who has a conservative talk show on radio station WLAP and blogs at TheMattWalshBlog.com has much the same analysis of the Bevin vs. McConnell primary.\nMcConnell's favorability ratings in Kentucky have been extremely low, thus making him vulnerable in a general election.\nNationalizing the election isn\u2019t an automatic guarantee of victory, but the \u201cstand for nothing\u201d strategy usually adopted by establishment Republicans IS a guarantee of defeat."}
