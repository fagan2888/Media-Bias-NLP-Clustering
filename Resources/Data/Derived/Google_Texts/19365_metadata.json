Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s time to channel your inner Silicon Valley entrepreneur.\n\nThe pace of modern life is fast. In the business world, change has become a constant. For investors, guessing the Next Big Thing is the key to getting that important leg up on the market. Stop for a minute, and you\u2019re a dinosaur. With all that in mind, S&P Capital IQ\u2019s Michael Thompson and a team of analysts at the firm outlined ten \u201cdisruptors\u201d for 2015, one for each sector of the S&P 500.\n\nIn most cases, the impact of these disruptive forces isn\u2019t always one-sided. Indeed, whether or not the disruption is good or bad depends upon how companies respond to it. Microsoft, for instance, has had a hard time adapting to the mushrooming trends in mobile technology. Apple, meanwhile, has owned the shift. So, the key is not only recognizing the trend, but picking the winners and losers.\n\nGood luck, race fans.\n\nFinancial Services Disruptor: Mobile Technology\n\nFor an industry that is so central to our daily lives, the banking industry is still more Medici than mobile. That\u2019s going to change, and in 2015 it starts with two words: Apple Pay. The geniuses from Cupertino have launched their mobile wallet. If it\u2019s anything like Apple\u2019s other products it will be a rousing success, nudging millions to move their banking and commerce completely online.\n\nMastercard, Visa, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup, Bank of America, American Express, and Discover Financial Services look like the early winners. Smaller regional banks like BancorpSouth and West America Bancorp and asset managers will struggle to maintain pace, S&P says.\n\nReuters\n\nTechnology Disruptor: Wearables\n\nCalling Dick Tracy! Calling Dick Tracy!\n\nThe tech sector is the place where the word \u201cdisruption\u201d takes on holy connotations. This industry lives for the upheaval of a new \u201ckiller app\u201d and in 2015, wearables are poised to make the leap into the mainstream, moving from \u201climited-run products for tech-cognescenti into an important hardware category,\u201d S&P\u2019s Angelo Zino and Scott Kessler wrote.\n\nAgain, Apple is at the forefront here. The company\u2019s new watch will be coming to market in the next few months, and will be a key driver in the wearables movement. \u201cThe launch should not only benefit Apple buy other hardware makers as adoption ramps up.\u201d\n\nApple is the clear winner here, and Samsung, which launched its Gear S smartwatch this past fall, also looks like a winner. Other hardware companies and hardware supply-chain companies that jump on board should also find success. The firm doesn\u2019t, actually, see many losers, at least in tech. \u201cWearables will result in a greater amount of information technology dollars being spent versus cannibalizing any particular segment or company,\u201d they wrote. Traditional watch makers, however, may see their sales fall.\n\nConsumer Discretionary Disruptor: Digitalization.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see how digitization is going to sweep across media companies. The bundled model of TV will almost inevitably succumb to an a la carte model as the process of delivering programming gets digitized. Several media outlets, HBO, ESPN, CBS, are working on exactly this. It\u2019s not just media. Traditional retailers are going to continue ramping up their \u201comni-channel\u201d efforts in a attempt to catch up with Amazon.com Even restaurants like Chipotle Mexican Grill are experimenting with digital services, offering an advance-ordering app. Don\u2019t forget the auto industry, either; AutoNation recently unveiled plans to move the car-buying process completely online.\n\nTime Warner Cable, Walt Disney, CBS Corp., Gap, Best Buy, Verizon Communications, Chipolte and Amazon look like early winners. Distributors like Cablevision Systems, Charter Communications and DirecTV look like potential losers, as well as retailers like Fred's that don\u2019t adapt technology to boost sales, the S&P team said.\n\nEnergy Disruptor: U.S. Oil Exports\n\n\u201cThere is a reasonable chance that U.S. legislators will repeal the 40-year-old ban on exports of U.S. crude oil,\u201d S&P analyst Stewart Glickman wrote. As is the energy industry didn\u2019t have enough upheaval, right?\n\nU.S. crude oil producers, like EOG Resources, Devon Energy and ConocoPhillips, look like the big winners here. The big losers may well be U.S. refiners like Valero Energy, Philips 66, and Marathon Petroleum, since the producers won\u2019t have to bring their crude to domestic refiners, Mr. Glickman said.\n\nAFP\n\nIndustrials Disruptor: Oil Prices\n\nThe price of oil isn\u2019t just an oil-industry story. It\u2019s going to have ramifications in almost every industry, and industrials are likely to feel it sharply. \u201cThose industries and companies for which fuel is a major cost would benefit from lower oil prices,\u201d Jim Corridore wrote.\n\nThe list of winners here is long. Virtually every airline\u2013Delta Air Lines Inc., United Continental Holdings, Southwest Airlines and the rest\u2013will benefit from sharper lower jet-fuel costs. Commercial transportation, trucking and railroads, will benefit, too. \u201cAny company that uses energy to manufacture products will benefit,\u201d Mr. Corridore wrote.\n\nBut there are some losers. Mr. Corridore said that companies in construction and engineering, like Foster Wheeler AG and Joy Global, will suffer as the they lose business from an energy industry that\u2019s retrenching amid the supply glut and price collapse.\n\nConsumer Staples Disruptor: Demographics\n\n\u201cAs the baby boomers age, they \u2013 along with many Generation X members and Millennials \u2013 are driving increased demand for products that focus on improving health and wellness,\u201d analyst Joseph Agnese writes. With an improving U.S. economy in 2015, these trends will sharpen, touching food manufacturers, retailers, and drug companies.\n\nWinners look like companies like Kroger, Sprouts Farmers Market, CVS Health, and Hain Celestial Group Losers may include Campbell Soup and Kellogg, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, and cigarette makers like Altria Group and Reynolds American, Mr. Agnese said.\n\nHeathcare Disruptor: the Supreme Court\n\nObamacare gets a hearing in the Supreme Court, most likely in the spring, and the outcome could \u2013 the GOP hopes \u2013 cripple the federal health law. The case is King v. Burwell, and it keys upon the meaning of a single line in the law, whether that\u2019s ambiguous, and who qualifies for heath-care subsidies. The court will likely hear the case in March and render a verdict in June.\n\nWhile the case has hyper-partisan political overtones, for the healthcare industry, what matters is continuity, and the fact of the matter is that the law has been good for investors. From the start of 2010 through this November, the healthcare sector has outperformed the broader S&P 1500 by 24%, analyst Jeffrey Loo said. \u201cHealth care sector investors have benefited significantly since the law was passed and will most likely continue to succeed in 2015.\u201d Assuming it survives the Court.\n\n\u201cIf the Court agrees with the challengers that subsidies can only be provided to those enrolling through state-run exchanges, it would cause a major disruption throughout the health care sector.\u201d If that happens, the entire industry will feel the effects, he said.\n\nAgence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nMaterials Disruptor: the Chinese Economy\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that China has been a major consumer of the raw materials that go into building an industrial economy, and it\u2019s also no secret that China\u2019s economic growth has been slowing down, with an attendant slide in the use of raw materials.\n\nThis is really a continuation of a trend, but to the extent that the economic slowdown gains steam, 2015 could be a rough year for materials companies.\n\nIn the sector, there are no winners in a China-slowdown story, Christopher Muir said. Losers would be strung across the paper and packaging industries, chemical companies, and metals.\n\nTelecom Disruptor: REITs\n\nThe real estate investment trust structure has been employed by communications-towers companies like American Tower, but the firm thinks that in 2015 infrastructure companies may start adopting a REIT model as well. Windstream Holdings got an allowance from the IRS this year to form a REIT, and S&P thinks others will follow.\n\nUtilities Disruptor: Congressional Action on the EPA\n\nA new Republican-controlled Congress is likely to take action aimed at reining in the Environmental Protection Agency, S&P said. A lot depends upon what Congress can push through, of course. Efforts to block the implementation of carbon rules would benefit utilities like Dominion Resources, Duke Energy, and NextEra Energy Efforts to cut the value of renewable generation assets would hurt companies with exposure there, like NextEra\u2019s unit NextEra Energy Partners, S&P said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "It's time to channel your inner Silicon Valley entrepreneur.
