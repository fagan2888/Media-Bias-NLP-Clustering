(REUTERS/Mike Segar)\n\n3906326\n\nObamacare\u2019s website, healthcare.gov, recently added an option that allows users to preview their new health care premiums \u2014 but the new feature leaves out key pieces of information customers need to choose a health care plan.\n\nWhile The Huffington Post celebrated the changes at Healthcare.gov in a Friday report, the publication admitted that users were only provided limited data about the program in exchange for basic information about where they live and what kind of coverage they are seeking.\n\nMore detailed information is not factored into the preview, such as: home address, number and ages of adults and children covered and the number of smokers covered. The preview does not give customers any information about the discounts for which they qualify.\n\nDepending on where the person lives, the new feature may not even give them basic information about the Obamacare.\n\nFor example, if a person living in Maryland visits healthcare.gov, they will be redirected to Maryland\u2019s healthcare exchange, MarylandHealthcareConnection.gov.\n\nObamacare\u2019s rollout has been plagued with systemic website problems, frustrated users and abysmally low enrollment numbers.\n\nA new deadline for fixing the glitches, Reuters reports, could be as early as mid-November. Republicans in the House and the Senate have announced that they intend to investigate the reason for the glitches, Fox News reports.\n\nHealthcare.gov is estimated to have cost taxpayers $634.3 million to construct, paid out to federal contractor CGI Federal \u2014 a Canadian company.\n\nFollow Josh on Twitter and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Josh Peterson", "description": "Healthcare.gov's new preview feature leaves out key pieces of information customers need to choose a health care plan.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obamacare's website, healthcare.gov, recently added an option that allows users to preview their new health care premiums -- but the new feature leaves out key pieces of information customers need to", "title": "Obamacare adds useless \u2018preview\u2019 option to dysfunctional website", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/12/obamacare-adds-useless-preview-option-to-dysfunctional-website/", "image": {"width": 628, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-03T182225Z_1_CBRE9921F1H00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-e1380826904961.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Useless preview option compounds consumer confusion", "title": "Obamacare adds useless \u2018preview\u2019 option to dysfunctional website Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/12/obamacare-adds-useless-preview-option-to-dysfunctional-website/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-03T182225Z_1_CBRE9921F1H00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-e1380826904961.jpg"}, "creator": "@@jdpeterson", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-12 13:14:32", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare adds useless 'preview' option to dysfunctional website", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare-gov,obamacare,josh-peterson", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "healthcare.gov,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Obamacare's website, healthcare.gov, recently added an option that allows users to preview their new health care premiums -- but the new feature leaves out key pieces of information customers need to", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-03T182225Z_1_CBRE9921F1H00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-e1380826904961.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2cb0\"", "article_summary": "A man looks over the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) signup page on the HealthCare.gov website in New York in this Oct. 2, 2013 photo illustration.\n(REUTERS/Mike Segar)3906326Obamacare\u2019s website, healthcare.gov, recently added an option that allows users to preview their new health care premiums \u2014 but the new feature leaves out key pieces of information customers need to choose a health care plan.\nDepending on where the person lives, the new feature may not even give them basic information about the Obamacare.\nObamacare\u2019s rollout has been plagued with systemic website problems, frustrated users and abysmally low enrollment numbers.\nThe preview does not give customers any information about the discounts for which they qualify."}
