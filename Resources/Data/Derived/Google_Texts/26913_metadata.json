Possible presidential candidates Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee join Franklin Graham, Pastor John Hagee, and National Religious Broadcasters President Jerry Johnson as signers of the Pledge in Solidarity to Defend Marriage. The pledge is authored and signed by James Dobson, Focus on the Family; Rick Scarborough, Vision America Action; and Matt Staver, Liberty Counsel. They write: \u201cWe respectfully warn the Supreme Court not to cross that line\u2026We stand united together in defense of marriage. Make no mistake about our resolve.\u201d\n\nMany Americans will be appalled that faith community leaders dare to place their judgment of constitutionality above that of the Supreme Court. \u201cIs not the Supreme Court the last word on law in America?\u201d they would ask. The answer is \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution makes no mention of judicial review of laws adopted by Congress and signed by the President, much less a right to re-write law. Judicial review \u2013 the prerogative of the Courts to decide whether a law is consistent with the Constitution \u2013 was an innovation when introduced in the famous 1803 Marbury vs. Madison case. It has been more-or-less universally accepted prior to the present emergency, but it imputes neither infallibility nor omnipotence to the Supreme Court. The Court reversed itself in the 1954 school desegregation case Brown vs. Topeka Board. No serious person would defend Court rulings in cases like Dred Scott (1857) or Plessy vs. Ferguson (1897). Plessy, of separate-but-equal doctrine infamy, was repudiated by the Court itself; but Dred Scott \u2013 permitting escaping slaves to be re-taken even on free soil \u2013 stood until passage of the 13th and 14th Amendments. Still standing is the recent decision upholding Obamacare after Chief Justice Roberts re-wrote the law. There is nothing like infallibility in the Court.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nEven President Obama and his allies have decried the 2010 Citizens United ruling as perverting the Court\u2019s mandate \u2013 although multitudes applaud it \u2013 in yet another showing that the Supreme Court is not the default last word on law in America. So what is the present emergency, and how might we address it creatively?\n\nMaking same sex marriage normative is a fundamental change to the core of our culture \u2013 any culture. Thus, cultures who embraced homosexuality, like Ancient Greece, never embraced gay marriage. While it is over the top to call procreation the sole purpose of marriage, the opportunity to birth and raise children in the parents\u2019 image is the surest expression of humanity-created-in-God\u2019s-image we can imagine or produce. This is not narcissism \u2013 unless parents are really sick \u2013 but our best chance to walk in the Image of God by sacrificing ourselves for our children. We are male and female for this purpose, needing one another to complete one another as the other gender \u2013 and only the other gender \u2013 embodies the being each lacks in our incomplete individuality. Sperm and egg sacrificing individualized existence is no accident. Render that particularity irrelevant by judicial fiat, and we lose a lot.\n\nThe destabilizing effect on families is evident in those nations with legalized gay marriage, while the promised benefits of health and longevity for gay married couples have proven a horrible mirage. Gays brought suit against Canada in 2009 in a vain effort to blame the very government who gave them what they wanted by normalizing their unions. Add the tangential plague of persecution that already stalks Christians \u2013 like the Oregon baker facing $135,000 in fines \u2013 who decline on conscientious grounds to cater to them in the US, and we see glimpses of the train wreck the Supreme Court may unleash in its decision.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nDobson declares: \u201cThe institution of marriage is\u2026the foundation of the entire culture.\u201d Staver adds, in the event the court rules against marriage: \u201cYes, I\u2019m talking about civil disobedience\u2026I\u2019m calling on people to not recognize the legitimacy of that ruling because it\u2019s not grounded in the rule of law. They need to resist\u2026in a peaceful way \u2013 as much as Martin Luther King, Jr. resisted unjust laws in his time.\u201d\n\nScarborough says: \u201cWe\u2019re facing a real constitutional crisis if the Supreme Court rules adversely\u2026For me there\u2019s no option. I\u2019m going to choose to serve the Lord. And I think that thousands of other pastors will take that position and\u2026millions of Christians.\u201d Let us first pray the Supreme Court operates rationally. Failing that, let us pray Scarborough is right about the millions. The good news \u2013 regardless \u2013 is that the God whose will is that none should perish wins in the end.
