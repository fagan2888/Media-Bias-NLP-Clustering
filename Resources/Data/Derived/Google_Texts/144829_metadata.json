Associated Press\n\nPARIS -- Paris Saint-Germain prepared for its Champions League game against Chelsea with an unimpressive 0-0 draw against Montpellier in the French league on Saturday.\n\nPSG coach Laurent Blanc rotated his team at the Parc des Princes to avoid any injuries ahead of Wednesday's match at Stamford Bridge. His players lacked a cutting edge against a well-organized Montpellier team, and missed good chances in the first half.\n\nPSG's best opportunity came in the third minute when striker Edinson Cavani connected with a cross from Maxwell and hit the crossbar.\n\nMontpellier goalkeeper Laurent Pionnier made two good saves during the first half-hour, denying efforts from Cavani and Angel di Maria, and was decisive in stoppage time to stop a fine attempt from Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\n\nPSG remained 23 points ahead of second-place Monaco in the standings after the Principality side drew at Caen 2-2 on Friday. Montpellier - the last club to win the French title before PSG claimed it for three consecutive seasons - continued its recovery under coach Pascal Hantz, extending its unbeaten run to five games.\n\nNice beat Troyes 2-1 and rose to third place, while sixth-place Saint-Etienne missed another chance to get closer to the podium spots after drawing at promoted Angers 0-0.\n\nLille defeated Reims 2-0, Bordeaux drew with struggling Ajaccio 1-1, and Lorient secured a goalless draw at Bastia.\n\nPSG played without key midfielders Blaise Matuidi and Marco Verratti, who could miss the encounter in London because of injuries. PSG travels to Chelsea for the return leg of their last 16 tie with a 2-1 lead.\n\nIbrahimovic came off the bench while David Luiz and Thiago Motta were not used. Blanc also gave 18-year-old midfielder Christopher Nkunku his first start in the top flight.\n\n\"I prefer that scenario than winning and ending up with players injured,\" Blanc said.\n\nAfter Cavani hit the woodwork, Pionnier thwarted another effort from the Urugyuay international and saved a curled free kick from Di Maria. Coming in for Di Maria at the stroke of the hour, Ibrahimovic had the chance to snatch a last-minute win for the hosts but lost his one-on-one with Pionnier.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paris Saint-Germain prepare for Champions League date with Chelsea with unimpressive goalless draw against Montpellier in French league", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald", "description": "Paris Saint-Germain prepare for Champions League date with Chelsea with unimpressive goalless draw against Montpellier in French league", "title": "PSG held to 0-0 by Montpellier ahead of Chelsea game", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160305/sports/303059926/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20160305/sports/303059926/EP/1/2/EP-303059926.jpg&updated=201603051526&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paris Saint-Germain prepare for Champions League date with Chelsea with unimpressive goalless draw against Montpellier in French league", "title": "PSG held to 0-0 by Montpellier ahead of Chelsea game", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160305/sports/303059926/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20160305/sports/303059926/AR/0/AR-303059926.jpg&updated=201603051526&maxw=1200&maxh=1200", "site": "@dailyherald", "card": "summary", "account_id": 8960722}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 105603449548761}, "keywords": "MLS, Soccer, Pro Men, Associated Press", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHeraldFans", "published_time": "2016-03-05", "modified_time": "2016-03-05T19:26:00Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Associated PressPARIS -- Paris Saint-Germain prepared for its Champions League game against Chelsea with an unimpressive 0-0 draw against Montpellier in the French league on Saturday.\nPSG held to 0-0 by Montpellier ahead of Chelsea gamehelloParis Saint Germain's Angel Di Maria , left, vies for the ball with Montpellier's Remy William, during the French League One soccer match between PSG and Montpellier at Parc des Princes Stadium, in Paris, Saturday, March 5, 2016.\nAfter Cavani hit the woodwork, Pionnier thwarted another effort from the Urugyuay international and saved a curled free kick from Di Maria.\nPSG coach Laurent Blanc rotated his team at the Parc des Princes to avoid any injuries ahead of Wednesday's match at Stamford Bridge.\nComing in for Di Maria at the stroke of the hour, Ibrahimovic had the chance to snatch a last-minute win for the hosts but lost his one-on-one with Pionnier."}
