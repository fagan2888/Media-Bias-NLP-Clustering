John Kasich holds an employee town hall at Nationwide Insurance in Monday Nov. 2, 2105, in Des Moines, Iowa.USA (Photo: Rodney White, Rodney White/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nNationwide Insurance is a sponsor for a number of very worthwhile causes. I applaud their program to encourage civic action highlighted in the Nov. 3 paper [Kasich calls for rebuilding families, neighborhoods]. I was surprised, however, by the lack of female and minority persons in the picture of 30 or so employees at a talk given by Ohio Gov. John Kasich. I don\u2019t think only white males are interested in civic action. The picture made me wonder about the diversity of Nationwide\u2019s employees.\n\n\u2014 Jean Minahan, Des Moines\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1NzLnNY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "In the photo highlighting their program to encourage civic action, females and minorities were lacking", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "In the photo highlighting their program to encourage civic action, females and minorities were lacking", "title": "Nationwide photo lacks diversity", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/11/07/nationwide-photo-lacks-diversity/75194082/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the photo highlighting their program to encourage civic action, females and minorities were lacking", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a41b6161e9e14907ab19ecc8e0fcda69d33f1163/c=300-0-1500-1200&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820810733504748-johnkasochnov2ia0283.JPG", "title": "Nationwide photo lacks diversity", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/John Kasich  2016 Presidential Campaign", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Events/John Kasich  2016 Presidential Campaign", "title": "Nationwide photo lacks diversity", "author": "Jean Minahan, Des Moines", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/10b95c5a0cc4841dfe85e0d5152886fc37ea0def/c=450-0-1350-1200/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820810733504748-johnkasochnov2ia0283.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/577f8a50297014fd2c244d09581dff52e1a8ea12/c=300-0-1500-1200/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820810733504748-johnkasochnov2ia0283.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d3b37bd8607a00c56b0625bf95660cc5fdb70973/c=102-0-1698-1200/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820810733504748-johnkasochnov2ia0283.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/afab04c9a3c5d12fd133ca7dc4a18f3226f63e84/c=0-92-1800-1109&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820810733504748-johnkasochnov2ia0283.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-11-07T10:48:41.777000-06:00", "shorthed": "Nationwide photo lacks diversity", "articleid": 75194082, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b9e0d0fb7a942a7df18baa51b58f8b1fac1a920e/c=0-92-1800-1109/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820810733504748-johnkasochnov2ia0283.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/582410453f0494fbb857229c7c5e4c97a52860c3/c=564-0-1236-1200/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820810733504748-johnkasochnov2ia0283.JPG"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "John Kasich.\nBuy Photo Republican presidential hopeful Ohio Gov.\nJohn Kasich holds an employee town hall at Nationwide Insurance in Monday Nov. 2, 2105, in Des Moines, Iowa.USA (Photo: Rodney White, Rodney White/The Register)Buy PhotoNationwide Insurance is a sponsor for a number of very worthwhile causes.\nThe picture made me wonder about the diversity of Nationwide\u2019s employees.\nI applaud their program to encourage civic action highlighted in the Nov. 3 paper [Kasich calls for rebuilding families, neighborhoods]."}
