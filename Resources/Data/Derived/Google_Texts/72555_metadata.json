Trump has literally offended every walk of life. We\u2019re not just one big group, there are multiple groups out here and we\u2019ll just get stronger as the day goes on.\u201d \u201cI would say that the hate is really scary. I think it\u2019s dangerous and it\u2019s not the message to send if you want to make something great again. I think we\u2019ve already been great. Being hateful, I have had so many messages of hate and threats from people I don\u2019t even know. This is the kind of mentality that fuels the support of this candidate and it\u2019s scary.\n\nCiting the difficulties that the United States has had in global politics, Trump made a point that in his presidency, several things, like the current Affordable Care Act, will be changed:\n\n\u201cThere are so many good ideas. We have to get rid of the alliances between states so that the companies can compete. It\u2019s going to cost the country less and it\u2019s going to cost the people less. These programs are going to be tailor-made and fantastic plans.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of education, he targeted the Common Core curriculum and reform to education:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of Common Core! We\u2019re going to have localized education with our parents and our students. We won\u2019t be guided by a bureaucrat in D.C. that just cares about their paycheck.\u201d\n\nThroughout the rally, protestors spoke out against Trump\u2019s views, causing quite a ruckus with his supporters. One by one, these protestors who disrupted the rally were removed from the rally. The candidate made sure to mention \u201cfor the press, the officers are being very gentle!\"\n\nSEE \"2016 Donald Trump Rally in St. Louis\" PHOTO GALLERY BELOW:\n\nTrump then mentioned how at couple of his rallies, he had demanded that a protestor be thrown out immediately. At another rally, he mentioned that he was being kinder with his dismissal of the protester.\n\nShortly after this remark, Trump stated, \u201cI\u2019d rather be too strong than too weak by a long shot!\u201d\n\nAs a response to a growing number of protestors, Trump exclaimed \u201cgo home and get a job\u201d or that certain young protesters were \u201ctwo young and spoiled kids,\u201d calling all of the protestors \u201ctroublemakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are not good people,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are not the people that made America great.\u201d\n\nTrump mentioned that as a country, we are failing in more than one aspect.\n\n\u201cAs a country, we don\u2019t win anymore. We don\u2019t win with our military; we can\u2019t beat ISIS.\u201d\n\nOutspokenly, the candidate criticized his fellow candidates, saying that Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the strength or the stamina to be president\u201d and that U.S. Senator and Candidate Bernie Sanders is a \u201ccommunist.\u201d He also referred to Republican Presidential Candidates Ted Cruz as \u201cLying Ted\u201d and Marco Rubio as \u201cLittle Marco.\u201d\n\nTo close out his speech, the candidate said, \"we\u2019re going to win and we\u2019re going to make America great again!\u201d\n\n\n\nTo contact Madelaine Gerard for any potential stories, please send an e-mail to madelaine@riverbender.com.\n\nPrint Version", "article_metadata": {"description": "ST LOUIS,
