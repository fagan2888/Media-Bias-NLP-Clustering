Christie was campaigning in the heavily Democratic, blue-collar city of Bayonne from the reception he received yesterday.\n\nThe governor was serenaded with chants of \u201cFour more years!\u201d during stops at the Big Apple sports bar and San Vito\u2019s restaurant on Broadway.\n\n\u201cHe really is for the people,\u201d said Geri Bachanes of Bayonne, a Democrat. \u201cHe really is not thinking party-wise, he wants us all to vote for whoever is good for the people.\u201d\n\nBachanes\u2019 sister, Carol Reasons, a Republican, agreed that Christie is a better choice than Democratic gubernatorial candidate Barbara Buono, a state senator, in the Nov. 5 election.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll cross party lines to help the people and to help New Jersey. We love him.\u201d\n\nAs expected, Christie urged voters to disregard party affiliations and focus on the best person for the position.\n\n\u201cThe message on Nov. 5 is that we want people in public office who are going to care first about getting the job done and then second or third what they\u2019re going to do with their party,\u201d Christie said.\n\nBozena Linowski, owner of European Day Spa, also on Broadway, said she\u2019s an independent who is voting for the sitting governor.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a no-nonsense guy who does the right thing for the state, cuts out a lot of corruption and spending money in the wrong way,\u201d said Linowski, whose boyfriend, Hillside Mayor Joseph Menza, also attended the event. \u201cHe\u2019s a good fit for the state. I would support (Christie) even if he was a Democrat, just as long as he was the right person for the position.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "bayonne", "title": "Christie's Democratic fans in Bayonne applaud his pitch to put party second", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Christie\\u0027s Democratic fans in Bayonne applaud his pitch to put party second\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/09/christies_democratic_fans_in_b.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2013/09/13483391-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11326504\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-28T07:03:00Z\", \"author\": \"Brandon Gould/The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"bayonne\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2013/09/13483391-small.jpg", "description": "You'd never know Gov.
