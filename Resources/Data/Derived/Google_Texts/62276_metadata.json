Cases considered to be low-priority include military veterans, spouses of active-duty personnel and young people who were brought to the country as small children.\n\nClosing an immigration case based on prosecutorial discretion does not prevent that person from being deported in the future.\n\nThe program sparked heated controversy when it was announced and was a key complaint in a lawsuit a group of immigration agents who opposed the new policies filed against the Obama administration. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit last summer, stating that the matter was outside the court's jurisdiction.\n\nThe level of cases closed based on prosecutorial discretion has increased notably since the program was put in place during fiscal year 2012. Prosecutorial discretion was used to close 4.7 percent of immigration court cases during the program's first year, compared to the 8.5 percent of cases closed with prosecutorial discretion during fiscal year 2013.\n\nDuring the first three months of fiscal year 2014, the level of cases closed by prosecutorial discretion decreased slightly, down to 7 percent.\n\nThe data come from a report published by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a national research organization based at Syracuse University in New York.\n\nProsecutorial discretion is being used more frequently than the program was during its first year due to its success, immigration attorney Douglas Stump said.\n\n\"It has worked amazingly well,\" said Stump, who is president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and describes himself as pro-enforcement. Stump has practiced immigration law for more than three decades and is founder and senior attorney at Stump and Associates P.C., which has offices in Oklahoma City and Tulsa.\n\n\"They are having some really significant results in criminal aliens and repeat offenders,\" he said. \"The targeted class of deported aliens is being reached.\"\n\nProsecutorial discretion was originally intended to reduce the backlog in the current deportation caseload to clear out \"low-priority\" cases and \"to keep low-priority cases out of the deportation pipeline in the first place,\" according to a White House blog post published shortly after the administration announced the program.\n\nThe number of open cases in the United States' immigration courts has continued to rise since the prosecutorial discretion program was launched, data show, increasing nearly 10 percent between fiscal years 2012 and 2014.\n\n\"Perhaps it would have worked (to decrease the backlog) were it not for the (federal budget) sequester,\" Stump said. \"What happens is we are now down 23 immigration judges in the United States, and Congress has not found the ability to fund those positions.\"\n\nThe immigration court system also has a significant shortage of clerical staff, he said.\n\nThe rate of Oklahoma City case closures based on the prosecutorial discretion program is much lower than the rates in Seattle, Tucson, Los Angeles, Omaha and Phoenix, where prosecutorial discretion was used to close more than 20 percent of cases.\n\nHowever, since the program's implementation, prosecutorial discretion has been used more frequently in Oklahoma City cases than it has been used in some other parts of the country, data show.\n\nMore than 7 percent of the roughly 1,500 immigration cases heard in Oklahoma City since fiscal year 2012 were closed based on prose cutorial discretion, while in nearly three-quarters of hearing locations nationally, the program was used to close fewer than 1 percent of cases, data show.\n\nThe rate of Oklahoma City cases closed based on prosecutorial discretion is due to early adoption of the program, Stump said.\n\n\"We saw more successful grants of prosecutorial discretion in Oklahoma at first than did some other, more reluctant, prosecutorial discretion offices,\" Stump said.\n\nOklahoma City immigration officers did a good job early on realizing the effectiveness of leveraging resources to remove violent undocumented aliens from the United States before nonviolent people, Stump said.\n\nOklahoma is included in the North Texas jurisdiction, and Dallas Chief Counsel Paul Hunker did an excellent job of seeing the \"vision\" of the prosecutorial discretion program and implementing it in the region, Stump said.\n\n\"They got the big picture in Oklahoma and Texas,\" he said.\n\nImmigration Court: Prosecutorial discretion closures\n\nFiscal Year All closures Prosecutorial discretion closures PD closings percent 2012 206,330 9,684 4.7 percent 2013 191,803 16,306 8.5 percent 2014* 42,816 2,993 7 percent Total 440,949 28,983 6.6 percent\n\n*First quarter, October-December 2013\n\nSource: TRAC Reports Inc.\n\nImmigration Court: Prosecutorial discretion closures\n\nImmigration Court Hearing location Closings (since Oct. 2011) Cases closed based on PD PD closings percent Dallas Oklahoma City 1,540 114 7.4 percent Dallas Dallas 5,492 334 6.1 percent\n\nNote: Eleven hearing locations in Texas and Oklahoma are listed as in the jurisdiction of the Dallas immigration court.
