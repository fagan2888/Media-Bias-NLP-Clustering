It was CU\u2019s largest margin of victory this season.\n\n\u201cI told the guys to play with a free mind, an uncluttered mind,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cYou can\u2019t play this game worried about making mistakes. I want our guys to understand they are good.\u201d\n\nIn its first season under veteran coach Ernie Kent, Washington State (9-10, 3-4) entered the game as one of the league\u2019s biggest surprises. But the Cougars couldn\u2019t keep up with Colorado\u2019s small lineup that was without injured frontcourt stalwarts Josh Scott (back spasms) and Xavier Johnson (ankle) for the fourth consecutive game.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s as well as I\u2019ve seen Colorado play in a while,\u201d said Kent, a former Oregon coach and a basketball analyst for the Pac-12 Network the past few years. \u201cThey played a wonderful game.\u201d\n\nColorado shot 54.8 percent, and six Buffs players scored in double figures, a first since a win over Jackson State early in the 2013-14 season. Sophomore forward Wesley Gordon recorded a double-double with 10 points and 14 rebounds.\n\nIn addition to playing freely, Boyle told his team before the game it was OK for them to be ticked off about the four-game losing streak.\n\n\u201cWe definitely played with more of an edge tonight,\u201d CU junior guard Xavier Talton said.\n\nJosh Hawkinson and DaVonte Lacy each scored 12 points for Washington State, which was limited to 38.7 percent shooting.\n\nAt the start, Colorado also was without the other member of its \u201cbig three.\u201d Booker, a senior guard, was kept out of the starting lineup by Boyle as a penalty for being late to the afternoon shootaround.\n\n\u201cI thought Askia responded well,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big issue. But this team has standards.\u201d\n\nConnecting on seven of their first eight shots, the Buffs raced to a 19-5 lead \u2014 most of it produced without Booker. He entered the game at the 16:06 mark, with the Buffs up 13-5.\n\nColorado recorded 25 assists, the most in five seasons under Boyle. The Buffs worked the ball all over the court. Posting career bests in assists were Talton (six) and Gordon (five), the sophomore forward.\n\nThe Buffs were able to penetrate Washington State\u2019s zone defense with slashing drives. Also, Colorado got a spark from an unlikely source. Freshman forward Tory Miller, a season-long reserve, contributed 10 points and seven rebounds, his best game as a Buff.\n\n\u201cI think you saw what this team is capable of,\u201d Boyle told reporters. \u201cYou could just feel it turning. Maybe the light switch turned on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado snaps four-game losing streak with win over Washington State", "title": "Colorado snaps four-game losing streak with win over Washington State", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/24/colorado-snaps-four-game-losing-streak-with-win-over-washington-state/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150124__CUWashingtonp1.jpg", "height": 472}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150124__CUWashingtonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-24T20:20:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:11:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf373\"", "article_summary": "Josh Hawkinson and DaVonte Lacy each scored 12 points for Washington State, which was limited to 38.7 percent shooting.\nLeading comfortably for most of the game, Colorado (10-9, 3-4 Pac-12) got 21 points from Askia Booker and snapped a four-game losing streak with an easy 90-58 conference victory over Washington State at the Coors Events Center.\nIn addition to playing freely, Boyle told his team before the game it was OK for them to be ticked off about the four-game losing streak.\n\u201cThat\u2019s as well as I\u2019ve seen Colorado play in a while,\u201d said Kent, a former Oregon coach and a basketball analyst for the Pac-12 Network the past few years.\n\u201cI think you saw what this team is capable of,\u201d Boyle told reporters."}
