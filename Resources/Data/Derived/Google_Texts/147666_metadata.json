(Melanie Stengel \u2014 New Haven Register)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story is one in a New Haven Register series called The Kindness Project, an occasional series featuring the many examples of making the world a better place through altruistic actions.\n\nNEW HAVEN >> The path to a doctorate of medicine often leads through a free clinic where skills are honed and the reality of health care for the uninsured or underinsured is reinforced.\n\nThe Haven Free Clinic operates on Saturday mornings at 384 Grand Ave., in the Fair Haven Community Health Center\u2019s space. What goes on there is much the same as what happens during the week, but the providers and the clientele are not the same.\n\nAt Haven, students from Yale Medical School and its other professional schools, including Public Health and Law, as well as undergraduates, offer their services, and the patients are those who would not show up during the week. Many of them are undocumented. Few speak English.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think a lot of what our work is about (is) an issue of fairness and inequity,\u201d said Ian McConnell, a second-year Yale medical student. \u201cThese are kind of normal, hardworking people in the \u2026 Fair Haven community,\u201d many of whom are uninsurable under Obamacare. \u201cWe\u2019re where they come back to, to chart a path for them.\u201d\n\nIt can be difficult in the urban community, in a clinic where \u201c(we) never feel like what we\u2019re doing is enough,\u201d said Isha Di Bartolo, who is in her research year at the medical school and is one of the co-directors of Haven.\n\nShe gave an example of how the commitment is not limited to Saturdays: \u201cIt was over the course of nine months,\u201d Di Bartolo recalled. \u201cTwo patients \u2026 would come to me with other medical (issues) that I wasn\u2019t necessarily qualified to answer. They would call me on their phone. We become the point persons whether we want to or not.\u201d\n\nDi Bartolo spoke of a patient who she ended up forming a relationship with, because they met again at a different setting. \u201cI was part of their clinical team at the Haven Free Clinic overseeing their medication and the side effects of their medication,\u201d Di Bartolo said. \u201cAnd after they were discharged, many months later, I was also part of a clinical team that oversaw a flare-up of his illness, and it was amazing to be part of that patient\u2019s team and be an advocate for their care.\u201d\n\nLaura Skrip, a second-year doctoral student in public health, said, \u201cI think, because the patients do come back, you do develop relationships with patients \u2026 My face is familiar to them.\u201d They give her hugs; the promise to improve their lifestyle.\n\nSkrip is involved with a an educational program called Advancing Nutrition and Dietary Outcomes. An overweight patient was referred to the program.\n\n\u201cWhen he first started, he had a lot of goals,\u201d Skrip said. \u201cHe definitely wanted to lose weight but was unaware of the things he would need to do to accomplish that. But over the course of five visits, he made many changes to what he was eating, He no longer eats fast food (or orders) soda daily.\n\n\u201cHe also started exercising three to four times a week and as a result he\u2019s lost 30 pounds. He completed the program but now wants to lose 10 more on his own.\u201d\n\nThe program does not rely totally on students. There are physicians who come regularly, translators and other providers who supplement the work of the students. \u201cWe have some primary care doctors,\u201d said Nicole Krenitsky, a second-year medical student. \u201cWe have a number of physicians who are certified in internal medicine,\u201d as well as advanced-practice nurses.\n\nHaven Free Clinic reinforces the idea that health care is not one-way. By giving, the students receive benefits to carry with them through their careers.\n\n\u201cFor all of us, the reason why we go to clinic on Saturday is we get something, too,\u201d said Bobby Rosen, a second-year medical student. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think relationship is really the right word. \u2026 You also benefit from forming a meaningful bond with someone in the community.\n\n\u201cBeing a student for four years in a classroom can be removed from the impact that you really want to have as a health care provider,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cAnd I think going to clinic on Saturdays is what gives my life meaning in this moment and I\u2019m so grateful to have that opportunity to do that.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019d like to hear about your ideas for stories about kindness: email them to Ed Stannard at estannard@nhregister.com or mail them to Ed Stannard, Kindness Project, New Haven Register, 40 Sargent Drive, New Haven, CT 06511.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "title": "Yale med students, volunteers commit to caring at Haven Free Clinic", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20140706/yale-med-students-volunteers-commit-to-caring-at-haven-free-clinic", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20140706/NEWS/140709686/AR/0/AR-140709686.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1074px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Yale med students, volunteers commit to caring at Haven Free Clinic"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "Editor\u2019s note: This story is one in a New Haven Register series called The Kindness Project, an occasional series featuring the many examples of making the world a better place through altruistic actions.", "title": "Yale med students, volunteers commit to caring at Haven Free Clinic", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20140706/yale-med-students-volunteers-commit-to-caring-at-haven-free-clinic", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20140706/NEWS/140709686/AR/0/AR-140709686.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Editor\u2019s note: This story is one in a New Haven Register series called The Kindness Project, an occasional series featuring the many examples of making the world a better place through altruistic actions."}, "article_summary": "The Haven Free Clinic operates on Saturday mornings at 384 Grand Ave., in the Fair Haven Community Health Center\u2019s space.\nYale Nursing student Helena Turner, left, gets some instruction on bloodwork from Ashley Okada at the Haven Clinic in New Haven.\n\u201cI was part of their clinical team at the Haven Free Clinic overseeing their medication and the side effects of their medication,\u201d Di Bartolo said.\nHaven Free Clinic reinforces the idea that health care is not one-way.\n\u201cWe have some primary care doctors,\u201d said Nicole Krenitsky, a second-year medical student."}
