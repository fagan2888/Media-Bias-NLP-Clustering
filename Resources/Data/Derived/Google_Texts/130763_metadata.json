But we won\u2019t share that information with anyone,\u201d Mr. McGurk said. \u201cThe only time we would do that \u2014 the road is monitored 24/7 \u2014 [is] if we see someone driving the wrong way down the road, then we will notify police.\u201d\n\nPolice presence on the new lanes will be increased to enforce the HOV rules. While motorcyclists and carpoolers will still be able to use the HOV lanes free of charge, the rules have changed for motorists with eco-friendly vehicles.\n\nMotorists with qualifying hybrid vehicles, which are allowed on HOV lanes as a reward for using clean energy transportation, will have to pay the toll to ride the express lanes, just like other commuters. The new agreement for the express lanes excludes most hybrid cars from the pool of vehicles that can enter the lanes free of charge.\n\nAll motorists planning to use the new lanes are expected to have an E-ZPass. Those who do not will get a bill in the mail that also includes a fee for using the roadway.\n\nThe toll amount changes depending on the number of cars in the lanes. Motorists can be charged between $.20 and $.80 per mile.\n\n\u201cWe look at density of cars in lanes. The tolls change depending on traffic; as more people go in the lane, the tolls increase, and they will decrease as more people leave the lanes,\u201d Mr. McGurk said.\n\nThe goal of the fluctuating tolls is to ensure that traffic in the lanes continues to move at 65 mph.\n\nCarpoolers with three or more people in the car, including the driver, can use the lanes free of charge with an E-ZPass Flex that can be switched to a free HOV mode.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Northern Virginia commuters celebrate the opening of the new express lanes on Interstate 95, motorists should beware that the toll systems are watching, keeping a record of speeders.", "Author": "Kellan Howell", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "As Northern Virginia commuters celebrate the opening of the new express lanes on Interstate 95, motorists should beware that the toll systems are watching, keeping a record of speeders.", "title": "Virginia toll lanes offer drivers convenience, but raise privacy concerns", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/28/virginia-toll-lanes-offer-drivers-convenience-rais/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/28/12282014_virginia-toll8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/28/12282014_virginia-toll8201.jpg", "title": "Virginia toll lanes offer drivers convenience, but raise privacy conce", "description": "As Northern Virginia commuters celebrate the opening of the new express lanes on Interstate 95, motorists should beware that the toll systems are watching, keeping a record of speeders.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Technology Internet, Mike Mcgurk"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddaee\"", "article_summary": "The new agreement for the express lanes excludes most hybrid cars from the pool of vehicles that can enter the lanes free of charge.\nWhile motorcyclists and carpoolers will still be able to use the HOV lanes free of charge, the rules have changed for motorists with eco-friendly vehicles.\nWhile the E-ZPass system doesn\u2019t enforce speed limits via ticketing or E-ZPass suspensions, the system does hold on to video surveillance that authorities could use in a later investigation.\nAs Northern Virginia commuters celebrate the opening of the new express lanes on Interstate 95, motorists should beware that the toll systems are watching, keeping a record of speeders.\nCarpoolers with three or more people in the car, including the driver, can use the lanes free of charge with an E-ZPass Flex that can be switched to a free HOV mode."}
