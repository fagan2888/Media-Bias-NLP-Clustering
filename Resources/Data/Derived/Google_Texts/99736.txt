Weasel Zippers attacked, taken down for 12 hours

Our colleagues at Weasel Zippers suffered a DDoS attack yesterday that took them down for 12 hours, following their exclusive publication of a manual “for blacks only” used by the #BlackBrunch crowd that attacked “white spaces” on the weekend. In solidarity with WZ, we urge you to follow this link to read the manual, instead of reprinting it here.

It shows a high level of sophistication, demonstrating that this movement is far from a spontaneous outburst. I strongly suspect it is organized by one or more of the groups that have been exploiting the recent deaths during police actions to advance revolutionary communist goals. Note that the #BlackBrunch movement is explicitly racist (consider what would happen if a group of whites invaded “black spaces” with the intent of disrupting them), and intended to “rub raw” (in Alinsky’s words) racial grievances. That is a classic Marxist-Hegelian dynamic intended to lead to revolution.
