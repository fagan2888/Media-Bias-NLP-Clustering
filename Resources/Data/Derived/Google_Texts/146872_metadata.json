List will be required to serve at least 85 percent of the sentence that Circuit Judge Michael Brandt will impose.\n\n\n\nAssistant State's Attorney Larry Evans said trial testimony would reveal that, after the infant was taken to a Peoria hospital with fresh injuries on Aug. 18, 2012, List told police his baby had rolled off of a bed while he was getting a pacifier for her. Told that she had suffered bleeding in the brain and other injuries consistent with shaken baby syndrome, he changed his story.\n\n\n\n\"He said he had been very angry and frustrated,\" said Evans.

Last April, a court-ordered mental evaluation determined he was not capable at that time but stood a strong probability of becoming fit with treatment.\n\n\n\nHis attorney did not seek to challenge a psychiatrist's report last November that List was mentally fit for prosecution.\n\n\n\nDefense attorney Charles Schirer replied, \"Absolutely,\" when Brandt asked Monday if List was \"mentally fit to plead guilty.\" At that reply, an unidentified woman in the courtroom uttered, \"Oh!
