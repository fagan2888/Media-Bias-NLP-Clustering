On everything from foreign aid and military funding to how to undermine Obamacare, Republicans are just as likely to clash with each other as with President Barack Obama.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHere, then, is POLITICO\u2019s guide to how it will play out as the Senate\u2019s committees change hands.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The war over Obama's new war in Iraq)\n\nOur survey looks at the 16 legislative committees, identifying the likely chairmen and interviewing many of them and their top aides. The story that emerges is one of ideological divide and tactical debate, with an inherent tension in the committees \u2014 between the gavel holders and the 2016 stars \u2014 making hearing rooms worth watching as Republicans try to prove they aren\u2019t just a party of no.\n\nYounger conservatives hope to pass bold conservative blueprints on core issues like health care and taxes, even if they\u2019re doomed to face a presidential veto. Committee chairmen believe that governing requires sometimes putting the possible ahead of the ideal.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at who\u2019s coming up with the ideas in the Senate, they tend to come from people like Paul and Cruz and Rubio,\u201d said Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action for America. \u201cEven within the leadership of the Senate, they know the ideas that are going to excite and energize the party are going to come from those \u2026 guys.\u201d\n\nPaul, for example, is trying to steer the Republican Party to become more skeptical of military action and foreign aid. He\u2019ll have McCain on his tail \u2014 because the new Armed Services chairman is sure to keep warning that Paul\u2019s ideas would weaken America\u2019s position of leadership in the world.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: In politics, 40 is the new 50)\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Cruz, who wants to keep throwing red meat to the base by picking fights with Obama on everything, but especially Obamacare. A lot of conservative activists will side with Cruz, and committee chairmen like Hatch could find themselves in trouble if they don\u2019t sign on to an agenda of repealing the entire health care law through the budget reconciliation process, rather than just the most unpopular parts \u2014 a strategy that would guarantee a veto from Obama.\n\nThat prospect has GOP strategists worried about the implications for the party, since a closely divided Senate would give a lot of power to a single senator \u2014 like Cruz \u2014 to hold things up if they don\u2019t get their way.\n\n\u201cThe tension is going to be, do they want to reach agreements \u2014 and does President Obama want to reach agreements \u2014 and if the answer is yes, are they able to do that, or does a presidential candidate who\u2019s running to the right stop any agreements from taking place?\u201d said Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary who has also served as a top Senate GOP aide.\n\nStill, some GOP strategists hope to find a third option between compromising with Democrats on divisive issues and imposing a hard-right agenda: finding issues on which the Republican base is comfortable \u2014 such as promoting international trade, approving the Keystone XL pipeline and repealing the medical-device tax \u2014 and trying to peel off enough Democratic support to make them law. \u201cI think the hope is that things move forward,\u201d said the veteran Republican pollster David Winston. \u201cFor a whole lot of reasons, there\u2019s going to be a focus on jobs and the economy, and then after that there will be an assessment of what\u2019s achievable and what\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nGetty\n\nThen again, the ranks of the new committee chairmen will include enough hard-line conservatives to ensure regular clashes with the White House. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the likely new chairman of Environment and Public Works, a climate change skeptic, is prepared to challenge Environmental Protection Agency rules across the board, especially the greenhouse gas emissions rule. And Jeff Sessions, who\u2019s set to become the new Budget Committee chairman, opposed last year\u2019s bipartisan deal to put sequestration on hold for two years \u2014 not a good sign given that the cuts are about to hit again.\n\nEven the most combative chairmen, however, may not be on the same page as the 2016-ers, who will want to set up fights big enough to define the future of the country. \u201cI think the tension is going to be present for the next two years,\u201d said Fleischer.\n\nIntro by David Nather, senior policy reporter\n\n***\n\nThe Committee: Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry\n\nThe Chair: Pat Roberts (Kansas)\n\nThe Lowdown: Roberts could throw a major wrinkle into what has been so far a smooth implementation by the Obama administration of the five-year, $500 billion farm bill signed in February. The self-styled champion of Midwest farmers cast an emphatic \u201cno\u201d vote on the bill because it failed to rein in spending on food stamps, tied crop insurance to conservation restrictions and brought back crop subsidies based on \u201ctarget prices\u201d \u2014 something Roberts says will encourage farmers to ignore market demand and plant for government checks.\n\nRoberts could also tackle the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s proposed \u201cWaters of the U.S.\u201d rule. Democrats had given the lead to the Environment and Public Works Committee on the proposal, which the farm lobby says will bury them under permit requirements and red tape by expanding the types of bodies of water the agency protects. Roberts, though, is expected to use the Agriculture Committee gavel to broaden the GOP fight against the proposal. The Kansas Farm Bureau \u2014 one of the strongest sources of support for Roberts during his latest election battle \u2014 has made withdrawal or revision of the rule a priority, and so will Roberts.\n\nRoberts\u2019 Top Bills:\n\n\u2022 Amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act: Roberts and Sen. Mike Johanns\u2019 proposal would do away with permit requirements for registered pesticides.\n\n\u2022 Improve Nutrition Program Integrity and Deficit Reduction Act of 2013: This bill would cut billions from food stamps by doing away with state eligibility and killing a loophole that allows states to distribute additional food stamps by sending families heating assistance checks even though they do not have heating bills.\n\nPro Take: Roberts, with his long background in championing issues like a stronger crop insurance program, is one of only a few lawmakers who could get away with reopening the 2014 farm bill \u2014 and GOP leaders in the House expect him to \u2014 to make significant cuts to food stamps.\n\nBipartisan Moment: EPA\u2019s efforts to expand its regulatory authority over farming activity near rivers, streams and even ditches has become an issue that many Democratic farm-state legislators also have embraced, pushing back on the Obama administration.\n\nThe Troublemaker: Sen. Thad Cochran. Democrats are not the only lawmakers who want to prevent deeper cuts to food stamps. The Mississippi Republican and expected chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee has stood with the panel\u2019s Democratic chair, Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, and others to foil previous efforts by Roberts to chop tens of billions of dollars in spending from the food stamp program.\n\nCochran told POLITICO that he did not see any reason to reopen the farm bill, including making cuts to food stamps. \u201cWe worked real hard to put together that farm bill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very evenly balanced between a lot of interests. \u2026 I think we ought to be open to any suggestions for reconsidering any things that are problematic, but I don\u2019t know of any that are.\u201d\n\nPain for Obama: Roberts is expected to call in a long list of Agriculture Department officials and throw under the microscope all of their efforts to implement the 2014 farm bill.\n\nSignature Moment: In 2000, Congress approved a major boost to the government-subsidized crop insurance program, pushing premium subsidies higher and encouraging farmers to purchase higher coverage levels. Roberts wrote the bill with Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Nebraska).\n\nCompiled by Bill Tomson, senior agriculture reporter\n\n***\n\nThe Committee: Appropriations\n\nThe Chair: Thad Cochran (Mississippi)\n\nThe Lowdown: Cochran can and will use the committee to aid individual senators. During his previous turn as panel chair he made sure the appropriations panel sent billions home to Mississippi for recovery from Hurricane Katrina.\n\nCochran\u2019s Top Bills:\n\n\u2022 Funding the government through the end of fiscal \u201915. To avoid another partial shutdown, something\u2019s got to happen by Dec. 11 \u2014 or else a new deadline must be set if the upcoming lame-duck session with Democrats still in charge punts.\n\n\u2022 Emergency money for Ebola, ISIL and other fast-unfolding world events. Obama already asked right after Election Day for $6.2 billion to deal with Ebola in West Africa and to protect the U.S. against the virus\u2019 spread.\n\n\u2022 The fiscal \u201916 spending bills \u2014 Congress\u2019 most fundamental job \u2014 remains one of its most challenging, and even with a GOP majority, there\u2019s no guarantee things will change.\n\nPro Take: There\u2019s only so much Cochran will be able to do to make the appropriations process work. Everything from the order of spending bills moving to the floor to the length of a continuing resolution, to a large degree, will be decided at the leadership level. And anything Cochran manages to pass with 60 votes on the floor \u2014 never an easy lift \u2014 can\u2019t be pulled too far to the right by House Republicans; otherwise, Obama might not sign it.\n\nBipartisan Moment: Cochran is in a great spot to help the new Republican majority demonstrate Congress isn\u2019t broken. That means he\u2019ll want to find common ground with Democrats on a couple of big spending bills and figure out a way to handle controversial amendments. While he\u2019ll bring a softer tone to the panel compared with its current chair, Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski, he\u2019s also no pushover. \u201cThad Cochran\u2019s gentility should not be confused with his desire to move legislation,\u201d said Jim Dyer, former House GOP Appropriations staff director.\n\nThe Chairmen Agriculture Committee \u2014 Pat Roberts of Kansas\n\nTop industry: Pharmaceuticals and health products Top three donors:\n\n\u2022 Burns & McDonnell: $116,500\n\n\u2022 Koch Industries: $78,450\n\n\u2022 Blue Cross/Blue Shield: $60,750\n\nAppropriations Committee \u2014 Thad Cochran of Mississippi\n\nTop industry: Crop production and basic processing Top three donors:\n\n\u2022 Telapex Inc: $71,350\n\n\u2022 Northrop Grumman: $65,300\n\n\u2022 Raytheon Co: $60,000\n\nBanking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee \u2014 Richard Shelby of Alabama\n\nTop industry: Finance, insurance and real estate Top three donors:\n\n\u2022 Travelers Companies: $92,500\n\n\u2022 Drummond Co: $89,500\n\n\u2022 Lockheed Martin: $88,800\n\nBudget Committee \u2014 Jeff Sessions of Alabama\n\nTop industry: Defense Aerospace Top three donors:\n\n\u2022 International Paper: $47,500\n\n\u2022 American Dental Association: $41,500\n\n\u2022 Norfolk Southern: $41,000\n\nCompiled by Patrick Temple-West, financial services reporter Source: Center for Responsive Politics\n\nThe Troublemaker: His fellow Senate and House Republicans will be looking to use must-pass spending bills to insert riders hindering Obama administration priorities on health care and the environment. But those are the same kind of poison pills likely to draw Obama veto threats and raise the stakes for another partial government shutdown.\n\nPain for Obama: Obama\u2019s domestic priorities have been strangled for years by budget cuts from sequestration, and there\u2019s no sense that anything will change now that he faces GOP majorities holding the purse strings and a very different policy agenda.\n\nSignature moment: Cochran\u2019s Senate career nearly ended earlier this year after he ran a sleepy primary campaign against tea party rival Chris McDaniel. Forced into a runoff, Cochran held on by a narrow 7,700-vote margin.\n\nCompiled by Darren Samuelsohn, senior policy reporter\n\n***\n\nThe Committee: Senate Banking Committee\n\nThe Chair: Richard Shelby (Alabama) is the favorite to be chairman, but the job could fall to Mike Crapo (Idaho), who has been the top Republican on Senate Banking since 2013.\n\nThe Lowdown: Shelby is poised to retake the committee\u2019s gavel after serving as chairman from 2003 to 2007. The Alabama Republican can be counted on to push for a rollback of rules included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, but he is also no ally of Wall Street and big banks. Both regulators and big financial firms will likely be under scrutiny by Shelby.\n\nShelby\u2019s Top Bills:\n\n\u2022 Economic impact \u2014 Shelby has pushed legislation that would require regulators to perform an economic impact analysis on the rules they write. In addition, Shelby introduced a bill that would direct banking regulators to report to Congress on the impact of proposed capital rules.\n\n\u2022 CFPB: Shelby and Republicans have long supported legislation that would require the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to be run by a board rather than a single director and to have its funding approved annually by Congress.\n\n\u2022 Dodd-Frank cleanup: Shelby introduced a bill that he says makes \u201cpurely technical\u201d and nonsubstantive corrections to drafting errors in the 2010 regulatory overhaul.\n\nPro Take: Shelby can be expected to ramp up the committee\u2019s oversight of Dodd-Frank and financial regulators, in particular the CFPB and the Financial Stability Oversight Council. While any attempts to scale back President Obama\u2019s signature Wall Street reform law will meet stiff resistance from Senate Democrats and the White House, Shelby may be able to find common ground with liberals when it comes to the largest banks. They both favor, for instance, tougher funding, or capital, rules for Wall Street giants.\n\nBipartisan Moments: At a September committee hearing, Shelby joined Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in charging that recent multibillion-dollar settlements between the Justice Department and large banks were inadequate because they did not include charges against any executives. Shelby said DOJ \u201cseems bent on money rather than justice.\u201d\n\nThe Troublemaker: During the drafting of Dodd-Frank, Shelby was the top Republican on Banking, but it was Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) who worked most closely with Democrats \u2014 Shelby did not end up voting for the bill. Corker\u2019s independent streak could cause headaches for Shelby this time around as well, particularly when it comes to what to do with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Corker worked closely with Democrats to produce a housing finance bill this year that Shelby opposes.\n\nPain for Obama: Shelby has shown little reluctance to block Obama\u2019s nominees that he considers too liberal. This could make it more difficult for the president to fill vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board and any other regulatory slots that open. In 2011, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Peter Diamond, a Nobel Prize winner, withdrew as a Fed nominee when it became clear the Shelby-led opposition would not relent. Shelby said Diamond lacked the necessary monetary policy experience. Obama\u2019s first nominee to be Fannie and Freddie\u2019s regulator, North Carolina Banking Commissioner Joseph Smith, was also blocked by Senate Republicans, with Shelby leading the charge.\n\nSignature Moment: In 2008, Shelby was one of 15 Republicans who voted against the creation of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, which allowed the government to bail out banks during the financial crisis.\n\nCompiled by Zachary Warmbrodt, financial services reporter\n\n***\n\nThe Committee: Budget\n\nThe Chairman: Likely: Jeff Sessions (Alabama). (Sessions could be bumped by Sen. Mike Enzi, who outranks him on the panel. An Enzi spokesman said the Wyoming Republican is considering his options.)\n\nThe Lowdown: If Sessions takes the gavel, it would give one of the Senate\u2019s most conservative members the power to change budgeting rules to make it easier to enact Republicans\u2019 agenda.\n\nThe Docket:\n\n\u2022 Passing a budget: After pounding Senate Democrats for years for failing to pass a budget, Republicans will be under pressure to show they can agree on a plan to put the government\u2019s books in order.\n\n\u2022 Reconciliation: Republicans could use the arcane parliamentary maneuver to pass legislation with a simple majority.\n\n\u2022 Choosing a Congressional Budget Office director: Republicans will have to decide whether to replace Doug Elmendorf, whose term ends in January.\n\n\u2022 Sequestration: After a two-year respite, sequestration will be back, with $109 billion in automatic spending cuts set to hit in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, 2015.\n\n\u2022 Dynamic scoring: Republicans may overhaul the way the budgetary costs of legislation are estimated.\n\nPro take: The Budget Committee would likely be a hyperpartisan panel with Sessions at the helm, especially if Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) becomes its ranking member. Sessions could use reconciliation, dynamic scoring and his power to name a new CBO director to strong-arm Democrats. But that could poison the well with the other side, making the days when Budget Committee members like Sens. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) and Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) worked together to reduce the deficit a distant memory.\n\nBipartisan moment: Though bipartisanship will likely be hard to come by on the panel, lawmakers will have to address sequestration, and Sessions could use his perch, as his predecessor, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, did, to broker a bipartisan deal to head off the looming cuts.\n\nThe Troublemaker: Sanders, a Budget Committee veteran who is not only at the opposite end of the political spectrum but is also considering a 2016 presidential run. It\u2019s hard to think of many things on which he and Sessions would not vehemently disagree.\n\nPain for Obama: Reconciliation can be used to sideline congressional Democrats and confront Obama with up-or-down decisions on a host of Republican priorities.\n\nSignature moment: A 2013 bipartisan deal to head off sequestration was a signature achievement of the Budget Committee, endorsed by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, his ranking Democrat Chris Van Hollen and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray. The only budget panel chieftain who opposed it? Sessions, who said it didn\u2019t cut enough spending.\n\nCompiled by Brian Faler, senior tax reporter", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "How it could play out as Senate committees change hands.", "title": "Young guns vs. gavels", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/republican-senate-committee-chairmanships-112723.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/10/141110_hatchcruz_photoillo_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Senate Republicans,Chuck Grassley,John McCain,Chairmanships,Elections,Senate,Thad Cochran,Republicans,2014 Elections,Rand Paul,Marco Rubio,Orrin Hatch,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "How it could play out as Senate committees change hands.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce1ec\"", "article_summary": "Signature moment: A 2013 bipartisan deal to head off sequestration was a signature achievement of the Budget Committee, endorsed by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, his ranking Democrat Chris Van Hollen and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray.\nBut that could poison the well with the other side, making the days when Budget Committee members like Sens.\nPain for Obama: Shelby has shown little reluctance to block Obama\u2019s nominees that he considers too liberal.\nThe Troublemaker: Sanders, a Budget Committee veteran who is not only at the opposite end of the political spectrum but is also considering a 2016 presidential run.\nPro take: The Budget Committee would likely be a hyperpartisan panel with Sessions at the helm, especially if Sen.
