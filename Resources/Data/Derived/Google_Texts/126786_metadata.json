Medicare '14: New ads, old messages\n\nThere\u2019s an element of nostalgia in campaign ads targeted at seniors. Both parties are talking about Medicare like it\u2019s 2012.\n\nThe ads are new, but the arguments are old: Republicans accuse Democratic incumbents of cutting $716 billion from Medicare as part of the health reform law in 2010. Democrats say the GOP lawmakers have been trying to \u201cend Medicare as we know it\u201d since 2011 by turning it into a voucher program as part of Rep Paul Ryan\u2019s House budget plan.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNeither attack is strictly true, but the vintage 2012 attacks just keep coming.\n\n( POLITICO's polling center)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to cover up his vote for Obamacare, cutting Medicare for West Virginia\u2019s seniors,\u201d says a NRCC attack on Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall.\n\n\u201cWhile Scott Brown represented Massachusetts, he voted to cut Social Security and Medicare,\u201d says a DSCC attack on the Republican now running for Senate in New Hampshire.\n\nThose attacks are typical and common. More than 12,000 television spots touched on Medicare in just one recent week in October, according to Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group.\n\nThere\u2019s been scant attention to Medicare policy over the past two years, aside from a failed compromise on an intractable physician payment problem, known as the \u201cdoc fix.\u201d But the worries about changing or cutting Medicare still resonate with voters, especially the retirees who reliably show up at the polls in midterms.\n\n( POLITICO's 2014 race ratings)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to believe public opinion would have shifted [Ryan\u2019s] way in the last two years in favor of ending the guarantee of Medicare,\u201d said Jeremy Funk of Americans United for Change, a labor-backed group originally formed to combat GOP efforts to privatize part of Social Security. \u201cTherefore it remains a potent contrast message to deliver today.\u201d\n\nThe Medicare messaging is playing out this year even in House and Senate races where neither candidate was around for the health law or Ryan budget votes. In Arizona\u2019s retiree-heavy Second District, for instance, Democratic Rep. Ron Barber took office in 2012, and his opponent, Martha McSally, has never been in Congress. But Medicare is the subject of multiple ads for both sides\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the majority of the Medicare recipients know what is happening to them,\u201d says a woman identified as Lou-Ann in an ad by the NRCC. \u201cUnder Obamacare, Medicare is going to be cut. Only when it hits you are you going to know it. Ron Barber did not stand up for the elderly.\u201d The on-screen texts refers to Barber\u2019s vote against one of the House\u2019s many efforts to repeal all or part of the health law.\n\n\u201cOne thing that worries me,\u201d says a middle-aged man working on his motorcycle, narrating a DCCC ad, \u201care these politicians like Martha McSally who would undermine Medicare, privatize it.\u201d The spot concludes, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m planning for retirement, and that plan starts with saying no to Martha McSally.\u201d\n\nDemocrats push the issue more: About 58 percent of the 12,537 Medicare-related spots on the air the week of Oct. 20-26 were from Democrats. But 40 percent of all health care-related ads mentioned Medicare, in large part because it remains one of the right\u2019s most powerful critiques of Obamacare.\n\nEntitlement fights have gone on for years \u2014 and Republicans had been losing the rhetorical battle on both Medicare and Social Security. The Ryan budget and talk of vouchers heightened that partisan disadvantage.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Worries about Medicare resonate with voters, especially the retirees who show up at the polls.", "title": "Medicare '14: New ads, old messages", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/medicare-in-the-2014-campaign-new-ads-old-messages-112391.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/31/141031_medicare_protest_gty_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Health Care,2014 Elections,Medicare", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Worries about Medicare resonate with voters, especially the retirees who show up at the polls.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Medicare '14: New ads, old messagesThere\u2019s an element of nostalgia in campaign ads targeted at seniors.\nEntitlement fights have gone on for years \u2014 and Republicans had been losing the rhetorical battle on both Medicare and Social Security.\nBut 40 percent of all health care-related ads mentioned Medicare, in large part because it remains one of the right\u2019s most powerful critiques of Obamacare.\nThe ads are new, but the arguments are old: Republicans accuse Democratic incumbents of cutting $716 billion from Medicare as part of the health reform law in 2010.\n\u201cWhile Scott Brown represented Massachusetts, he voted to cut Social Security and Medicare,\u201d says a DSCC attack on the Republican now running for Senate in New Hampshire."}
