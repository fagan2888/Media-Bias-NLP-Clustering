Rick Perry on the right, argue that the agency helps small businesses remain competitive in the global market and creates jobs in the United States.\n\n>>> Commentary: It\u2019s Time to End Cronyism in Washington. Let\u2019s Begin with the Export-Import Bank.\n\nHowever, opponents as conservative as House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, and as liberal as Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., characterize the agency as an engine of corporate welfare and cronyism.\n\nSuch an example of \u201ccommon ground\u201d should be heeded by \u201ccongressional leaders on the left,\u201d Nader writes, suggesting that Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). should be vocal opponents of Ex-Im.\n\nAlthough small businesses nationwide receive support from Ex-Im, the bank\u2019s financing is involved in only 2 percent of all U.S. exports. Several large companies \u2014 Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar among them \u2014 receive the bulk of loans and guarantees.\n\n>>> This State Benefits Big from the Export-Import Bank. Want to Know Why?\n\nNader writes:\n\nEx-Im defenders argue that the majority of its loans go to small businesses that cannot secure financing in the private market, conveniently ignoring the crucial fact that the majority of the money goes to big businesses such as \u2026 Boeing, as well as other giant corporations like General Electric (10 percent of Ex-Im loans and guarantees in 2013) and Caterpillar (approximately 5 percent).\n\nSuch companies argue their profits will suffer if Congress doesn\u2019t reauthorize the bank. Foreign recipients of Ex-Im financing, however, say business would not be interrupted should the charter expire.\n\nHubert Frach, divisional senior vice president for Dubai\u2019s Emirates Airline, told Reuters that Ex-Im\u2019s expiration would not hinder his company\u2019s ability to purchase planes from Boeing.\n\n\u201cEx-Im is not an exclusive tool for Emirates to finance the aircraft,\u201d he said. \u201cOur aircraft are financed by various concepts.\u201d\n\n>>> Deal or No Deal?
