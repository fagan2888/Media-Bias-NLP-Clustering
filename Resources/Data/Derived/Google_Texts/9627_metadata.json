European nations announced a new round of sanctions against Russia\u2019s financial, defense and energy sectors.\n\n\u201cLeaders agreed that the international community should therefore impose further costs on Russia and specifically that ambassadors from across the EU should agree a strong package of sectorial sanctions as swiftly as possible,\u201d UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced after his country, Germany, Italy and France imposed the new penalties.\n\nRelated: Let Europe Do the Heavy Political Lift with Putin\n\nDespite Europe\u2019s move, the Kremlin seems unconcerned. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed the penalties even before they arrived, saying earlier on Monday that Russia would \u201covercome any difficulties that may arise in certain areas of the economy, and maybe we will become more independent and more confident in our own strength.\u201d\n\nAfter the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 killed nearly 300 innocent people, many thought Putin would back down and lessen cooperation with Russian separatists fighting with Ukrainian security forces for control of western Ukraine. However, since the plane went down Russian resistance has done the opposite: it\u2019s actually increased.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Russia has upped the supply of weapons to the rebels. Putin is also warning Russian business leaders that the economic pinch is about to get tighter.\n\nYesterday, Putin called defense industry leaders to his home to discuss \u201crisks of a political nature,\u201d according to The Wall Street Journal. He also warned the Russian people, in a nationally televised talk to high-ranking Russian security officials last week, that the West is attempting to harm Russia \"in the economic sphere and politically.\"\n\nRelated: Four Ways NATO Could Affect the Ukraine Crisis\n\nWildly Popular with Russia\u2019s People\n\nIf the past is any indication, it\u2019s unlikely the new round of sanctions will be enough for common Russian citizens to turn on Putin. According to a June poll conducted by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, the percentage of Russians who \u201cbelieve in the positive political [perspectives] of V. Putin\u201d has increased 1.5 times in the last two years, from 40 percent in 2012 to 69 percent in mid-2014.\n\nThe research center found that Putin\u2019s popularity cut across all demographics and was not lagging, despite the crisis in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis stance is shared by young respondents (67 percent), elderly respondents (71 percent), residents of Moscow, St. Petersburg (76 percent) and rural area[s] (68 percent),\u201d the center found. \u201cEvery fifth respondent (20 percent) believes that Putin has reached the peak of his career and he can hardly achieve more than he has now. And only 5 percent think that his influence is declining; the share of such respondents has considerably decreased over a year (\u202619 percent in 2013).\u201d\n\nRelated: Russia, U.S. Edge Toward Economic Warfare\n\nPutin is so popular and such a dominating force in Russian politics that few Russians believe there is any one more capable of steering the country, the center found.\n\n\u201cToday three-quarters of Russians (73 percent) are ready to vote for Putin in the presidential elections, if he participates in these elections: over a year the number of such respondents has increased (from 51 percent in 2013),\u201d the center found. \u201cHalf of respondents (54 percent) report that they do not know any politician capable of competing with Putin\u2026 and such a person will not appear in the short run (48 percent a year ago).\u201d\n\nLosing Support of the Oligarchs?\n\nAs the poll shows, support for Putin among the Russian public is not dying down. However, the real source of power in Russia is the oligarchs, and new reports indicates that they\u2019re tiring of Putin\u2019s standoff with the west, which is hitting them the hardest.\n\nAccording to the German magazine Der Spiegel [the original story is in German, but an English language report can be found here), German intelligence chief Gerhard Schindler has told the Bundestag that a power struggle is underway between the Kremlin and Russian business leaders.\n\n\u201cAccording to German intelligence it is quite possible that some of the oligarchs who are worried by European Union sanctions will soon start putting economic interests above political concerns and try to put the brakes on Putin,\u201d Der Spiegel reported.\n\nThe German report came out before the new round of sanctions were announced. Many in Russia were assuming that Germany and the rest of Europe would not impose new penalties because of the close ties between the two. Yesterday, this assumption turned out to be false.\n\n\"The ruble is losing value, Russia's budget deficit is growing and its economic development is bad. Even the Russian president sees this,\" Germany Finance Minister Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble told Der Spiegel. \u201cNobody is Moscow should start thinking that Russia can win with its approach.\"\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Vladimir Putin has been able to get away with his involvement in Ukraine because the Russian people love him.
