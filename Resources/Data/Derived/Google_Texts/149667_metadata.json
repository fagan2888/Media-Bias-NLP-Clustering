Ted Cruz said \u201cabsolutely we shouldn't be sending $500 million of taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise.\u201d Chris Christie, Scott Walker, and Jeb Bush all bragged about defunding Planned Parenthood in their states. Carly Fiorina likened the Planned Parenthood issue to the Iran threat. Kasich argued that governors should be able to strip the organization of funding, and Trump didn\u2019t have much to say about Planned Parenthood but he did promise to \u201ctake care of women.\u201d In calling for the defunding of the national reproductive health provider\u2014a move that would place basic health care and services, including family planning, out of reach for millions\u2014the candidates are ignoring research that has over and over again show that publicly funded family planning is one of our government's smartest and most cost-effective public investments. In recent years family planning has joined abortion in conservative crosshairs, but the economic benefits it confers once made it an uncontroversial and bipartisan issue.\n\nThis is not to say the health benefits aren\u2019t important. They are, and they have been well documented and cited. For decades Planned Parenthood and other reproductive-health providers have\u2014with support from programs such as Medicaid and Title X, the nation\u2019s only program solely focused on making family planning available to all\u2014prevented or provided care for millions of unintended pregnancies, unintended births, abortions, sexually transmitted infections, and cervical cancer. If that\u2019s not enough\u2014clearly, it\u2019s not\u2014the economic benefits of these programs are what should earn them high praise from conservatives. In a Guttmacher Institute study of women seeking contraceptive care at publicly funded clinics, 63 percent of women reported birth control had allowed them to take better care of themselves or their families, and 56 percent said it allowed them to take care of themselves financially. Half reported that it helped them stay in school and complete their education and that it helped them get or keep a job and advance their careers. In a recent poll, 72 percent of Pennsylvania voters said a woman's ability to control the timing and size of her family impacts her financial stability, and 62 percent believed that laws that made abortion harder to access can negatively impact a woman's financial security. Polls of voters in New York and Virginia showed similar results. Women\u2019s ability to plan and space their pregnancies has been shown to improve educational attainment and increase wages and lifetime earnings. Access to family planning has increased women\u2019s labor-force participation, improved their\u2014and their family\u2019s\u2014economic security, and has multi-generational health and economic benefits. The National Women\u2019s Law Center highlights research that shows the initial availability of birth-control pills in the early 1970s accounted for 30 percent of the growth in the proportion of women in skilled careers between 1970 and 1990, and contributed to an increase in the number of women in fields that are dominated by men, such as medicine and law. Women\u2019s ability to plan and space their pregnancies has been shown to improve educational attainment and increase wages and lifetime earnings. And the children of mothers who had access to birth control have higher family incomes and college completion rates. Researcher Martha Bailey found that\u2014relative to children conceived in the same areas before family-planning programs began\u2014children born after the advent of federally funded family-planning programs lived in households with higher annual incomes and were 5 percent less likely to live in poverty, 15 percent less likely to live in households receiving public assistance, and 4 percent less likely to have a single parent.\n\nInvesting in reproductive health isn\u2019t just good for women and their families\u2014it\u2019s good for the economy. Today it is estimated that every dollar spent on publicly funded family planning yields a savings of $7.09 in public expenditures. In 2013, publicly funded family-planning providers helped women prevent two million unintended pregnancies, one million of which would have resulted in unplanned births and 693,000 in abortions. In 2010 just over half of all births\u2014and 68 percent of the 1.5 million unplanned births\u2014in the United States were paid for by public insurance. That year, the government expenditures on unintended pregnancies and the associated births, abortions, and miscarriages totaled $21.0 billion. According to the Guttmacher Institute, without these services rates of abortion, unintended pregnancies, and unplanned births would have all been 60 percent higher, and the related costs could have been as much as 75 percent higher.

That\u2019s a far cry from the $2.37 billion America spent on publicly funded family planning in 2010 (75 percent in Medicaid expenditures, 10 percent in Title X, and the rest in state appropriations, block grants). In 2013, those programs served 8.3 million women\u2014only 42 percent of those in need of publicly funded care. Despite these savings, the Republican candidates contend that family-planning spending is off the charts, but that is certainly not the case. Between 2010 and 2013, Congress reduced Title X spending by 12 percent, while the number of women in need of publicly funded family planning services grew by five percent, or a total of 918,000 women. When accounting for inflation, today\u2019s Title X budget is two-thirds of what it was in 1980. In 2015, Congress appropriated $286.5 million for Title X (down from $317 million in 2010), but if funding had kept pace with inflation over the past three decades, the current level would be in the ballpark of $850 million. In addition to the drop in funding, state regulations on Title X funding have altered the reach of the program. Today Ohio, Michigan, and Texas have tiered funding systems that prioritize state health-department clinics and crisis pregnancy centers, leaving little to no money for the very family-planning clinics the funding was originally intended. Kansas and Oklahoma prohibit private family-planning providers from receiving state and federal funding and many other states prevent organizations that also provide abortion services from receiving funding.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Family-planning programs boost incomes, reduce poverty, and ease the load on America\u2019s safety net.
