On the December 8th, 2014 edition of Your Call, we’ll talk to Dr. Robert Okin about his new book “Silent Voices: People With Mental Disorders On The Street.” Nearly 200,000 of the homeless people in the US are severely mentally ill. Dr Okin spent two years collecting the stories of mentally ill homeless people in San Francisco. How do they end up on the street? And how can we help them while respecting their humanity -- and autonomy? Join the conversation on the next your Call, with Rose Aguilar and you.

Guests:

Dr. Robert Okin, former chief of service of the San Francisco General Hospital Department of Psychiatry and a professor of clinical psychiatry at the UCSF, and author of Silent Voices: People with mental disorder on the street
