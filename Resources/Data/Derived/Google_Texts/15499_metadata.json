Spurred at least in part by the ACA, our system has been evolving from being \u201cfee-based\u201d to \u201cvalue-based.\u201d In other words, instead of doctors, hospitals and other providers being paid by the number of visits and tests they order, they\u2019re now increasingly being held accountable, and being paid, based on the value of care they deliver.\n\nRecently, CMS announced plans to require hospitals in 75 geographic areas to participate in a test of the value-based \u201cbundles\" program. It would pay hospitals fixed amounts for performing hip and knee replacements, two of the most common procedures Medicare recipients undergo. This initiative, more formally known as the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model, combined with CMS\u2019s Bundled Payment for Care Improvement bundle initiative, have the potential to be true game-changers for healthcare overall.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat is why this move is the clearest sign yet from Washington that not only is the Obama administration serious about the move to value-based care, they are not content to let the shift happen gradually. Instead, the White House is willing to aggressively bet on the benefits bundled payments and similar programs can deliver to the system and to patients sooner rather than later.\n\nOne major determinant of whether or not this wager will pay off is an often overlooked area of the system that can be made more efficient: post-acute care \u2013 or the care a patient receives once they leave the hospital. A key problem under the traditional fee-based system is hospitals and providers have lacked sufficient incentives to focus on the full episode of care.\n\nAs a result, post-acute care coordination has slipped through the cracks, leading to inconsistent care, whether it being discharged too early without the appropriate resources in the community \u2013 leading to preventable hospital readmissions \u2013 or staying too long in skilled care facilities \u2013 resulting in bloated Medicare fees. With this in mind it isn\u2019t shocking that post-acute care has been one of the fastest growing and most highly variant cost areas in healthcare.\n\nThis is where the bundles come in. The goal is to incentivize everyone to deliver the best outcomes for patients at the lowest costs (the core of value-based care). Instead of each interaction and service being a separate bill back to the government, the bundles approach equates to one payment for both the initial hospital stay and the 90 days after \u2013 with CMS guaranteed savings.\n\nThe bundles are now in their second full year of implementation, and participation has been rapidly growing, with the total number of providers taking part increasing significantly in the past year. In March, Rep. David McKinley David McKinleyCoal Country\u2019s top lawyer takes on Obama\u2019s EPA Coal country rages against fall Conservatives fail to strip cyber text from spending bill MORE (D-W.Va.) introduced H.R. 1458, the Bundling and Coordinating Post-Acute Care (BACPAC) Act, designed to create further incentives for expansion of the bundles program. But the new plan to require widespread bundle adoption could be the equivalent of spiking a marathon runner with an adrenaline shot.\n\nEarly results have been promising. In our work as a bundles convener with a presence at over 100 hospitals, we are seeing many hospital and provider groups participating in the bundles deliver lower costs for the system, better patient outcomes and increased patient satisfaction. CMS estimates the new bundles initiative will cover roughly 25 percent of the hip and knee replacements that Medicare pays for and expects more than $150 million in net savings over the next five years \u2013 a dollar amount many experts consider conservative. Based on the current trend line, it\u2019s fair to predict further positive results, which will continue to demonstrate the benefits when a value-based approach to healthcare is translated from theory to practice.\n\nHowever, for this positive momentum to continue, policymakers and private sector players must keep supporting programs like bundled payments, and take bold actions like the Obama administration and CMS did recently. Otherwise, the transition to value-based care could stall, and patients, providers and taxpayers could all pay the price. However, with the way Washington is playing their cards, it\u2019s looking more and more like not only are programs such as the bundles here to stay, they may become the new normal sooner than anyone dared to hope or expect.\n\nRichards is CEO of naviHealth and Advisory Board member to the Post-acute Care Center for Research.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Instead of doctors, hospitals and other providers being paid by the number of visits and tests they order, they\u2019re now increasingly being held accountable, and being paid, based on the value of care they deliver.", "description": "Instead of doctors, hospitals and other providers being paid by the number of visits and tests they order, they\u2019re now increasingly being held accountable, and being paid, based on the value of care they deliver.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Instead of doctors, hospitals and other providers being paid by the number of visits and tests they order, they\u2019re now increasingly being held accountable, and being paid, based on the value of care they deliver.", "title": "Washington\u2019s big bet on value-based care", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/248595-washingtons-big-bet-on-value-based-care", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/248595-washingtons-big-bet-on-value-based-care", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-21T16:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Clay Richards", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",David McKinley,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-21T16:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/248595-washingtons-big-bet-on-value-based-care", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Instead of doctors, hospitals and other providers being paid by the number of visits and tests they order, they\u2019re now increasingly being held accountable, and being paid, based on the value of care they deliver.", "card": "summary", "title": "Washington\u2019s big bet on value-based care"}, "dcterms.title": "Washington\u2019s big bet on value-based care"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca210\"", "article_summary": "The goal is to incentivize everyone to deliver the best outcomes for patients at the lowest costs (the core of value-based care).\nOtherwise, the transition to value-based care could stall, and patients, providers and taxpayers could all pay the price.\nRichards is CEO of naviHealth and Advisory Board member to the Post-acute Care Center for Research.\nWith this in mind it isn\u2019t shocking that post-acute care has been one of the fastest growing and most highly variant cost areas in healthcare.\n1458, the Bundling and Coordinating Post-Acute Care (BACPAC) Act, designed to create further incentives for expansion of the bundles program."}
