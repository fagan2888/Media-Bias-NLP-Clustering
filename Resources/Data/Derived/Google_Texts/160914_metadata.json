Asked which one or two issues were most important to them, the same two issues stood out: 45 percent wanted to repeal Obamacare, while 43 percent wanted more aggressive pursuit of terrorists.\n\nThe GOP poll results, compiled from interviews with 402 likely Iowa Republican caucus participants Jan. 26-29, suggest some reasons why former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie have struggled so far while more conservative figures such as Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee have greater support.\n\n\u201cWe need a conservative approach; we have got to turn this whole country around,\u201d said Dennis Ard, 70, a retired teacher from Sioux City who favors Walker. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a real American, as American as I can find, as patriotic as I can find, with those values that I\u2019ve grown up understanding. I\u2019m looking for a pro-life person that I guess would be maybe very conservative; to me, it\u2019s normal. Other than that, jobs are the most important thing in this country.\u201d\n\nArd said he thinks Bush\u2019s rivals have twisted his stance on immigration to make him sound more liberal than he is. He said he thinks Bush cares about education, but he added he is concerned about \u201ctoo much federal control in education.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really, really like Jeb Bush and would push him first, but you know what I\u2019m afraid of? They will think, \u2018Oh, another Bush,\u2019 and the politics that went along with his brother,\u201d Ard said. \u201cI\u2019m just afraid that it would be a close race but I don\u2019t think Bush could pull it off.\u201d\n\nLikely Republican caucus participants are galvanized around several hot-button issues. Along with their firm stance in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act, 70 percent oppose legalizing marijuana. Two-thirds oppose making gay marriage legal nationwide.\n\nThe findings offer some mixed signals about immigration reform, potentially a trouble spot for Bush because some within his party consider him to be soft on the issue. While 65 percent of the Republican sample opposes creating a path to permanent residency for people living illegally in the U.S., only 9 percent identified it as the most important issue for the next president to address, down from 11 percent in an October poll, and just 12 percent said it was among the top two issues of importance to them personally, placing it behind building the Keystone XL pipeline on their priority list.\n\nIn another potential drag on Bush in Iowa, 61 percent said they oppose implementing the Common Core education standards, which the former governor has supported.\n\nYet the survey suggests that likely Iowa Republican caucus-goers don\u2019t see most of those litmus tests as deal-breakers. Asked to identify the most important issues for the next president to address, survey respondents led with terrorism, at 25 percent, up from 16 percent in the October poll, likely as a result of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in France. The federal deficit was next, at 21 percent. Only 8 percent identified health care and 7 percent social issues as most important.\n\nMartha Miller, 55, a registered nurse and homemaker from Wapello, Iowa, whose early favorites in the potential field are Walker and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, said while terrorism is the most important issue for her, she\u2019d feel less motivated to support a Republican who wants to liberalize immigration policy, nationalize school standards, or keep Obamacare in place.\n\nUltimately, a strong anti-abortion stance is the only issue Miller considers non-negotiable. \u201cIt\u2019s more important that they win,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really is. I\u2019m not always going to be able to have my agenda, and I look at the big picture\u2014except when it comes to abortion.\u201d\n\nThe survey also reflects the extent to which the two parties are talking past one another. \u201cThey\u2019re just not at the same table having a conversation together,\u201d said pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of West Des Moines-based Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about different things.\u201d\n\nThe top issue for the next president in the minds of 401 likely Democratic caucus participants also surveyed was unemployment and jobs, at 21. Climate change was the top issue for the next president to tackle in the minds of 13 percent of the Democratic sample, while a grand total of one respondent in the Republican sample agreed.\n\nClimate change is the most important issue the next president will confront, followed by income inequality, said Robert Haug, 68, of Ames, a likely Democratic caucus-goer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a view that the Republicans share,\u201d said Haug, who said he'd be \u201chappy\u201d voting for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton but favors the views of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. \u201cIt seems to me that most if not all of the current candidates on the Republican side are in compete denial about the scientific evidence about climate change.\u201d\n\nAsked which two issues were most important to them personally, likely Democratic caucus-goers cited taking steps to reduce income inequality (37 percent) and raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans to pay for middle-class tax cuts (30 percent) over more aggressively pursuing terrorists (19 percent). Just 10 percent of the Democrat sample said repealing Obamacare was a top priority. \u201cThe polarization between the parties is obvious,\u201d Selzer said.\n\nMore generally, there were two areas of partisan agreement in the survey: Support for more aggressively pursuing terrorists in the U.S. and abroad to prevent more attacks, and at the same time support for cutting back on surveillance programs that involve collecting telephone data of ordinary Americans.\n\nWhile likely Republican caucus participants felt more strongly about the need for a more aggressive anti-terror policy than Democrats, both were overwhelmingly in favor of it\u201491 percent in the Republican sample and 70 percent in the Democrat sample. On the surveillance question, there was hardly any partisan difference, with 60 percent of the Republican sample and 63 percent of the Democrat sample saying surveillance should be cut back.\n\n\u201cThey want their cake and they want to eat it too,\u201d Selzer said of poll respondents. \u201cThey understand that right now terrorism feels like a more immediate threat than it has in a couple years, but they have also learned that there\u2019s been what they think of as overreach by the federal government, the ability that the government is capturing their personal telephone conversations. They don\u2019t want their head cut off, but they don\u2019t want the government listening in on their phone calls.\u201d\n\nThe poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nMore from the Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register Iowa Poll\n\n\u2014 Walker Surging as Bush Struggles\n\n\u2014 Jeb Bush Has a Big Iowa Problem\n\n\u2014 Romney Would Have Faced Many Campaign Hurdles\n\n\u2014 Full Iowa Poll Coverage", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Margaret Talev", "description": "Likely GOP\u00a0caucus-goers send\u00a0mixed signals about how crucial a candidate's immigration stance\u00a0will be.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i5Po7zMJSFDY/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "Likely GOP\u00a0caucus-goers send\u00a0mixed signals about how crucial a candidate's immigration stance\u00a0will be.", "title": "Iowa Republicans: Obamacare and Terrorism Sizzle\u00a0While\u00a0Social Issues Still Matter", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-02/bloomberg-politics-des-moines-register-iowa-poll-obamacare-and-terrorism-sizzle-among-republicans-but-social-issues-still-matter", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i5Po7zMJSFDY/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Likely GOP\u00a0caucus-goers send\u00a0mixed signals about how crucial a candidate's immigration stance\u00a0will be.", "title": "Iowa Republicans: Obamacare and Terrorism Sizzle\u00a0While\u00a0Social Issues Still Matter", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-02/bloomberg-politics-des-moines-register-iowa-poll-obamacare-and-terrorism-sizzle-among-republicans-but-social-issues-still-matter", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i5Po7zMJSFDY/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "Likely GOP\u00a0caucus-goers send\u00a0mixed signals about how crucial a candidate's immigration stance\u00a0will be."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Iowa Republicans: Obamacare and Terrorism Sizzle\u00a0While\u00a0Social Issues Still Matter", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NJ55826KLVRM01", "parsely-author": "Margaret Talev", "date": "2015-02-02T11:00:02.999Z", "keywords": "Immigration,Jeb Bush,Iowa Poll", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Immigration,Jeb Bush,Iowa Poll", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-02T11:00:02.999Z", "parsely-tags": "Immigration,Jeb Bush,Iowa Poll,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-02/bloomberg-politics-des-moines-register-iowa-poll-obamacare-and-terrorism-sizzle-among-republicans-but-social-issues-still-matter"}, "article_summary": "More from the Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register Iowa Poll\u2014 Walker Surging as Bush Struggles\u2014 Jeb Bush Has a Big Iowa Problem\u2014 Romney Would Have Faced Many Campaign Hurdles\u2014 Full Iowa Poll Coverage\nYet the survey suggests that likely Iowa Republican caucus-goers don\u2019t see most of those litmus tests as deal-breakers.\nMore than 90 percent of likely Iowa Republican caucus participants said they favored pursuing terrorists more aggressively, while 80 percent were in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act.\nOn the surveillance question, there was hardly any partisan difference, with 60 percent of the Republican sample and 63 percent of the Democrat sample saying surveillance should be cut back.\nWhile likely Republican caucus participants felt more strongly about the need for a more aggressive anti-terror policy than Democrats, both were overwhelmingly in favor of it\u201491 percent in the Republican sample and 70 percent in the Democrat sample."}
