Newsbusters, a conservative group that critiques the media, is one that has taken issue with the PolitiFact Virginia designation, saying it is absolutely fair to link what Warner said to Obama\u2019s promise.\n\n\u201cSomehow, GOP challenger Ed Gillespie is judged as wrong to suggest Politifact called this the \u2018Lie of the Year,\u2019 or suggesting it applies to every Democrat pushing Obamacare, not just Obama. Warren Fiske \u2013 a reporter with the Richmond Times-Dispatch \u2013 lamely claimed that only Obama is the subject of the original designation,\u201d Newsbusters said. \u201dFiske also claimed that somehow, when Senator Warner pushed his colleagues to vote for Obamacare, he was somehow victimized and surprised when Obama made a lie out of the original promise.\"\n\n[MORE: Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\n\u201cCan you imagine a newspaper reporter trying to claim that if you voted for the Iraq war, you're not really responsible for how the war unfolds when you run for re-election, since the president 'surprised' you when it didn't go as planned? These liberal media 'fact checker' websites define 'fact' in an incredibly elastic and politicized way \u2013 just the way they report the rest of the news,\u201d Newsbusters concluded.\n\nThe Gillespie campaign isn\u2019t backing down in the face of the criticism. It posted a letter of its own, signed by campaign manager Chris Leavitt, that reads, \u201cPolitiFact didn\u2019t designate President Obama the 'liar of the year.' They deemed 'lie of the year' the false statement made by President Obama, Mark Warner and many others that if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health plan.\u201d\n\nAccording to the campaign (and in the interests of full disclosure, let me add that my daughter is an unpaid volunteer) and the letter, \u201cUp to 250,000 Virginians will receive cancellation notices this fall after being assured by Mark Warner and President Obama that wouldn\u2019t happen. Mark Warner broke his promise to Virginians when he made the statement PolitiFact national deemed lie of the year. We rate PolitiFact Virginia\u2019s false rating 'false,' and so will a majority of Virginia voters in November.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Politifact Virginia Helps Mark Warner By Denying Obamacare Lie", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Democrats who claimed you could keep your plan under the health care law are as much to blame as Obama.", "title": "A Lie No Matter Who Told It", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2014/09/29/politifact-virginia-helps-mark-warner-by-denying-obamacare-lie", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/ac/08/23672d8e437caa44c3fd8736b8d8/140929-markwarner-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrats who claimed you could keep your plan under the health care law are as much to blame as Obama.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Politifact Virginia Helps Mark Warner By Denying Obamacare Lie"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 29, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Roff,Warner, Mark,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,media,media bias,Virginia,Gillespie, Ed,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Democrats who claimed you could keep your plan under the health care law are as much to blame as Obama."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbcb6\"", "article_summary": "[SEE: Cartoons on President Obama]\"The Lie of the Year is awarded each December by our colleagues at PolitiFact National,\u201d Politifact Virginia says on its Website.\nIt\u2019s a statement the Gillespie ad labels the \u201cLie of the Year,\u201d a description with which PolitiFact Virginia has taken issue.\nMark Warner broke his promise to Virginians when he made the statement PolitiFact national deemed lie of the year.\nThe Gillespie campaign isn\u2019t backing down in the face of the criticism.\nNewsbusters, a conservative group that critiques the media, is one that has taken issue with the PolitiFact Virginia designation, saying it is absolutely fair to link what Warner said to Obama\u2019s promise."}
