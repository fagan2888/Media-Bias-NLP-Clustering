John Kasich has announced he will officially launch his presidential campaign in a few weeks, there may be new attention on another Republican statewide officeholder.\n\nLt. Gov. Mary Taylor seems to be out in front a lot these days \u2013 at the unveiling of the Thomas Edison statue in the Statehouse May 20, the grand opening of a new technology center for the Wendy\u2019s fast food restaurant in Columbus a week later, and the groundbreaking for a highway project in southeastern Ohio in late June.\n\nBut when Gov. John Kasich officially hits the presidential campaign trail, his lieutenant governor will likely be a lot more visible.\n\nDavid Niven, a political science professor at the University of Cincinnati, and says it will be a great chance for Taylor.\n\n\u201cShe has to sit back while Mike DeWine defines who he is, while Jon Husted defines who he is, so she has really been left with a secondary role,\u201d said Niven. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to imagine right now her being able to elevate herself past them without an opportunity, without a chance to shine.\u201d\n\nPolitical science professor David Cohen of the Ray C. Bliss Institute for Applied Politics at the University of Akron, has had a chance to observe Taylor first-hand, since he lives in Green, which Taylor represented when she was in the Ohio House a decade ago.\n\nCohen says being out in front would give her a leg up as she and other Republican candidates prepare for the statewide elections in 2018.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always easier, easier to raise money, easier in terms of gaining name recognition as an incumbent than it is as a challenger,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cAnd I think one of her big challenges as lieutenant governor is she doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of name recognition. And that\u2019s a problem for just about every lieutenant governor in the country.\u201d\n\nNiven says taking on a bigger public role would be an opportunity for Taylor to escape the negative reports that have come out about her use of a state plane \u2013 she says the trips were official business and she paid the state back \u2013 and the resignations of two top staffers after questions were raised about the hours they claimed they had worked.\n\nAnd Niven says it would be a chance for Taylor to define herself beyond the limited public profile she\u2019s had so far \u2013 which has primarily focused on her opposition to the Affordable Care Act, which she calls Obamacare.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, she really isn\u2019t a voice in the administration\u2019s budget plan; she\u2019s not a voice in the administration\u2019s overall agenda,\u201d Niven said. \u201cThis would give her an opportunity to assert relevance and credibility and leadership.\u201d\n\nBut Cohen doesn\u2019t think the reported situations involving the plane trips and the staffers are that unusual for an elected official; and that they won\u2019t be a roadblock to Taylor, who he notes pundits don\u2019t often mention as a candidate for higher office.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re really overlooking someone who has a pretty impressive resume and experience to run for governor or senator or some other higher office,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cI think that\u2019s a mistake and I think she really is a force to be reckoned with.\u201d\n\nNiven notes that Taylor wouldn\u2019t have more authority with Kasich out of state, unlike in New Jersey, where the lieutenant governor gets full acting gubernatorial power, including veto power.\n\nFor her part, Taylor said that she didn\u2019t want to talk about her responsibilities or the possibilities for her until after Kasich\u2019s campaign launch, which is set for July 21.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Now that Ohio Gov.
