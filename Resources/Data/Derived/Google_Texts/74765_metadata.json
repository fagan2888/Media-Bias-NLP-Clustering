However, the program got off to a horrendous start last fall when the federal Obamacare website crashed and took weeks to fix.\n\nIn Illinois, more than 333,000 residents have signed up for health coverage and about a third of those have actually purchased insurance.\n\nRepublicans have consistently campaigned against the law, making dozens of attempts to repeal it since it was signed in 2010.\n\nCommentary on Twitter was fast, funny and predictable.\n\nPerhaps the cartoon didn\u2019t go far enough.\n\n@gdebenedetti Such restraint\u2026going with \"open wide\" instead of \"bend over.\" \u2014 xpostfactoid (@xpostfactoid1) April 7, 2014\n\nBachmann\u2019s press operation quickly spun the story around.\n\nBachmann Fires Back at New Yorker Cover: They 'Parrot the Administration's Obamacare Talking Points' | Truth Revolt: http://t.co/Rmh2Js35K9 \u2014 Truth Revolt (@TruthRevoltOrg) April 7, 2014\n\n\u201cIf anybody is an expert in spoon-feeding, it is the liberal media and their disposition to parrot the Administration\u2019s Obamacare talking points and unconfirmed enrollment numbers,\u201d said Dan Kotman, spokesman for Bachmann. \u201cWith an ounce of curiosity, they would quickly find that Obamacare is causing premiums to skyrocket and patients to lose their plans and doctors\u2014exactly the opposite of what President Obama promised.\u201d\n\nAn unnamed senior GOP congressional aide told TruthRevolt that the cartoon is a \u201cperfect illustration\u201d of the condescending attitude displayed so often by liberals.\n\n\u201cThe joke is really on them. The clear goal here was to mock conservatives, but what they\u2019ve given us instead is a perfect illustration of liberal paternalism.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Declaring a victory for his health care reform plan, the New Yorker's latest cover shows President Obama spoon-feeding GOP leaders their medicine.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2014/04/08/new-yorker-cover-obama-gives-gop-their-medicine/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbschicago.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/482080645.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbschicago.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/482080645.jpg?w=1500", "height": 1069}, "type": "article", "description": "Declaring a victory for his health care reform plan, the New Yorker's latest cover shows President Obama spoon-feeding GOP leaders their medicine.", "title": "New Yorker Cover: Obama Gives GOP Their Medicine"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbschicago.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/482080645.jpg?w=1500", "title": "New Yorker Cover: Obama Gives GOP Their Medicine", "site": "CBSchicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Declaring a victory for his health care reform plan, the New Yorker's latest cover shows President Obama spoon-feeding GOP leaders their medicine."}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Weather, Traffic, and the Best of Chicago - CBS 2 TV | WBBM Newsradio 780 | 670 The Score", "keywords": "local, news, politics, syndicated local, cartoon, gop, new yorker, new yorker cover, obamacare", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Chicago", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msvalidate.01": "0FD6BCBEF9479095CF623C15833E1E08", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbschicago", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbschicago"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/87568ef37c252bc5ea7c1d183167347b?s=16", "news_keywords": "cartoon, gop, new yorker, new yorker cover, obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf02\"", "article_summary": "By John DodgeCHICAGO (CBS) \u2014 Declaring a victory for his health care reform plan, the New Yorker\u2019s latest cover shows President Obama spoon-feeding GOP leaders their medicine.\n\u201cThis whole enterprise was just an elaborate excuse,\u201d Barry Blitt said on the New Yorker website about his cover for this week\u2019s issue.\nHowever, the program got off to a horrendous start last fall when the federal Obamacare website crashed and took weeks to fix.\nObama is dressed in a white doctor\u2019s coat in an exam room, giving Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell some liquid medication, the kind typically reserved for children.\nIn Illinois, more than 333,000 residents have signed up for health coverage and about a third of those have actually purchased insurance."}
