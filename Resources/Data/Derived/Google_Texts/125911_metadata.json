(AP) \u2014 Former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal became embroiled in three high-profile lawsuits involving issues targeted by conservatives during his failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination: Planned Parenthood, Common Core and same-sex marriage.\n\nHis Democratic successor, Gov. John Bel Edwards, however, appears to be in no rush to wade into the controversies.\n\nThe Jindal administration lost the first rounds of both the Planned Parenthood and Common Core lawsuits, and appeals from that administration are pending. Edwards hasn\u2019t decided whether to continue those appeals, said his spokesman, Richard Carbo.\n\nJindal\u2019s health department cut off Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood clinics in the state after videos were released by an anti-abortion group claiming Planned Parenthood illegally sells fetal tissue. The organization denied the allegation and said the videos were misleading.\n\nA federal judge ordered that the state continue funding cancer screenings, gynecology exams and other health services at Planned Parenthood clinics that that serve an estimated 5,200 women in Louisiana.\n\nGovernors in several other states also are tied up in lawsuits over funding of the organization\u2019s clinics.\n\n\u201cWe are in talks with the Attorney General\u2019s office on the best path forward for the litigation,\u201d Carbo said in a statement.\n\nJindal lawyer Jimmy Faircloth said he\u2019s currently assuming the appeal will continue, but is awaiting further instructions from Edwards\u2018 office and Attorney General Jeff Landry.\n\nIn the 2014 federal Common Core lawsuit, Jindal accused President Barack Obama\u2019s administration of manipulating $4.3 billion in federal grant money and policy waivers to illegally pressure states to adopt the English and math standards and associated testing.\n\nA judge ruled that Jindal offered \u201cno evidence\u201d Louisiana was made to adopt a particular set of education standards.\n\nCarbo said Edwards\u2018 executive counsel was reviewing the case to determine whether later legislation approved by Obama makes the lawsuit moot: In December, Obama signed an overhaul of the No Child Left Behind education law that says the federal government can\u2019t mandate or give states incentives to adopt or maintain any particular set of academic standards.\n\nFaircloth, who also represented the Jindal administration in that case, said he\u2019ll take his cues from the Edwards administration on whether that appeal will proceed.\n\nThe third case, centering on same-sex marriage, is in state district court.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Louisiana, the Forum for Equality Foundation and six New Orleans residents are challenging as unconstitutional a Jindal executive order.\n\nThe \u201cMarriage and Conscience\u201d order prohibits state agencies under the governor\u2019s control from denying licenses, benefits, contracts or tax deductions in response to actions taken because of someone\u2019s \u201creligious belief that marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman.\u201d\n\nThe May 19th order remains in place until August, unless Edwards rescinds it, which he hasn\u2019t indicated he will do, though he opposed enacting similar legislation when Jindal pushed it.\n\nMarjorie Esman of the ACLU said she had no information from the new administration on its plans.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t heard from the governor or from the new attorney general,\u201d Esman said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Louisiana Gov.
