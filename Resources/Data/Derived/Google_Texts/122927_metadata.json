I\u2019m putting it in my will. I\u2019ll tell you why. I\u2019m an atheist. Most libertarians should be atheists.\n\nReason: Many are.\n\nKing: To believe in something above you. You don\u2019t believe in anything!\n\nReason: I believe in all sorts of things. But yes, you don\u2019t believe in an after life, so you want to be around.\n\nKing: I want to be around to pick up the pieces. That\u2019s an old song. But yes, I want to be around, and the only possible guarantee is cryonics, where they inject you with a compound that will keep you and put you in a tube, and if they cure the disease, they wake you up.\n\nReason: And you\u2019re gonna talk to Ted Williams when you wake up.\n\nKing: They don\u2019t put your head in a jar, that\u2019s a misnomer. I was just on Dr. Oz\u2019s show, and he showed me exactly how they do it. They take the body and immediately put an injection in to keep the blood flowing.\n\nReason: You\u2019re not betting on Dr. Oz as your afterlife physician, are you?\n\nKing: I\u2019ll take anybody.\n\nReason: So when you wake up-\n\nKing: You don\u2019t like Dr. Oz?\n\nReason: Dr. Oz, there\u2019s a lot of ethical questions about his snake oil-\n\nKing: The government shouldn\u2019t control it.\n\nReason: No I don\u2019t think so, absolutely not, he should be free to sell stuff, and people should be free to critique it and analyze it and offer an independent evaluation. Other than the people who wake you up from cryonics, who would be the first people on your talk show panel?\n\nKing: Depends what year it is and who\u2019s around? But I would ask questions, I\u2019ll meet new people and find out-\n\nReason: So, you, Ted Williams\u2019 head, and maybe a couple people who are just from the current time?\n\nKing: Walt Disney.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "TV and radio legend Larry King, who hosts two web-based shows on Ora TV, loves cryonics.
