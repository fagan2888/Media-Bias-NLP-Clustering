Not long ago, researchers had thought it was rare for the cells in a single healthy person to differ genetically in a significant way. But scientists are finding that it\u2019s quite common for an individual to have multiple genomes.\n\nSome people, for example, have groups of cells with mutations that are not found in the rest of the body. Some have genomes that came from other people.\n\n\u201cThere have been whispers in the matrix about this for years, even decades, but only in a very hypothetical sense,\u201d said Alexander Urban, a geneticist at Stanford University. Even three years ago, suggesting that there was widespread genetic variation in a single body would have been met with skepticism, he said. \u201cYou would have just run against the wall.\u201d\n\nBut a series of recent papers by Urban and others has demonstrated that those whispers were not just hypothetical. The variation in the genomes found in a single person is too large to be ignored.\n\n\u201cWe now know it\u2019s there,\u201d Urban said. \u201cNow we\u2019re mapping this new continent.\u201d\n\nDr. James R. Lupski, a leading expert on the human genome at Baylor College of Medicine, wrote in the journal Science that the existence of multiple genomes in an individual could have a tremendous impact on the practice of medicine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s changed the way I think,\u201d he said.\n\nScientists are finding links from multiple genomes to certain rare diseases, and now they\u2019re beginning to investigate genetic variations to shed light on more common disorders.\n\nScience\u2019s changing view is also raising questions about how forensic scientists should use DNA evidence to identify people. It\u2019s also posing challenges for genetic counselors, who can\u2019t assume that the genetic information from one cell can tell them about the DNA throughout a person\u2019s body.\n\nHUMAN BLUEPRINT\n\nWhen an egg and sperm combine their DNA, the genome they produce contains all the necessary information for building a new human. As the egg divides to form an embryo, it produces new copies of that original genome.\n\nFor decades, geneticists have explored how an embryo can use the instructions in a single genome to develop muscles, nerves and the many other parts of the human body. They also use sequencing to understand genetic variations that can raise the risk of certain diseases.\n\nGenetic counselors can look at the results of genetic screenings to help patients and their families cope with these diseases \u2014 altering their diet, for example, if they lack a gene for a crucial enzyme.\n\nThe cost of sequencing an entire genome has fallen so drastically in the past 20 years \u2014 now a few thousand dollars, down from an estimated $3 billion for the public-private partnership that sequenced the first human genome \u2014 that doctors are beginning to sequence the entire genomes of some patients.\n\nYet all these powerful tests are based on the assumption that, inside our body, a genome is a genome is a genome. Scientists believed that they could look at the genome from cells taken in a cheek swab and be able to learn about the genomes of cells in the brain or the liver or anywhere else in the body.\n\nIn the mid-1900s, scientists began to get clues that this was not always true. In 1953, for example, a British woman donated a pint of blood. It turned out that some of her blood was Type O and some was Type A. The scientists who studied her concluded that she had acquired some of her blood from her twin brother in the womb, including his genomes in his blood cells.\n\nChimerism, as such conditions came to be known, seemed for many years to be a rarity. But \u201cit can be commoner than we realized,\u201d said Dr. Linda Randolph, a pediatrician at Children\u2019s Hospital in Los Angeles.\n\nOne woman discovered she was a chimera as late as age 52. In need of a kidney transplant, she was tested so that she might find a match. The results indicated that she was not the mother of two of her three biological children. It turned out that she had originated from two genomes. One genome gave rise to her blood and some of her eggs; other eggs carried a separate genome.\n\nWomen can also gain genomes from their children. After a baby is born, it may leave some fetal cells behind in its mother\u2019s body, where they can travel to other organs and be absorbed into those tissues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty likely that any woman who has been pregnant is a chimera,\u201d Randolph said.\n\nA MOSAIC PATTERN\n\nA century ago, geneticists discovered one way in which people might acquire new genomes. They were studying \u201cmosaic animals,\u201d rare creatures with oddly colored patches of fur.\n\nThe animals didn\u2019t inherit the genes for these patches from their parents. Instead, while embryos, they acquired a mutation in a skin cell that divided to produce a colored patch.\n\nMosaicism, as this condition came to be known, was difficult to study in humans before the age of DNA sequencing. In 1960, researchers found that a form of leukemia is a result of mosaicism. A blood cell spontaneously mutates as it divides, moving a big chunk of one chromosome to another.\n\nLater studies added support to the idea that cancer is a result of mutations in specific cells. But scientists had little idea of how common cases of mosaicism were beyond cancer.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the technology to systematically think about them,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Walsh, a geneticist at Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cNow we\u2019re in the midst of a revolution.\u201d\n\nThe latest findings make it clear that mosaicism is quite common \u2014 even in healthy cells.\n\nNow that scientists are beginning to appreciate how common chimerism and mosaicism are, they\u2019re investigating the effects of these conditions on our health.\n\nRecent studies on chimeras suggest that these extra genomes can even be beneficial. Chimeric cells from fetuses appear to seek out damaged tissue and help heal it, for example.\n\nBut scientists are also starting to find cases in which mutations in specific cells help give rise to diseases other than cancer. Researchers are now investigating whether mosaicism is a factor in more common diseases, like schizophrenia.\n\n\u201cThis will play itself out over the next five or 10 years,\u201d said Urban.\n\nPRACTICAL MATTERS\n\nMedical researchers aren\u2019t the only scientists interested in our multitudes of personal genomes. So are forensic scientists. When they attempt to identify criminals or murder victims by matching DNA, they want to avoid being misled.\n\nLast year, forensic scientists at the Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory Division described how a saliva sample and a sperm sample from the same suspect in a sexual assault case didn\u2019t match.\n\nWhile the risk of confusion is real, it is manageable, experts said.\n\n\u201cThis should not be much of a concern for forensics,\u201d said Manfred Kayser, a professor of Forensic Molecular Biology at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. In the cases where mosaicism or chimerism causes confusion, forensic scientists can clear it up by other means .\n\nFor genetic counselors helping clients make sense of DNA tests, our many genomes pose more serious challenges. A DNA test that uses blood cells may miss disease-causing mutations in the cells of other organs.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t tell you what else is going on,\u201d said Nancy B. Spinner, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThat may change as scientists develop more powerful ways to investigate our different genomes and learn more about their links to diseases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not tomorrow that you\u2019re going to walk into your doctor\u2019s office and they\u2019re going to think this way,\u201d said Lupski. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/10/hfgenome15_v2-crop.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Think your personal DNA is the key to all your mysteries?
