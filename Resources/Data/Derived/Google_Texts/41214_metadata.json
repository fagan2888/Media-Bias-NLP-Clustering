The money will only go toward addressing health concerns in Vineland.\n\nHowever, Scheetz said using the grant in Vineland is a great starting point in hopefully getting Cumberland County out of last place in the state's health ranking.\n\n\"Cumberland County has been ranked the unhealthiest county for some time now,\" she said. \"And 40 percent of county residents live in Vineland. So we felt it was a good starting point.\"\n\nShe added that the CCA YMCA has a long-term goal of addressing health issues in municipalities throughout the county.\n\nScheetz said among the areas the funding will address include: increasing accessibility to quality foods, promoting areas for children to play and exercise, working within the school district to educate children in healthy eating as well as the harms of tobacco.\n\n\"We have to look at where we live, where supermarkets are located, where people are purchasing food at,\" she said. \"We often hear from people that they want to go out and purchase healthy food, but that there are no places to go (in close proximity).\"\n\nShe noted that the funding will yield more personnel that has not been available in the past due to a lack of resources.\n\n\"This funding will bring the manpower and boots on the ground we need,\" she said.\n\nLike members going to various corner stores and supermarkets and educating the store owners on easy and cost-effective ways to obtain healthy foods.\n\nFunded in part by the Affordable Care Act, 193 awards totaling nearly $212 million (first-year funding) will go to regions throughout the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) website.\n\nNew Jersey received two grants, totaling roughly $1.1 million with a focus on populations hardest hit by chronic diseases, according to a news release from HHS. The CDC will administer the grants.\n\n---\n\nSpencer Kent may be reached at skent@southjerseymedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @SpencerMKent.
