Business leaders\u2019 sales expectations for the first quarter came in at 61.2, down from 62 for the fourth quarter of 2013, while profits fell to 57.9, down from 59.3 for the fourth quarter.\n\nEconomist Richard Wobbekind, executive director of the Leeds School\u2019s Business Research Division, said the index has shown nine consecutive quarters of positive expectations.\n\n\u201cThe sustained confidence over the past several quarters now ties the record of optimism set from 2003 to 2005,\u201d said Wobbekind. \u201cStrong signals from the market are keeping confidence up, including the acceleration of GDP growth, employment gains and a federal budget compromise.\u201d\n\nConfidence in the national economy saw the greatest gain, 1.9 points, to 57.4.\n\nConfidence in the state economy increased to 64.8 from 63.9 last quarter. It outpaced confidence in the national economy, which has been a consistent 35-quarter trend noted in the business confidence index.\n\nWobbekind said that despite a slight slip in sales and profit expectations, the business leaders indicated increased expectations for investments in labor and capital.\n\nThe capital-expenditures index measured 59 for the first quarter, up from 57.4. The hiring-plans index increased to 59.3, up from 57.8.\n\nHoward Pankratz: 303-954-1939, hpankratz@denverpost.com or twitter.com/howardpankratz", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado business leaders confident heading into 2014", "title": "Colorado business leaders confident heading into 2014", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/02/colorado-business-leaders-confident-heading-into-2014/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-02T07:19:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-02T07:19:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It outpaced confidence in the national economy, which has been a consistent 35-quarter trend noted in the business confidence index.\nThe confidence of Colorado business leaders has increased slightly going into the first quarter of 2014 as economic conditions have improved and some political issues have subsided, according to the Leeds Business Confidence Index.\nWobbekind said that despite a slight slip in sales and profit expectations, the business leaders indicated increased expectations for investments in labor and capital.\nBusiness leaders\u2019 sales expectations for the first quarter came in at 61.2, down from 62 for the fourth quarter of 2013, while profits fell to 57.9, down from 59.3 for the fourth quarter.\nThe hiring-plans index increased to 59.3, up from 57.8."}
