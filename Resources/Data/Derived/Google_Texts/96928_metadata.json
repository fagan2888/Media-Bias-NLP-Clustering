John McCain Thursday over new comments he made about repealing Obamacare that were at odds with statements he made in September.\n\nBeck said more than once that he couldn\u2019t decide whether McCain is a \u201cdirtbag weasel\u201d or a \u201cweasel dirtbag.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his radio program, Beck said that when GOP Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee were fighting to repeal the legislation a number of weeks ago, McCain said such a goal was \u201cnot rational.\u201d Cruz, Lee, and anyone who supported their efforts were called everything from \u201canarchists\u201d to \u201cterrorists\u201d (though not necessarily by McCain).\n\nBut Beck said now that \u201cthe lousy senator from Arizona\u201d has seen how \u201cthe political winds have changed,\u201d he wants to jump on the bandwagon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to call him \u2018the good senator from Arizona,\u2019 but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a good senator from Arizona,\u201d Beck said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a lousy senator from Arizona.\u201d\n\nBeck played audio from McCain\u2019s interview with Greta Van Susteren on Fox News Wednesday, where the senator advocated reforms like allowing individuals to purchase insurance across state lines and medical malpractice reform, before launching into another tirade.\n\n\u201cJohn McCain, you\u2019re such a maverick,\u201d Beck said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \u201cHe\u2019s almost such a maverick he\u2019s old-timey. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s using someone else\u2019s recycled idea, you know? And it\u2019s almost like he had to destroy someone so he could retain his power! You know what I mean? And then take his idea and then just recycle it, repackage it, and then go on the sources that won\u2019t hold him accountable at all, because they are part of the problem. You know what I mean? It\u2019s almost that much of a maverick.\u201d\n\nWatch the segment below:\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
