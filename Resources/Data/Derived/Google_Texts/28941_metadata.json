Marco Rubio, R-Fla., outlined his views on the role of America in the world, why we need American power, and his position on what the U.S. military should look like in a speech today.\n\nHere is a brief recap of what Rubio said:\n\n1. \u201cForeign policy is domestic policy.\u201d \u201cNever before have our people and our economy been so connected and dependent to the world. What happens across the planet can have a greater impact on your family than what happens down the street.\u201d\n\n2. Rubio\u2019s Foreign Policy doctrine\n\n\u201cIn this globalized world, conflict breeds economic disruption.\u201d \u201cWe must boldly oppose efforts by other nations to infringe upon the freedom of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, and outer space.\u201d \u201cWe need to have moral clarity regarding what we stand for and why. This means reinforcing our alliances. It means resisting efforts by rising and resurgent powers to subjugate their neighbors. It means being unabashed in our support for the spread of economic and political freedom.\u201d \u201cWe need American Strength.\u201d \u201cThe world is at its safest when America is at its Strongest.\u201d\n\n3. America\u2019s enemies are getting bolder and threats are rising. The lists includes nuclear proliferation to countries like North Korea and soon Iran, growing Russian and Chinese militaries, and terrorist groups like ISIL. More problematic, \u201cour adversaries are emboldened by what they perceive as our diminished military presence.\u201d\n\n4. The military has been cut too much. The Defense Department has borne the brunt of spending reductions, even though Social Security and Medicare make up a greater portion of federal spending. As Rubio stated, \u201cadding insult to injury, the savings found in the defense budget were redirected to already bloated domestic programs.\u201d These cuts, 21 percent in four years, has resulted in \u201ca perilous strategic weakness.\u201d\n\n5. Increase the defense budget. The senator would like a return to the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gate\u2019s Fiscal Year 2012 budget as recommended by the bipartisan National Defense Panel. The increased budget would allow the military to invest in two \u201cvital objectives for national defense: modernization and innovation.\u201d\n\nIn short, Rubio\u2019s remarks laid out a solid conservative plan for foreign policy and defense, one that acknowledges both the countries\u2019 fiscal responsibilities as well as global realities. His plan is rooted in his belief that \u201cAmerica cannot avoid its role as a global leader.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
