Right in time for Broncos kickoff, snow began falling in Denver on Sunday night.

By kickoff at 6:30 p.m. for the Denver Broncos game against the New England Patriots, temperatures were in the low 20s with light flurries.

The National Weather Service is forecasting snow accumulation of between 1 and 3 inches by Monday morning.

Two to 6 inches of snow is expected to fall over the mountains into Monday morning, the weather service said.

The snow is likely to accumulate the most along and south of Interstate 70, forecasters said.

Freezing temperatures along with flurries should make for treacherous road conditions on Sunday night and possibly into the Monday morning commute.

Centennial, Lakewood and Aurora went on accident alert Sunday night as slippery roads gave way to an excess of accidents.

Temperatures in the metro area should climb above freezing Monday — after four days below — with a high forecast about 36 degrees.

A dry weather pattern is expected from Tuesday through Friday with a trend of warming temperatures throughout the rest of the week.
