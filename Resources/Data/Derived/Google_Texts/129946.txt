MOREHEAD CITY, Carteret County -

Blue Cross and Blue Shield continues to fix what's being called one of its most serious system failures in years.

Since Jan. 1, some 25,000 customers could not confirm whether they had health insurance. The owner and employees of Beachcare Urgent and Family Medical Center in Carteret County are also affected.

They reached out to NewsChannel 12's Anna Bulszewicz. As soon as she started making calls, Blue Cross started working to fix its problem. After Anna contacted BCBS, a representative reached out to Beachcare and vowed that they would be covered by the end of the day Tuesday.

A company spokesperson says the problem was caused by a recent technology upgrade and the Affordable Care Act's changing deadlines. They expect to fix everyone's issues by the end of the week.
