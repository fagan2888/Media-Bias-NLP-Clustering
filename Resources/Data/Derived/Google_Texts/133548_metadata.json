Ian Ziering of \u201c90210\u201d was in the movie \u201cSharknado.\u201d And Sapphire from the movie \u201cAlmost Famous\u201d is a \u201cBand Aid.\u201d\n\nThose are among the anonymous edits to Wikipedia that have originated from IP addresses in Congress during the August recess, when lawmakers take their annual hiatus from Washington and life around the Capitol quiets down.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChanges to Wikipedia from congressional IP addresses became a mini-controversy around this time last year, when more than 100 edits were made. Wikipedia administrators imposed a temporary ban on one House-linked IP address for consistently poor edits, ranging from tongue-in-cheek changes about conspiracy theories to controversial ones about a transgender actress.\n\nFewer edits have been made this August, with only seven traced to IP addresses linked to Congress as of Friday afternoon \u2014 far below the usual pace, according to a Twitter account that was set up to automatically tweet updates.\n\nThe topics of the edits have mostly been non-political, with changes made to entries on college basketball, greek life and fantasy novels.\n\nThe Cato Institute\u2019s Jim Harper, who sat on a panel last year that encouraged staffers to use Wikipedia properly, said he hasn\u2019t been following the issue closely this year. Still, \u201cthe fact that I haven\u2019t heard anything about it suggests the controversy has subsided,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWikipedia is a peculiar place with a peculiar culture, and the ban was a bad response to some misbehavior coming from the Hill,\u201d Harper said, adding that some conflict of interest rules have also discouraged broader use of Wikipedia within Congress.\n\nThe alterations to Wikipedia have been publicized by CongressEdits, a bot account on Twitter that was created by the programmer Ed Summers.\n\nCongressEdits has tweeted 816 times since July of 2014, automatically publicizing anywhere from 35 to 75 anonymous Wikipedia edits per month.\n\nThe Twitter account has more than 32,000 followers, including dozens of journalists in Washington. Some suspect the controversial edits last year were made so that they would attract attention on Twitter.\n\nEven so, Wikimedia DC applauded the bot last year, saying it added a level of transparency to the service. It noted that many of the edits that spawned the temporary ban last year are \u201cthe kind of juvenile or disruptive edits that Wikipedia deals with every minute of every day without incident.\"\n\nThere is a history of controversial congressional edits to Wikipedia, which is one of the most trafficked sites on the Internet. In 2006, the encyclopedia highlighted instances of staffers embellishing their members\u2019 profile and removing some negative content.\n\nThe foundation has tried to publicize best practices for congressional staff given their expertise in certain subjects. Those practices include registering individual accounts rather than posting anonymously, acknowledging conflicts of interest, and making suggested edits in the talk page rather than making the edits themselves.\n\nChanges to Wikipedia are usually tracked by a person\u2019s user name, but if none is given, the edits are cited to a specific address. Similar twitter bots have been set up for some other publicly known IP addresses from the Pentagon, CIA, NSA, NATO, and companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter and the Wikimedia Foundation itself.\n\nThe McConnell edit that came from Senate this month actually removed a prank edit that compared the Republican leader to a turtle \u2014 a comparison made popular by Jon Stewart and one that Wikipedia editors have had to strike before.\n\n\u201cMcConnell is the first openly Otherkin member of Congress. His species identity is turtle,\u201d someone in the House wrote in an edit last September before it was removed.\n\nThe most recent anonymous edit from Congress was made to the Big 12 Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament page, which corrected the win-loss record of one team. Another last week added more description to the plot of the 2000 Cameron Crowe hit movie \u201cAlmost Famous\u201d but was later removed because it added \u201cunneeded detail.\u201d\n\nSomeone in the House was also spotted editing the page about Robert Jordan\u2019s fantasy book \u201cThe Eye of the World.\u201d\n\nSome edits coming from Congress this month did relate to politics, including one about Mississippi government and another about Maine\u2019s 2nd congressional district.\n\nMichelle Newby, who worked on Wikipedia projects for the Cato Institute before moving to the Charles Koch Institute, said no one could pinpoint who exactly in the congressional office buildings is making the edits, especially given the availability of Wi-Fi.\n\n\u201c[CongressEdits] can\u2019t distinguish between edits made by representatives, senators, Hill staff, interns, constituents, middle school kids, or the janitors,\u201d she said. \"All of those people are interested in a huge number of things, so their edits could be on many subjects.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Some anonymous edits to Wikipedia have showed up during the August recess.", "description": "Some anonymous edits to Wikipedia have showed up during the August recess.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Some anonymous edits to Wikipedia have showed up during the August recess.", "title": "'Turtle' McConnell, 'Sharknado' among Wikipedia edits from Congress", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/251674-turtle-mcconnell-and-sharknado-among-wikipedia-edits-from-congress", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/sharknado_ianziering_080213getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/251674-turtle-mcconnell-and-sharknado-among-wikipedia-edits-from-congress", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-22T11:10-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Wikipedia, US Congressional staff edits to Wikipedia, World Wide Web,Mitch McConnell,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-22T11:10:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/251674-turtle-mcconnell-and-sharknado-among-wikipedia-edits-from-congress", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Some anonymous edits to Wikipedia have showed up during the August recess.", "card": "summary", "title": "'Turtle' McConnell, 'Sharknado' among Wikipedia edits from Congress"}, "dcterms.title": "'Turtle' McConnell, 'Sharknado' among Wikipedia edits from Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4fa6\"", "article_summary": "CongressEdits has tweeted 816 times since July of 2014, automatically publicizing anywhere from 35 to 75 anonymous Wikipedia edits per month.\nADVERTISEMENTChanges to Wikipedia from congressional IP addresses became a mini-controversy around this time last year, when more than 100 edits were made.\nThere is a history of controversial congressional edits to Wikipedia, which is one of the most trafficked sites on the Internet.\nIt noted that many of the edits that spawned the temporary ban last year are \u201cthe kind of juvenile or disruptive edits that Wikipedia deals with every minute of every day without incident.\"\n\"All of those people are interested in a huge number of things, so their edits could be on many subjects.\""}
