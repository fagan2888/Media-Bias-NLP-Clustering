A Democrat has won a special election for a vacant Southern California legislative seat, bolstering the party's supermajority in the state Assembly.

Sebastian Ridley-Thomas, an aide to Los Angeles City Councilman Curren Price Jr., defeated former Culver City mayor and city clerk Christopher Armenta, 60 percent to 36 percent on Tuesday.

Another Democrat in the race — real estate broker John Jake — captured 4 percent of the vote.

Ridley-Thomas, 26, is the son of former state legislator Mark Ridley-Thomas, now chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. He touts his experience as a former legislative aide and has endorsements from labor unions and prominent politicians, including Gov. Jerry Brown and former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.

"I hope that my relative youth will be an asset," Ridley-Thomas said, noting that changes in term limits laws would permit him to remain in office about 12 years. "That's a long time to move the needle on some serious questions that the people of California have struggled with."

He said he planned to work on education, jobs and mental health issues in his district and in the state legislature. He said he would look to ways to increase the number of medical professionals trained at UCLA and West Los Angeles College and the range of mental health clinics and caregivers as the Affordable Care Act rolls out in California.

He also said he wanted to find money to rehab old buildings in the Culver City Unified School District. He said he would be paying attention to the Inglewood Unified School District, now in state receivership, and to developments within the L.A. Unified School District.
