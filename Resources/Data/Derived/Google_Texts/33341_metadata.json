He and his family knew they wanted to move to the Austin area, but Liberty Hill\u2019s school system is what attracted him to town.\n\n\u201cWe looked to see what school was the best and there were several good schools, but Liberty Hill just drew us in,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThe office for our insurance is in Cedar Park so it\u2019s not too far way.\u201d\n\nHall, who joined USHealth Advisors in November 2014, often drives to his clients\u2019 place of business or home for what he describes as a more tailored and intimate client experience.\n\nUSHealth Advisors operates under the HOPE mission, which stands for \u201cHelping Other People Every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe strive on being able to customize programs that really benefit the individuals and keeping their insurance premiums down by increasing their benefits,\u201d he said.\n\nHall said his is the only insurance company that is Affordable Health Care Act-exempt. The exemption allows USHealth Advisors agents such as Hall to customize programs to fit needs of clients.\n\n\u201cWe build a policy to fit what the client is really looking for,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re actually able to customize it.\u201d\n\nUSHealth Advisors offers standard health insurance, life insurance, dental, vision, ancillary \u2014 an accident protector where the client pays out per accident; and MedGuard insurance \u2013 in case the client is diagnosed with something major and is meant to help keep them on their feet through recovery.\n\nThe USHealth office in Cedar Park has more than 30 employees. Company-wide there are about 1,200-1,300 employees across some 38 states.\n\nUSHealth Advisors was launched more than 50 years ago as part of Freedom Life, which is the underwriter for the company US Health Group.\n\n\u201cWe base on the American Independent Business Coalition and we offer insurance through AIBC so we provide group coverage at an individual rate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe CEO and the board are helping individuals and small businesses and providing better services that they need.\u201d\n\nIn his role as Field Training Agent, Hall has several agents that work underneath him. He provides insurance to individuals, trains employees and makes sure they are going out and serving clients.\n\nHall said he is passionate about helping others.\n\n\u201cThis is something that is an enjoyment to me,\u201d he said. \u201cTo know that I\u2019m able to go out and customize these policies for people to really see the benefits come out of them and how well clients are being treated and the respect they\u2019re receiving for that.\u201d\n\nHe shared a client experience from earlier this year. At the time, the couple had another insurance company, but USHealth Advisors was able to provide them a slightly less expensive coverage that also had built-in ancillary coverage.\n\nThat coverage came in handy later and not only stopped them from paying out-of-pocket expenses but actually put money back into their pockets.\n\nHall is a member of the Liberty Hill Chamber of Commerce and expects to become part of the organization\u2019s board of directors later this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the type of person that likes to get very active,\u201d he said. \u201cMy kids are involved at Liberty Hill High School with sports and academics. We like to give back to the community for what the community has already given to us.\u201d\n\nHe sees his Chamber membership as a great way to become part of the growing community.\n\nThough his office is open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Hall is usually able to meet clients after hours and weekends if needed at their office or home. The Cedar Park office is located at 715 Discovery Blvd., Ste. 304.\n\n\u201cWhatever is best for the client,\u201d he said. \u201cI can customize hours if I need to.\u201d\n\nHall serves clients throughout Texas and invites those interested to find out more by visiting USHealth Advisors online or reaching out to any of the area chambers.\n\nLearn more about Hall and the company by calling (512) 876-5072, or send email to ricky.hall@ushaadvisors.com or visit www.ushaagent.com/rickhall.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Liberty Hill Independent", "description": "By Christine Bola\u00f1os After working for shipping company DHL for 22 years, Rick Hall decided to move to Texas and try something different. \u201cI moved to Texas about four and a half years ago and I decided to retire from DHL and find something different to do,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI really wanted to get into \u2026", "title": "Hall puts his heart into insurance work - Liberty Hill Independent", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://lhindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Ricky-Hall-headshot-color-web-300x200.jpg", "url": "http://lhindependent.com/hall-puts-his-heart-into-insurance-work/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "USHealth Advisors health insurance", "published_time": "2015-09-21T19:37:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda5b6\"", "article_summary": "Hall said his is the only insurance company that is Affordable Health Care Act-exempt.\nThe exemption allows USHealth Advisors agents such as Hall to customize programs to fit needs of clients.\nAt the time, the couple had another insurance company, but USHealth Advisors was able to provide them a slightly less expensive coverage that also had built-in ancillary coverage.\nThe USHealth office in Cedar Park has more than 30 employees.\nLearn more about Hall and the company by calling (512) 876-5072, or send email to ricky.hall@ushaadvisors.com or visit www.ushaagent.com/rickhall."}
