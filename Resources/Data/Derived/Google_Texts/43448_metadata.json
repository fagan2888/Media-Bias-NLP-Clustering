The president, who convincingly won a second term in 2012, has faced some severe headwinds since his second inauguration nearly a year ago.\n\nWith that in mind, CNN has compiled a list of factors that have combined to afflict Mr. Obama with what\u2019s come to be known as the \u201csecond-term curse.\u201d CNN cited \u201cObamacare blues,\u201d \u201cHow low can you go?,\u201d \u201cSnowden leaks,\u201d \u201cIRS targeting,\u201d \u201cStalled agenda\u201d and \u201cReality versus perception.\u201d I believe the list is on target, but simply listing the variables doesn\u2019t tell the full story.\n\nMr. Obama hasn\u2019t been able to get much through Congress since his second term started. The president had trouble gaining support for gun-control and immigration-reform legislation. A resolution authorizing military action against Syria also didn\u2019t go anywhere. I would argue this is consistent with the historical pattern of re-elected presidents losing their clout in Term 2.\n\nMr. Obama also has been beset by scandal, namely the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s harassment of conservative groups that applied for tax-exempt status between 2010 and 2012, the administration\u2019s handling of the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, the Department of Justice\u2019s secret investigation into a national security leak and the National Security Agency\u2019s spying. This, like the president\u2019s stalled agenda, is consistent with history.\n\nControversial doings that were \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 kept under wraps during a president\u2019s first term often explode into public view in the second term. Just look at the administrations of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nThen there is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. The program was rolled out Oct. 1, but the website for signing up for it was plagued by dysfunction for weeks. Not long afterward, it became clear that despite the president\u2019s 2009 pledge to the contrary, Obamacare would cancel health-insurance plans Americans were happy with. In November, Mr. Obama even admitted the cancellations resulted from shoddy craftsmanship on the part of himself and his legislative allies.\n\nNot surprisingly, as a result of the aforementioned episodes, Americans began losing faith in the president, and he now is plagued by the lowest approval ratings of his tenure. In fact, as I noted in my Dec. 18 post, the only president with a lower approval rating in mid-December of his fifth year was the infamous Mr. Nixon.\n\nThat, I believe, is the sequence of events that led to Mr. Obama contracting second-termitis. We\u2019ll have to see how the president does next year, but history shows it is difficult for a president to bounce back from a rough Year 5.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb95\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019ll have to see how the president does next year, but history shows it is difficult for a president to bounce back from a rough Year 5.\nIn November, Mr. Obama even admitted the cancellations resulted from shoddy craftsmanship on the part of himself and his legislative allies.\nThat, I believe, is the sequence of events that led to Mr. Obama contracting second-termitis.\nMr. Obama hasn\u2019t been able to get much through Congress since his second term started.\nFew people would doubt that 2013 was a bad year for President Obama."}
