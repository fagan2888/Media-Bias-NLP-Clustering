Dr. Ben Carson said Wednesday that the Supreme Court's June ruling making same-sex marriage legal around the country is the worst decision by the high court in the past 20 years.

"Worst Supreme Court decision in the last 20 years?" Beck asked the 2016 hopeful.

"Probably, I would say the gay marriage decision," Carson responded. Beck also tried pressing Carson on who he would appoint to the Supreme Court, but he declined to offer up any specific names.
