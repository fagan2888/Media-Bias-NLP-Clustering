Discussions on the bank are \u201cstill ongoing,\u201d according to a House leadership aide.\n\nThe memo marks the first time McCarthy has laid out the GOP\u2019s agenda since he ascended to the Majority Leader slot at the end of July, and its content offers a bit more voice and personality than the documents sent out by his predecessor, Eric Cantor.\n\nFor instance, McCarthy rails against the Forest Service for a recent advisory warning citizens about the dangers of roasting marshmallows and suggesting using fruit instead of the classic chewey campfire treats.\n\n\u201cThis perfectly captures what is wrong with our government. Hard-earned tax dollars supporting bureaucrats who can\u2019t pass up an opportunity to tell us how to live our lives. For the things that government is supposed to do \u2013 like confront terrorist groups \u2013 we don\u2019t have a strategy, but for things Americans are supposed to be able to do for themselves \u2013 like figuring out the best ingredients for s\u2019mores \u2013 government bureaucrats have that figured out,\u201d McCarthy wrote.\n\nRegarding ISIS, McCarthy said House committees will be actively reviewing the increasing threat while lawmakers attend briefings from administration officials and outside experts.\n\n\u201cI believe that it is critical that we confront and defeat ISIL and like-minded terrorists who directly threaten America. I \u2013 and I know many of you \u2013 have personally called on the Administration to address this growing national security challenge. As we return, our national security committees will continue their aggressive oversight work \u2013 including hearings with senior Administration officials \u2013 on both the rise of ISIL and what is necessary to confront and defeat them. I anticipate that Administration officials will be up to brief all Members. In addition, a number of other briefings by outside experts are currently being planned. These hearings and briefings will be absolutely critical in helping us take the appropriate steps necessary to achieve our objective: the defeat of our terrorist enemies,\u201d the memo says.\n\nThe memo does not directly address legislation to authorize military action targeting ISIS.\n\nHouse Republicans are also planning to bring up a series of bills that will help them drive their message ahead of the November elections.\n\nOne bill will combine a series of \u201cjobs\u201d proposals like a bill that would require congressional approval for regulations costing the economy more than $100 million a year.\n\nA second bill will combine energy-related proposals like a measure to approve the Keystone pipeline.\n\nRepublicans will also be voicing disapproval of President Obama\u2019s prisoner swap of five Taliban soldiers for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl without notifying Congress.\n\nIn several cases, Republicans facing tougher than average reelection contests will be highlighted when their proposals are considered.\n\nFor example, Rep. Steve Southerland\u2019s (R-FL) \u201d Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act\u201d will come up as a stand-alone bill.\n\nRead the memo:\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTO: House Republicans\n\nFROM: Kevin McCarthy\n\nDATE: September 4, 2014\n\nSUBJECT: September Agenda\n\n\u201cHard work spotlights the character of people: some turn up their sleeves, some turn up their noses, and some don\u2019t turn up at all.\u201d -Sam Ewing\n\nI hope everyone had a productive August and that you enjoyed time at home with your families and constituents. After speaking with many of you throughout the month, what we\u2019ve heard from our constituents across the country has been consistent \u2013 American families simply can no longer afford the Obama economy. It is costing them too much in job losses, reduced wages, and higher healthcare, food, and energy prices.\n\nFor years, President Obama has tried to use Washington bureaucracy to fix America\u2019s problems. He has made plenty of promises \u2013 a functioning and inexpensive healthcare system, a successful economic stimulus, a new energy economy and increased respect abroad, to name a few. Yet each and every one of these promises has been broken.\n\nWe must continue to put forth an agenda that fuels the revival of the American Dream. And we must remain committed to unapologetically and boldly confronting the Obama Administration and Senate Democrats as they march toward government intrusion in every aspect of our lives.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you caught this, but last Friday the Forest Service published an article about how to roast marshmallows. Tips included using a roasting stick of at least 30 inches in length and substituting fruit for the chocolate and slices of angel food cake for graham crackers.\n\nThis perfectly captures what is wrong with our government. Hard-earned tax dollars supporting bureaucrats who can\u2019t pass up an opportunity to tell us how to live our lives. For the things that government is supposed to do \u2013 like confront terrorist groups \u2013 we don\u2019t have a strategy, but for things Americans are supposed to be able to do for themselves \u2013 like figuring out the best ingredients for s\u2019mores \u2013 government bureaucrats have that figured out.\n\nOur government today lacks common sense and competency. And the American people know it.\n\nOur conservative agenda is about restoring competency and common sense in government and giving Americans the freedom to live their lives, run their businesses, and raise their families. It\u2019s time to create a 21st Century government that isn\u2019t bogged down in unnecessary meddling and harmful regulating, but is instead honest, simple, and effective. With a limited number of legislative days before the election, we will have a busy September focused on our vision for prosperity and a government that is accountable to its people.\n\nDefeating our Terrorist Enemies\n\nBefore turning to the bills currently scheduled for floor consideration, I think it is important to touch on the topic I know each of us is focused on: the rise of ISIL, its terrorist activities \u2013 including the brutal murders of innocent Americans \u2013 and the establishment of new terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries in the Middle East. Terrorist threats to the United States and its allies have grown appreciably during the Obama Administration as the Al Qaeda network has metastasized. The Administration has been too passive as these terrorist organizations have been allowed to acquire new safe havens and grow in strength, whether in Libya where Ansar al-Sharia terrorists killed 4 Americans in Benghazi in 2012, in Iraq and Syria where ISIL has slowly and steadily built itself into a veritable terrorist army, or in Afghanistan where a resurgent Taliban is on the offensive.\n\nI believe that it is critical that we confront and defeat ISIL and like-minded terrorists who directly threaten America. I \u2013 and I know many of you \u2013 have personally called on the Administration to address this growing national security challenge. As we return, our national security committees will continue their aggressive oversight work \u2013 including hearings with senior Administration officials \u2013 on both the rise of ISIL and what is necessary to confront and defeat them. I anticipate that Administration officials will be up to brief all Members. In addition, a number of other briefings by outside experts are currently being planned. These hearings and briefings will be absolutely critical in helping us take the appropriate steps necessary to achieve our objective: the defeat of our terrorist enemies.\n\nAmerica cannot shirk from this grave and growing threat to our national security. We understand the terrorists\u2019 war on the United States and our allies is not over and that military action against terrorist groups like ISIL that pose a direct and growing threat to American interests is overdue. That said, the American people need to hear plainly from the President about the nature of the threat and his strategy to confront it.\n\nJobs and Economic Growth\n\nIn order to remind Harry Reid and Senate Democrats of our positive solutions to build a robust economy and foster job creation, the House will send a single jobs package to the Senate assembled from the jobs bills House Republicans have passed this Congress. This compilation bill will include:\n\n* H.R. 2575, the Save American Workers Act, authored by Representative Todd Young, which repeals Obamacare\u2019s 30-hour definition of full-time employment;\n\n* H.R. 899, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, authored by Representative Virginia Foxx, which equips Congress and the public with tools to determine the true costs of regulations;\n\n* H.R. 2804, the Achieving Less Excess in Regulation and Requiring Transparency (ALERRT) Act, authored by Representative George Holding, Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Representative Doug Collins, and Representative Spencer Bachus, which promotes jobs, better wages, and economic growth through regulatory reform;\n\n* H.R. 367, Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, authored by Representative Todd Young, which ensures that Congress votes on all new major rules before they can be enforced;\n\n* H.R. 1105, the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act, authored by Representative Robert Hurt, which prevents Dodd-Frank Act regulations from diverting capital from small- and medium-sized businesses;\n\n* H.R. 2274, the Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Brokerage Simplification Act, authored by Representative Bill Huizenga, which streamlines regulatory requirements to help facilitate capital formation to grow small- and medium-sized businesses;\n\n* H.R. 3474, the Hire More Heroes Act, authored by Representative Rodney Davis, which incentivizes businesses to hire veterans by excluding them from Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate threshold;\n\n* H.R. 1526, the Restoring Healthy Forests for Healthy Communities Act, authored by Chairman Doc Hastings, which will put Americans back to work by promoting responsible timber production;\n\n* H.R. 761, the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act, authored by Representative Mark Amodei, which allows the U.S. to develop resources that are critical to our economic competiveness;\n\n* H.R. 3086, the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, authored by Chairman Bob Goodlatte, which protects internet access for all Americans and fosters growth in the digital economy;\n\n* H.R. 4438, the American Research and Competitiveness Act, authored by Representative Kevin Brady, which makes the R&D Tax Credit permanent, paving the way for increased innovation and investment in the U.S.;\n\n* H.R. 4457, the America\u2019s Small Business Tax Relief Act, authored by Representative Pat Tiberi, which makes section 179 expensing permanent ensuring that our small businesses have the certainty they need to grow their businesses and create jobs;\n\n* H.R. 4453, the S Corporation Permanent Tax Relief Act, authored by Representative Dave Reichert, which provides the necessary flexibility for S corporations to access capital and make new investments; and\n\n* H.R. 4718, authored by Representative Pat Tiberi, making bonus depreciation permanent in order to lower the cost of capital for businesses.\n\nLowering Costs on Gas and Groceries\n\nWith gas prices still hovering near $3.50 per gallon and energy costs siphoning too much out of families\u2019 paychecks, we must enact policies that encourage an American energy revolution. That is why we will send to the Senate a single, common-sense energy plan comprised of House-passed bills focusing on production, infrastructure, reliability, and efficiency. This package will include:\n\n* H.R. 3, the Northern Route Approval Act, authored by Representative Lee Terry, which allows construction of the Keystone XL pipeline;\n\n* H.R. 1963, the Bureau of Reclamation Conduit Hydropower Development Equity and Jobs Act, authored by Representative Steve Daines, which streamlines the development of hydropower on federal lands;\n\n* H.R. 2640, the Central Oregon Jobs and Water Security Act, authored by Representative Greg Walden, which allows for construction of a hydropower facility at the Bowman Dam;\n\n* H.R. 2728, the Protecting States\u2019 Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act, authored by Representative Bill Flores, which protects American energy production by recognizing states\u2019 authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing;\n\n* H.R. 4801, authored by Representative Adam Kinzinger, which studies the impact and cost effectiveness of thermal insulation in federal buildings;\n\n* H.R. 3301, the North American Energy Infrastructure Act, authored by Chairman Fred Upton, which strengthens our partnerships with Canada and Mexico in order to build a more secure and efficient North American energy market;\n\n* H.R. 6, the Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act, authored by Representative Cory Gardner, which expedites the export of U.S. liquefied natural gas to our allies;\n\n* H.R. 1582, the Energy Consumers Relief Act, authored by Representative Bill Cassidy, which ensures Congressional oversight of energy-related rules costing more than $1 billion;\n\n* H.R. 1900, the Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act, authored by Representative Mike Pompeo, which modernizes the review process for natural gas pipeline permit applications;\n\n* H.R. 2641, the Responsible And Professionally Invigorating Development Act, authored by Representative Tom Marino, which establishes a more streamlined and transparent federal permitting process for construction projects;\n\n* H.R. 3826, the Electricity Security & Affordability Act, authored by Representative Ed Whitfield, which protects reliable and affordable electricity sources;\n\n* H.R. 2824, the Preventing Government Waste & Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America Act, authored by Representative Bill Johnson, which prevents the Administration from developing new, job-killing coal regulations; and\n\n* H.R. 4899, the Lowering Gas Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act, authored by Chairman Doc Hastings, Representative Doug Lamborn, Representative Scott Tipton, and Representative Bill Johnson, which removes federal government barriers that block production of U.S. energy sources offshore and expands onshore American energy production by streamlining government red-tape and regulations.\n\nThe House will also consider H.R. 5078, the Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act, authored by Representative Steve Southerland, which protects the long-standing federal-state partnership in the regulation of our waters. The Obama Administration\u2019s federal power grab \u2013 attempting to literally define puddles as navigable waterways so they can regulate them \u2013 will have broad, negative impacts on a wide range of U.S. industries, most notably agriculture. Placing additional burdens on our hard-working farmers will result in higher food prices for American families and I commend the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee for its commitment to addressing this important issue.\n\nHealthcare\n\nWhile the President has failed to live up to his \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it\u201d promise, House Republicans remain committed to protecting Americans from the crushing costs of Obamacare. An estimated 11 million small business employees could find themselves negatively impacted by the increasing premium costs associated with this law. That is why House Republicans will pass H.R. 3522, the Employee Health Care Protection Act, authored by Representative Bill Cassidy, which ensures that these workers can, in fact, keep the plan they have and like.\n\nAccountability\n\nThanks to the great work of Chairman Darrell Issa and the Oversight & Government Reform Committee and Chairman Dave Camp and the Ways & Means Committee, House Republicans have not only been unwavering in our pursuit of the truth behind the IRS targeting, but have put forth solutions to prevent federal agencies and their employees from breaching the trust of the American people.\n\nTo follow on to the great work we have already done on this issue, the House will consider a series of bills from the Ways & Means Committee that will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to disclose information about the investigations regarding leaked taxpayer information to victims; prohibit any IRS officer or employee from using a personal email account to conduct official business; and codify the taxpayer right to appeal the IRS\u2019s determination of a group\u2019s application for tax-exempt status. We will also consider H.R. 5169, the Senior Executive Service Accountability Act, authored by Representative Tim Walberg, which makes Senior Executive Service employees subject to the same employment standards as other civil service personnel, and H.R. 5170, the Federal Records Accountability Act, authored by Representative Mark Meadows, that establishes a process for removing a federal employee for the falsification, theft, or destruction of a federal record.\n\nYou may have also seen the recent GAO Report confirming that the Administration violated the law in its release of five Taliban terrorists from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The law is clear, and therefore the House will consider H. Res. 644, authored by Representative Scott Rigell, which condemns the failure to comply with the statutory requirement to provide advance notice to Congress.\n\nFinally, the House will also pass a Continuing Resolution that will continue government operations as they are on September 30th into the new fiscal year.\n\nI look forward to seeing you all next week as we work to build a brighter future for our country.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s see who will be the first to correctly identify the room in which the British started the fire that destroyed most of the Capitol on August 24, 1814.\n\n###", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kevin McCarthy Outlines GOP Fall Agenda", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Kevin McCarthy Outlines GOP Fall Agenda", "title": "Kevin McCarthy Outlines GOP Fall Agenda - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Congress/House-Republicans/kevin-mccarthy-pointing-finger-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/09/04/kevin-mccarthy-outlines-september-agenda/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kevin McCarthy Outlines GOP Fall Agenda", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Congress/House-Republicans/kevin-mccarthy-pointing-finger-ap.jpg", "title": "Kevin McCarthy Outlines GOP Fall Agenda - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Congress, ISIS, Senate,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senate", "published_time": "2014-09-04T11:20:48-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "3, the Northern Route Approval Act, authored by Representative Lee Terry, which allows construction of the Keystone XL pipeline;* H.R.\n2575, the Save American Workers Act, authored by Representative Todd Young, which repeals Obamacare\u2019s 30-hour definition of full-time employment;* H.R.\n3826, the Electricity Security & Affordability Act, authored by Representative Ed Whitfield, which protects reliable and affordable electricity sources;* H.R.\n3522, the Employee Health Care Protection Act, authored by Representative Bill Cassidy, which ensures that these workers can, in fact, keep the plan they have and like.\n1582, the Energy Consumers Relief Act, authored by Representative Bill Cassidy, which ensures Congressional oversight of energy-related rules costing more than $1 billion;* H.R."}
