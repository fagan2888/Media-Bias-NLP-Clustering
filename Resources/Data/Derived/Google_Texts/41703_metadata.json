Which doesn\u2019t stop him from trying to spin it into an apocalyptic headline \u2026 somehow.\n\nI ran a free clinic in a janitor\u2019s lunch room. Obamacare came along, and my patients were, for the first time, able to get insurance, to take care of their health care needs.\n\nOh, the humanity. And the health care!\n\nKlepper also spoke with some former patients of the janitor\u2019s lunch room clinic, who are now \u201cliving the nightmare that is Obamacare.\u201d Except they like it too. For some totally bizarre reason, they like going to see their doctors in an actual doctor-type environment instead of a place where people go to eat sandwiches on their lunch breaks.\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Klepper concludes, they\u2019re \u201cbiased by their personal positive experiences.\u201d\n\nWatch and enjoy.\n\n[The Daily Show]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Daily Show's Jordan Klepper investigates the Obamacare Apocalypse and what went wrong with everything that's supposedly going wrong but somehow isn't.
