However, restaurant owners around the nation are beginning to experience the impact of yet another government mandate that is greatly increasing their costs of doing business.\n\nFor Scott Womack, an Indiana franchise restaurant owner with over 25 years in the industry, the ACA mandate\u2013coupled with the likely prospect of a minimum wage increase\u2013meant it no longer made financial sense for him to stay in the casual dining business. The Daily Signal reports that he sold his 16 IHOP locations around the Hoosier state before the January 1, 2015 Obamacare employer mandate took effect.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nWomack testified before Congress in 2011, after the passage of the ACA, about the impact it would have on his business. At the time, he had 12 IHOP restaurants with about 1000 employees. He had also signed a development agreement, prior to the law\u2019s passage, to add 14 new locations in Ohio.\n\nHe testified at the time his plans were now in jeopardy due to the new costs of doing business associated with Obamacare. He explained that profit margins for him range between five and seven percent. He added:\n\nThe law [the ACA] is one-size-fits-all for employers, and restaurants don\u2019t fit. Though some restaurant companies offer coverage now, the cost is prohibitive for many employees, and many of their plans will not qualify in 2014. The only viable alternative is to pay the $2,000 per employee penalty, which is not tax deductible. A quick study of public restaurant companies shows that many did not earn enough in 2010 to pay the penalties and likely will not survive in the future. For my company, these penalties amount to 60% of our earnings, and again, our company is very profitable by industry standards\u2026 Advertisement \u2013 story continues below Let me state this bluntly: this law will cost my company more money than we make.\n\nWomack told The Daily Signal: \u201cYou have to fund your development through your profits\u2026and if you have no profits, you\u2019re not building restaurants.\u201d\n\nHe sold his restaurants last year, not going forward with plans to build several new locations, which meant hundreds of lost jobs for those who would have worked in his restaurants and those who would have built and serviced them.\n\nOwners of multiple franchise locations, like Womack, can often particularly feel the law\u2019s impact. Despite each restaurant really being a stand-alone enterprise in terms of profitability, they are grouped together in terms of the number of full-time employees with regards to Obamacare. The ACA\u2019s employer mandate kicks in at the 50 or more full-time employee threshold.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nInternational Franchise Association\u2019s spokesman Matthew Haller explained its impact: \u201cRather than helping existing and aspiring franchise owners expand by adding jobs, locations and more hours for their employees who need them most, the law\u2019s arbitrary definition of \u2018large employer\u2019 and \u2018full-time work week\u2019 have contributed to the steady increase in part-time employment in America and have been a drag on new franchise business formation.\u201d\n\nWomack decided to stay in the restaurant business by purchasing Popeyes restaurant franchises in the Kansas City area. He employees 180 now, rather than over 1000. Quick service dining, rather than casual dining like IHOP, makes more sense in the new business climate created by Obamacare. He wants to continue to grow his quick service locations, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a tightrope walk that you do, balancing between the risks in the industry vs. the reward of growing your business.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Owners like Scott Womack, can often particularly feel the law\u2019s impact.", "author": "Randy DeSoto", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Owners like Scott Womack, can often particularly feel the law\u2019s impact.", "title": "Obamacare Completely Changed This Business-Owner's Life In A Pretty Unbelievable Manner", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 750, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/scottwomack.jpg", "height": 366}, "updated_time": "2015-03-24T09:19:59-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/ihop-restaurant-owner-sells-16-locations-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Owners like Scott Womack, can often particularly feel the law\u2019s impact.", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/scottwomack.jpg", "title": "IHOP Restaurant Owner Sells His 16 Locations Because Of Obamacare", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-23T16:31:06-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Expose Obama", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2015-03-23T16:31:06-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-24T09:19:59-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ihop, scott womack, international house of pancakes, , obamacare, politics, nation, religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd344\"", "article_summary": "The Daily Signal reports that he sold his 16 IHOP locations around the Hoosier state before the January 1, 2015 Obamacare employer mandate took effect.\nWestern Journalism reported earlier this month on the negative impact increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour is having on the Seattle restaurant industry.\nQuick service dining, rather than casual dining like IHOP, makes more sense in the new business climate created by Obamacare.\nOwners of multiple franchise locations, like Womack, can often particularly feel the law\u2019s impact.\nAdvertisement - story continues belowFaced with significant increases in labor costs due to the Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), a midwest restaurant owner decided to sell his 16 International House of Pancake locations."}
