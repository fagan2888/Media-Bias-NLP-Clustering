His production, for one. He set all the college career rushing yardage and touchdown records at Wisconsin. He also wants to keep his college number: 28.\n\nAfter practice Tuesday, Ball switched from No. 38 to the No. 28 he wore for the Badgers.\n\nBut there are other parts of college Ball is glad to leave behind.\n\nIn particular, all those pad-popping practices. A college coach can have his team practice two, three, four times a week in full pads if he wants. And that\u2019s during the season.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the weird thing about the difference, in college, you\u2019re banging heads 24-7,\u201d said Ball, a Broncos rookie who figures to get his carries in the season opener Thursday night against Baltimore. \u201cHere, I feel fresh. The way Coach Fox has us practicing, without pads, he does a good job of keeping us fresh.\u201d\n\nBroncos coach John Fox doesn\u2019t have much choice. The league\u2019s collective bargaining agreement limits him to 11 padded practices through the first 11 weeks, and only three in the final six weeks.\n\nFewer pads means more time in the film room.\n\n\u201cAs a rookie, all I can say is from what I\u2019ve seen on film, the Ravens\u2019 defense plays fast,\u201d Ball said. \u201cEspecially 55 and 58. Those are some players that play fast.\u201d\n\nBall is focusing on the correct players. No. 55 is Terrell Suggs, and No. 58 is Elvis Dumervil, the Ravens\u2019 top two edge pass rushers, whom Ball must pick up as Peyton Manning\u2019s blitz protector.\n\nMcCray\u2019s fate. It\u2019s likely that had Lerentee McCray not suffered such a severe right ankle sprain in the second half of the Broncos\u2019 fourth preseason game, the undrafted rookie would have made the team as the sixth linebacker.\n\nInstead, the doctor said his high ankle sprain would take six to eight weeks to recover, so the Broncos put him on season-ending injured reserve. The day after setting their 53-man roster, the Broncos waived fullback Jacob Hester to add that sixth linebacker, Adrian Robinson.\n\nMcCray was playing extremely well in the preseason, including the first half of Game 4 against Arizona.\n\n\u201cDisappointing, but hey, it\u2019s part of the business,\u201d McCray said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bronco Montee Ball switches numbers to 28, which he wore at Wisconsin", "title": "Bronco Montee Ball switches numbers to 28, which he wore at Wisconsin", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/03/bronco-montee-ball-switches-numbers-to-28-which-he-wore-at-wisconsin/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20130817_082914_montee-ball.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20130817_082914_montee-ball.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-04T00:05:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T21:25:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4046\"", "article_summary": "But there are other parts of college Ball is glad to leave behind.\nThere are some parts Montee Ball wants to keep from his college days.\nA college coach can have his team practice two, three, four times a week in full pads if he wants.\n\u201cAs a rookie, all I can say is from what I\u2019ve seen on film, the Ravens\u2019 defense plays fast,\u201d Ball said.\nThe day after setting their 53-man roster, the Broncos waived fullback Jacob Hester to add that sixth linebacker, Adrian Robinson."}
