Thirty-nine percent said they would oppose a plan that meant either of those steps. Support thinned further as the pollsters brought up the other potential pitfalls of single-payer systems.\n\nWhen asked their view of \u201csingle-payer\u201d health care\u2014what such a system is often called\u2014the respondents seemed to like it. \u201cA slim plurality of 39 percent supports replacing the private health insurance system with a single government-run, taxpayer-funded plan that would cover medical, dental, vision and long-term care, with 33 percent opposed,\u201d the AP\u2019s Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar and Emily Swanson write. Just 26 percent, meanwhile, support the existing Obamacare law.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation poll, also from Thursday, found that people feel similarly thrown by the phrase \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Thirty-six percent of respondents viewed that \u201cvery positively,\u201d but only 15 percent felt that way about \u201csingle payer.\u201d\n\nMedicare for All or Single Payer?\n\nKaiser Family Foundation\n\nOne of the people the AP quoted, a Chicago office manager named Elizabeth Medina, encapsulated the cognitive dissonance that single-payer health care provokes:\n\n\u201cOverall it sounds terrific,\u201d she said. \u201cYeah! Let's go for it! But Europe and Canada have their problems with the single-payer system ... it\u2019s subpar.\u201d\n\nThere are two common points of confusion about single payer. The first is about the definition of \u201csingle,\u201d which, as you might know, is \u201cone.\u201d And the \u201cone\u201d in this case almost always means \u201cthe government.\u201d It means everyone gives up their Platinum Elite Status Cigna Extra Miles plan that they get at a steep discount from their work. Instead, they go on the same plan everyone else has. This is a key element of Sanders\u2019s proposal, as described on his site: \u201cUnder Bernie\u2019s plan, Americans will benefit from the freedom and security that comes with finally separating health insurance from employment.\u201d\n\nThe thing is, half of Americans get their insurance through work, and they don't all hate it. A government plan might not be any worse, but it will require a leap into the unknown.\n\nThe AP says that higher taxes are also a \u201cgiven\u201d under single-payer, and that\u2019s probably true, but it\u2019s hard to tell how much people will spend on taxes versus how much they spend now on insurance premiums and surprise ER bills. And it\u2019s worth noting that the AP didn\u2019t bring up any of the positives typically associated with single-payer, like the potential for significant administrative cost savings.\n\nThe other point of confusion is that \u201cEurope\u201d has single-payer health care, and America should be more like Europe. European countries\u2019 medical systems are all pretty different. Some of them, like the U.K., have single-payer health care. Germany has a system much like ours, except the insurers aren\u2019t for-profit companies and it\u2019s cheaper for the patients. Other countries have mixed public-private systems that guarantee a basic level of health care but allow the rich to buy supplemental private insurance.\n\nIt sounds like Sanders\u2019s idea could resemble any one of these. In his description, he says, \u201call you need to do is go to the doctor and show your insurance card.\u201d If everyone were covered by the same plan, it\u2019s not clear why you\u2019d need an insurance card. If there is a card, it\u2019s not clear whether it would be issued by a German-style sickness fund or function more like an NHS medical card.\n\nIt\u2019s true, however, that Europe has its own problems, some of them related to single-payer health-care systems. America\u2019s existing medical system is no picnic either. But when they\u2019re shown the downsides of single-payer, Americans seem to prefer the devil they know.", "article_metadata": {"description": "And when they find out, they don\u2019t like it.", "author": "Olga Khazan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "And when they find out, they don\u2019t like it.", "title": "People Have No Idea What 'Single Payer' Means", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/02/AP_830132681540/facebook.jpg?1456432021", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/people-have-no-idea-what-single-payer-means/471045/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/olgakhazan"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The other point of confusion is that \u201cEurope\u201d has single-payer health care, and America should be more like Europe.\nKaiser Family FoundationOne of the people the AP quoted, a Chicago office manager named Elizabeth Medina, encapsulated the cognitive dissonance that single-payer health care provokes:\u201cOverall it sounds terrific,\u201d she said.\nSome of them, like the U.K., have single-payer health care.\nWhen asked their view of \u201csingle-payer\u201d health care\u2014what such a system is often called\u2014the respondents seemed to like it.\nOther countries have mixed public-private systems that guarantee a basic level of health care but allow the rich to buy supplemental private insurance."}
