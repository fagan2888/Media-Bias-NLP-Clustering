Now more than ever we need a cornerstone of our democracy to do its job and get the answers to what the devil is going on in the White House.\u201d\n\nObama announced Bergdahl\u2019s release the day after VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned. And The Hill noted that Obama\u2019s POW exchange pushed Shinseki\u2019s resignation from the headlines,\u201d as the \u201cSunday shows were packed with administration officials defending the decision and Republicans launching into political attacks against\u201d Obama.\n\nPalin also challenged the media to get to the bottom of the \u201cvery concerning\u201d POW exchange.\n\n\u201cYou prove yourselves idiots if you take for an answer that there\u2019s nothing amiss on this one either, \u2018not even a smidgen,'\u201d she said.\n\nPalin also declared that Obama \u201cblew it\u201d and destroyed troop morale while blasting Bergdahl\u2019s father\u2019s anti-American sentiments. She linked to a Breitbart News report and asked Americans to learn more about the five dangerous terrorists Obama released and the American soldier he freed.\n\n\u201cAs for the released soldier, let\u2019s hope he can enjoy his freedom back home. It would be wonderful for him to make it back to Idaho in time for Father\u2019s Day,\u201d Palin noted. \u201cPerhaps around a traditional all-American barbeque for pops, he can convince his dad there\u2019s no need to continue his anti-American rants that tear the fabric of the flag to which his son pledged allegiance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sarah Palin: Obama Timed Bowe Bergdahl Release to Distract from VA Scandal", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Sarah Palin: Obama Timed Bowe Bergdahl Release to Distract from VA Scandal", "title": "Sarah Palin: Obama Timed Bowe Bergdahl Release to Distract from VA Scandal - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Palin/Sarah%20Palin%20AP%20jpg.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/06/03/sarah-palin-obama-timed-bergdahl-release-to-distract-from-va-scandal/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sarah Palin: Obama Timed Bowe Bergdahl Release to Distract from VA Scandal", "title": "Sarah Palin: Obama Timed Bowe Bergdahl Release to Distract from VA Scandal - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Palin/Sarah%20Palin%20AP%20jpg.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Sarah Palin, White House,National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "National Security", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-06-03T08:20:00-07:00", "categories": "National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc34\"", "article_summary": "It would be wonderful for him to make it back to Idaho in time for Father\u2019s Day,\u201d Palin noted.\n\u201cAs for the released soldier, let\u2019s hope he can enjoy his freedom back home.\n\u201cThe timing of this is to distract from the VA scandals and other Obama Error disasters.\nShe linked to a Breitbart News report and asked Americans to learn more about the five dangerous terrorists Obama released and the American soldier he freed.\nPalin also declared that Obama \u201cblew it\u201d and destroyed troop morale while blasting Bergdahl\u2019s father\u2019s anti-American sentiments."}
