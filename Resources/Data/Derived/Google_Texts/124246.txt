The Senate's top Republican will make a new effort this weekend to win passage of legislation to repeal the health care reform law.

In a rare Sunday session, the Senate will take up an amendment — offered by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to a big highway funding bill — to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Repealing the ACA, Sen. McConnell said Friday on the Senate floor is “something nearly every Republican wants, and something we will continue to fight for.”

“I urge every senator to take this important opportunity to join me in voting to finally give the American people the fresh start they deserve on health care,” Sen. McConnell added.

Observers say it is unlikely that Republicans will be able to garner the 60 votes they would need to stop a certain Democratic filibuster on the McConnell amendment.

The House of Representatives on several occasions during the last few years has voted to repeal the health care law, but the Senate didn't act on the repeal measures.

The broader highway funding bill to which Sen. McConnell wants to attach the ACA repeal amendment, also includes a provision that would stretch out by four years until the end of 2025 a federal law that allows employers to remove surplus assets from overfunded pension plans to pay for retiree health care benefits.
