It may be that his buffoonery and megalomania are simply more attractive to some early voters than rival candidates, with their solemn professions that what pushes them into the grind of campaigning is their dedication to promoting the public welfare.\n\nBut I am considerably more than annoyed when Trump puts himself at the head of the armies of the new nativism by using his bullhorn to echo the warnings of the movement\u2019s Cassandras against the supposed \u201chordes\u201d of undocumented immigrants pouring through our \u201copen southern border.\u201d His point of attack is the so-called \u201canchor babies\u201d \u2014 children of pregnant mothers who supposedly sneak into the United States so that their children will be born here and automatically become citizens.\n\nOur works of history rightly celebrate our role as a land of asylum and opportunity for people from almost everywhere on the globe\u2026 But they often overlook or minimize the contrasting truth that there was always stiff resistance to that hospitality.\n\nThe hidden, malodorous and unproven subtext is that these children, entitled to the privileges of citizenship, will open the gates to legalizing the entry of family members, swarms of whom will qualify for welfare state entitlement programs, so that they may live in happy idleness at the expense of \u00a8real\u201d American taxpayers. None of these suppositions has yet been proven by any serious evidence.\n\nSo thus far, disgusting enough. But when Trump dipped into the gutter to add to this repertory of lies and half truths one of the oldest and rankest \u2014 namely that Mexico was emptying its prisons and asylums to let rapists and thieves run free on our streets (a charge eagerly snapped up by the likes of O\u2019Reilly and Limbaugh, and left unchallenged by many of Trump\u2019s rivals for the nomination) \u2013 I boiled over. That\u2019s crossing the line that separates debate from shameless indecency.\n\nI am a historian of the United States and have heard it all before, sometimes almost verbatim and no less gross. Our works of history rightly celebrate our role as a land of asylum and opportunity for people from almost everywhere on the globe. It\u2019s a pillar of our cherished self-image as exceptional among nations. But they often overlook or minimize the contrasting truth that there was always stiff resistance to that hospitality.\n\nListen to this: \u201cAmerica has become the sewer into which the pollutions of European jails are emptied.\u201d Substitute \u201cMexican\u201d or \u201cLatin American\u201d for \u201cEuropean\u201d and it could be straight out of Trump\u2019s latest eruption. But it\u2019s from a newspaper published in the 1850s by supporters of an anti-Catholic and foreigner-hating movement that began as a secret society whose members were ordered, when asked nosy questions, to say: \u201cI know nothing.\u201d Eventually, the \u201cKnow-Nothings\u201d emerged into the open and organized themselves into a political organization that campaigned in 1854 as \u201cthe American Party.\u201d\n\nIn that first off-year foray, the new entry won a number of state and local offices and some seats in both House and Senate. The basic glue that held Know-Nothing-ism together was hatred of the alien (especially the Irish). The slither of the Know Nothings into the American Party was a way of \u201cprotecting\u201d America from the Pope\u2019s minions and other evil foreign influences. Happily, 1854 was only a flash in the pan. When the party ran a national ticket headed by so respectable a figure as ex-US President Millard Fillmore, they won only a single state, Maryland.\n\nTo be American was not about ancestry but to commit oneself heart and soul to the ideal of equality.\n\nA few years later, Lincoln was dead along with some 600,000 casualties of the Civil War, and a radical Republican Congress oversaw writing the Union\u2019s victory into the Constitution via the Fourteenth Amendment. Its opening clause proclaimed, \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d That flipped the prewar position, in which state citizenship was necessary to become a United States citizen, leaving room for states to refuse citizenship to \u201cundesirables\u201d like Negroes and foreigners. Now, no state could deny its born or naturalized resident citizens \u201cthe equal protection of its laws\u201d or the guarantees of the Bill of Rights.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment clearly intended to make sure that the newly freed ex-slaves would have their full civil rights, though it would take a Fifteenth to specify that voting was included. The inclusion of children born in the United States to recent immigrants was almost incidental. That is the \u201cerror\u201d that the enemies of birthright citizenship aim to correct. They argue that almost no other nations outside the Western hemisphere show such foolish generosity. Somehow, this is one issue on which they are willing to forget or forgo our proud exceptionalism.\n\nMeanwhile, American ports began receiving the first waves of an enormous and transformative mass migration \u2014 some 31 million between 1860 and 1930. They represented a \u201cnew\u201d immigration: Chinese, Italians, Greeks, Poles, Russians, Syrians, Slovaks, Serbs, Armenians. To many so-called \u201cold stock\u201d Americans, millions of these newcomers were dangerous and unworthy, and to the members of an Immigration Restriction League \u2013 which included in its number many of \u201cthe best people\u201d of New England \u2013 the immigrants were of the \u201cwrong\u201d religions and nationalities. Poet Thomas Bailey Aldrich explained that through our \u201cunguarded gates\u201d pressed,", "article_metadata": {"description": "His behavior transcends partisan politics.
