The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, created by the Affordable Care Act, was designed to make hospitals pay closer attention to what happens to their patients after they get discharged.\n\nSince the fines began, national readmission rates have dropped, but roughly one of every five Medicare patients sent to the hospital ends up returning within a month.\n\nSome hospitals view the punishments as unfair because they can lose money even if they had fewer readmissions than they did in previous years. All but 209 of the hospitals penalized in this round were also punished last year, a Kaiser Health News analysis of the records found.\n\n[READ: Find the Best Medicare Plan for You]\n\nThe fines are based on readmissions between July 2011 and June 2014 and include Medicare patients who were originally hospitalized for one of five conditions: heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia, chronic lung problems or elective hip or knee replacements. For each hospital, Medicare determined what it thought the appropriate number of readmissions should be based on the mix of patients and how the hospital industry performed overall. If the number of readmissions was above that projection, Medicare fined the hospital.\n\nThe fines will be applied to Medicare payments when the federal fiscal year begins in October. In this round, the average Medicare payment reduction is 0.61 percent per patient stay, but 38 hospitals will receive the maximum cut of 3 percent, the KHN analysis shows. A total of 506 hospitals, including those facing the maximum penalty, will lose 1 percent of their Medicare payments or more.\n\nOverall, Medicare's punishments are slightly less severe than they were last year, both in the amount of the average fine and the number of hospitals penalized. Still, they will be assessed on hospitals in every state except Maryland, which is exempt from these penalties because it has a special payment arrangement with Medicare.\n\n[READ: Data Show Obamacare Is Working]\n\nThese lower payments will affect three-quarters of hospitals or more in Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and the District of Columbia. KHN found that fewer than a quarter of hospitals face punishments in Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nMost of the 2,232 hospitals spared penalties this year were excused not because Medicare found readmissions to be sufficiently infrequent, but because they were automatically exempted from being evaluated \u2013 either because they specialized in certain types of patients, such as veterans or children, because they were specially designated \"critical access\" hospitals, or because they had too few cases for Medicare to accurately assess.\n\nThe readmission penalties are not the only fines hospitals face this year. As it did last year, Medicare is also giving out bonuses and penalties based on a variety of quality measures. The government has not yet announced those, but they also begin in October. Those financial incentives will total about $1.5 billion. Medicare will also punish hospitals with high rates of infections and other avoidable occurrences of patient harm.\n\nThe KHN analysis found that four hospitals have received the maximum readmission penalty every year. Two are in Kentucky: Harlan ARH Hospital, which is in the heart of the Appalachian coalfields, and Monroe County Medical Center in Tompkinsville. The other hospitals are the Livingston, Tennessee, Regional Hospital \u2013 also in Appalachia \u2013 and Franklin Medical Center in Winnsboro, Louisiana None of the hospitals immediately returned phone calls Monday.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Heart disease is the leading cause of death for African American and white women in the U.S.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Overall, Medicare's punishments are slightly less severe than last year's; 2,592 hospitals are impacted.", "zone": "hospitalsoftomorrow/articles", "author": "Kaiser Health News", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Overall, Medicare's punishments are slightly less severe than last year's; 2,592 hospitals are impacted.", "title": "Half of U.S. Hospitals Face Medicare's Readmission Penalties", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/hospital-of-tomorrow/articles/2015/08/05/half-of-nations-hospitals-fail-again-to-escape-medicares-readmission-penalties", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/69/13/d51091bb4bd98337736708b51563/141008-ambulance-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Overall, Medicare's punishments are slightly less severe than last year's; 2,592 hospitals are impacted.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Half of Nation's Hospitals Fail Again to Escape Medicare's Readmission Penalties - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2015-08-05", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/29a19ad/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F69%2F13%2Fd51091bb4bd98337736708b51563%2Fresizes%2F500%2F141008-ambulance-editorial.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "Hospital of Tomorrow,hospitals,health care,Medicare,health insurance,LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],Kaiser Health News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-08-05"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Zc0u6b", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "Hospital of Tomorrow, hospitals, Medicare, readmission, penalties"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05fa\"", "article_summary": "The readmission penalties are not the only fines hospitals face this year.\nA total of 506 hospitals, including those facing the maximum penalty, will lose 1 percent of their Medicare payments or more.\nHospitals that readmit patients within a month of their discharge face penalties under Medicare that cost them more than $400 million.\nIn the fourth year of federal readmission penalties, 2,592 hospitals will receive lower payments for every Medicare patient that stays in the hospital \u2013 readmitted or not \u2013 starting in October.\nThe fines will be applied to Medicare payments when the federal fiscal year begins in October."}
