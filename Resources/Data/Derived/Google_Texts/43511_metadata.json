The company recently lined up new funding for its genetic testing firm. (Photo: Leigh Taylor, Cincinnati Enquirer)\n\nMASON, Ohio \u2014 Assurex Health is proving Midwestern states far from Silicon Valley can produce cutting-edge technology companies.\n\nThe Mason, Ohio-based start-up is at the forefront of personalized medicine and is helping patients with depression, ADHD or chronic pain get on the right medication so they can live active, fulfilling lives. In the process, Assurex Health is reducing the significant economic and emotional costs incurred through trial-and-error treatment.\n\nThe company is a gem in Greater Cincinnati's start-up scene that's making an international impact with technology spun out of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in 2006.\n\nAssurex Health is one of 10 finalists in USA TODAY's Entrepreneur of the Year contest. Profiles of the other contenders will run in the coming weeks, and a winner will be selected in December.\n\nEvery day, Assurex Health extracts and analyzes the DNA from hundreds of patient cheek swabs. Within 36 hours, the company sends a report through a secure portal to doctors, detailing which medications are most likely to be effective for individual patients, based on that patient's genes.\n\nThe company, led by former Procter & Gamble executive Virginia C. Drosos, is in the midst of a massive growth spurt. In the last 12 months, Assurex Health has more than doubled its employee count to 220, tested its 100,000th patient in June, and announced several strategic partnerships.\n\nGina Drosos, president of Assurex Health.

Drosos called the decision \"a milestone in helping improve the care of millions of older Americans and others with depression.\"\n\n- Assurex Health also closed a $32 million round of funding this year, and overall has raised $60 million of equity and debt.\n\nNot bad for a company that employed just 15 people four years ago and was based in an old garage and karate studio. Assurex Health survived multiple near-death experiences in its early years thanks to Cincinnati's investment community \u2014 including funders CincyTech, Queen City Angels and Allos Ventures \u2014 which leaned in with capital and their access to talent.\n\nKey early hires included Chairman James Jim S. Burns, an experienced executive who came out of retirement in 2009 to serve as CEO, and Donald R. Wright, a technology executive who is Assurex Health's chief operating officer.\n\nAlong the way, Assurex Health executives said they learned key lessons that have since paid off for the company. The start-up pushed to hire the best talent it could find, and not simply settle for employees it could comfortably afford. Burns and Wright also instilled a company culture in which executives did whatever it took to overcome obstacles. Wright, for example, handled everything from overseeing the development of laboratory tests and software to answering customer service calls\n\n2011 was a pivotal year as California firms Claremont Creek Ventures and Sequoia Capital \u2014 an early funder of Apple and Google \u2014 announced an $11 million investment in Assurex Health.\n\nEqually important, the firms allowed Assurex Health to keep growing in Greater Cincinnati instead of moving the company to California. Drosos, who previously ran P&G's $6 billion beauty-care business and regularly appeared on Fortune's Most Powerful Women list, joined Assurex Health as president in 2013 and was named CEO this year.\n\nShe's acutely aware of the company's leadership position among Cincinnati's start-ups, and has said Assurex Health wants to be \"the tip of the spear\" that brings more attention to the region's young companies and helps them grow.\n\nIndeed, Assurex Health is a leading start-up candidate in Cincinnati to eventually become a public company or be acquired by a large corporation, creating the kind of wealth among its investors that will help turbocharge the region's fast-growing entrepreneurial ecosystem\n\nDrosos' primary focus, of course, is continuing to scale Assurex Health, which hopes to help 1 million people within the next five years.\n\n\"We are at an inflection point as powerful as any I've ever felt in any business on the brink of growing dramatically,\" she says. \"We have a lot of talent, and a lot of passion in this company. Those two things will continue to take us a long way.\"\n\nPichler also reports for The Cincinnati Enquirer.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1wW10F4", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Most startups define big wins as landing a key customer, strategic partner or round of funding.
