Followers of this fad believe that shampoo does more damage than good for your hair, and boast that their locks actually fare better without it. In a YouTube video, the team at Reactions investigated the no-poo method, and found major flaws associated with the growing trend.\n\nA quick Google search says shampoo is to blame for everything from stripping hair of oils to causing scalp irritation. But how accurate are these accounts?\n\nProponents of the \u201cno-poo\u201d fad claim the hair is self-cleaning, and after a few weeks of greasy, smelly hair, your scalp will cease to produce sebum \u2014 the oil that coats your hair and skin. Reactions reported this was a myth and that, in reality, the scalp continues to produce sebum no matter what the hair\u2019s condition is.\n\nIt\u2019s not only sebum that continues to get trapped in your locks; hair also picks up pollen, dirt, pollution, and other random stuff from the air. What\u2019s more, washing with just water also comes with its own set of consequences. According to Reactions, water helps to stretch the cuticles of the hair, and may cause them to dry out and feel rough. This can leave locks dull and fragile.\n\nInstead of going completely sans shampoo, Reactions suggests using just conditioner \u2014 which has many of the same ingredients as shampoo only in lower quantities \u2014 or dry starches or clays. Whatever you do, make sure not to try an obscure product on your hair, such as vinegar, which, due to its acidity, is actually far more damaging than shampoo could ever be.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hair, secrets, does, no, poo, method, leave, you, luscious, locks, or, dirty, hair", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Science weighs in on whether skipping shampoo is actually good for your hair health.", "title": "Is Skipping Shampoo Really All That Good?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hair-secrets-does-no-poo-method-leave-you-luscious-locks-or-dirty-hair-378235", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/03/17/hair-secrets-does-no-poo-method-leave-you-luscious-locks-or-dirty-hair.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Science weighs in on whether skipping shampoo is actually good for your hair health.", "title": "Is Skipping Shampoo Really All That Good?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hair-secrets-does-no-poo-method-leave-you-luscious-locks-or-dirty-hair-378235", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/03/17/hair-secrets-does-no-poo-method-leave-you-luscious-locks-or-dirty-hair.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/17/hair-secrets-does-no-poo-method-leave-you-luscious-locks-or-dirty-hair.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2016-03-17T09:26:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-17T09:26:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Science weighs in on whether skipping shampoo is actually good for your hair health."}, "article_summary": "You may have heard about the recent no-shampoo craze, often referred to as the \u201cno-poo\u201d method.\nIn a YouTube video, the team at Reactions investigated the no-poo method, and found major flaws associated with the growing trend.\nAccording to Reactions, water helps to stretch the cuticles of the hair, and may cause them to dry out and feel rough.\nIt\u2019s not only sebum that continues to get trapped in your locks; hair also picks up pollen, dirt, pollution, and other random stuff from the air.\nInstead of going completely sans shampoo, Reactions suggests using just conditioner \u2014 which has many of the same ingredients as shampoo only in lower quantities \u2014 or dry starches or clays."}
