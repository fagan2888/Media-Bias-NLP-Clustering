Mr. Wheeler last week released an outline of strict new federal oversight of the Internet, a plan known to advocates as so-called \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d but won\u2019t reveal the text of the plan until the FCC\u2019s meeting on Feb. 26.\n\n\u201cThe American people are being misled about President Obama\u2019s plan to regulate the Internet,\u201d Mr. Pai said. \u201cLast week\u2019s carefully managed rollout was designed to downplay the plans of a massive intrusion in the Internet economy. I have now read the 332-page plan. It is worse than I had imagined.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe claim that President Obama\u2019s plan to regulate the Internet does not include rate regulation is flat-out false.\u201d\n\nMr. Wheeler said the plan will declare broadband a \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d under Title II of the Communications Act, giving the FCC broad new regulatory powers. It\u2019s a more intrusive proposal than Mr. Wheeler originally outlined last year, and it more closely follows guidelines endorsed by Mr. Obama last November.\n\nThat development has led two congressional committees to launch investigations into whether the president exerted his influence over the FCC, which is ostensibly an independent agency.\n\nOn Monday, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, asked Mr. Wheeler in a letter to turn over any documents related to communications and meetings involving the White House and agency officials.\n\nMr. Johnson told the FCC chair that he was concerned there was \u201capparent pressure exerted on you and your agency by the White House.\u201d The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee also is investigating the issue.\n\nMr. Pai, one of two Republicans on the five-member commission, said the president\u2019s plan would give the FCC broad new powers and \u201cexplicitly opens the door to billions of dollars in new taxes on broadband.\u201d He also said the proposal could result in consumers losing services they currently enjoy.\n\nBy invoking Title II, Mr. Pai said, the FCC is giving itself the authority to determine whether prices are \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe claim that President Obama\u2019s plan to regulate the Internet does not include rate regulation is flat-out false,\u201d Pai said. \u201cIndeed, the only limit on the FCC\u2019s discretion to regulate rates is its own determination of whether rates are \u2018just and reasonable,\u2019 which isn\u2019t much of a restriction at all.\u201d\n\nOther FCC officials said the proposal is similar to the agency\u2019s rules governing cell-phone providers, and said the agency hasn\u2019t tried to regulate prices in that industry. Mr. Wheeler has said the proposal will not impose any new taxes.\n\nBorrowing an infamous complaint about Obamacare, Mr. Pai told reporters, \u201cIf you like your current service plan, you should be able to keep your current service plan. The FCC shouldn\u2019t take it away from you.\u201d\n\nProtesters interrupted Mr. Pai\u2019s news conference, accusing him of representing big corporate providers such as Comcast. Activists say the Wheeler plan is the only way the FCC can enact meaningful net-neutrality protections against providers blocking or slowing down online traffic.\n\nMr. Pai said FCC rules prohibit him from releasing the plan to the public, saying only the chairman can authorize its disclosure.\n\nThe president nominates FCC commissioners, but the agency is independent and not intended to answer to the White House. Mr. Obama nominated Mr. Wheeler to head the FCC in 2013, after he served as a campaign fundraiser for the president and worked as a lobbyist for the cable-TV and wireless industries.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission Tuesday blasted President Obama's plan to regulate the Internet, saying it will lead to \"utility-style regulation,\" new taxes and less consumer choice.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission Tuesday blasted President Obama\u2019s plan to regulate the Internet, saying it will lead to \u201cutility-style regulation,\u201d new taxes and less consumer choice.", "title": "FCC commissioner blasts Obama\u2019s \u2018net neutrality\u2019 plan", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/10/fcc-commissioner-blasts-obamas-net-neutrality-plan/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/12/ap163548959452.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/12/ap163548959452.jpg", "description": "A Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission Tuesday blasted President Obama's plan to regulate the Internet, saying it will lead to \"utility-style regulation,\" new taxes and less cons", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "FCC commissioner blasts Obama\u2019s \u2018net neutrality\u2019 pla"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Politics, Federal Communications Commission, Arjit Pai, Tom Wheeler"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb43\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe American people are being misled about President Obama\u2019s plan to regulate the Internet,\u201d Mr. Pai said.\nMr. Pai said FCC rules prohibit him from releasing the plan to the public, saying only the chairman can authorize its disclosure.\nActivists say the Wheeler plan is the only way the FCC can enact meaningful net-neutrality protections against providers blocking or slowing down online traffic.\nBorrowing an infamous complaint about Obamacare, Mr. Pai told reporters, \u201cIf you like your current service plan, you should be able to keep your current service plan.\nMr. Wheeler last week released an outline of strict new federal oversight of the Internet, a plan known to advocates as so-called \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d but won\u2019t reveal the text of the plan until the FCC\u2019s meeting on Feb. 26."}
