Chris Christie (R-N.J.), New York Yankees player Alex Rodriguez and pop star Justin Bieber during the hysterical cold open.\n\nIn the spoof of CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan Live, SNL first criticized Morgan\u2019s lack of journalistic integrity.\n\n\u201cMy name is Piers Morgan, and what I lack in journalistic integrity \u2014 \u201d actor Taran Killam said, leaving the sentence unfinished while moving on to the next topic.\n\nThe faux Morgan went on to discuss the well-known figures accused of misleading the American public. The first of these was Christie and the Bridgegate debacle. The Governor, played by Bobby Moynihan, apologized for the whole incident \u2014 but then got slightly heated over the continued media attention.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over, so shut up!\u201d he said in a very New Jersey tone.\n\nSNL implied Christie\u2019s actual involvement in bridge closure by the defensive stance Moynihan took. The fake Christie implied that he was too busy balancing budgets, yelling at teachers \u2014 aka being a bully \u2014 and working out \u201cfive times a year\u201d to have participated in the bridge closure.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t keep track of every freakin\u2019 idiot I\u2019m trying to screw over!\u201d Moynihan exclaimed.\n\nWhen faux Morgan pressed Christie on allegations that he had withheld Hurricane Sandy funding, fake Christie then began threatening Morgan\u2019s commute to work.\n\nTaking aim at A-Rod, played by the show\u2019s host and musical guest, Drake, SNL\u2019s Morgan confronted the slugger on the allegations of his steroid use \u2014 allegations that led the actual Rodriguez to file lawsuits against Major League Baseball. But fake A-Rod took it a step further, suing the players\u2019 union for not tricking the MLB well enough, the steroids for being in his body and Jackie Robinson for breaking the professional baseball color barrier and allowing people of color to even play the sport, which led to the situation in the first place.\n\nFaux Morgan then asked Rodriguez about the evidence against him, including hundreds of text messages. Fake A-Rod blamed them on autocorrect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s messed up, man,\u201d he told the CNN host. \u201cSo that\u2019s why I\u2019m suing my iPhone, as well as the dictionary.\u201d\n\nClosing the sketch was Kate McKinnon\u2019s spot-on impression of Justin Bieber, which will surely be one of the must-watch clips from SNL in 2014.\n\nMcKinnon mocked Bieber\u2019s snide arrogance and cocky misdemeanor in his handling of the egging allegations as of late. All the while, the actress nailed Bieber\u2019s personal mannerisms, head-dips, look-aways and the other goofy bro poses he does when he gets in front of a camera.\n\nWatch the cold open here:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "This week, Saturday Night Live tackled the biggest controversies during its month-long holiday hiatus, taking shots at Gov.
