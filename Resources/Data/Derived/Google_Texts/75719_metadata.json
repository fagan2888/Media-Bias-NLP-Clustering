Enrollment via Avenue H is year-round.\n\nKiser said 900 plans were submitted to the Insurance Department for 2015, more than double the number for 2014.\n\nBut much of the growth simply reflects that the department is no longer allowing health plans to offer dental riders. Instead, insurance companies will offer plans with and without dental or pediatric dental coverage. The various permutations mean more plans to choose from.\n\nSix companies will offer 108 plans to individual Utahns on the federal exchange, up from 96 this year. Such plans also have to be available off the exchange. Six companies, three of them new, are offering 148 plans exclusively off the exchange.\n\nSmall-business employees will have a plethora of options: 75 plans from three companies on Avenue H and 576 plans from seven companies off the exchange.\n\nRep. Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville, said that increased number of plans will make it even harder for consumers shopping on the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov.\n\n\"You're going to have to scroll through a lot more pages,\" he said.\n\nkmoulton@sltrib.com\n\nTwitter: @KristenMoulton", "article_metadata": {"description": "Utahns shopping for health insurance on the federal exchange can expect prices that are 5.7 percent higher, on average, next year.
