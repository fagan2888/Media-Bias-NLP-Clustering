Open enrollment begins Oct. 15.\n\nFor seniors in Erie County, the change in monthly premiums between 2014 and 2015 for plans with drug coverage ranges from a $3 decline for one Today\u2019s Options plan to an increase of $67 for a BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York offering, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\n\u201cOur senior members are experiencing an upheaval in what they are used to. Premiums, the way they\u2019ve been in the past, are unsustainable. BlueCross BlueShield decided to get ahead of that inevitability and accept those realities this year,\u201d Julie Snyder, the insurer\u2019s director of corporate relations, said in a statement.\n\nMedicare Advantage plans are a type of Medicare health plan offered by insurers that contract with the federal government to provide hospital and medical coverage to those who are eligible.\n\nThe plans often offer additional benefits such as gym memberships and vision coverage, though the benefits provided can change from year to year within the same plan.\n\nNational enrollment in Medicare Advantage has nearly tripled over the last decade, rising from 5.6 million in 2005 to 15.7 million this year, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported.\n\nThe plans are exceptionally popular in this region, with 54 percent of seniors here enrolling in Medicare Advantage plans compared to 30 percent of seniors nationwide.\n\nAs part of the Affordable Care Act, however, the federal government has begun reducing how much it pays private insurers through the Medicare Advantage program, bringing the payments in line with those for traditional Medicare.\n\nThough the Obama administration this spring abandoned its proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage for 2015, several insurers cited earlier cuts to the program as the reason they were discontinuing or raising the price of their managed Medicare plans.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s continued pressure on the reimbursements from CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services),\u201d said Nora K. McGuire, senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Independent Health.\n\nMVP Health Care of Schenectady, for example, said last month it was dropping Medicare Advantage plans that serve 2,100 seniors in Western New York, and 19,800 seniors statewide, and raising the monthly premiums on its remaining plans by an average of 45 percent for 2015.\n\nThe plan information posted Wednesday by CMS, the federal Medicare agency, shows that seniors in Erie County can choose from 32 Medicare Advantage plans for 2015, down from the 36 plans available in 2014.\n\nThe estimated annual cost to enrollees for the 22 plans that include drug coverage \u2013 including premiums, co-pays and other charges, and assuming an average level of spending on prescription medication \u2013 is an average of $4,761 for 2015, up $295, or 6.6 percent, from the average cost of the same plans in 2014, The News found.\n\nSeniors who enter accurate information about their own use of medical services and prescription drugs can get a better estimate of their costs.\n\nThe changes from this year to 2015 vary dramatically, however, with estimated annual costs decreasing by as much as 7.2 percent for Independent Health\u2019s Network Advantage plan and increasing by 21 percent for BlueCross BlueShield\u2019s Senior Blue HMO 651 Part D plan.\n\nThe plan prices remain low compared to traditional Medicare, which is estimated to cost $6,590 next year.\n\nThe information posted by the federal Medicare agency applies to seniors who directly enroll in Medicare Advantage, but does not cover the many seniors who enroll in group Medicare Advantage coverage through an employer.\n\nAmherst-based Independent Health has the highest Medicare Advantage enrollment in the region, with 74,725 total members in 2014, and the insurer largely avoided dramatic changes to its plans for 2015. Independent Health also is the only local insurer offering a $0-premium plan for 2015.\n\nEnrollment in its managed Medicare plans has soared since 2009, when 56,254 members signed up for Medicare Advantage.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most important to us is to maintain consistency and stability in our plans. So we try to do that while offering people the choice,\u201d McGuire said.\n\nBlueCross BlueShield is dropping one plan with drug coverage, adding another, and raising the rates of its other three plans with drug coverage. The insurer has about 48,000 Medicare Advantage members, including those enrolled through an employer.\n\n\u201cThe current Medicare Advantage premiums that our loyal BlueCross BlueShield members are hearing about this week are best explained in the overall context of a dramatically changing national health care marketplace, driven by the federal Affordable Care Act, stringent government regulations and new taxes,\u201d Snyder said.\n\nUnivera Healthcare dropped one of its Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage, leaving three for 2015 enrollment. The average estimated annual cost is rising by 10 percent or more next year for each plan, according to CMS. Univera\u2019s direct-pay Medicare Advantage enrollment is 18,600.\n\n\u201cLuckily, we\u2019re not in that position where we\u2019ve had to make radical changes. We\u2019ve done the best we can to keep the premium as low as possible,\u201d said Heather Smith, director of Medicare sales for Univera Healthcare and its parent, Excellus BlueCross BlueShield of Rochester.\n\nThe insurers will aggressively market their plans to seniors over the next few months, setting up phone banks and in-person information sessions to take questions from prospective members.\n\nEnrollment for 2015 begins in two weeks and closes Dec. 7.\n\nemail: swatson@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Area senior citizens who use Medicare Advantage will have fewer choices, and can expect to pay more, when they select a plan for 2015, according to information revealed Wednesday by the federal agency that oversees Medicare.Several insurers have discontinued plans \u2013 and raised rates...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "Area senior citizens who use Medicare Advantage will have fewer choices, and can expect to pay more, when they select a plan for 2015, according to information revealed Wednesday by the federal agency that oversees Medicare.Several insurers have discontinued plans \u2013 and raised rates... - The Buffalo News", "title": "Area seniors will pay more for 2015 Medicare Advantage plans  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/business/area-seniors-will-pay-more-for-2015-medicare-advantage-plans-20141001", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/storyimage/BN/20141001/CITYANDREGION/141009886/AR/0/AR-141009886.jpg&exactW=1000&exactH=1000&AlignV=middle&Q=80", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8de6\"", "article_summary": "The information posted by the federal Medicare agency applies to seniors who directly enroll in Medicare Advantage, but does not cover the many seniors who enroll in group Medicare Advantage coverage through an employer.\nThe plans are exceptionally popular in this region, with 54 percent of seniors here enrolling in Medicare Advantage plans compared to 30 percent of seniors nationwide.\nEnrollment in its managed Medicare plans has soared since 2009, when 56,254 members signed up for Medicare Advantage.\nThe plan information posted Wednesday by CMS, the federal Medicare agency, shows that seniors in Erie County can choose from 32 Medicare Advantage plans for 2015, down from the 36 plans available in 2014.\nUnivera Healthcare dropped one of its Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage, leaving three for 2015 enrollment."}
