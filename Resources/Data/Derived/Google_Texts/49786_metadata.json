In recent weeks, California lawmakers have rushed to approve several pieces of legislation that make the state a standout leader in women\u2019s health issues. Here are five reasons you may want to consider moving there:\n\n1. California wants to expand the pool of abortion providers. At the end of last month, the California legislature bucked the national trend and voted to actually expand abortion access instead of limiting it. Under this measure, which is awaiting Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s (D) signature, a wider pool of medical professionals will be legally permitted to perform abortions. Allowing nurse practitioners and trained physicians assistants to provide this care will help address the fact that over half of the counties in the state don\u2019t have an abortion provider. Advocates say it\u2019s an important method of ensuring that women will be able to have early abortions, and won\u2019t be forced to delay the procedure until they can travel to get to the nearest doctor.\n\n2. California is working to protect abortion clinics. In addition to allowing a greater number of medical professionals to provide abortion care, California is also working to protect reproductive access in another way. Instead of launching politicized attacks against abortion clinics \u2014 a widespread strategy that is forcing dozens of clinics across the country to close \u2014 the state is advancing a measure that would make sure clinics aren\u2019t held to unnecessary standards. \u201cThis bill will repeal unequal and burdensome building requirements on clinics that provide abortions,\u201d the legislation\u2019s sponsor explained. It\u2019s been approved by the Senate, and awaits a final vote in the California Assembly.\n\n3. California may ensure young adults won\u2019t worry about anyone finding out they got STD tested or had an abortion. This week, California lawmakers approved the Confidential Health Information Act \u2014 a measure that will make sure residents don\u2019t have to disclose any \u201csensitive\u201d health services they\u2019ve received through their insurance. This is important because, when people are under a spouse\u2019s or a parent\u2019s insurance policy, they typically run the risk of that person seeing an itemized list of every type of health service they used the insurance for. Now that Obamacare allows young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until the age of 26, that poses a problem for many young people who aren\u2019t comfortable telling their parents about the sexual health care they\u2019ve received. Many women end up paying for abortions with their own money out of pocket because they\u2019re too worried about this dynamic. If Brown signs this bill, that won\u2019t be an issue in the Golden State anymore.\n\n4. California is taking steps to prevent victim-blaming and cyber-bullying. California is considering a bill that would outlaw \u201crevenge porn\u201d \u2014 that is, sexual photos of an individual that are posted online by their angry ex without their consent. Revenge porn is a growing problem and, when it comes to nonconsensual sex, spreading around graphic photos of rape victims has led some of them to commit suicide. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely just a new form of victim-blaming,\u201d the founder of the group \u201cEnd Revenge Porn\u201d explains. New Jersey is the only other state in the country that currently criminalizes this type of online behavior, so California\u2019s bill \u2014 which was recently approved by the Senate \u2014 could help pave the way for similar legislation in other places.\n\n5. California just expanded the definition of rape to ensure victims will have justice. On Monday, California finally closed a loophole in a century-old law that didn\u2019t include non-married people in a certain legal definition of rape. Under the old statute, if a woman\u2019s rapist impersonated her boyfriend and forced himself on her while she was unconscious, he couldn\u2019t technically be convicted of rape \u2014 even though he could be if his victim was married and he pretended to be her husband. It\u2019s an arcane law that had been on the books since 1872, and the update was long overdue. Still, though, it\u2019s important for states to work on updating their definitions for sexual assault to encompass all victims\u2019 experiences. Too often, outdated policies impact the way that rape victims are treated for decades.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Five pieces of legislation that might inspire you to move to the Golden State.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Five pieces of legislation that might inspire you to move to the Golden State.", "title": "How California Has Recently Transformed Itself Into One Of The Best States For Women", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/09/12/2610751/california-state-women/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/California.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Five pieces of legislation that might inspire you to move to the Golden State.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/California-321x214.jpg", "title": "How California Has Recently Transformed Itself Into One Of The Best States For Women", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/California.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/California.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-12T11:50:42+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Too often, outdated policies impact the way that rape victims are treated for decades.\nCalifornia is working to protect abortion clinics.\nRevenge porn is a growing problem and, when it comes to nonconsensual sex, spreading around graphic photos of rape victims has led some of them to commit suicide.\nIf you\u2019re a woman \u2014 or if you\u2019re simply an individual who supports reproductive rights and sexual health \u2014 the Golden State may be the place for you.\nStill, though, it\u2019s important for states to work on updating their definitions for sexual assault to encompass all victims\u2019 experiences."}
