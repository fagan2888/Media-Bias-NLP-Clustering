Greg Abbott dealt a final blow Saturday to his own pledges to tighten Texas\u2019 loose ethics rules, vetoing two reform bills poisoned by a last-minute rider that would have given lawmakers cover to hide their spouses\u2019 financial dealings.\n\nThe vetoes, which were among 42 bills rejected by the new governor, capped Abbott\u2019s inability in his first year to strengthen ethics laws as promised shortly after taking office in January. He even named it one of five legislative priorities, alongside upgrades to border security and Texas pre-K.\n\nAbbott delivered on his other so-called emergency items, but when it came to state lawmakers putting new rules on themselves, they fought for months over allowing more transparency about their personal wealth and curbing conflicts of interests.\n\nAlthough the vetoed bills would have tightened some disclosure rules, even ethics watchdosg considered what became known as the \u201cspousal loophole\u201d amendment far too toxic.\n\n\u201cProvisions in this bill would reduce Texans\u2019 trust in their elected officials, and I will not be a part of weakening our ethics laws,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. \u201cSerious ethics reform must be addressed next session - the right way. Texans deserve better.\u201d\n\nThe amendment would have shielded lawmakers from disclosing how their spouses make money. It was stuck into the bill by Republican state Sen. Joan Huffman, a former judge, whose husband has myriad business interests.\n\nAnother comprehensive ethics bills sank earlier this session over whether to politically active nonprofit should have to disclose their donors, in what is known as dark money.\n\nAlthough critics have long denounced Texas\u2019 ethics laws as soft, Abbott was forced to confront issues of transparency and oversight early when a $110 billion no-bid state contracting scandal erupted shortly after he was elected in November.\n\nAbbott has now cleared his desk of thousands of bills to sign into law or reject. He also vetoed softer penalties for prostitution and another that would have given state employees more flexibility to work from home. It\u2019s the most bills vetoed since former Gov. Rick Perry rejected 56 bills in 2007, but far short of the 83 bills Perry spiked during his first year on the job, which helped set his defiant tone.\n\nAbbott said he also eliminated $300 million from the Texas budget in line-item vetoes, though that amounts to only a mere fraction of a $209 billion two-year budget.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican Gov.
