For a decade, community members have gathered in Panama City to celebrate the local businesses that helped the area thrive.

Saturday was the 10th annual Glenwood BBQ Cook-Off and Red Velvet Cake Bake-Off at the A.D. Harris Learning Village; but it wasn't just about the cook-offs.

The A.D Harris art gallery had its soft opening, retail and craft vendors showed off their work, and there was even a chance to go horseback riding

"These are the kinds of activities that the community really enjoys because they continue to come," said Toni Shamplain, the Manager of the A.D. Harris Learning Village. "We have one vendor here from Bainbridge, Georgia, and one of our competition teams is from Bristol, so we are reaching more than Bay County."

The new A.D. Harris art gallery is open during normal office hours Monday-Friday.
