If Democrats introduce an amendment to strike the provision from the broader reconciliation bill, the Maine moderate said Tuesday she would support it.

"Reconciliation is subject to many, many amendments. There is usually a vote-a-rama where we vote on dozens of amendments, and so I am going to wait to see what the process looks like, but I am very concerned about the bill."

Collins' hesitance to support the GOP's big messaging package highlights one of Republican leaders' obstacles as they move on a budget reconciliation bill this week. Under the process, GOP leaders are hoping to defund parts of Obamacare as well as stop federal funding from going to Planned Parenthood. They only need 51 votes to pass the bill, but they only have 54 Republicans. That means they cannot afford to lose many moderates like Collins. Leaders have already had to make changes to the bill that make it more conservative to quell concerns coming from conservative presidential candidates including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.

Collins has not been clear on exactly where she would be on a final vote if the Planned Parenthood defund provision remains part of the bill, but she has been vocal about the fact she believe Planned Parenthood provides many important health care functions for women around the country.
