Andrew Wilson, 17, of Norman was charged as a youthful offender, with two counts of first-degree robbery.

The teenager who pulled off three successful bank robberies earlier this year, surrendered to authorities in Cleveland County on Tuesday.

Andrew Wilson, 17, of Norman was charged as a youthful offender, with two counts of first-degree robbery.

Wilson admitted he dressed as an elderly man and passed handwritten notes demanding cash to the tellers at the Midfirst Bank and IBC Bank in Moore. He also owned up to have robbery of an IBC Bank in Oklahoma City. Now, the big question is, why did he do it?

"You try to look for what brought a good kid, an honor student type kid into this position," Gary James, Wilson's attorney said he has several theories. "He's had some family tragedies in his life, including the death of his mother. There's a lot of things."

The attorney also pointed out Wilson is now willing to cooperate with authorities by giving them his confession and his disguise. Wilson also returned $6824.00. James said there is not any evidence to show Wilson purchased luxury items with the other half of the money. Instead, James said his client spent the money on "typical kid stuff" such as gas, food, music, and video games.

Several popular video games are apparently designed for players to carry out bank robberies, but there is not any evidence, at this point in the case, to show what video games Wilson actually purchased.

James said he will be researching any and all possible motives as part of his defense. He said Wilson is just a kid who made a mistake and should not have his whole life destroyed because of it.

â€œHe made mistakes and he will pay for those mistakes."

Cleveland County District Attorney Greg Mashburn said the robberies put everyone involved in dangerous situation. As for the case in Oklahoma County, District Attorney David Prater said he anticipates filing charges soon.

In the meantime, Wilson is out of jail on a $15,000 bond.
