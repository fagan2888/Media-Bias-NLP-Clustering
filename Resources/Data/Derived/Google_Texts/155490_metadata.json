She says that these journalists are letting their position of privilege cloud their reporting \u2014 and they\u2019re missing the point of what Obamacare means for millions of Americans who actually need the program.\n\nIf I see one more journalist symbolically log on to the Obamacare website, I\u2019m going to scream. If you\u2019re making faux calls into the call center, only to complain about the lack of hold music, as if that is what\u2019s critically important here, you\u2019re severely missing the point.\n\nAnd even when you defend your negative reporting about the Obamacare website glitches, as The Washington Post\u2018s Ezra Klein did last night on MSNBC, having the privilege of analyzing the process from the perspective of someone who is already insured and not in need of coverage allows the core impact of the new program on the health and security of millions of Americans to be missed \u2026\n\nObamacare is more than a website. More than half of the people I worked with on the Obama campaign in 2008 said health care reform was their reason for joining the campaign and working to elect a Democrat.

When I scrolled through my list of choices\u2013124 different plans to be exact\u2013I realized that this is the reason Republicans hate the program so much: it will fundamentally change lives, including my own.\n\nThere are a few glaring omissions in the coverage of Obamacare\u2019s shaky rollout. For the most part, those covering the problems are insured themselves and consequently greatly underestimate the patience of a chronically uninsured person who has been counting down the days until Obamacare began so they could have a little piece of mind that if they got sick they wouldn\u2019t be staring down bankruptcy.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/zerlina20maxwellmsnbchealthcare.gov20coverage102513575lh.jpg?w=50", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theRoot", "site_name": "The Root", "description": "Journalists who have insurance but log on to healthcare.gov, make false calls into the call center and report negative stories about their experience are missing the point of what the Affordable Care Act means for the millions of Americans without health coverage, Zerlina Maxwell writes at Feministing.", "title": "Obamacare Website Glitches: Privilege Is Clouding Reporting", "url": "http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2013/10/obamacare_website_glitches_journalists_privilege_is_clouding_their_reporting", "image": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/zerlina20maxwellmsnbchealthcare.gov20coverage102513575lh.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-25 15:02:50", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare Website Glitches: Privilege Is Clouding Reporting", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 110960888944481}, "sailthru.tags": "Culture", "sailthru.description": "<p>Political commentator Zerlina Maxwell, writing at <a href=\"http://feministing.com/2013/10/24/dear-journalists-your-privilege-is-clouding-your-perspective-on-obamacare-website-glitches/\">Feministing</a>, hits journalists who have health coverage but log on to healthcare.gov, make false calls into the call center and then report negative stories about problems with Obamacare enrollment.
