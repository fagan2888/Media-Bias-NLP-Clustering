In fact, I now prefer grey skies.\u2019\n\nMohammed Saleh Tauiman was just 13 years old in 2014 when the Guardian newspaper gave him a camera so he could record life under the drones that flew over Marib province, Yemen.\n\nHis father and teenage brother had been killed in a US drone attack in 2011 while they were herding the family\u2019s camels. Afterward, he lived in constant fear of what he called the \u201cdeath machines\u201d that circled above him in the sky.\n\n\u201cI see them every day and we are scared of them,\u201d he said to the Guardian. \u201cA lot of the kids in this area wake up from sleeping because of nightmares from them and some now have mental problems. They turned our area into hell and continuous horror, day and night, we even dream of them in our sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nAnd then, on Jan. 26, a drone killed Mohammed. The Guardian asked both the CIA and the Pentagon whether they\u2019d identified the 13-year-old boy as an Al Qaeda militant. Neither agency gave a comment.\n\nIt\u2019s just the latest tragedy caused by the controversial US drone campaign.\n\nSix years ago, on Jan. 23, 2009, President Barack Obama launched his first drone strikes just three days into his presidency, killing at least nine civilians in the course of two strikes in North Waziristan.\n\nSince then, US drones have killed more than 2,400 people in strikes targeting markets, homes, funerals and even weddings, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a UK-based nonprofit. Between 2004 and 2013, drone strikes killed an estimated 2,525 to 3,613 people.\n\nIn May 2013, Obama defended the drone strikes, saying they were legal, effective, and saved American lives. He said civilian casualties would \u201chaunt\u201d him for the rest of his life, but that he needed to weigh the loss of civilian lives against the threat to life posed by terrorists.\n\nThere are doubts, though, about how effective Obama\u2019s drone campaign has been when it comes to avoiding civilian casualties and killing terrorists. Researchers found that only 12 percent of drone strike victims in Pakistan could be identified as militants and fewer than 4 percent were indentified as members of Al Qaeda. More than a third of those who were described as militants \u201cwere not designated a rank\u201d and nearly 30 percent were not even linked to a specific group.\n\nUnmanned aircraft have done more than just kill and injure thousands of civilians, according to the program\u2019s critics, which include the United Nations, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Drones terrorize and traumatize the population, forcing people to keep their children home from school, avoid large gatherings that may prove suspicious, and remain hidden, lest they be killed before proven innocent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pervasive fear for people every second of the day,\u201d said Sarah Knuckey, one of the lead researchers and editors of the 2012 report, \u201cLiving Under Drones\u201d to MSNBC. \u201cIt has a significant mental health impact for people living there.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t just listen to drone critics. Listen to the people of Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia in their own words. Here are just a few harrowing accounts from ordinary people who have seen and experienced the devastating human cost of US drone strikes firsthand:\n\nZubair Rehman\n\nZubair Rehman and Rosa Brooks speak about United States drone strikes in the Middle East. pic.twitter.com/udg2EBELWy \u2014 CHHR (@health_as_right) October 25, 2014\n\n\u201cI no longer love blue skies. In fact, I now prefer gray skies,\u201d Zubair, a 13-year-old boy from North Waziristan, Pakistan, said in a testimony before Congress in October 2013. \u201cThe drones do not fly when the skies are gray \u2026 When the sky brightens, drones return and we live in fear. It\u2019s something that a 2-year-old would know \u2026 We hear the noise 24 hours a day.\u201d\n\nZubair\u2019s grandmother was killed by a drone strike on Oct. 24, 2012, as she was picking okra in a field. He testified together with his father and 9-year-old sister.\n\nRafiq ur Rehman\n\nRafiq, Zubair, and Nabila ur Rehman testifying at #droneshearing today on the Hill. pic.twitter.com/kXodjUQnwb \u2014 Mike Darner (@mikedarner) October 29, 2013\n\n\u201cNobody has ever told me why my mother was targeted that day,\u201d said Zubair\u2019s father, Rafiq ur Rehman, a Pakistani primary school teacher. He described his deceased mother, Momina Bibi, as the \u201cstring that held our family together.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, my job is to educate. But how do I teach something like this? How do I explain what I myself do not understand? How can I in good faith reassure the children that the drone will not come back and kill them, too, if I do not understand why it killed my mother and injured my children?\u201d\n\nAziz Mabkhut al-Amri\n\n\u201cAs we were driving to the site, I felt myself going deeper and deeper into darkness,\u201d said Aziz. His brother Abdullah Mabkhut al-Amri\u2019s wedding in Rada\u2019a, Yemen in December 2013 made headlines when four hellfire missiles struck it. \u201cThat is the feeling of a person who sees his brothers, cousins, relatives and friends dead by one strike, without reason.\u201d\n\nSaeed Mohammed Al Youseffi\n\n\u201cPeople were really terrified,\u201d said Saeed Mohammed Al Youseffi of Ma\u2019rib Province, who was set to get married two days after the tragedy in Rada\u2019a. \u201cPeople are afraid now to attend any large gathering \u2014 weddings, funerals. Everyone is just trying to survive.\u201d\n\nOum Saeed\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who is with Al Qaeda,\u201d said Oum Saeed, a middle-aged mother of 10, \u201cbut the drones know.\u201d\n\nFaisal bin Ali Jaber\n\n\u201cYemen is losing an entire generation to drones,\u201d said Faisal bin Ali Jaber, an environmental engineer in Yemen who lost two family members in a 2012 drone strike. He said leading a normal life is impossible \u201cwhen you have a drone hovering above your neighborhood.\u201d\n\nMalik Jalal\n\n\"#Drones may kill relatively few but they terrify many more.\" Malik Jalal, tribal leader, @reprieveuk @FFR_PK client pic.twitter.com/vmoajOoWPv \u2014 Jennifer Gibson (@jennifermgibson) November 17, 2014\n\n\u201cDrones may kill relatively few, but they terrify many more,\u201d said Malik Jalal, a tribal leader in North Waziristan. \u201cThey turned the people into psychiatric patients. The F-16s might be less accurate, but they come and go.\u201d\n\nNazeer Gul\n\n\u201cThe drones are like the angels of death,\u201d said Nazeer Gul, a shopkeeper in Pakistan. \u201cOnly they know when and where they will strike.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Hatem Moussa/AP", "article_metadata": {"description": "US drones have killed more than 2,400 people in strikes targeting markets, homes, funerals and even weddings.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Hyacinth Mascarenhas", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "US drones have killed more than 2,400 people in strikes targeting markets, homes, funerals and even weddings.", "title": "What It's Like Living Under Drones \u2014 In Victims\u2019 Own Words", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/like-living-drones-victims-words/202148/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/071913_DRONE_16x9.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-13T13:24:32-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "US drones have killed more than 2,400 people in strikes targeting markets, homes, funerals and even weddings.", "title": "What It's Like Living Under Drones \u2014 In Victims\u2019 Own Words", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/071913_DRONE_16x9.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Yemen", "published_time": "2015-02-14T05:00:51-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-13T13:24:32-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe48ea\"", "article_summary": "What It\u2019s Like Living Under Drones \u2014 In Victims\u2019 Own Words\u2018I no longer love blue skies.\nBetween 2004 and 2013, drone strikes killed an estimated 2,525 to 3,613 people.\n\u201cThe drones do not fly when the skies are gray \u2026 When the sky brightens, drones return and we live in fear.\nHere are just a few harrowing accounts from ordinary people who have seen and experienced the devastating human cost of US drone strikes firsthand:Zubair RehmanZubair Rehman and Rosa Brooks speak about United States drone strikes in the Middle East.\nIn May 2013, Obama defended the drone strikes, saying they were legal, effective, and saved American lives."}
