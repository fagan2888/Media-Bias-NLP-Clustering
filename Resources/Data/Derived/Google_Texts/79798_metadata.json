She's not progressing at all. She's the same,\" Cissy Houston said.\n\nIn his book \"Whitney and Bobbi Kristina: The Deadly Price of Fame,\" author Ian Halperin claims Bobbi Kristina was was never the same after her mother, Whitney Houston, died in 2012.\n\n\"There were allegations of drugs and alcohol. She never dealt properly with the loss of her mother,\" Halperin told ABC.\n\n\"He says that led her to surround herself with enablers just using her for access to Whitney's money,\" ABC reporter Mara Schiavocampo said.\n\nNew York Daily News published an excerpt from the book in which one of Bobbi Kristina's friends told Halperin: \"The crowd she hung out with was out of control. The past couple of years she hung with a bunch of crazies, they were wild and reckless.\"\n\nThis is not Halperin's first tell-all biography about a celebrity.\n\nHe's written unauthorized biographies on Michael Jackson and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, as well.\n\nNow, of course, there's always a lingering doubt when it comes to tell-all books.\n\nBut similar to unauthorized stories, a literary editor for the Chicago Tribune told CNN in 2010 that authorized stories have just as many problems: \"It's very, very possible to do an incredibly accurate book without the main subjects ever speaking with the author.\"\n\nHalperin's book on Bobbi Kristina hits bookshelves Tuesday.\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ian Halperin's new tell-all claims Bobbi Kristina Brown's life was unstable after her mother, Whitney Houston, died in 2012.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Ian Halperin's new tell-all claims Bobbi Kristina Brown's life was unstable after her mother, Whitney Houston, died in 2012.", "title": "New Book Claims Bobbi Kristina Brown Had Unstable Life", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/new-book-claims-bobbi-kristina-brown-had-unstable-life/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1433863863.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ian Halperin's new tell-all claims Bobbi Kristina Brown's life was unstable after her mother, Whitney Houston, died in 2012.", "title": "New Book Claims Bobbi Kristina Brown Had Unstable Life", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/new-book-claims-bobbi-kristina-brown-had-unstable-life/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1433863863.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=52Y2drdToCLsA2fTXVUxT7A2wE7frGzL&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://48105", "iphone": "newsy://48105", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://48105", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "bobbi kristina brown,bobbi kristina brown book,bobbi kristina brown whitney houston book,ian halperin,ian halperin bobbi kristina brown,ian halperin new books,entertainment news,celebrity news,aol,newsy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1433863863.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7bb\"", "article_summary": "Ian Halperin's new tell-all claims Bobbi Kristina Brown's life was unstable after her mother, Whitney Houston, died in 2012.\nIn his book \"Whitney and Bobbi Kristina: The Deadly Price of Fame,\" author Ian Halperin claims Bobbi Kristina was was never the same after her mother, Whitney Houston, died in 2012.\nA new unauthorized biography alleges Bobbi Kristina Brown's life was turbulent leading up to her accident in January.\nBobbi Kristina, who is 22-years-old, was placed in a medically induced coma after she was discovered unresponsive and face down in a bath tub.\nHalperin's book on Bobbi Kristina hits bookshelves Tuesday."}
