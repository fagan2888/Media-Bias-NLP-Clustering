Colorado’s Democrat Gov. John Hickenlooper has been a proponent of Obamacare. However, during last night’s debate with his Republican challenger Bob Beauprez, Hickenlooper attempted to make some quick distance from the Affordable Care Act:

Nice try, Governor!

“More Coloradans will benefit when the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented in 2014,” Hickenlooper said. #copolitics #Hickpocrisy — Bob Beauprez (@bobbeauprez) October 16, 2014

That’s what Hickenlooper said.
