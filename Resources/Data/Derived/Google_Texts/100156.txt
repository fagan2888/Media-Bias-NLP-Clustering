JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - More than 20 Home Depot employees spent part of their Thursday afternoon helping local veterans.

They helped to remodel the Five Star Veterans Center.

Areas inside and outside the building were revamped. Two rooms will get a makeover and a brand new outdoor recreational area will be put together.

Five Star Veterans Center is a nonprofit corporation that helps homeless vets get back on their feet by providing meals, transportation and helping them get a job.

This project is part of an effort by Home Depot to help and give back to U.S. military veterans and their families.



Since 2011, The Home Depot Foundation has invested more than $110 million to provide safe housing to veterans, and along with the help of Team Depot volunteers, has transformed more than 25,000 homes for veterans across the country.
