Sherrod Brown of Ohio said in April. \"When you strip people of their overtime pay, which is what's happened over the years, they really don't have a chance to get ahead: They're working harder and harder and not seeing real pay increases.\"Brown is one of 26 Democrats in the Senate who have been pushing for the president to raise the overtime ceiling to $56,680. In a May blog post, Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez wrote the Obama administration's overtime proposal has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review.Perez then said more needs to be done to improve the lives of American workers.\"But updating the overtime rules isn't the only fix that's needed,\"Perez wrote. \"As President Obama has said, it's time to raise the national minimum wage, whose value has been eroding for more than four decades.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "barack obama, overtime, pay, ceiling, rules", "pubdate": "2015-06-29T22:45:24", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "President Barack Obama will reportedly unveil an overtime rule this week that could give raises to 5 million Americans.", "title": "Politico: Obama to Raise Overtime Ceiling This Week", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/barack-obama-overtime-pay-ceiling/2015/06/29/id/652773/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=b9b87848-c316-454f-b81e-bb843b51d1dc&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/barack-obama-overtime-pay-ceiling/2015/06/29/id/652773/", "title": "Politico: Obama to Raise Overtime Ceiling This Week", "description": "President Barack Obama will reportedly unveil an overtime rule this week that could give raises to 5 million Americans.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1435617924, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "barack obama, overtime, pay, ceiling, rules", "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2015-06-29T22:45:24"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/barack-obama-overtime-pay-ceiling/2015/06/29/id/652773/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "President Barack Obama will reportedly unveil an overtime rule this week that could give raises to 5 million Americans."}, "article_summary": "\"Brown is one of 26 Democrats in the Senate who have been pushing for the president to raise the overtime ceiling to $56,680.\n\"Overtime pay is time-and-a-half, and Obama has long been expected to take executive action to more than double the high-water mark.\n\"As President Obama has said, it's time to raise the national minimum wage, whose value has been eroding for more than four decades.\"\n\"When you strip people of their overtime pay, which is what's happened over the years, they really don't have a chance to get ahead: They're working harder and harder and not seeing real pay increases.\n\"The president's policies are making it difficult for employers to expand employment,\" House Speaker John Boehner said last year."}
