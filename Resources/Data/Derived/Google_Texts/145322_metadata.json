Certain political and business figures keep relying on the same stable of techniques, ignoring that the political and/or economic climate may have changed, to say nothing of the electorate. Perhaps some have been too long at the fair?\n\nPower breeds isolation. One loses touch with the \"person on the street.\" Perceives too selectively. Moves only in familiar circles. This can lead to missteps.\n\nOverkill costs, in more ways than one. Our household received no less than seven expensive mailings, to say nothing of dramatic business association emails, from proponents of this measure. Who paid for that? Could all of that passion and money have been better directed toward our legislative delegation and our governor, pressing for overdue prioritization of roads funding?\n\nMost county residents have common sense \u2014 and good olfactory nerves.\n\nTo label something as the best solution, because it's \"local,\" while calling on the poorest and the working poor to bear the brunt of it, was unwise \u2014 and looked callous, to boot. People know better. Most residents are decent, they acknowledge the roads problem and will support an equitable solution. In this case their perception was that they were being conned. Possibly some proponents of this failed measure believed that they were on a righteous course, but one wonders how many.\n\nThe \"Ooops, we're sorry (about taxing groceries) and we'll fix it later\" carrot was seen as insulting. It came about only because somebody (intelligent) read the fine print. And how were voters to explain such an error? Only two options: Those who crafted the measure are not very bright or they tried to mislead the electorate. Since some of the architects are highly intelligent individuals, the \"honest mistake\" answer was lame. So what explanation remained?\n\nAlso, whether intended or not, the \"fix it later\" promise was eerily reminiscent of a similar, infamous \"Let's pass it and then we'll find out what's in it\" Affordable Care Act exhortation.\n\nProponents' praise for those \"who'll be in town after the vote is over\" was shortsighted. Americans for Prosperity made this into a true debate, where both sides were aired. The fact that some of its organizers came from out of town does not negate their value. In fact, maybe we should hope that some of them stay behind. Further, they were supported from the get-go by many residents, three strong county councilmen and the late broadcaster Russ Cassell, among others. So much for the \"out of towner\" rap.\n\n(Some hereabouts persist in discrediting fellow residents this way, and it's really getting old. It harms us externally. What do we care from whence good ideas come? Let's take 'em and use 'em to better our community \u2014 and appreciate the people who contributed them.)\n\nMany of our local news media were turned into pretzels from the contortions expected of them to support a \"pro vote.\" Kinda scary. A free press is a vanishing commodity everywhere, no question. But we need one in our county. Hopefully, local news media will be emboldened by this outcome.\n\nFinally, the notion that the defeat of this particular measure would sound the death knell for Greenville's future was histrionics. Bad roads are an embarrassment, for sure, but we'll likely get to a fix now. And Greenville County has other things going for it.\n\nWhat we'd really better worry about is our increasingly barnacled government leadership, the lack of transparency in many public matters, cultivating a compliant news media, and how the way that some continue to do things around here in the public square runs counter to our sought-after \"world class image.\"\n\nThis vote offers us a great opportunity to make some major changes.\n\nMary Ann Pires is CEO of The Pires Group Inc., a national public relations marketing firm headquartered in Greenville.
