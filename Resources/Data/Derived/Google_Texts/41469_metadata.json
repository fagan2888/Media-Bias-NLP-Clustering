It\u2019s been 80 years since a vacancy created in a presidential election year was filled. You have to go back to 1888, Grover Cleveland was in the White House, to find the last time a vacancy created in a presidential year on the Supreme Court was confirmed by a Senate controlled by the party different from the president.\n\n\u201cSo we know what the tradition is. Joe Biden in 1992, when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, laid down the Biden Rule. He said when the campaign is underway, no Supreme Court judge would be confirmed.\n\n\u201cAnd in 2005, (then-Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid said, under the Constitution, the Senate doesn\u2019t even have an obligation to give a vote to a nominee. And (New York Sen.) Chuck Schumer, who will be the Democratic leader next year, said 18 months before the 2008 election the Democratic Senate would not confirm a Supreme Court vacancy \u2026 .\u201d\n\nWhy wait? Because it\u2019s the (lower-case) democratic thing to do.\n\nAs McConnell noted, \u201cGeorge, the American people are in the middle of choosing who the next president is going to be. And that next president ought to have this appointment, which will affect the Supreme Court, for probably a quarter of a century.\u201d\n\nTo that, Stephanopoulos noted, \u201cBut they elected President Obama.\u201d\n\nHowever, McConnell responded, that was not the most recent time the people had a chance to speak.\n\n\u201cThe last time the American people voted was in 2014 and they elected a Republican Senate. And under the Constitution, we have shared responsibility. This is not something he does alone. He nominates. We confirm. The last time the American people spoke in 2014 they gave us nine additional net seats, and we took over the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nThat some Republican senators, such as Mark Kirk of Illinois, have said that they would hold a hearing on Garland, doesn\u2019t mean anything. McConnell does the scheduling, and as long as he says \u201cno hearings,\u201d no hearings will be held.\n\nNow, will he hold firm to that until November? Beats me. But if not, he really would be exposed as weak \u2013 indeed, one of the weakest leaders Washington has ever seen (even including Jimmy Carter).\n\nMcConnell has critics beyond left-wingers, however. Prominent conservative columnist George Will says that stonewalling Garland\u2019s nomination is mere obstructionism and an unworthy example of tit-for-tat revenge for Democrats\u2019 deep-sixing the nominations of well-qualified jurists such as Robert Bork and Miguel Estrada.\n\nFurther, Will asks, do opponents believe that a President Trump would nominate someone better?\n\nMcConnell\u2019s allies reply that even the chance of keeping a nominee off the bench who would cement progressives\u2019 control of the court for a generation is worth taking. And, yes, there is a possibility a Trump appointment could be a decent one.\n\nAnd one by President Cruz could be even better.\n\nUPDATE\n\nI saw this too late for last week\u2019s column, but it\u2019s too good an example of \u201cvirtue-signaling\u201d (taking purely symbolic stands to gain undeserved praise) to let pass.\n\nLast Saturday, left-wing groups sponsored a campaign for people to turn off all their electric lights and appliances from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. to honor something called \u201cEarth Hour,\u201d apparently to mark a global warming protest.\n\nThis is too rich. Can they not see how revealing it is to let everything useful, the chief advances of our civilization, be shut off so they can all sit around in the dark?\n\nNaturally, conservatives encouraged people to turn on all their lights and other appliances to mark \u201cHuman Achievement Hour\u201d as a time to celebrate actual progress instead of \u201cprogressive\u201d neo-Dark Age retrogression.\n\nPeople who actually live in the 21st century can see that it\u2019s far better to light one bulb than bless the darkness.\n\nM.D. Harmon, a retired journalist and military officer, is a freelance writer and speaker.
