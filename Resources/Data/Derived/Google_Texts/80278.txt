Aetna paid a 23 percent premium to acquire Louisville-based Humana, the smallest of the Big Five. The deal followed a $6.8 billion merger on Thursday between smaller insurers Health Net and Centene and comes after Cigna and Anthem have acknowledged talking about a merger that could value the combined company at as much as $85 billion. Analysts think industry leader UnitedHealth Group could be on the prowl by next year for targets, including Molina Healthcare or Well Care Health Plans, strong niche players in Medicare and Medicaid markets.

The deals will boost acquirers' profits sharply, Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said. She estimates that Anthem would get $1.6 billion in annual synergies by 2018 from buying Cigna, and Aetna could get $1.25 billion in 2018 savings from merging with Humana. Even after debt payments that could reach $1.3 billion a year on Anthem/Cigna, the surviving company would make a profit of $19.28 a share that year, 36 percent higher than existing estimates for Anthem of $14.15. Profits next year will be 11 percent higher if that merger happens, as cost-cutting gets under way, she estimates.

"The Big Five will be a Big Three," said Gupte, who estimated public companies led by Anthem/Cigna, Aetna/Humana and United would command about a third of the U.S. health-care market, with regional players and government programs covering most of the rest.
