His family foundation \u2014 Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation is sponsoring a clinical trial for a device to restore movement in paralyzed patients by sending an electrical current to the spinal cord. He spoke with New Scientist about some early successes epidural stimulation has had on four patients and its interest in recruiting 36 more patients with spinal cord injuries to undergo the paralysis treatment.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works. The 16-electrode stimulator is implanted in the same place on each patient\u2019s spine, no matter which location the spinal cord was severed. The user applies a continuous electrical current \u2013 at varying frequencies and intensities \u2013 to specific regions in the lower spinal cord where there are dense bundles of nerves that control the hips, knees, ankles and toes. The effect of the device is to mimic signals that would normally be transmitted by the brain to artificially rekindle movement in those regions, Reeve said.\n\nSo far the results for the paralysis treatment sound impressive. The four adults treated with the implant, each of whom has a spinal cord injury, have been able to move their legs, feet and toes. The article also notes that therapy restored to each of the men, who are young and fit, bladder and bowel control and sexual function.\n\nIn the expanded clinical trial of the paralysis treatment, it will seek a more diverse group of patients. They will be men and women of different ages with varying degrees of spinal injuries who have lived with the condition for different lengths of time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo fund the trial it has raised one-third of the $15 million.
