Speaking to The Daily Mail, she said that she met her unborn child\u2019s 15-year-old father during a \u201cdrunken night out with friends.\u201d Since the encounter, the boy has been charged with rape, and has been called to appear at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on July 10.\n\nNotwithstanding her pregnancy\u2019s grim circumstances, the prospective preteen mom is excited to enter the next stage of life. \"I didn't think I'd get pregnant because it was my first time. But I'm really excited and looking forward to being a mum,\u201d she told reporters. \"I can't wait to take the baby swimming and out for walks in the pram. I think I'll be able to cope as I've had lots of practice looking after my brothers.\u201d\n\nThat said, she acknowledges the tremendous responsibility of parenthood. \"I know how to feed a baby its bottle and I can change nappies. But I panic and cry if they're sick and I don't like giving them a bath because I'm a bit frightened,\u201d she said. \"It's good to know I'll have my mum here to help me if I need her.\"\n\nThe girl\u2019s mother, who was initially opposed to the pregnancy, has now accepted the situation and agreed to take care of the child while the girl is at school. She told reporters that while she\u2019s not too keen on becoming a grandmother, she is still proud of her child\u2019s decision to keep the baby. \u201cNow I'm used to the idea,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm really looking forward to having another baby in the house.\u201d\n\nThough extreme, the situation is not unique. In 1997, 12-year-old Jenny Teague became Britain\u2019s youngest mother when she gave birth to a baby girl. The youngest confirmed mother in medical history is Lina Medina \u2014 a Peruvian woman who gave birth at age 5 in 1938.\n\nBut while the girl may be physiologically fit to produce a child, her lifestyle choices hardly align with good parenting. She has allegedly been smoking 20 cigarettes a day throughout her entire pregnancy. \u201cI can give up smoking at any time,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cBut I don't find it affects my pregnancy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "12 year old girl youngest mom, uk youngest mom, mother, jenny teague, lina medina", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 12-year-old Scottish girl will become Britain's youngest mother when she gives birth next month.", "title": "12-Year-Old Girl To Become UK's Youngest Mom", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/12-year-old-girl-become-uks-youngest-mom-263617", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/24/pregnancy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 12-year-old Scottish girl will become Britain's youngest mother when she gives birth next month.", "title": "12-Year-Old Girl To Become UK's Youngest Mom", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/12-year-old-girl-become-uks-youngest-mom-263617", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/24/pregnancy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/24/pregnancy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-11-24T15:57:17-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-24T15:57:16-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 12-year-old Scottish girl will become Britain's youngest mother when she gives birth next month."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15b5\"", "article_summary": "In 1997, 12-year-old Jenny Teague became Britain\u2019s youngest mother when she gave birth to a baby girl.\n\u201cI can give up smoking at any time,\u201d she told reporters.\nThe youngest confirmed mother in medical history is Lina Medina \u2014 a Peruvian woman who gave birth at age 5 in 1938.\nBut I'm really excited and looking forward to being a mum,\u201d she told reporters.\nShe told reporters that while she\u2019s not too keen on becoming a grandmother, she is still proud of her child\u2019s decision to keep the baby."}
