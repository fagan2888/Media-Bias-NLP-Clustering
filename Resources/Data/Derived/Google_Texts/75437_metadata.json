If ratified by the Senate, the convention would result in the automatic exchange of individuals\u2019 and businesses\u2019 sensitive financial information between foreign governments and the U.S.\n\n>>> Learn More: Two Little Known Tax Treaties Will Lead to Substantially More Identity Theft, Crime, Industrial Espionage, and Suppression of Political Dissidents\n\nSpecifically, the U.S. government would be required to share with foreign governments the financial information of foreign individuals and businesses with accounts in the U.S. Additionally, foreign governments would be required to share with the U.S. the financial information of Americans\u2019 and U.S.-based businesses with accounts overseas.\n\nThe protocol has been backed by the Obama administration and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). They argue that it will help to identify tax evaders.\n\nHowever, tax policy experts warn that the treaty would lead to an erosion of financial privacy.\n\n\u201cPromiscuous information sharing with corrupt governments is a recipe for all sorts of bad things,\u201d Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told The Daily Signal. \u201cBad tax policy, identify theft, espionage\u2014you should be trying to make government smaller and less intrusive, not bigger.\u201d\n\nMitchell, along with The Heritage Foundation\u2019s senior fellow in economic policy, David Burton, have been among the few tracking the treaty\u2019s progress and warning of its implications for American individuals and businesses who have foreign bank accounts.\n\n\u201cIf you have any sort of nexus with a foreign financial institution, you don\u2019t have to live overseas for that; you just have to have a diversified portfolio,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThis type of massive information sharing sweeps in just about everything.\u201d\n\nUnder the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which was ratified in 1991 and is currently in place, the Department of the Treasury is authorized to share information requested by a foreign government about an individual, and the original convention was open only to members of the OECD or the Council of Europe.\n\nThe amended convention is open to all countries and leads to the automatic sharing of information between governments, which include the Chinese, Russian, and Colombian administrations, among others. Seventy-two governments currently participate in the automatic sharing of financial information, Burton said, but the Senate has not yet ratified the treaty.\n\nAnd though the protocol could jeopardize the security of Americans\u2019 financial information\u2014including account balances and numbers, dividends, interest, trusts, and the sales of financial assets\u2014Burton and Mitchell said it would pose a serious threat to political dissidents who have fled countries like Russia and China.\n\n\u201cYou have governments who are evil, corrupt, and incompetent,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re talking about gangs in Mexico who want information about American executives so they can kidnap them, whether it\u2019s Russia or China in international espionage, or an incompetent government with hackers, this thing is just a disaster waiting to happen.\u201d\n\nIn a December paper outlining the dangers of ratifying the convention, Burton stressed the impact the treaty could have on political dissidents and said that corrupt officials within authoritarian governments would have access to information that can then be sold for identity theft or financial fraud.\n\nAdditional safeguards to protect such information are needed, he said. Though the Department of the Treasury, and specifically the Internal Revenue Service, have stressed that they must be \u201csatisfied that the foreign jurisdiction has the necessary legal safeguards in place to protect exchanged information,\u201d Burton said it\u2019s unlikely the U.S. can detect internal data transfers from one foreign governmental entity to another.\n\n\u201cFinancial privacy can be the difference between the survival and the systematic suppression of an opposition group in a country with an authoritarian government,\u201d he said. \u201cMany dissidents and human rights groups maintain accounts outside the countries where they are active for precisely this reason.\u201d\n\nThough the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the amended convention late last year, it has yet to be taken up by the full Senate.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has in the past been an outspoken opponent of proposals that would require the sharing of confidential financial information. However, his office did not respond to The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment on the amended protocol.\n\nIf the amended convention does eventually make its way to the Senate floor and is ratified, Mitchell warned the U.S. would be on a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d\n\n\u201cCollection, storing, and sharing\u2014it\u2019s hard to conceive how it can get worse, but it can get worse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be on a slippery slope. Who only knows what sort of poison and thorns and spikes are going to be at the bottom of the hill we\u2019re sliding down?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The tax treaty would result in the sharing of financial information belonging to individuals' and businesses' who have foreign bank accounts.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The tax treaty would result in the sharing of financial information belonging to individuals' and businesses' who have foreign bank accounts.", "title": "Tax Treaty Would Authorize the Sharing of Americans\u2019 Info", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160128_TaxTreaty_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-29T17:02:10+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RPD8Qv"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The tax treaty would result in the sharing of financial information belonging to individuals' and businesses' who have foreign bank accounts.", "title": "Tax Treaty Would Authorize the Sharing of Americans\u2019 Info", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160128_TaxTreaty_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2016-01-28T17:27:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-29T17:02:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Protocol amending the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, OECD, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, Dan Mitchell, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, David Burton, Rand Paul"}, "article_summary": "Seventy-two governments currently participate in the automatic sharing of financial information, Burton said, but the Senate has not yet ratified the treaty.\nSen.
