Doug was a litigator, a public policy advocate and a nonprofit executive \u2014 jobs that meant he spent more time reading documents or meeting with groups of attorneys then he did earning national celebrity. But Doug, who died this weekend of colon cancer, was also one of the most significant constitutional thinkers in the nation. He identified a key flaw at the heart of liberal constitutional rhetoric, and, possibly more than anyone else in the nation, charted a path away from this flaw. American lawyers, or, at least, the American legal left, speak quite differently about the Constitution than we did fifteen years ago, and it is because of Doug Kendall.\n\nFor many years, liberal constitutional rhetoric fixated on two words: the \u201cliving constitution.\u201d As early as 1912, Senator Albert Beveridge, the Senate\u2019s leading proponent of child labor laws, spoke of how \u201cthe Constitution is a living thing, growing with the people\u2019s growth.\u201d During his 1967 confirmation hearing, Justice Thurgood Marshall explained that \u201cthe Constitution was meant to be a living document,\u201d citing nineteenth century decisions holding that it should be \u201cinterpreted and applied as of the time that a particular factual situation came up.\u201d\n\nBy the twenty-first century, however, this rhetoric had begun to wear thin, not necessarily because it was wrong \u2014 but because, by couching their arguments in a \u201cliving constitution\u201d framework, liberals seemed to be conceding that the text and history of the Constitution was not on their side. In 2005, Slate\u2019s Dahlia Lithwick noticed that the words \u201cliving constitution\u201d were used as a slur far more often than they were in earnest. \u201cA Nexis search for the words \u201cliving Constitution\u201d turns up literally dozens of stories by conservatives bashing the premise into a hopeless pulp,\u201d Lithwick wrote. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to find a creditable recent defense of the Constitution as something greater than the span of its own four corners.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us back to Doug Kendall. Doug\u2019s insight was that liberals can make the Constitution-as-written the centerpiece of their rhetoric, without having to give up on their preferred outcomes (or, at least, without having to give up on them most of the time). He founded and ran the Constitutional Accountability Center (CAC), which describes itself as \u201cdedicated to fulfilling the progressive promise of our Constitution\u2019s text and history.\u201d Under Doug\u2019s leadership, CAC, filed briefs arguing that marriage equality, Obamacare and broad civil right protections, among other things, are all consistent with the framers\u2019 vision for the Constitution.\n\nCAC\u2019s Obamacare brief relies heavily on the writings of George Washington. Their marriage equality brief quotes the Federalist Papers.\n\nDoug was not the first person to recognize that progressive values can be aligned with the text-and-history approach to the Constitution that, at least in recent decades, has come to be associated with conservatives. Nor did he claim to be the first to this insight. In its press release announcing Doug\u2019s death, CAC credits Yale Law Professor Akhil Amar for laying the intellectual framework for the idea \u201cthat the text and history of the whole Constitution point our Nation and its courts in a progressive direction.\u201d\n\nYet, while Amar\u2019s undoubtedly made massive contributions to constitutional scholarship, the academy often functions as a windowless warehouse where ideas are stored but rarely seen by the outside world. Doug took Amar\u2019s ideas and operationalized them. And he also offered progressive lawyers a way to talk about the Constitution that didn\u2019t require them to sound like they were constantly trying to change it.\n\nAdmittedly, this new way of speaking about the founding document has not always paid dividends at the Court. Several years ago, shortly after Doug founded CAC, he told me that he named his organization the Constitutional Accountability Center because he wanted to hold judicial conservatives accountable to their own rhetoric. Responding to Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, for example, who insist that they root their constitutional decisions in how the framing generation would have understood particular constitutional phrases, CAC promised to deliver these two justices a pile of evidence showing that their own purported method of deciding cases should point them in a progressive direction.\n\nAt a litigation tactic, this proved less than successful. Scalia not only voted against CAC\u2019s position in two major challenges to Obamacare, he betrayed the views he\u2019d previously expressed in his own judicial opinions in both cases. The two originalist justices voted against marriage equality \u2014 twice. And they remain two of the most reliably conservative votes on the Court.\n\nNevertheless, one of the most important lessons that liberal laywers learned between NFIB v. Sebelius, the first assault on Obamacare to reach the Supreme Court, and King. v. Burwell, the second one to do so, is that a strong legal case can fall apart if its supporters lose the battle for public opinion. NFIB was rooted in a legal argument so weak that one conservative federal appeals court judge dismissed it for having no basis \u201cin either the text of the Constitution or Supreme Court precedent.\u201d Nevertheless, Republicans ran a brilliant PR campaign to sell this legally unsound case to the American people. In the end, that was nearly enough to convince a majority of the Supreme Court to take out the law. It was enough to convince them to take a significant bite out of the law.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in King v. Burwell, by contrast, actually left Obamacare on stronger footing than it would have been on if that case had never been filed. The difference between the two cases was that liberals won the PR war in King.\n\nSo it matters a great deal whether a political movement can offer a theory of the law that, even if it cannot sway a particular judge or justice, can at least create a political environment where the justices fear how they will be perceived if they go out on a limb in a particular case. Doug Kendall understood this fact. He understood that liberals had long ceded territory that we did not need to concede. He built and executed a playbook that would allow progressives to retake this territory. And he taught a new generation of liberal lawyers how to follow this playbook even now that he is gone.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Doug Kendall, who died this weekend of colon cancer, was one of the most significant constitutional thinkers in the nation.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Doug Kendall, who died this weekend of colon cancer, was one of the most significant constitutional thinkers in the nation.", "title": "The Man Who Changed The Way Liberals Talk About The Constitution Died This Weekend", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/09/28/3706250/the-man-who-changed-the-way-liberals-talk-about-the-constitution-died-this-weekend/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/28095129/doug-kendall.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doug Kendall, who died this weekend of colon cancer, was one of the most significant constitutional thinkers in the nation.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/28095129/doug-kendall-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Man Who Changed The Way Liberals Talk About The Constitution Died This Weekend", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/28095129/doug-kendall.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/28095129/doug-kendall.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-28T15:01:18+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "In 2005, Slate\u2019s Dahlia Lithwick noticed that the words \u201cliving constitution\u201d were used as a slur far more often than they were in earnest.\n\u201cA Nexis search for the words \u201cliving Constitution\u201d turns up literally dozens of stories by conservatives bashing the premise into a hopeless pulp,\u201d Lithwick wrote.\nJustice The Man Who Changed The Way Liberals Talk About The Constitution Died This Weekend CREDIT: Constitutional Accountability Center Doug KendallUnless you are a part of a certain legal community in Washington, D.C., you probably haven\u2019t heard of Doug Kendall.\nHe identified a key flaw at the heart of liberal constitutional rhetoric, and, possibly more than anyone else in the nation, charted a path away from this flaw.\nBut Doug, who died this weekend of colon cancer, was also one of the most significant constitutional thinkers in the nation."}
