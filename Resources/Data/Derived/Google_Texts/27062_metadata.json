Today, the company turned those rumors into reality.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on Apple Watch a long time,\u201d Apple\u2019s Tim Cook said Tuesday in introducing the first entirely new product to be launched by the company since he became CEO three years ago.\n\nHow long? Over that time, Apple\u2019s stock has swung from scorching hot to market laggard and back again as the company went from being seen as the ultimate tech trendsetter to facing constant questions about its ability to innovate to\u2026well, whatever it is now that the watch has been announced and consumers finally get to swoon over it, or not.\n\nAs money manager Jeff Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital, suggested on CNBC on Tuesday, sentiment around Apple has swung all the way back to where it was in 2012. Just look at this stock chart.\n\nAAPL data by YCharts\n\nFormer Apple CEO Steve Jobs was famous for saving \u201cone more thing\u201d for the end of his presentations, using that line to introduce another new product, and sometimes the most important product of the day. Cook brought back that line on Tuesday before introducing the Apple Watch, which he called \u201ca new, innovative, intimate way to communicate from your wrist\u201d and a \u201ccomprehensive health and fitness device.\u201d But will it be a hit? The future buzz around Apple, its stock and Cook\u2019s legacy as a successor to Jobs, will rest in part on the answer.\n\nRelated: Naked and Hacked: Why the iCloud Breach Is Bigger Than Apple\n\nThe Apple Watch will come in two sizes and three different finishes, with a variety of straps, at a starting price of $349. Apple says the watch lets you send and receive messages, communicate with coworkers by drawing pictures, and share your heart rate with friends. It can also give you directions, find movie times, control your Apple TV, enable you to securely pay for purchases, open the door to your Starwood hotel room and let you track the phases of the moon.\n\nThe watch will also feature a range of health and fitness tracking apps, including, it seems, one that will notify you when you\u2019ve been sitting too long. (But can it make you want to get up?) Oh, and it will also tell time.\n\nWhat the Apple Watch apparently won\u2019t do is work all those wonders without a link to an iPhone \u2014 or arrive in stores for the 2014 holiday shopping season. \u201cIt will be available early next year,\u201d Cook promised, \u201cand it will be worth the wait.\u201d Time will tell.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Two years ago, the Apple rumor mill started churning with word that the iPhone maker was going to enter another new category, besides TV: wearables.
