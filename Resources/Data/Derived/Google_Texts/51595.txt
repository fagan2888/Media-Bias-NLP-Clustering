Caught in the act! Fifi Box's 10-month-old daughter Trixie Belle sneaks her way into the kitchen dishwasher



Radio star Fifi Box's baby girl Trixie Belle is only turning one next month and already looks to know her way around the kitchen.

The radio star shared a photo with her social media followers on Sunday of a pink-clad and guilty-looking Trixie sitting in her mother's dishwasher, arms in the air and smiling coyly.



Fifi captioned the snap: 'Ok, ok I get it I'm not allowed in the dishwasher! Gee mum relax take a chill pill!'

Inseparable: The mother and daughter are rarely seen apart, even taking a trip to Las Vegas together in January

The mother daughter duo have been inseparable since Trixie's birth last April.

The blue-eyed bub goes to work with her mother each day and the pair even holidayed in Las Vegas over the Christmas break.

Melbourne-based Fifi first announced that she was pregnant with Trixie during her radio show 'Fifi and Jules' back in November 2012.

Just weeks later it was reported that Grant Kenny was the father of her child.

However, the former Australian Ironman, 50, and Fifi have never commented on the speculation.
