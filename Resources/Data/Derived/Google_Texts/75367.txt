Thousands of breast cancer survivors and community members will walk in Jersey City tomorrow for the American Cancer Society’s annual New Jersey Making Strides Against Breast Cancer event.

According to the ACS, approximately 6,960 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in New Jersey last year, and the 3-mile walk will raise money to help fund research and prevention.

The walk will be held in Lincoln Park. Participants should meet near the park’s West Side Avenue entrance, across from Belmont Avenue. On-site registration begins at 8 a.m. with the walk at 10 a.m.

Online registration ends today at noon.

The Making Strides website notes that there are already 278 teams with a total of 1,705 participants who have already raised more than $105,000.

For more information on the day of the walk, contact Jennifer Coulombe at (646) 538-0088.
