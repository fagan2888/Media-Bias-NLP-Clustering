Rick Perry of Texas, who also turned down the Medicaid money and is thought to be considering a second presidential run, used even more vivid language. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting 1,000 more people on the Titanic when you knew what was going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said in an interview between sessions of the Republican Governors Association meeting that it would matter in a political context.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a factor; I think it\u2019s a philosophical position,\u201d Mr. Perry said of Medicaid expansion, noting that even President Obama had called Medicaid \u2014 which is financed by both the states and federal government \u2014 part of \u201ca broken system.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether somebody took it or didn\u2019t, I\u2019ll leave it up to them to justify to their constituents why,\u201d he said of the federal money.\n\nThat is not to say that Mr. Perry would not use the issue to his advantage in a presidential primary race. It is not difficult to project how it could play out in the 2016 campaign, said Republican strategists, noting that the governors who accepted the Medicaid expansion could easily be pegged in television ads and mailers as having effectively approved the president\u2019s health care law.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Walker and Mr. Perry are not the only ambitious Republicans to sound a \u201cWhere were you on Obamacare?\u201d line of attack. Senator Rand Paul said this week that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, perhaps the leading 2016 contender among establishment Republicans, would have to answer for his decision to take the Medicaid money.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cOn the case of the New Jersey governor, I think embracing Obamacare, expanding Medicaid in his state is very expensive and not fiscally conservative,\u201d Mr. Paul said.\n\nHe added, \u201cMany Republican governors I would say are conservative did resist expanding and accepting Obamacare in their states.\u201d\n\nMr. Paul\u2019s criticism underlines one of the challenges governors face as they contemplate presidential campaigns. House members and senators do not face the same dilemma: While members of Congress vote on legislation, bills can be passed without their support. But governors face decisions that affect the residents of their states.\n\nGov. John Kasich of Ohio expressed this political fact of life, becoming animated as he was questioned at a meeting with reporters here about his decision to expand Medicaid.\n\n\u201cI always try to put myself in the shoes of somebody else to say: \u2018How would I feel if I didn\u2019t have health insurance? Are you kidding me?\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Kasich, who has been mentioned as a 2016 hopeful, his voice rising. In defending Medicaid, he spoke at length about the scourge of drug addiction and challenges faced by those with mental illnesses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to save lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to help people, and you tell me what\u2019s more important than that.\u201d\n\nThe issue is a particularly delicate one among Republican governors, not only because they have disagreed on whether to take the Medicaid money, but because Mr. Christie, already a leading figure in the party, formally took over the Scottsdale meeting as the association\u2019s chairman.\n\nPhoto\n\nGov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina has made much of her decision to turn down the Medicaid expansion, frequently boasting that \u201cwe didn\u2019t just say no, we said never.\u201d But she took a more restrained position here when sitting next to Mr. Christie at a news conference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the people of South Carolina will make a decision on one issue,\u201d said Ms. Haley, whose state holds the South\u2019s first presidential primary.\n\nBut when asked if she was suggesting that the health law would not be a factor in 2016, Ms. Haley clarified \u201cit is going to be an issue, certainly,\u201d but would not be \u201cthe sole issue.\u201d\n\nSome of the Republican governors are still determining how to handle Medicaid expansion. They include Mike Pence of Indiana, who said he would like to take a middle course on the issue, using the new federal money to cover more low-income Indiana residents but do so through a state-run program.\n\n\u201cI believe it could be a pilot program for the kind of health care reform that is grounded in the principles of consumer-driven health care,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\n\nAs to whether he would be vulnerable in a presidential primary because he accepted money provided through the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Pence demurred. \u201cThe circumstances of each state with regard to Medicaid are different,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi made same argument in discussing why conservatives ultimately would not punish governors who took the Medicaid money. \u201cSome people may try to make it an issue, but I think they\u2019re going to find out it\u2019s not the kind of issue they expect it to be,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kasich, asked if taking the funding could hamper his own presidential prospects, shot back, \u201cIs that how you\u2019re going to make a decision?\u201d\n\nBut then he offered a prediction that might have been rooted in his hopes: \u201cI think all things kind of fade over time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131121212905, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans in Washington are planning to use the troubled new health law against Democrats in
