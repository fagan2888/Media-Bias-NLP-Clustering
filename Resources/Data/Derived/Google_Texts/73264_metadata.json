The Buffs have also lost 13 consecutive Pac-12 road games.\n\nAs has been the case in many of those Pac-12 losses, CU was out of it by the time the fourth quarter began, as ASU (4-2, 2-1) took a 21-point lead.\n\nThe Buffs certainly didn\u2019t play well, but they also had a series of unfortunate events throughout the night.\n\nOn ASU\u2019s first possession of the night, the Buffs stripped the ball from Sun Devils running back Demario Richard. But it squirted right to ASU tight end Kody Kohl, who scooped it up and went 28 yards untouched for a touchdown.\n\nThree plays later, CU quarterback Sefo Liufau was hit by an ASU defender as he threw, and had the ball picked off and returned 30 yards to the CU 15. ASU scored five plays later for a 14-0 lead.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Buffs forced an Arizona State punt, but safety Chidobe Awuzie couldn\u2019t stop his momentum and was flagged for roughing the punter. ASU kept the ball.\n\nThen came the deflection-turned-TD by Witherspoon, which gave ASU a 31-10 lead and, essentially, sealed the outcome.\n\nWhen the Sun Devils weren\u2019t getting fortunate bounces, they were doing what they\u2019ve always done by dominating the Buffs. ASU is now 7-0 all time against CU, with each win coming by at least two touchdowns.\n\nLiufau had his first 300-yard passing game of the season, finishing 25-of-40 for 389 yards.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU Buffs fail to put end to Pac-12 losing streak", "title": "CU Buffs fail to put end to Pac-12 losing streak", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/10/cu-buffs-fail-to-put-end-to-pac-12-losing-streak/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151010__cu-asup1.jpg", "height": 462}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151010__cu-asup1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-10T23:25:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T05:46:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "CU (3-3, 0-2 Pac-12) extended its Pac-12 losing streak to 13 games and fell to 1-19 in conference games under coach Mike MacIntyre.\nIn their first Pac-12 road game of the season, the Buffs were routed 48-23 by Arizona State at Sun Devil Stadium.\nBOXSCORE: Arizona State 48, Colorado 23Even when they did catch a break, they didn\u2019t.\nIn the second quarter, the Buffs forced an Arizona State punt, but safety Chidobe Awuzie couldn\u2019t stop his momentum and was flagged for roughing the punter.\nOn ASU\u2019s first possession of the night, the Buffs stripped the ball from Sun Devils running back Demario Richard."}
