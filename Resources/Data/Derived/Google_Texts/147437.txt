Fire caused damage to an apartment complex in south Wichita early Sunday morning.

Crews were called around 4:30 a.m. to a fire at River Walk Apartments in the 400 block of East Marion Road, near Pawnee and Broadway.

Pictures from the scene showed exterior damage to a three-story building at the complex.

No one was hurt.

The cause of the fire is under investigation, and a damage estimate has yet to be determined.

Apartment management declined to comment when KAKE News asked about efforts to help displaced residents.
