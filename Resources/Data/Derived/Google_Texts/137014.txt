A Fountain woman faces seven counts of animal cruelty after she was arrested Saturday.

Fountain Police were called to a home at 1446 Bonita Drive after receiving a report from a mail carrier that several windows in the home were broken and that dogs were barking, Fountain police said in a news release.

Officers investigated and discovered four pitbulls that had no outdoor access. An officer contacted the Humane Society and learned that it was investigating Crystal McIntosh for animal cruelty.

Police were granted a search warrant and the Humane Society took control off the four pitbulls, three of whom were emaciated. Authorities also recovered three dead turtles, the release said.

McIntosh, who arrived at the home while police were there, told officers she and her family moved out three months ago. The homeâ€™s water was turned off on Jan. 26 and the electricity was turned off Feb. 1, police said.

Police arrested McIntosh on seven counts of aggravated animal cruelty.
