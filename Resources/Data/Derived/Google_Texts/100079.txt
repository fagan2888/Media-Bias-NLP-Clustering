An Ogden physician will try to unseat Republican Rob Bishop of Utah’s 1st Congressional District in November.

Peter Clemens is the Democrat who’ll try to derail the congressman’s bid for a seventh term. Clemens is a doctor from Ogden who lost his party’s convention contest two years ago to unseat Bishop, but this time he ran for the nomination unopposed. Clemens calls himself “an independent voice.”

“We need to end the reign of Congressman Rob Bishop,” said Clemens. “Now is the time. This is the year. Don’t get Robbed.”

Clemens pledged to advocate for workers, veterans, affordable college and protecting public lands from the policies of his Republican opponent.

Meanwhile, Bishop easily defeated his own Republican challenger, David Chiu, at the GOP convention and won his party’s nomination. He’s a former school teacher, lobbyist and Speaker of the Utah House. Bishop told the GOP convention crowd Saturday he’s eager to return to Washington to battle for conservative causes like gun rights, federalism, religious freedom and repealing Obamacare.

“I wanna go back and fight to make sure that Utah is in control of their lands, that Utah controls their water and that Utah is able to control their destiny.”

Bishop says he wants to serve the remaining four years of his term as the House Resources Committee chairman before he leaves Congress and returns to Utah.
