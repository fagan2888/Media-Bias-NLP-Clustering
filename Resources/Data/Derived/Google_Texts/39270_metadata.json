Ninebot said it received $80 million from a group of investors, including Xiaomi, a Chinese electronics manufacturer that once accused Segway\u2019s makers of infringing on its copyrights, to finance the purchase.\n\nAnalysts said the purchase also illustrates a new drive by Chinese companies to move away from copycat products and toward the pursuit of brand-name products, especially those that have gained some appeal among Western countries.\n\n\u201cToday it\u2019s not just copycat China,\u201d said Neil Shen, founding partner of Sequoia Capital China, a Ninebot investor, at Ninebot\u2019s presentation on Wednesday. \u201cChina will expand, through its own innovations and through acquisitions.\u201d\n\nDean Kamen, inventor of the Segway, pitched up the two-wheeled vehicle in the early 2000s as the next big thing in modern transportation, asserting at one point that the Segway would \u201cbe to the car what the car was to the horse and buggy.\u201d Venture capitalist John Doerr predicted that the scooter would hit $1 billion in sales faster than any other company in history, making it bigger than the Internet. And Mr. Kamen suggested that the company would sell 100,000 units in its first year.\n\nBut the motorized scooter never caught on, saddled with a damaging reputation for being uncool. The company sold just 30,000 units during its first six years in the market, according to Forbes.\n\nThe Segway seemed like a magnet for PR disasters as well.\n\nPresident George W. Bush took a spill while riding the \u201chuman transporter\u201d around his family estate in Kennebunkport, Maine. Later that same year, Segway had to recall 2,000 units after customers complained that the device was unstable when its battery ran low.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest disaster came when James Heselden, a British entrepreneur who bought the company in 2009, died in a freak accident in the fall of 2010 when a cross-country version of the Segway he was riding plunged off a cliff.\n\nBesides the bad publicity, the Segway has also been stymied by adaptability issues. Riders and police officers have had a difficult time trying to determine its best use. Should it be a road cruiser, something like a environmentally-friendly Harley Davidson? Or should it be used like a bicycle, safe to use on sidewalks, but not on the open roads?\n\n\u201cWhen I first got it, it was so much fun,\u201d said entrepreneur Peter Shankman, one of the first five people in New York City to buy one. \u201cBut the police didn\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d Mr. Shankman says that on one block he\u2019d be told to get on the sidewalk, while on another he\u2019d be told to get in the street.\n\nNinebot Chief Executive Gao Lufeng is banking on a friendlier market in China for battery-powered Segway, in a country filled with densely populated cities and a major air pollution crisis.\n\nMr. Gao said he would preserve both brand names, and that the company would collaborate more closely with Xiaomi. Mr. Gao added that the Segway would offer Chinese citizens an option to alleviate the country\u2019s air quality problems.\n\n\u201cThis alliance will help us provide more environmentally friendly transportation methods for our customers,\u201d he said.\n\nSegway-like devices are widely used by Chinese police officer to patrol Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square, but it remains to be seen if the personal transportation vehicle will be widely accepted by the Chinese public.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There will be a new pair of hands on the handlebars of the Segway, as a former Chinese rival has acquired the ungainly two-wheeled scooter that never lived up to its early billing as the future of 21st century transportation.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "There will be a new pair of hands on the handlebars of the Segway, as a former Chinese rival has acquired the ungainly two-wheeled scooter that never lived up to its early billing as the future of 21st century transportation.", "title": "Former Chinese rival in deal to buy Segway", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/15/former-chinese-rival-in-deal-to-buy-segway/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/15/4_152015_ap5313757215148201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/15/4_152015_ap5313757215148201.jpg", "description": "There will be a new pair of hands on the handlebars of the Segway, as a former Chinese rival has acquired the ungainly two-wheeled scooter that never lived up to its early billing as the future of 21s", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Former Chinese rival in deal to buy Segway"}, "Author": "Chris White", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Segway Inc, Ninebot Inc, Beijing, China, Xiaomi"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc567\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Gao added that the Segway would offer Chinese citizens an option to alleviate the country\u2019s air quality problems.\nMr. Gao said he would preserve both brand names, and that the company would collaborate more closely with Xiaomi.\nBeijing-based scooter manufacturer Ninebot Inc., which makes a range of short-distance motorized transport devices, said Wednesday that it bought New Hampshire-based Segway Inc. for an undisclosed amount.\n\u201cToday it\u2019s not just copycat China,\u201d said Neil Shen, founding partner of Sequoia Capital China, a Ninebot investor, at Ninebot\u2019s presentation on Wednesday.\nLater that same year, Segway had to recall 2,000 units after customers complained that the device was unstable when its battery ran low."}
