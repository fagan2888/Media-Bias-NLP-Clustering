She is a teacher who struggled to find time and a place to pump at her school. (Reza A. Marvashti /For The Washington Post)\n\nAll Anna Johnson-Smith wanted was some time each afternoon to pump breast milk for her infant. But when she returned to work as a kindergarten teacher in Marlin, Tex., her principal denied her request, putting her in the position of choosing between her child and her career.\n\nTwo weeks into the school year, she quit. Since then, she has joined the ranks of current and former teachers in multiple states \u2014 including Texas, Virginia, Florida, Nebraska and Utah \u2014 who are advocating for the right to pump at work, seeking to close a loophole that leaves teachers and other salaried workers unprotected under federal law.\n\n\u201cA 15-minute break was all I was asking for,\u201d said Johnson-Smith, now a stay-at-home mother and the owner of a photography studio. \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far in our society in so many ways, and here in 2015, we\u2019re still fighting for the right to provide breast milk for our babies.\u201d\n\nBreast-feeding rates are on the rise in the United States, perhaps at least partly because of the federal government\u2019s efforts to educate the public about the health benefits of breast milk. Breast-feeding protects babies from ear infections and other illnesses, according to the surgeon general, and children who are breast-fed for at least six months are less likely to become obese. Mothers who breast-feed are less likely to suffer from breast or ovarian cancer.\n\nWith more than half of the nation\u2019s mothers with infants working outside the home, that advice has led many women to try to pump on the job.\n\nAnna Johnson-Smith left her job as a kindergarten teacher when she wasn't allowed time to pump her breast milk. She provides three tips that would create a better work environment for breast-feeding mothers. (The Washington Post)\n\nWhile pumping at work is a hassle for many women, for teachers, it can feel nearly impossible. Privacy is scant in a school building full of children, and classroom schedules are busy and inflexible. It is difficult to find a spare moment to run to the restroom, let alone enough time to pump.\n\n[Four teachers detail why it\u2019s a struggle to pump at school]\n\nSome teachers lean on colleagues or aides who are willing to cover their classrooms while they take refuge in a supply closet or an empty office. Some teachers pump at their desks during planning periods or lunchtimes, hoping that students and staff members observe the do-not-disturb sign on the door. Some work for principals who do their best to make the logistics easy.\n\nOthers, like Johnson-Smith, who resigned in fall 2012 after the May birth of her daughter, end up with a choice: Quit their jobs to keep breast-feeding their babies, or quit breast-feeding to keep working.\n\n\u201cIn many school districts, it comes down to how supportive the principal is,\u201d said Ann Seacrest, a lactation consultant and executive director of MilkWorks, a nonprofit breast-feeding center in Nebraska. Breast-feeding advocates say mothers shouldn\u2019t have to depend on the largesse or understanding of their bosses.\n\nWomen who don\u2019t remove milk from their breasts often enough risk painful engorgement or plugged ducts and infection, according to lactation experts. Perhaps more important, failing to pump frequently enough can cause a drop in milk supply that makes it frustratingly difficult \u2014 or impossible \u2014 to provide a baby with enough nutrition through breast milk alone.\n\nMonica Howell, a high school teacher in Miami, said that when she returned to work last year, her assistant principal denied her request for a 20-minute break to pump toward the end of her first two-hour class of the day. The principal reversed that decision, allowing Howell the time she needed. Her students worked on written assignments while she pumped.\n\nAnna Johnson-Smith left her teaching job in Texas because she couldn\u2019t get time to pump at school.

(William Galbreath/Family photo)\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not always going to have a principal like mine, who was trying to help me,\u201d she said. Even with his support, there were days when there was no adult to cover her classroom. Her breasts became painfully full, and she worried she would leak noticeably.\n\nHowell brought the issue to her union, the United Teachers of Dade. The Miami-Dade County teachers\u2019 contract signed in fall 2014 included a new provision guaranteeing teachers the right to a nonbathroom private space and \u201creasonable\u201d time to pump.\n\n\u201cIt was a victory for us,\u201d said Karla Hernandez-Mats, the union\u2019s secretary-treasurer. \u201cThis is a workforce that is predominantly women, and here we are taking care of everybody\u2019s children in the community, but we\u2019re not afforded the time to take care of our own babies? How fair is that?\u201d\n\nOf the approximately 3.5 million public schoolteachers in the United States, about three-quarters are women.\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act protects mothers who are hourly workers by requiring their employers to provide time and space for pumping, part of the Obama administration\u2019s broader effort to encourage breast-feeding. But the law does nothing to protect teachers or other women who work in salaried positions.\n\nA growing number of states have passed laws to pick up the slack.\n\nVirginia passed a law in 2014 specifically aimed at protecting teachers who pump; Louisiana did the same in 2013.\n\nThis year, Texas and Utah passed laws that require public employers, including schools, to provide nursing mothers with time and space to pump. Nebraska also passed a measure this year that requires any employer with more than 15 workers to allow pumping breaks unless doing so would cause undue hardship.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that this needs to be in legislation to protect teachers,\u201d said Diana West, spokeswoman for La Leche League International.\n\nFour years after the U.S. surgeon general issued a \u201ccall to action\u201d urging doctors, communities and businesses to support breast-feeding mothers, teachers and many other salaried workers have no legal right to pump at work in more than half the states, including Maryland, according to state laws compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. The District requires employers to provide nursing mothers with a sanitary place to pump that\u2019s not a bathroom and reasonable unpaid break time \u2014 unless the employer argues that such breaks would create an \u201cundue hardship.\u201d\n\nEven in states where they are legally protected, teachers say the realities of working in a school make it tough.\n\nShelly Steely teaches social studies in San Diego, in a state where employers have been required to provide time and space for nursing mothers for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cTechnically, you\u2019re supposed to be able to take the breaks when you need them, but there\u2019s not enough coverage at any school site to leave your classroom,\u201d said Steely, who went back to work in November, when her daughter was 8 weeks old. \u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic to have someone teaching half of one of my classes.\u201d\n\nSteely pumped at her desk during her planning period and lunchtime with a sign on her door that was disregarded more than once by students and custodians.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you have ever talked to a teenager about nursing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of awkward.\u201d\n\nSarah Anzelmo-Steele, a middle-school teacher in Richmond, said her principal was supportive when she returned to work after her maternity leave last fall, shortly after the state legislature passed a law requiring schools to allow teachers to pump. But even with the law and her principal\u2019s goodwill, it was challenging to find a private place that would be reliably available.\n\nEventually, the school\u2019s art teacher, who was pregnant, offered to let Anzelmo-Steele use the art supply closet. Anzelmo-Steele said she would pump just before school started, sometimes running down the hall to get to class on time. Her breasts were so full that they were sore by the time she was able to pump at lunch at 12:30 p.m.\n\nShe pumped again when she had her planning period, after 1:30 p.m. It was not ideal to pump twice in quick succession after such a long stretch without pumping in the morning. But Anzelmo-Steele wanted to be a team player, and she feared that asking for a mid-morning break would have burdened her colleagues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like other jobs, where your boss can just go, \u2018Oh yeah, of course, just go pump when you need to pump,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go pump, you need to find someone else to cover your class.\u201d\n\nShe said she had hoped to breast-feed for a year, as the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends. She made it to seven months. Sometimes, she wishes she had asked for more time to pump; perhaps it could have made a difference. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sound like a whiner,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "national education, education, teachers, breastfeeding, pumping", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Some educators face a choice: Quit their jobs to keep breast-feeding their babies, or quit breast-feeding to keep working.", "title": "Teachers learn a lesson in loopholes when it comes to pumping breast milk", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/breast-may-be-best-but-teachers-dont-have-the-right-to-pump-at-work-in-many-states/2015/08/02/9f6daa64-36d0-11e5-9d0f-7865a67390ee_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/07/31/Education/Images/pumpatschool__6361438382530.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@emmersbrown"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "national education, education, teachers, breastfeeding, pumping", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "9f6daa64-36d0-11e5-9d0f-7865a67390ee", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Some educators face a choice: Quit their jobs to keep breast-feeding their babies, or quit breast-feeding to keep working."}, "article_summary": "Some teachers pump at their desks during planning periods or lunchtimes, hoping that students and staff members observe the do-not-disturb sign on the door.\nAnna Johnson-Smith left her job as a kindergarten teacher when she wasn't allowed time to pump her breast milk.\n(Reza A.
