Part of the rationale for that move\u2013besides a drive towards efficiency\u2013was that Zipcar didn\u2019t totally trust its ad agency.\n\n\u201cA big piece of my frustration in working with a traditional agency is that it felt like a black box,\u201d Mr. Harrington said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the feeling that agencies play games and direct business to their trading desks. As a CMO, that is extraordinarily frustrating for me.\u201d\n\nMr. Harrington was referring to the practice that many ad agencies within larger holding companies employ these days. These ad conglomerates typically own digital ad buying specialty divisions\u2013often referred to as trading desks\u2013which focus on programmatic ad buying, but vary in how much they disclose to their clients about how they operate. In some cases, these trading desks simply buy ad space on various digital ad exchanges, often using different sets of data to target ads at specific audiences.\n\nOther agency trading desks actually purchase media inventory upfront at wholesale prices using automated technology and then resell it to individual agency clients, promising highly sophisticated ad targeting using different data sources. In some cases, individual clients do not have any transparency into what prices these trading desks pay upfront for this media inventory.\n\nZipcar\u2019s comments once again raise questions about the viability of the traditional agency model as firms lose the trust of clients because of their perceived lack of transparency. Executives from agencies like Omnicom and Publicis have already found themselves playing down concerns about widespread kickbacks.\n\nMr. Harrington, who joined Zipcar as interim CMO in 2012, declined to identify the digital agency that Zipcar had worked with previously. DigitasLBi handed Zipcar\u2019s digital media buying from mid-2012 through part of 2013, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cDigitasLBi operates on a fully transparent model for and behalf of all of our clients\u2013past, present and future,\u201d said a Digitas spokeswoman. \u201cOur clients have applauded our transparency, and characterize us as ahead of the industry.\u201d\n\nBesides the trading desk model, Mr. Harrington\u2013a former ad agency executive himself\u2013cited the preponderance of \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cwaste\u201d in listing his gripes with big ad agencies.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The auto-rental company Zipcar has fully embraced data-driven digital advertising over the past two years, increasing its spending as it looks to extract more efficiency from online marketing.
