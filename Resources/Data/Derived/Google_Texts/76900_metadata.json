Federal rule change could be costly, change mission of autism program\n\nIn January, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued changes to its Home and Community-Based Services program, which provides waivers to Medicaid-eligible people with disabilities to live at home or in the community rather than in facilities the government deems institutional. The goal is to keep people out of settings with isolating qualities that keep them away from the broader community.\n\nThe rule states that waiver money cannot be given for programs in settings that aren\u2019t considered \u201chome and community based\u201d or are institutional or isolating. It has the potential to affect the nearly 6,000 facilities in Ohio that offer waiver services. These institutional settings include nursing facilities, hospitals, and intermediate care facilities. Settings in the same building or \u201cadjacent to\u201d institutional-like settings are also not eligible for HCBS waivers.\n\nWell-intentioned as it is, the rule has left care providers across Ohio wondering what it means for their programming.

Health-care consumers get many new choices, some higher prices\n\nToledo-area residents will face an explosion of insurance plan choices and higher costs for some insurance premiums as the second enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health-care marketplace begins this Saturday.\n\nThe number of insurance companies offering plans in the Toledo area on the health-care exchange has risen from seven to 11, and the number of health-plan options to choose from has mushroomed from 66 last year to nearly 450 this year.\n\nAlso new on the exchange will be a separate section of the Web site where small business owners, those with 50 or fewer employees, can purchase health insurance.\n\nThose already covered with insurance can renew or change their policies over the next three months.
