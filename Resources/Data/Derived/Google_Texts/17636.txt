CLEVELAND (AP) - Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona has been ejected in the fifth inning against Kansas City.

Francona was thrown out by plate umpire Tom Woodring after the Indians’ Michael Brantley was hit in the leg by a pitch from Jeremy Guthrie.

Francona was upset that Guthrie wasn’t ejected because Woodring had warned both benches after the Royals pitcher hit Jason Kipnis in the second inning.

Francona argued with Woodring and crew chief Gary Cederstrom before leaving the field to a loud ovation.

The ejection was Francona’s third of the season and 39th of his career.
