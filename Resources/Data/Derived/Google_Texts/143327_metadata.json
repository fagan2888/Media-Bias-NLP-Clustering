Huerta was the first woman in U.S. history to recruit, organize, lobby and negotiate on behalf of migrant workers. But she also was visible on picket lines and in protests as photos of her with a bullhorn attest.\n\n\"It's like walking through memory lane,\" Huerta said. \"It's really beautiful. I'm just amazed that they were able to select photographs and they were really able to tell my story in the farmer's movement.\"\n\nThe exhibit, which will run until May 15, 2016, focuses on the 13 years when she co-founded the UFW until the passage the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, which she helped advance. Its run dates coincide with the 50th anniversary of the September 1965 Delano grape strike and boycott, which led to the field workers' first contract with California table grape growers.\n\nHuerta's exhibit features more than 40 objects including photos, original speeches Huerta made to Congress, United Farm Workers memorabilia and Chicano artwork. Huerta dressed herself and her children in handmade clothes and one of the items on display is one of Huerta's vests with a symbol of the UFW symbol on it.\n\nRelated: Farmworkers Activist Dolores Huerta Will Be Focus of Smithsonian Exhibit\n\nShe said another favorite photo in the collection is one of children working in the fields. \"I remember at the time of that photo we were sued because growers maintained there were no children working in the fields,\" she said. She also likes one of Robert F. Kennedy in a visit to Delano, Calif., as a presidential candidate.\n\nOne that she said some exhibit goers might find surprising reflects the middle class life she grew up in, depicting her in her days as a majorette.\n\nIn 2012, Huerta was honored by President Obama with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Huerta continues her activism and along with the Dolores Huerta Foundation, is still active and fighting for the rights of immigrants, voting rights, promoting community organizing and more recently the right to die and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"As long as I have the energy and health I am going to do as much as I can,\" said Huerta.\n\nDolores Huerta, Huelga, Delano CA Grape Strikes, September 24, 1965.
