House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) claimed Thursday that she doesn’t know who Jonathan Gruber is despite the fact that she mentioned the Obamacare architect and MIT professor by name during a 2009 press conference regarding the health law.

Her reason for attempting to distance herself — and other Democrats who have supported Obamacare — from Gruber is obvious. The MIT professor has become infamous over the last few days for saying on video from last year that the Affordable Care Act passed because of its “lack of transparency” and the “stupidity of the American voter.”

“I don’t know who he is. He didn’t help write our bill,” Pelosi said during a Thursday press conference.

“You have a person who wasn’t writing our bill commenting on what was going on when we were writing the bill who has withdrawn some of the statements that he made,” she continued. “So, let’s put him aside.”

Interestingly enough, Pelosi does know who Gruber is — or, at least, she did, according to video from 2009.

“I don’t know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT’s analysis of what the comparison is to the status quo versus what will happen in our bill to those who seek insurance within the exchange,” explained Pelosi of the Democrats’ health care proposal at a 2009 press conference. “And our bill takes down those costs even from now and much less preventing the upward spiral.”

Does Pelosi think that the American people are too “stupid” to believe her when she says she doesn’t recognize Gruber’s name?

Moreover, It appears the White House is also taking measures to distance itself from the Obamacare architect.

“The tax credits in the law that help millions of middle class Americans afford coverage were no secret, and in fact were central to the legislation,” White House spokeswoman Jessica Santillo explained of Gruber’s remarks in a statement to Talking Points Memo. “Not only do we disagree with those comments, they’re simply not true.”
