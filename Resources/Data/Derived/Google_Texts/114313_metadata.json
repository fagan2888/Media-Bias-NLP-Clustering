In the 17 states with statistics available on Medicaid expansion, on average 63 percent more individuals applied for this component of Obamacare than the states had projected. In November, we were told this expansion would add 44,000 South Dakotans to the welfare rolls. By December, that number had increased to 55,000. Based upon the experience of the other states, South Dakota would likely see almost 90,000 citizens added to the welfare rolls if we do this expansion. Over 10 percent more of our state\u2019s population that would be looking to the remaining taxpayers for free health care. At least 75 percent of those new welfare recipients are able-bodied and without dependents.\n\nState officials met with then-Obama HHS Secretary Sebelius and said S.D. would consider expanding this welfare program if we could require the recipients to work. Seems like a reasonable request, the South Dakotans paying for the program have to work. Secretary Sebelius dismissed the request as a non-starter. The Obama administration\u2019s refusal to consider this reasonable requirement is enlightening. It means they don\u2019t care about health care coverage so much as they care about creating unrestricted government dependency. Encouraging pride and some level of self-reliance for welfare recipients through earning the benefits is unacceptable to the Obama administration.\n\nOpposing more welfare is not foreclosing health care coverage, and our family has experience with this situation. When dad was home disabled, mom took a job as a kitchen aid at the local nursing home. I remember mom telling us she did it for the health insurance. For our family, it just seemed like a natural continuation of the teachings of commitment, hard-work, and responsibility that had always been our parents\u2019 lives. Today the politicians would \u2013 by their policy positions \u2013 preach against those qualities and those actions. They would encourage welfare, instead of work. They would send a message to young people of the value of looking to the government, and not the values our parents taught us.\n\nStates that have bought into the Obamacare deal have largely underestimated the number of eligible welfare recipients, many by up to 100 percent. It\u2019s easy to see why. Free concentrates and creates demand. Run an ad offering free anything, and see how much demand you will create. Now tell people that you have an option for free health care that only requires them to either not work or reduce their work \u2013 its not rocket science to understand the consequences. People will adjust their lives and income so that they can qualify for free.\n\nUnderstand, this is a government welfare program, not a health program. If the goal was health, the federal government would require (or at least let state\u2019s require) that the welfare recipient not smoke, and be on a program to manage obesity \u2013 two huge health care cost drivers. But, the Obama administration will not allow these conditions either.\n\nThese 90,000 new welfare recipients will have to pay no deductible and no co-payment. The financial skin in the game that makes the taxpaying South Dakotans think twice about overusing expensive health care resources, doesn\u2019t exist for the Medicaid recipient.\n\nThere are some big players in S.D. exerting pressure on the Governor because they want access to these federal funds, but their gain comes at too great a cost to the citizens of this state. Today the Obamacare advocates describe their new arbitrary mark \u2013 taxpayer funded health care for all who keep their earnings below 138 percent of the poverty level \u2013 as the mark where we really are caring and loving. Given their way, in five years that number will be 175 percent, and if given enough time they will get to where they set out for at the beginning of this Obamacare march \u2013 government-owned and operated health care.\n\nThere is no such thing as free federal money. The brunt of the higher cost of this new welfare program will fall on those current programs that rely on our current Medicaid appropriations \u2013 the impoverished elderly in our nursing homes and the severely disabled in our community based facilities \u2013 people that really need and deserve our welfare tax dollars. Unlike the Obama administration, S.D. lacks the ability to print money or go into debt. The S.D. Legislature needs to bring sanity to this debate.\n\nMY VOICE\n\nLee Schoenbeck is a trial lawyer, mechanic\u2019s kid, and a legislator from Watertown. My Voice columns should be 500 to 700 words.
