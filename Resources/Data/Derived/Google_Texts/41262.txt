One of the last places a woman wants to be when she’s about to give birth is standing in a hospital hallway for hours, with no nurses or doctors available – and no bed or pain medicine available – due to overcrowding.

Yet, that is exactly what happened to Narmeen Choudhury, a New York City-based television reporter. And it’s happening to many other NYC moms.

When Choudhury’s doctor told her he’d meet her at Mount Sinai-Roosevelt Hospital, her contractions were 2 1/2 minutes apart. She arrived to find a packed waiting room, no beds available, no seats available, and four or five other women in labor, standing.

Her doctor was nowhere to be found. So she waited:

For two hours, as my contractions got stronger and stronger, I stood and rocked back and forth in the hallway of a busy labor and delivery wing….Not once did a nurse or resident stop to ask me my name, how far along I was, how I was doing or if I needed anything at all. Not once in the two hours I stood in pain just a few feet from the nurses station.

She was about to give birth by the time she was brought into triage:

I was finally checked and told I was 7 to 8 cm dilated! Great news, but also scary knowing I could have delivered in the hallway if we were left on our own for much longer. Our daughter’s heart rate began to drop significantly, indicating some kind of distress. After this happened a total of three times through the night and into the early morning, we did realize we were in for an unplanned emergency c-section.

Fortunately, her daughter Laila was born healthy and everyone is doing fine today. But Choudhury still has questions:

How long was she in distress? Could something have happened to her in those two hours I was forced to stand and labor alone? These are just some of the questions I ask myself over and over again.

When she shared her story on Facebook she received “dozens of messages” from NYC women who have been in similar circumstances in various city hospitals.

One woman, Annie Coppins, also waited for hours in a hospital hallway, asking for an anesthesiologist. Only after she and her husband, Buzzfeed’s McKay Coppins, took to Twitter to ask for help did it finally arrive.

Another, Laurie Kyle, says the medical staff mocked her natural birth choices – while she was giving birth:

“I just did not anticipate being insulted in the throes of my pain for no reason by someone saying do you mind if we use these sterile instruments? Are they not natural enough for you. The resident who stitched me up made a comment about how this is what she gets when she doesn’t want an episiotomy,”

Michele Giordono, Executive Director of Choices in Childbirth, said they hear from women “all the time” about bad childbirth experiences in NYC:

The problem, according to [Giordono], is evident at nearly every single city hospital. And the issue…does not discriminate between public or private hospitals.

Two hospitals named in Choudhury’s stories have issued statements, saying they are aware of the complaints and always striving to improve.
