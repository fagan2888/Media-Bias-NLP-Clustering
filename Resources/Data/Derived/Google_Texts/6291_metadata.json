And over the past year, medical care has risen at an unadjusted 3% annual rate. That\u2019s the fastest advance in a year and a half.\n\nWhat\u2019s gotten more expensive is treatment in hospitals. The price of hospital-related care has climbed 5.3% in the past 12 months, the highest rate since mid-2014, the government reported Tuesday.\n\nAnalyst Omar Sharif at SG Americas Security said the increase in October might reflect problems with the process of calculating monthly changes. Prices of medical care rose slower than usual during the summer and they might be catching up now as government gets a better handle on actual costs. The same pattern emerged early in the year.\n\nHealth insurance is also on track to post the biggest annual increase in three years. The cost of insurance has climbed at a 3% pace in the past 12 months.\n\nHigher health-care expenses in October were largely driven by a jump in prices in the West, though the reasons are unclear.\n\nSee also: Health care and rent drive first inflation rise in three months\n\nThe price of subscription drugs, meanwhile, has slowed to a 3.7% annual pace from a 13-year high of 6.4% in the fall of 2014. But that\u2019s still an above-average increase.\n\nThe cost of getting treated by a doctor at an office hasn\u2019t risen very much, though: just 1.9% in the past year.\n\nHealth care is a volatile category that\u2019s shown sharp swings, especially during the recovery. The advent of the law popularly known as Obamacare has also clouded the picture.\n\nWhether the upward trend in costs persists remains to be seen, but rising health expenses clearly are a drain on U.S. households.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"parsely-author": "Jeffry Bartash", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The price of medical care has risen at a 3% rate in the past 12 months, the fastest advance in a year and a half.", "creator": "@jbartash", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DZ469_medica_ZG_20151117133746.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/health-care-costs-might-be-on-rise-again-2015-11-17", "author": "Jeffry Bartash", "parsely-title": "Health-care costs might be on rise again", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-11-17T15:29:00-05:00", "description": "The price of medical care has risen at a 3% rate in the past 12 months, the fastest advance in a year and a half.", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "The price of medical care has risen at a 3% rate in the past 12 months, the fastest advance in a year and a half.", "title": "Health-care costs might be on rise again", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/health-care-costs-might-be-on-rise-again-2015-11-17", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DZ469_medica_ZG_20151117133746.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DZ469_medica_ZG_20151117133746.jpg"}, "article.id": "3DC7182E-8D45-11E5-94C7-1AA65E6715F8", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Health-care costs appear to be on the rise again.\nPrices of medical care rose slower than usual during the summer and they might be catching up now as government gets a better handle on actual costs.\nIn October, the price of medical care jumped a seasonally adjusted 0.7% to mark the biggest gain in five months, according to the consumer price index.\nAnd over the past year, medical care has risen at an unadjusted 3% annual rate.\nWhether the upward trend in costs persists remains to be seen, but rising health expenses clearly are a drain on U.S. households."}
