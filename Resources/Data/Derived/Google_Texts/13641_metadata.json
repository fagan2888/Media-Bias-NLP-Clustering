Why? Because they believed in what they were doing,\u201d said Carson, in a reference to the early American colonists who rebelled against rule by the British crown.\n\n\u201cFast forward to today. What do we have? You\u2019ve got ISIS. They\u2019ve got the wrong philosophy, but they\u2019re willing to die for it while we are busily giving away every belief and every value for the sake of political correctness. We have to change that.\u201d\n\nCarson seemed to understand that his comments would generate media attention, adding that it would be \u201cridiculous\u201d to accuse him of comparing ISIS to the early American patriots \u2014 though that is manifestly what he did do.\n\n\u201cNow I recognize that there\u2019s press here and some of the press will say, \u2018Carson said that ISIS is the same as the United States,'\u201d Ben Carson said. \u201cThey are just so ridiculous, so ridiculous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson, the Republican 2016 presidential hopeful, spoke fondly of ISIS for not bending to \"political correctness,\" setting an example for the United States.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Ben Carson, the Republican 2016 presidential hopeful, spoke fondly of ISIS for not bending to \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d setting an example for the United States.", "title": "Ben Carson Praises ISIS, Like U.S. Founding Fathers \u2018Willing To Die For What They Believe\u2019", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1759364/ben-carson-isis/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ben-Carson-ISIS.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-15T19:53:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-15T20:03:53+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ben-Carson-ISIS.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-01-15T19:53:24+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "ben carson,isis,2016 presidential campaign,american revolution,republican national committee.,u.s. founding fathers,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ben-Carson-ISIS.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ben Carson, the Republican 2016 presidential hopeful, spoke fondly of ISIS for not bending to \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d setting an example for the United States."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNow I recognize that there\u2019s press here and some of the press will say, \u2018Carson said that ISIS is the same as the United States,'\u201d Ben Carson said.\n\u201cThey are just so ridiculous, so ridiculous.\u201d\nThey\u2019ve got the wrong philosophy, but they\u2019re willing to die for it while we are busily giving away every belief and every value for the sake of political correctness.\n\u201cA bunch of rag tag militiamen defeated the most powerful and professional military force on the planet.\nBecause they believed in what they were doing,\u201d said Carson, in a reference to the early American colonists who rebelled against rule by the British crown."}
