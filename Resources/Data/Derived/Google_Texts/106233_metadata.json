Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), a champion of their party\u2019s liberal wing, argues that Obama is mistaken in gleefully claiming credit for the recovery. She says the Democrats\u2019 focus must remain on disillusioned middle-class Americans who have been left behind by the recovery. \u201cDespite these cheery numbers, America\u2019s middle class is in deep trouble,\u201d she said in a speech to an AFL-CIO conference in Washington.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) insists she\u2019s not a candidate for president in 2016, but she is increasingly speaking out on liberal causes and may eventually eclipse President Obama in shaping their party\u2019s campaign message going forward.\n\nThe tensions within the party reflect sharp differences in tactics and emphasis. After years of relentless economic bad news and criticism of his stewardship, Obama seems determined to claim credit for a vastly improving economy that is the envy of European and Asian leaders.\n\nYet from a purely tactical standpoint heading into the 2016 presidential campaign season, Warren appears to be making the more salient political argument. The ticket to a political recovery in two years is to hammer away at the need to make the financially struggling middle class feel secure.\n\nPolitical experts have offered varying explanations for why the Republicans crushed the Democrats in the November mid-term election \u2013 from widespread dissatisfaction with Obama\u2019s policies to frustration over partisan gridlock on Capitol Hill to a decision by many Hispanics to protest the president\u2019s delay in acting on immigration reform by sitting out the election.\n\nRelated: The 6 Power Players Who Will Shape the 2015 Political Agenda\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a moment of great anxiety as a nation,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said this week in analyzing the outcome of the election. \u201cThe people we represent have lost faith in their government. They no longer trust Washington to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nHowever, a new study issued by the Pew Research Center on Thursday offers another intriguing explanation for why the Democrats did so poorly at the polls: that many lower income or \u201cfinancially insecure\u201d Americans who were inclined to vote Democratic simply opted out of the political system and left the Democrats hanging high and dry.\n\nThese \u201cfinancially insecure\u201d non-voters include many middle class Americans that Warren invokes in practically every speech she gives now. By contrast, wealthier or more financially secure people who historically have supported Republican candidates turned out in much larger numbers and helped the GOP sweep to victory.\n\n\u201cFinancial security is strongly correlated with nearly every measure of political engagement,\u201d the study found. Last fall, for instance, about 94 percent of financially secure Americans said they were registered to vote, while only little more than half of the least financially secure were registered.\n\nThe financially troubled group makes up about 20 percent of the general public and 15 percent of registered voters, compared with the most financially secure who represent a quarter of the general public and 33 percent of registered voters, according to Pew data.\n\nWhile the 2014 voting records are not yet fully available to researchers, pre-election estimates suggest that 63 percent of the most financially secure were \u201clikely voters\u201d last November, compared with just 20 percent of the least financially secure, according to the report.\n\nRelated: The \u2018Draft Elizabeth Warren\u2019 Effort Gets $1M Boost\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of votes left on the table\u201d by the Democrats, noted Scott Keeter, Pew\u2019s Director of Survey Research, in an interview yesterday. \u201cThe alternative universe is that the election could have looked very different if those people had all showed up to vote.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly news that the Democrats failed miserably at turning out its base in the November mid-term election after Obama racked up huge, historic presidential election victories in 2008 and 20012.\n\nThe turnout in the November election was the lowest in more than seven decades. In 43 states, less than half the eligible population bothered to vote, according to The New York Times and no state broke 60 percent. Overall, the national turnout was a dismal 36.3 percent.\n\nDemocrats paid heavily as Republicans regained control of the Senate for the first time in eight years and expanded their majority in the House. A large share of the blame went to Democratic lawmakers and an unpopular president who failed to rally traditional elements of the party \u2013 including struggling middle-class black, Hispanic and white voters.\n\nThings could be different next time depending on the presidential matchup. Yet even a candidate as formidable as former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton may have trouble breaking through the lethargy or indifference of disgruntled middle class Democrats who have lived with wage stagnation for years.\n\nRelated: Tackling Wage Stagnation May Be Out of Reach for Now\n\nThe Pew study was based on data gathered from a nationally representative panel of 3,154 adults, who were surveyed on line and by mail between September and early October. In defining the \u201cleast financially secure Americans,\u201d the study used metrics well beyond income.\n\nThis group is predominantly female, non-white, single and with limited educations. Many of them have little understanding of politics. And some have health conditions that restrict their movement and can even keep them from the voting booth. Only about seven percent of them have a college degree, compared to nearly half for the most the most financially secure.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats would have won the November election by a gigantic margin if all of those people had actually showed up to vote,\u201d Keeter said. \u201cI think both parties need to think about this group \u2013 to the extent the Republicans might want to up their success among not just white voters but all voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis analysis suggests that a good message to the middle class could potentially yield you a lot of votes,\u201d he added.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Obama administration and liberal Democrats appear at odds these days over how best to characterize \u2013 and capitalize \u2013 on the economic recovery.
