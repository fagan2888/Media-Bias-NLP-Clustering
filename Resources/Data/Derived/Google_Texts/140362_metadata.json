(AP) \u2014 Despite the downturn in energy prices, Wyoming remains strong and must invest in infrastructure projects and accept federal funds to expand Medicaid to keep moving forward, Gov. Matt Mead told lawmakers in his state of the state address Monday.\n\nMead, a Republican in his second term, said it\u2019s important to respect the budget recommendations of the Legislature\u2019s Joint Appropriations Committee, which is calling for across-the-board cuts to nearly all state agencies over the next two years.\n\nHowever, Mead said he stands behind his own recommended budget that calls for taking roughly $450 million more from the state\u2019s $1.8 billion \u201crainy day fund\u201d to avoid cutting government services.\n\nHe proposed refilling the fund over the coming two-year budget cycle by reducing the flow of state mineral revenue into permanent savings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that the people we are here to serve will accept the tough reductions that are needed,\u201d Mead said in his 51-minute address in Cheyenne. \u201cThey will be less accepting about the loss of senior programs or a sewer system in their town while we continue to build up the largest relative rainy day fund in the country as if it is not raining.\u201d\n\nThe current two-year state general fund budget is about $3.5 billion.\n\nMead also hammered on the need to accept federal funds to expand the Medicaid program, a move that would offer health insurance coverage to some 20,000 low-income adults in the state.\n\nExpanding the program is a key element of the federal Affordable Care Act, which congressional Republicans have tried unsuccessfully to repeal in recent years.\n\nRelated: Wyoming lawmakers facing falling revenues in budget session\n\nMany Wyoming lawmakers say they don\u2019t trust federal promises to keep funding the program. The Joint Appropriations Committee has voted against expansion.\n\nMead opposed the Affordable Care Act in his first term in office and steered Wyoming into a multi-state legal challenge that led to the U.S. Supreme Court upholding most of the law.\n\nIn recent years, however, Mead has emphasized that Wyoming can\u2019t afford to turn its back on available federal funding only to see it go to other states.\n\nIn addition to providing health care, Mead said accepting federal Medicaid funds would help Wyoming hospitals avoid getting stuck providing uncompensated care and would inject hundreds of millions of dollars into the state economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to Wyoming to leave these problems unaddressed \u2014 to suggest the solution is going to be a new administration in D.C. that will fix it all,\u201d Mead said. \u201cFrom where I sit, it could get worse, depending on who the next president is.\u201d\n\nMead also said he will fight for the state\u2019s beleaguered coal industry.\n\n\u201cWyoming is, and will proudly remain, the energy producer for the rest of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful thing.\u201d\n\nMany major coal companies are in financial trouble and some with mines in Wyoming\u2019s Powder River Basin have declared bankruptcy. The federal government, meanwhile, recently announced a moratorium on new coal leases.\n\nState financial analysts recently warned that state revenue from federal coal leases are likely to fall from nearly $740 million in the two-year state funding cycle that covered 2013-14 to just $26 million in 2019-2020.\n\nWyoming has used federal coal lease bonus payments to fund school construction.\n\nMead told lawmakers the disappearance of federal coal lease bonus payments is one of the biggest financial challenges facing the state. The Legislature will have to address how to cover some $600 million in school construction expenses that until recently was covered by coal revenues.\n\nHouse Minority Floor Leader Rep. Mary Throne, D-Cheyenne, said she and other Democrats agree with many of Mead\u2019s points.\n\n\u201cWe appreciated his strong message on Medicaid expansion, and also on emphasizing the need to prioritize people over buildings,\u201d Throne said.\n\nRepublicans in the Legislature outnumber Democrats 77-to-13.\n\nHouse Speaker Kermit Brown, R-Laramie, said Mead has some differences with lawmakers on budget issues.\n\n\u201cBut as he said in his message, which I absolutely agree with, we\u2019re all focused on the same thing, which is what\u2019s best for the people of the state of Wyoming, and we\u2019ll get it worked out,\u201d Brown said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CHEYENNE, Wyo.
