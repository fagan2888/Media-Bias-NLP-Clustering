Now there\u2019s an intersection of the two: 53 percent of Americans and 56 percent of sports fans say \u201cthat God rewards athletes who have faith with good health and success on the playing field.\u201d So says a new survey gauging public sentiment about sports and religion conducted by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute and the Religion News Service.\n\nTwo-thirds of Catholics (65 percent) and minority Protestants (68 percent) agree with the idea, along with 60 percent of white evangelical Protestants and 49 percent of white mainline Protestants, the poll found. Four-in-10 of the respondents overall disagree.\n\nAt the same time, roughly one-quarter of Americans and fans alike say that \u201cGod plays a role in determining which team wins a game,\u201d the poll noted.\n\n\u201cMinority Protestants (45 percent) are more likely than any other religious group to believe that God plays a role in determining which team wins a sporting event. More than 3-in-10 white evangelical Protestants (32 percent) and Catholics (31 percent) believe that God plays a role. Only about 1-in-5 (19 percent) white mainline Protestants and 9 percent of the religiously unaffiliated believe God has a hand in the outcome of sporting events,\u201d the poll stated.\n\nAnd what about that proverbial day of rest?\n\n\u201cOn any given Sunday, 25 percent of Americans say they are more likely to be in church than watching football, while 18 percent say the opposite - that they are more likely to watching football than to be in church. One-quarter of Americans say that on any given Sunday they are likely to be doing both, while 32 percent say are not likely to be doing either,\u201d the poll stated.\n\nThe wide ranging survey of 1,012 U.S. adults - which also addressed domestic violence among players and discrimination - was conducted Jan. 14-18.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sunday is often associated with both church and devoted football watching.
