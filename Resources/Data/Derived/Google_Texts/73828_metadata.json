We will now take an indignation ride through the facts of a civil complaint the American Civil Liberties Union recently filed, the latest to test a provision in the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to equip female workers with a clean, private space in which to express milk.\n\nKaty Waldman Katy Waldman is Slate\u2019s words correspondent.\n\nWhen the ACA went into effect on March 23, 2010, it amended the nation\u2019s arterial labor law, the FLSA, to set new workplace standards around breastfeeding and lactation. Companies must now offer new mothers \u201creasonable\u201d (unpaid) break time to pump milk. They must also arrange for a \u201cprivate, non-bathroom place,\u201d \u201cshielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public,\u201d in which the milk can be pumped, up until a year after the employee has given birth. Furthermore, employers are forbidden to \u201cretaliate\u201d against workers who complain about their bosses\u2019 lack of compliance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut following weeks of alleged harassment and discrimination, Bobbi Bockoras, a six-year employee at Saint Gobain Verallia, a glass-bottling factory in Alleghany, Pa., found herself seated on a dirty floor, surrounded by dead bugs, pump in hand. When she had first requested a space to express milk for her infant daughter, Lyla, she\u2019d been directed to the bathroom. She\u2019d protested, and the plant had upgraded her to the first-aid room, where she was allegedly heckled by male coworkers shouting and pounding on the door. Her next option was a room with glass walls and no lock on the entrance. Then a shower room. Finally, Bockoras writes on the ACLU\u2019s blog,\n\nI eventually agreed to use an old locker room, even though it was filthy, because at least it had a lock on the door \u2013 and they said they'd clean it up. But when I showed up to pump there a few days later, I found that the room had not been cleaned\u2026the floor was unfinished and had large patches missing from it, and there was no air conditioning \u2013 which is serious, because temperatures can get up to 106 degrees on the factory floor. The only furniture in the room was a single chair. I was completely disgusted, but what could I do? I only had a short break before I had to be back on my shift, and my baby has to eat, so I pumped there anyway. Even though I complained that it was filthy, the company did not have it cleaned. To make matters worse, shortly after that, someone took the chair from the room, which is how I found myself pumping on the floor, with dead bugs for company.\n\nWhen Bockoras continued to complain, the company issued a heartfelt apology, offered her two weeks paid vacation, and resolved to start abiding by federal labor laws. Oops! No, they didn\u2019t: According to Bockoras, they switched the new mother from her day shift to a rotating schedule of nights and early mornings, refused to explain why, ignored a note from her doctor saying she should keep more regular hours, and proceeded to tell her that she would experience harassment \u201cregardless of what shift I was on.\u201d It didn\u2019t help that some jokesters allegedly covered the doorknob to her lactation cell with grease and metal shards. \u201cThey've never identified the culprits and no steps were taken to train my colleagues to prevent further harassment,\u201d Bockoras writes. After 10 weeks in this abyss of nursing humiliation, the new mom\u2019s ability to produce breast milk began to suffer, and she had to start feeding her daughter formula. That was when she began to pursue legal recourse, reaching out to the ACLU, the Women\u2019s Law Project, and the firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, which is now working on the case pro bono.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Employer Allegedly Makes Breast-Feeding Mother Pump on the Floor, Surrounded by Dead Bugs", "sailthru.author": "Katy Waldman", "description": "Put on your outrage caps, everyone.
