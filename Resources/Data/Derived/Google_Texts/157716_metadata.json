Since then, research has moved diagnostics and treatment forward. Today, scientists know of some 100 autoimmune diseases \u2014 many unknown at the release of its first edition \u2014 affecting a total of 50 million Americans, of which 75 percent are women.\n\n\u201cThis book, which contains more than a decade of new research, is for those women \u2014 and their families,\u201d AARDA, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary, wrote in a press release.\n\nThe book sorts out signs that may be important in what is often perceived as vague and unrelated symptoms, and teaches women how to handle doctors who tell them their disease is \u201call in their heads.\u201d Women can also learn what diagnostics are available and how to interpret results, and the book provides an extensive overview of available and anticipated treatment options. It even goes into the particulars of how to find a specialist and navigate the Affordable Care Act\u2019s healthcare system.\n\n\u201cBecause autoimmunity is a major women\u2019s health issue, it is a major \u2018family\u2019 issue,\u201d said Virginia T. Ladd, founder and executive director of AARDA. \u201cAutoimmune diseases represent the third largest cause of chronic illness among women in the U.S. and are among the top 10 leading causes of death among American women age 65 and younger. Yet, even as new research and groundbreaking biological treatments have changed outcomes for AD patients, too many physicians are still quick to dismiss women\u2019s symptoms as something that is all in their heads.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe updated version of this book will serve to educate women about an important area affecting their health, well-being and families, empower them to become their own advocates and to learn more about their own family history of AD, especially when family members can be affected by seemingly different diseases which may not even be recognized as autoimmune \u2013 but are.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy collecting patient diagnoses, clinical data, and perhaps results of laboratory and imaging studies, along with key demographics, this \u2018big data\u2019 endeavor will facilitate the sharing of information among medical experts and researchers, advance understanding of ADs and hopefully lead to better treatments and a cure for these closely linked illnesses,\u201d said Noel R.
