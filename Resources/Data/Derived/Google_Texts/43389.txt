He told host John Catsimatidis that the House plans to go “on offense on ideas” to show how the country will be different with a Republican in the White House.

“We’re going to roll out of the house this spring, going on offense on ideas and saying to the country, ‘Here is what we can do to fix America’s big problems if you give us a Republican president to work with in 2017. This is why we think this gridlock and divided government we have isn’t working and we need the American people to break this tie, settle this thing, this broken government. Washington isn’t working, isn’t listening. Give us the ability to put this agenda in place, and that’s what we want to take to the country this spring and talk about it all summer and all fall long.'”
