He chats with Emmylou Harris as she picks at her grapefruit, revealing his easygoing nature and their comfort with each other.\n\nBut more than having similar personalities, it\u2019s evident they share the same sense of values.\n\nFriends for almost four decades, it wasn\u2019t until a few years ago that they recorded an album together. That one turned out pretty well \u2014 \u201cOld Yellow Moon\u201d won the Grammy for best Americana album. It included some covers and a few songs penned by Crowell.\n\nThat experience was so positive they decided to step it up on the recently released \u201cThe Traveling Kind\u201d by co-writing seven of the album\u2019s 11 songs. Now they\u2019re off touring the United States and Europe to promote it.\n\n\u201cI would certainly say the writing process was fun. On \u2018Old Yellow Moon,\u2019 we didn\u2019t do any writing together,\u201d Crowell said.\n\nHarris agreed, adding that from her perspective, their fruitful collaboration derives from what she describes as Crowell\u2019s \u201cRodney-ness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no tension,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never even had an argument.\u201d\n\nCrowell added: \u201cI guess you might say there\u2019s no ego because our relationship is based on friendship.\u201d\n\nWhile Crowell penned a few of the songs on their first album and he and Harris co-wrote a majority on the new one, he doesn\u2019t feel like you have to write a song to give a piece of yourself to the music. It\u2019s something he feels Harris does very well.\n\nHe cites an artist that both have a connection with to prove his point.\n\n\u201cJohnny Cash and Emmy are similar in a way. People ask me and I say Emmy has a poet\u2019s soul, so when she records outside material, as John did, there\u2019s a poetic sensibility,\u201d Crowell said.\n\nHarris was influenced by Cash at an early age and was one of the artists who appeared on the recent cover album, \u201cLook Again to the Wind: Johnny Cash\u2019s Bitter Tears Revisited.\u201d Originally released in 1964, that album provided strong commentary about the U.S. government\u2019s mistreatment of Native Americans. She remembers buying \u201cBitter Tears\u201d when it came out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell together again for new album", "title": "Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell together again for new album", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell together again for new album", "title": "Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell together again for new album", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/emmylou_harris_rodney_crowell_together_again_for_new_album/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/emmylou-harris-and-rodney-crowell-portrait-session.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell together again for new album", "title": "Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell together again for new album", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/emmylou-harris-and-rodney-crowell-portrait-session.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Carucci", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He chats with Emmylou Harris as she picks at her grapefruit, revealing his easygoing nature and their comfort with each other.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Even though the server got his order wrong, Rodney Crowell waits patiently for his egg-white omelet.\nFriends for almost four decades, it wasn\u2019t until a few years ago that they recorded an album together.\nThat one turned out pretty well \u2014 \u201cOld Yellow Moon\u201d won the Grammy for best Americana album.\nOn \u2018Old Yellow Moon,\u2019 we didn\u2019t do any writing together,\u201d Crowell said."}
