Officials say a Texas woman has been charged after her 2-year-old daughter suffered burns and witnesses said she told them she'd put the child in the oven.

The Somervell County Sheriff's Office said in a news release that deputies were called late Thursday to a home because a child had burns. The sheriff's office says witnesses told deputies upon arrival that 35-year-old Tasha Shontell Hatcher said she'd put her child in the oven.

Hatcher was charged with injury to a child with serious bodily injury and arraigned Saturday. Bond was set at $300,000. It wasn't immediately known whether Hatcher has a lawyer.

Texas Child Protective Services spokeswoman Marissa Gonzales says the child has been taken into their custody and will be placed in foster care when released from the hospital.
