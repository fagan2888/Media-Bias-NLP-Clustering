Ian Dishon Davis Isabel, the Davenport man accused of planting video cameras in the girlsâ€™ restroom at a Davenport elementary school, has been arrested according to the United States Department of Justice.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Isabel was taken into custody in Adams County, Illinois on April 11, 2014. United States Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, Nicholas A. Klinefeldt, says he will remain in custody pending a federal court appearance.

Jail records showed Isabel was in the Rock Island County Jail Monday morning, April 14, 2014. Authorities there said Isabel was released to the custody of federal authorities that same day.

Isabel made an initial appearance in federal court in Illinois, where he waived his preliminary and detention hearings, according to First Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin VanderSchel. That's when Isabel was turned over to the U.S. Marshal Service to await a court appearance in federal court in Iowa. That appearance was set for Wednesday, April 16.

Jail records showed Isabel was held in the Scott County Jail late Monday afternoon, April 14.

"The federal complaint is merely a charging instrument," said a spokesperson from the U.S. Department of Justice. "Isabel is presumed innocent until proven guilty."

The case is being prosecuted by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Iowa and the arrest was the result of a joint effort between the United States Secret Service, the United States Secret Service Cyber-Security Task Force, and the Davenport Police Department, the Adams County Sheriff's Office, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, and the United States Marshals Central Illinois Task Force.
