The exercises incorporate elements of Indian culture.\n\nMaria McCoy raised her arms in a moving exercise at a talking circle run by healer Donna LaChapelle at the Minnesota Indian Women\u2019s Center in Minneapolis.\n\nThe duo recently completed two years of training with the esteemed Center for Mind-Body Medicine in Washington, D.C., and are now among the first Indian healers in the country certified by the center.\n\n\u201cOur dream,\u201d La Chapelle said, \u201cis to take this to all of our communities. If we have enough Indian people trained, the movement can begin.\u201d This movement would spread the healing power of mind-body medicine throughout the Indian populace.\n\nBut first they must plant seeds.\n\nThey are getting help through the Minnesota Indian Women\u2019s Resource Center, which recently was awarded one of 12 inaugural seed grants from the George Family Foundation to introduce integrative medicine practices to communities that haven\u2019t had access before.\n\nThe $25,000 grant to the center will be used to host Indian gatherings on mind-body medicine and support training for elders and spiritual teachers.\n\nThe philosophy of mind-body medicine \u2014 that our thoughts and emotions have an impact on our physical health \u2014 is a natural fit with traditional Indian beliefs that healing the mind and spirit will help heal the body.\n\nBreathing, movement and social support are used in many Indian ceremonies, said Suzanne Koepplinger, director of the Catalyst Initiative, the grant program. \u201cMind-body medicine is not that far afield,\u201d she said.\n\nEagle Speaker, whose traditional Indian name is Holy Medicine Shining Woman, comes from a long line of herbalists. She works with homeless women and with girls who have been trafficked for sex to help them deal with the trauma they\u2019ve experienced.\n\nBoth she and La Chapelle also help their Indian clients heal from \u201chistorical trauma\u201d wounds \u2014 depression, chemical dependency and other issues resulting from the loss of Indian population, land and culture over generations.\n\nThree years ago, La Chapelle found herself searching for new tools to help her people.\n\n\u201cI knew something was missing,\u201d she said. \u201cI wondered, \u2018How do you heal?\u2019 The universe responded.\u201d\n\nShe met Dr. Kathleen Farah, a family physician with Children\u2019s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota who specializes in integrative medicine.\n\nFarah demonstrated the methods to La Chapelle and Eagle Speaker and encouraged them to apply for additional training through the Center for Mind-Body Medicine.\n\nThe center has used the techniques in many settings to help people heal from traumatic experiences. One notable case involves treating children living in Gaza and Israel traumatized by war using the same exercises that La Chapelle and Eagle Speaker are using in their group sessions.\n\n\u201cThe model is to train people to go into their communities and work with groups. They do simple meditation, simple guided imagery, etc. \u2014 all of which helps the brain heal from trauma,\u201d Farah explained.\n\nAlready, word is starting to spread across the Indian community about the benefits of mind-body medicine, the women said. Eagle Speaker was invited to visit the Leech Lake reservation during its recent annual youth conference to talk about the techniques.\n\nNelda Goodman held an eagle feather as part of a talking circle.\n\n\u201cPart of it is just beginning that healing process for our people,\u201d Eagle Speaker said. \u201cIf we can heal 10 people, there are other generations coming up after them.\u201d\n\nBack at the Minnesota Indian Women\u2019s Resource Center, the circle of women gathered burned sage and passed an eagle feather as each one took turns \u201cchecking in\u201d about their thoughts and emotions. At the end, they practiced \u201cshaking,\u201d a mind-body method of relieving stress by moving the whole body.\n\nThey laughed as they shook their arms and legs, danced to music, and came back to the circle once again to bid farewell for the night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s holding that sacred space for people because we all need to share,\u201d said La Chapelle. \u201cPeople have a lot of stories \u2014 and maybe even a lot of heartache \u2014 that they haven\u2019t been able to release.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The women sat in a circle &mdash; their eyes closed and their ears tuned into the soothing voice of Donna La Chapelle.", "title": "Elders treat ills with mind-body medicine, native healing traditions", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/a-pair-of-indian-elders-integrate-mind-body-medicine-with-native-healing-traditions-for-better-health/310149071/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143535060755930.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143535060755930.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The women sat in a circle &mdash; their eyes closed and their ears tuned into the soothing voice of Donna La Chapelle.", "title": "Elders treat ills with mind-body medicine, native healing traditions", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/a-pair-of-indian-elders-integrate-mind-body-medicine-with-native-healing-traditions-for-better-health/310149071/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143535060755930.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143535060755930.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The women sat in a circle &mdash; their eyes closed and their ears tuned into the soothing voice of Donna La Chapelle."}, "article_summary": "If we have enough Indian people trained, the movement can begin.\u201d This movement would spread the healing power of mind-body medicine throughout the Indian populace.\n\u201cSoft,\u201d she coached, as the handful of mostly American Indian women in their 60s inhaled through their noses.\nFarah demonstrated the methods to La Chapelle and Eagle Speaker and encouraged them to apply for additional training through the Center for Mind-Body Medicine.\nAlready, word is starting to spread across the Indian community about the benefits of mind-body medicine, the women said.\nThe $25,000 grant to the center will be used to host Indian gatherings on mind-body medicine and support training for elders and spiritual teachers."}
