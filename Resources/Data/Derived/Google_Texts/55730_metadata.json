But many fund managers say the Fed\u2019s plan to increase rates could be postponed by heightened uncertainty about the global economy, spurred by turmoil in China\u2019s stock market and a renewed selloff in commodities.\n\nUltralow interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis have stoked a rally in the $12.7 trillion market for U.S. government bonds and other credit markets. Many investors are concerned that the start of a tightening cycle will send bond prices lower and yields higher. Higher rates make interest rates on existing bonds relatively unattractive.\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has fallen in July after posting the biggest quarterly rise in two years last quarter. The yield rose slightly to 2.252% late Tuesday as global stocks stabilized following a selloff. It was down from 2.48% made on June 26, which was the highest closing level since September. Yields fall as prices rise.\n\nHelping to drive yields lower are investors shifting expectations to a December rate increase. A flare-up of the Greek debt crisis, jitters about China and concern about what softening commodities markets mean for global growth also whetted investors\u2019 appetite for haven Treasurys.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion it is too soon to signal a hike,\u201d said Jim Caron, global fixed-income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, with $406 billion in assets under management at the end of March. \u201cThe risk is the Fed hikes prematurely and hurts the economy. Why not wait until December? What\u2019s the harm?\u201d\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury is a benchmark against which long-term rates for consumers and businesses are set. Foreign governments and firms use the 10-year yield to price their dollar-denominated bond sales.\n\nMany investors and interest-rate strategists say that the current bout of growth worries could prompt the Fed to stick to its script: The central bank is on track to raise rates this year but the timing of the first rate increase hinges on how the U.S. economy performs.\n\n\u201cThe odds are roughly 50/50 that they will raise rates in September, though the chances appear to be falling, not rising,\u201d said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income at Raymond James in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nFed-funds futures, used by investors and traders to place bets on central-bank policy, showed Tuesday that investors and traders see a 19% likelihood of a rate increase at the September Fed meeting, according to data from the CME Group. The odds for December were 54%.\n\nSome analysts say accelerating U.S. growth supports the case for a departure from crisis-era stimulus measures soon. Any signal from the Fed in its Wednesday statement that it was leaning toward \u201cliftoff\u201d in September could send bond yields higher, these analysts said. A post-Fed meeting press conference isn\u2019t scheduled.\n\n\u201cI would put very high odds on a September move, as I believe that Fed officials have finally recognized that they have long overstayed their welcome at zero and are eager to begin the normalization process,\u2019\u2019 said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. \u201cYellen made the point in her recent Congressional testimony that starting sooner will give the Fed a better chance to be able to execute normalization at the gradual pace that she would prefer.\u201d\n\nEconomists expect data later this week to show that the U.S. economy grew at an annualized 2.7% rate in the second quarter, rebounding from a 0.2% contraction in the first quarter.\n\nThe Fed \u201cis likely going through the process of assessing the potential impact of a slowdown in China to the U.S. economy,\u201d said Sean Simko, head of fixed-income management at SEI Investments which has $258 billion assets under management.\n\nIn the meantime, lower commodities prices are hurting countries relying on raw-materials exports and reducing U.S. inflation expectations. A higher dollar driven by the prospect of the Fed\u2019s higher interest rates hurts U.S. exports and reduces prices of imported goods.\n\nMany investors have been long prepared for the Fed\u2019s pending shift. They have been migrating away from shorter-dated Treasurys whose yields are pinned by the Fed\u2019s short-term policy rate. Known as the fed funds rate, the Fed has held it near zero since December 2008.\n\nThe yield on the two-year note was 0.670% Tuesday, close to 0.733% from June 10, the highest closing level in 2015.\n\nInvestors say the preference for longer-dated bonds reflect some concerns that even a modest rate increase by the Fed may restrict the U.S. economic growth and keep a lid on inflation.\n\n\u201cYellen has said, \u2018Everybody wake up, we are going to move this year,\u2019 but the Fed doesn\u2019t want to choke off growth,\u201d said Donald Ellenberger, head of multisector strategies at Federated Investors Inc., which had $355.8 billion in assets under management as of March 31.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Many bond investors are skeptical that the Federal Reserve will clearly signal a September rate increase at the conclusion of the central bank\u2019s policy meeting on Wednesday.", "title": "September Rate Increase?
