The death rate for whites aged 45 to 54 declined by about 1.8 percent annually from 1983 to 1998, but it increased by 0.6 percent annually from 1999 to 2014. While an increase in drug overdoses and suicides accounts for part of the reversal, progress on reducing deaths from such causes as heart disease and cancer appears to be stagnating for white adults in the 21st century, according to an analysis from the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that advocates for greater health-care access.\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing a regression that has little precedent in the industrialized world over the past half-century,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nThe report builds on a startling paper from Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton that got a lot of attention late last year. They found that since 1999, death rates among middle-aged whites in the U.S. reversed a decades-long decline, driven by drug overdoses, suicides, and diseases linked to alcohol. Case and Deaton, a Nobel Prize winner, reported the biggest jumps in mortality among the lowest-educated whites. The trend wasn\u2019t evident in other rich countries or other racial groups in the U.S.\n\nSince the end of World War II, most of the developed world has recorded steady improvements in mortality. Advances in public health, new medical treatments, and expanded access to health insurance help people live longer. Behavioral changes such as declining smoking rates also play a role. These add up to about a 2 percent annual drop in death rates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the historical norm for a long time,\u201d said David Squires, co-author of the Commonwealth Fund report.\n\nWhites in the United States have historically had lower mortality rates than blacks. That continues to be the case by a large margin. But while mortality for black adults continues to decline across age groups, that\u2019s not the case for whites. (Hispanics have lower death rates than both whites or blacks in the U.S., despite generally lower socioeconomic status, a demographic phenomenon known as the Hispanic paradox.)\n\nThe reasons behind white Americans\u2019 mortality backslide aren\u2019t clear. \"We need to understand why this is happening,\u201d said David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund and co-author of the report. He and Squires hypothesize that the health declines mirror economic and social dislocation. Middle-aged whites in 2014 were more likely to be poor and less likely to be married than they were in 2002. Until 2014, when provisions of the Affordable Care Act took effect, they were more likely to be uninsured, too.\n\nWhile the trend is national, it\u2019s most pronounced in some Southern states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and West Virginia. They\u2019re the areas of the country with the weakest health systems, according to indicators compiled by the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nNan Astone, a researcher at the Urban Institute, observed last year that the death rates for white women from 15 to 54 had increased since 1999. While there isn't clear evidence, she posited that economic forces may play a role. \u201cFor working class people, wages have been stagnant for years now,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of difficulty with globalization, frankly.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "John Tozzi", "twitter": {"description": "Whites of all ages are dying earlier than historical trends would have predicted.", "title": "Death Rate Improvements for Whites Have Stalled", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-29/death-rate-improvements-for-whites-have-stalled", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iIcx02EDpBZ0/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "John Tozzi", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health", "news_keywords": "Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-29/death-rate-improvements-for-whites-have-stalled", "parsely-title": "Death Rate Improvements for Whites Have Stalled", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-01-29T05:01:03.691Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Whites of all ages are dying earlier than historical trends would have predicted.", "parsely-tags": "Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2016-01-29T05:01:03.691Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Whites of all ages are dying earlier than historical trends would have predicted.", "title": "Death Rate Improvements for Whites Have Stalled", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-29/death-rate-improvements-for-whites-have-stalled", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iIcx02EDpBZ0/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Whites of all ages are dying earlier than historical trends would have predicted."}, "parsely-post-id": "O1P79R6JTSEM01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iIcx02EDpBZ0/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "(Hispanics have lower death rates than both whites or blacks in the U.S., despite generally lower socioeconomic status, a demographic phenomenon known as the Hispanic paradox.)\nThe health gains that continue to drive down death rates in most of the developed world have stalled for white Americans.\nThey found that since 1999, death rates among middle-aged whites in the U.S. reversed a decades-long decline, driven by drug overdoses, suicides, and diseases linked to alcohol.\nThese add up to about a 2 percent annual drop in death rates.\nWhites in the United States have historically had lower mortality rates than blacks."}
