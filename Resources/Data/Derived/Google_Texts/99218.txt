LEADVILLE, Colo. -- Police are looking for a college student who disappeared from Colorado Mountain College in Leadville last week.

Colton Wilson, 19, was last seen Thursday.

The Lake County Sheriff's Office said they're not treating his disappearance as a suicide and they do not suspect any foul play.

He may have been seen during the weekend in Frisco.

But the last picture of Wilson shows him leaving his dorm at the campus of 300 students in his pajama bottoms in the middle of afternoon.
