(See related graphic).\n\nThe 12-month composite score of 63.7 for overall M&A is significantly lower than the three-month score of 70.5, a sign that the momentum of 2014 and the first half of 2015 may slow down soon. But sentiment about TMT is the reverse.\n\nThe 12-month TMT composite score of 85.3 is higher than the 79.9 three-month outlook. Among the six high-growth sectors featured in the MMP, the two considered most likely to withstand a downturn are health care and TMT, according to our survey participants.\n\nThe MMP is a forward-looking sentiment indicator derived from monthly surveys of approximately 250 executives published in partnership with McGladrey LLP. Previous sector forecasts include manufacturing, health care, energy, consumer goods and retail and financial services.\n\nVarious tech companies have been acquisition targets recently.
