But it would also eliminate the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, and its $465 million allocated for this year. And it would include specific provisions to defund \u201cObamacare,\u201d according to a statement released by the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe funding is \u201ctargeted to proven program with the most national benefit,\u201d according to Rep. Hal Rogers, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.\n\n\u201cThis legislation continues our efforts to reduce wasteful spending, to stop harmful and unnecessary regulations that kill jobs and impede growth, and to make wise investments in proven programs on behalf of the American taxpayer,\u201d said Rogers.\n\nDespite the overall increase in funding, the AHRQ elimination provision has drawn some serious opposition.\n\n\u201cWithout AHRQ we wouldn\u2019t know one baby (is) born every 25 minutes with drug withdrawal \u2013 a $1.5 billion problem,\u201d said Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist at Vanderbilt University, via Twitter.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let the politics of no destroy the science of why and how,\u201d said the University of Utah\u2019s Department of Biomedical Informatics, in another tweet.\n\nRep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.) proposed a reinstatement of the AHRQ funding on Wednesday at the Labor and Health and Human Services House subcommittee meeting, she said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to wipe out this unique and vital agency,\u201d the congresswoman said. \u201cNo other HHS agency shares AHRQ\u2019s mission: AHRQ is our only federal agency focused on researching and sharing evidence-based information that can be used to increase the quality and safety of American health services, and make our health care more accessible, equitable, and cost-efficient. AHRQ\u2019s funding represents only 0.01 percent of all health care spending, but this small investment has huge returns for the American people, promoting better health outcomes and practices that make us healthier and improve the quality of care we receive.\u201d\n\nHouse legislators also attempted to eliminate the AHRQ three years ago, but failed.\n\nThe bill is expected to go to a full committee vote next week, when the Senate version is expected to be released.\n\nThe new funding controversy follows the battle over the American Competes Reauthorization Act, which House members touted as improving science \u2013 amid widespread opposition from the scientific community.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Drug Discovery & Development", "description": "The National Institutes of Health would get an additional $1.1 billion in next year\u2019s budget, while eliminating a popular agency, according to a House appropriations bill released this week.", "title": "NIH Funding to Increase $1.1 B \u2013 But Popular Agency is Eliminated", "url": "http://www.dddmag.com/news/2015/06/nih-funding-increase-11-b-%E2%80%93-popular-agency-eliminated", "image": "http://www.dddmag.com/sites/dddmag.com/files/061915_NIH.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "drug; discovery; development; National Institutes of Health; NIH; budget", "abstract": "The National Institutes of Health would get an additional $1.1 billion in next year\u2019s budget, while eliminating a popular agency, according to a House appropriations bill released this week.
