It\u2019s an inscrutable piece of machinery about three feet tall, with four jutting steel arms and a yellow smiley face affixed to the front. As Snyder, tieless in a blue shirt and blazer, takes the stage in an Italian restaurant's faux-ornate banquet room, he makes no mention of the object. Nor do the two supporters he\u2019s sharing the stage with, Snyder\u2019s lieutenant governor and a tourism official. I begin to wonder if it\u2019s an errant piece of cooking equipment or a furnace component that\u2019s escaped the boiler room. Finally, after more than 10 minutes of reciting his education and jobs plans, Snyder points to the thing. \u201cThe Forest Hills Comets\u2014there\u2019s their robot!\u201d Snyder says, to polite applause. It belongs to a local school's robotics team. Michigan, Snyder boasts, is leading the country in robotics jobs.\n\nSnyder, I later learned, is frequently in the company of robots. He marched in a Labor Day parade with a robot. He personally emceed a recent national robotics competition in Ypsilanti. When he signed the state\u2019s last budget bill, in June, a robot brought him the pen. You might think this was a campaign ploy to make Snyder, a 56-year-old former computer-company executive, look lively by comparison. It may not be that, but it does seem to be an attempt to rekindle the fading brand\u2014\"One Tough Nerd\u201d\u2014that launched Snyder in politics four years ago. As his first term draws to a close, Snyder insists he\u2019s still the pragmatic, numbers-focused moderate Republican he campaigned as in his first, unlikely run for office in 2010. But his critics charge the slogan\u2014unveiled in a Super Bowl ad that propelled him through a crowded primary\u2014has proven to be a sham. Rather than steering the state in nonpartisan fashion toward economic stability, Snyder, they charge, has proven instead to be a hardheaded ideologue whose trickle-down policies have not produced results. \u201cHe campaigned as a bean counter. He said he was going to focus on jobs,\u201d Snyder\u2019s Democratic opponent, Mark Schauer, told me in an interview. \u201cOur current governor\u2019s policies work for the wealthy, but they\u2019re not working for most Michiganders.\u201d Despite such complaints, Snyder was initially widely expected to sail to a second term against Schauer, a little-known former congressman. (No Michigan governor has been denied a second term since 1962.) But Schauer and his allies have waged an aggressive campaign, attacking Snyder for cutting school funding (a charge he denies) and taxing seniors\u2019 pensions. The result is what looks to be a tight race. Most recent polling has shown Snyder leading, but there are exceptions, like a YouGov survey earlier this month that had Schauer ahead by 2 points. Overall, Snyder leads by an average of 3.5 points\u2014a far tighter margin than his commanding 18-point victory four years ago. \u201cHe campaigned as a nerd, and he didn\u2019t seem very threatening,\u201d Susan Demas, editor and publisher of the Inside Michigan Politics newsletter, told me. Snyder\u2019s persona isn\u2019t polarizing like Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker or Pennsylvania\u2019s Tom Corbett, and he seemed to fit with Michigan\u2019s long tradition of moderate Republican governors such as George Romney, William Milliken, and John Engler. Instead, Demas said, \u201cHe\u2019s governed very far to the right. A lot of the moderates, the independents, the conservative Democrats that gave him that big margin in 2010 have been scared off.\u201d\n\nSnyder was slow to respond to Schauer\u2019s early advertising blitz, prompting concern among Republicans that he didn\u2019t seem to be taking the race seriously. As recently as a few weeks ago, party elders publicly complained about his reluctance to engage; they feared Snyder was surrounded by yes-men who didn't comprehend the political threat. In late September, Republican consultant Dan Pero, a former gubernatorial chief of staff, wrote on Facebook, \u201cI must say the Schauer campaign is running one of the most message disciplined campaigns I\u2019ve seen .... Hope our counterattack begins soon.\u201d Days after that message, Snyder began airing an ad featuring a teacher defending his school-funding increases, \u201cin spite of what you\u2019ve heard.\u201d Related Story Did Republicans Blow the Michigan Senate Race? Pete Hoekstra, a former Republican congressman who sought the gubernatorial nomination in 2010 and lost to Snyder, told me he\u2019d been surprised by the closeness of the race, which he attributed to Snyder\u2019s low-key style. \u201cThis is a guy who doesn\u2019t go around and tout his political accomplishments all the time,\u201d Hoekstra said. \u201cHe\u2019s spent more time managing the state than managing his personal political success\u2014that\u2019s just the way Rick is.\u201d But Hoekstra said he believed the polling trend was turning in Snyder\u2019s favor, and he foresaw a strong victory. Another Snyder ally told me that the governor would outspend Schauer 2-to-1 in the coming weeks, an onslaught Schauer would be helpless to combat. When I asked Snyder about the campaign, he insisted he wasn\u2019t taking anything for granted. \u201cYou had special interests coming into Michigan spending $1 million a week lying about my record,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re responding.\u201d Still, his campaign is not particularly intense. At the town hall in Grand Rapids, the questions were notably friendly, attendees having been screened to keep out Democratic staffers and liberal activists. Three of the questioners identified themselves as Republican staffers or volunteers; their queries were variations on, \u201cWhy are you so great?\u201d Another questioner wanted to know what books Snyder was reading. Snyder disclosed that, \u201cbeing a good nerd,\u201d he goes for history and biography and tends to read more than one book at a time.\n\nThe \"nerd\" act had worked for a while. To liberals, the moment Snyder \u201cripped off the mask,\u201d as one put it to me, was in December 2012, when he signed the right-to-work legislation passed by the state legislature. Snyder had previously said he wasn\u2019t interested in such a measure, which he called \u201cdivisive.\u201d But he said the unions, who had pushed a failed ballot initiative to enshrine collective bargaining in the state constitution, started the fight\u2014despite his urging them not to\u2014and forced him to take a side. I told him that made it sound like he was justifying right-to-work as revenge on the unions. Snyder denied it, characteristically: \u201cI don\u2019t do revenge. I don\u2019t fight with people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey created the environment that was divisive.\u201d The measure hasn't had the far-reaching effects either side predicted. Union membership hasn't plummeted as labor feared, but nor have jobs suddenly blossomed\u2014the state's unemployment rate of 7.4 percent is sixth-worst in the nation. A less charitable view of the right-to-work episode is that Snyder got steamrolled by conservatives in the legislature and caved to their demands. Some people see this as a pattern. Snyder\u2019s proclaimed indifference on social issues has allowed the conservative faction of the legislature\u2019s Republican majority to dominate, enacting restrictions on abortion and a ban on domestic-partner benefits for government workers. Another abortion bill passed over Snyder\u2019s veto. For nearly two years, Snyder has been trying to pass a massive package of road-improvement funds, funded in part by doubling the gas tax, but he\u2019s been stymied by some legislators\u2019 hostility to tax hikes. Snyder told me he hoped to make the roads package a priority in the legislature's post-election lame-duck session. But Democrats are worried he will get it through by making a trade with Republicans who are pushing a plan to allocate Michigan\u2019s electoral votes by congressional district\u2014a proposal that would have handed most of the state\u2019s votes to Mitt Romney in 2012. Snyder has refused to take the possibility off the table. And while he has encouraged legislators to consider an employment-nondiscrimination measure for gays and lesbians, he has not taken a position on the issue himself.\n\nTo me, Snyder insisted that the picture his opponents paint of him doesn\u2019t tell the full story. \u201cThe majority of bills I signed into law had broad bipartisan support from both parties,\u201d he said. Snyder pointed to his work to raise the minimum wage, accept the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid-expansion funds, and bring Detroit out of bankruptcy through a combination of public funds, private loans, and pension cuts. \u201cI don\u2019t use a partisan lens, I don\u2019t use a political lens when I make my decisions,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to do the right thing and treat people with civility and make things better, and that\u2019s a model that\u2019s worked well and shows results in Michigan.\u201d In many ways, the arc of Snyder\u2019s term has mirrored that of Colorado\u2019s Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper\u2014a businessman-turned-politician who sought to forge a middle path by avoiding hot-button issues and forging bipartisan agreements. Like Snyder, Hickenlooper's own party has forced him to take sides on divisive issues, tarnishing his nonideological brand. And Hickenlooper, too, now finds himself endangered after voters stopped believing his common-sense shtick and started blaming him for all the elements of his split-the-difference compromises they didn\u2019t like. In both cases, the man who once convinced voters he could rise above politics has ended up, instead, with everyone mad at him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have a change,\u201d Cassandra Brown, a 64-year-old retired Detroit teacher, told me. Her former colleagues, she said, have seen their classes get bigger and been forced to spend their own money on classroom supplies under Snyder\u2019s budgets. \u201cA lot of working people have been affected by all this.\u201d The race has shaped up as purely a referendum on Snyder and his policies, both sides acknowledge. There has been little focus on Schauer, a former state senator and one-term member of Congress. After losing his House seat in 2010, Schauer took a job with the laborer\u2019s union, and he was pepper-sprayed in the protests over right-to-work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michigan Republican Rick Snyder finds himself in an unexpectedly tough reelection campaign thanks to a backlash against his economic policies.", "author": "Molly Ball", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Michigan Republican Rick Snyder finds himself in an unexpectedly tough reelection campaign thanks to a backlash against his economic policies.", "title": "Michigan's Rick Snyder: From 'One Tough Nerd' to Embattled Governor", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/10/RTX13OQF/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/10/from-one-tough-nerd-to-embattled-governor/381453/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/mollyball"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Snyder told me he hoped to make the roads package a priority in the legislature's post-election lame-duck session.\nMichigan, Snyder boasts, is leading the country in robotics jobs.\n(No Michigan governor has been denied a second term since 1962.)\nHe said he was going to focus on jobs,\u201d Snyder\u2019s Democratic opponent, Mark Schauer, told me in an interview.\nAnother Snyder ally told me that the governor would outspend Schauer 2-to-1 in the coming weeks, an onslaught Schauer would be helpless to combat."}
