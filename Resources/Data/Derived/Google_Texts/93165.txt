You're personally paying more for health services. But good luck trying to shop around for a better deal.

A new analysis finds that Americans with health insurance through their employers paid almost 7 percent more for out-of-pocket medical costs in 2013 compared to 2012â€”rising from an average of $662 per person annually to $707.

The increase comes as more people are enrolled in so-called high-deductible health plans, which require them to directly bear a larger share of health costs.

The same study by the Health Care Cost Institute also looked at what people paid out-of-pocket for services in nine states, and found a wide range of costs.

Some people paid less out-of-pocket for certain services, while others getting the same services in the same state paid significantly more, according to the institute. The study examined variations in costs of five services: new doctor visits, cataract removal, colonoscopies, lower leg MRIs and pregnancy ultrasounds.
