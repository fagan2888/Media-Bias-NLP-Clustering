That\u2019s more than the deficit cut Washington once promised ObamaCare would produce.\n\nFormer Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Holtz-Eakin on Tuesday told members of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on health that ObamaCare would likely result in huge overpayments.\n\nTo make his case, Holtz-Eakin pointed to the Earned Income Tax Credit, a program that works somewhat like ObamaCare in that it hands out refundable tax credits based on income. Despite its relative simplicity and the fact that it has been around for decades, the EITC overpaid $11.6 billion in 2012 \u2014 an error rate of 21%.\n\nThe vast complexity of ObamaCare means an even greater risk of such overpayments.\n\nAfter all, subsidy payments depend on individuals\u2019 claims about future incomes, family size, immigration status and the availability of \u201caffordable\u201d coverage at work. Obama promised that all this would be instantly verified during the application process, but the administration now admits that at least 25% of sign-ups could be either ineligible for any subsidies or are getting the wrong amount.\n\nAnd, since the law restricts the IRS\u2019 ability to \u201cclaw back\u201d any overpayments \u2014 and caps how much must be repaid \u2014 many of those who get too-big subsidies are likely to simply ignore the government\u2019s request to have that money back.\n\nHoltz-Eakin calculates that if the same 21% error rate applies to ObamaCare subsidies, it will mean $152 billion in overpayments in a decade. In other words, these overpayments could easily swamp the $120 billion budget savings the CBO said ObamaCare would produce.\n\nThis is, of course, just one way the deficit-cutting claims were phony. As we\u2019ve pointed out in this space many times, the CBO based its estimates on a fantasy in which ObamaCare worked exactly as predicted.\n\nBut the administration has already made vast changes to the law. It delayed the employer mandate, neutered much of the individual mandate, put off cuts to Medicare Advantage, promised bigger insurance industry bailouts and so on. All of these had the effect of raising the net cost of ObamaCare.\n\nPresident Obama has made so many ad hoc changes, in fact, that the CBO finally gave up even pretending it can predict how ObamaCare will affect the deficit.\n\nNow if everyone else would just give up pretending this law can be fixed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Waste: Lawmakers have learned that ObamaCare could end up overpaying insurance subsidies by as much as $152 billion.
