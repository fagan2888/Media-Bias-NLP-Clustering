Boeing Co. said an international buyer who canceled a satellite purchase blamed Ex-Im\u2019s slated demise, and the aerospace manufacturing giant said the bank\u2019s lapse is one of several factors that will force it to lay off employees before the end of this year.\n\nCompany officials said \u201cdue to congressional inaction on Ex-Im reauthorization, Boeing is operating at a significant disadvantage in overseas campaigns against foreign aerospace companies that are supported by their governments\u2019 official export credit agencies.\u201d\n\nBassetts Ice Cream of Philadelphia, a smaller Ex-Im customer, said it will struggle to finance international sales, while Clink Bond Inc., a fastening hardware company, said it will feel the effects of the bank\u2019s breakup \u201cdownstream\u201d as it feeds its parts to companies that rely on the bank, even though it doesn\u2019t contract with Ex-Im itself.\n\nSEE ALSO: Consumers fear online lenders as option if feds squeeze paydays out\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve moved from disbelief to starting to feel a lot of pain,\u201d Linda Dempsey, vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers, said of Ex-Im\u2019s customers.\n\nEstablished in 1934, the bank steps in to finance exports when private lenders are unwilling to extend credit. Its supporters say the bank helps U.S. goods compete in overseas markets, as foreign governments prop up their companies with similar credit agencies.\n\nBut conservative groups sharpened their attacks on Ex-Im after President Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, saying they should target reauthorization bills to phase out government programs they view as wasteful or unnecessary.\n\nConservatives say the bank\u2019s importance in the economy has been oversold, and point to the fact that the sky hasn\u2019t fallen since the June 30 lapse is proof the bank\u2019s customers can get by without it.\n\n\u201cIt is surprising that Boeing is choosing to pursue layoffs when it is reporting increased sales, record-breaking revenue and a backlog of orders that will take seven years to clear,\u201d said Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and a key opponent of the bank.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s no doubt some U.S. companies receive a benefit from Ex-Im, there\u2019s also no doubt Ex-Im hurts other American companies and their workers,\u201d Mr. Hensarling, Texas Republican, said of the standoff over the bank. \u201cWhere is the fairness in giving Washington politicians the power to pick who gets helped and who gets hurt?\u201d\n\nProponents of the bank said it has majority support in both chambers, and want to see Congress revive it as part of a jam-packed September agenda that includes a vote on the Iran nuclear deal and talks to avert a government shutdown.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Ex-Im is being held hostage by an extreme partisan minority,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown, Ohio Democrat and leading champion of the bank. \u201cCongress should continue its bipartisan tradition of reauthorizing Ex-Im now and avoid another self-inflicted economic wound that will threaten jobs and tilt the playing field against U.S. workers, exporters, and manufacturers.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no clear path forward, however. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, opposes the bank and has been content to let it unwind its current business.\n\nSen. Mark Kirk, Illinois Republican, successfully attached the bank to a multiyear highway bill the Senate passed before recess, but that legislation faces an uncertain fate in the House, which is forging its own approach to financing road projects.\n\nA Kirk aide said Friday the senator would support attaching the bank to any other bill it sends to the House, and U.S. manufacturers are searching for cracks of legislative daylight.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different ideas on how to move forward. There\u2019s a lot of challenges as well,\u201d Ms. Dempsey said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all potential legislative vehicles to move this forward as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nBut House Speaker John A. Boehner has agreed to let Mr. Hensarling offer amendments to try to strip out the bank provision if the Senate adds it to any other bills.\n\nAmid the standoff, the bank itself said Friday it hasn\u2019t resorted to layoffs and will continue to manage its $107 billion in outstanding loans and guarantee commitments.\n\n\u201cWe have heard from many of you about the detrimental impact this has had on your business and your workers,\u201d Ex-Im Chairman and President Fred P. Hochberg said in a mid-August letter to bank customers. \u201cOn behalf of everyone here at EXIM Bank, I want to express our hope and determination that current efforts to reauthorize EXIM Bank will succeed once Congress returns in September.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. manufacturers say they're starting to feel the pain from Congress' decision to let the federal Export-Import Bank's charter lapse in June, and are planning to mount a push to revive the obscure, controversial agency when lawmakers return next week.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "U.S. manufacturers say they\u2019re starting to feel the pain from Congress\u2019 decision to let the federal Export-Import Bank\u2019s charter lapse in June, and are planning to mount a push to revive the obscure, controversial agency when lawmakers return next week.", "title": "Manufacturers to push to revive Ex-Im charter", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/7/manufacturers-to-push-to-revive-ex-im-charter/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/03/4338474c7e602c006a0f6a706700d91b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/03/4338474c7e602c006a0f6a706700d91b.jpg", "description": "U.S. manufacturers say they're starting to feel the pain from Congress' decision to let the federal Export-Import Bank's charter lapse in June, and are planning to mount a push to revive the obscure,", "card": "summary", "title": "Manufacturers to push to revive Ex-Im charter"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Business Finance, Congress"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOn behalf of everyone here at EXIM Bank, I want to express our hope and determination that current efforts to reauthorize EXIM Bank will succeed once Congress returns in September.\u201d\nConservatives in Congress say Ex-Im, as the bank is known, is spending billions in \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d to prop up corporations that don\u2019t need the help.\nU.S. manufacturers say they\u2019re starting to feel the pain from Congress\u2018 decision to let the federal Export-Import Bank\u2019s charter lapse in June, and are planning to mount a push to revive the obscure, controversial agency when lawmakers return next week.\n\u201cUnfortunately, Ex-Im is being held hostage by an extreme partisan minority,\u201d said Sen.
