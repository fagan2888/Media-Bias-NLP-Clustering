At turns skeptical, reclusive and territorial, this \u201coddball fraternity\u201d is fixated on acquiring the most impressive collection of 78 r.p.m. records, the often overlooked predecessors to the more familiar vinyl. The resulting book, peppered with portraits of the quirky collectors, is a meditation on \u201cthe rapture of discovery.\u201d\n\nF, by Daniel Kehlmann. Translated by Carol Brown Janeway. (Vintage, $15.95.) At a hypnotist\u2019s mysterious urging, a father abandons his wife and three sons to pursue a writing career.
