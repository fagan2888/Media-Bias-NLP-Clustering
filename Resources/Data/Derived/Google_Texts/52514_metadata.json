U.S. rate and taxpayers are unacceptably exposed by this administration\u2019s blind eye to the UK\u2019s failed offshore wind program. Neither the ocean area the federal government holds in trust for U.S. citizens, nor U.S. citizens themselves, should be exploited by an industry that historically fails to deliver public benefits.\n\nGermany\u2019s flagship BARD Offshore I is a 400MW wind project intended to supply the energy needs of 400,000 households. But Bard Offshore 1 remains out of operation according to industry source Offshore Wind Biz (June 2014) citing: \u201cfrequent technical problems with the converter substation,\u201d \u201ca smoldering fire,\u201d \u201cfailure of the system,\u201d \u201cfive unplanned outages since the beginning of 2014\u201d and \u201ctransmission problems.\u201d\n\nWindPowerOffshore (September 19, 2014) reports the Danish company Vattenfall is going to dismantle the Yttre Stengrund in Swedish waters after only 13 years of operation. \u201cOnly one in (5) turbines is currently operational.\u201d\n\nEurope\u2019s offshore wind energy endeavors reveal the challenges of the harsh and corrosive marine environment. GE deployed the Cape Wind prototype GE 3.6 MW wind turbines at Arklow, the wind farm offshore of Ireland. GE subsequently \u201cdiscontinued\u201d the Cape Wind 3.6 MW wind turbine even while Cape Wind, the wind farm planned for offshore Massachusetts, was under permit review by the DOI. That review advanced Cape Wind as a \u201creliable\u201d energy source.\n\nCape Wind changed specifications to Siemens 3.6 MW during their power purchase contract negotiations with the national grid. But Siemens is not boasting offshore wind success, according to the Wall Street Journal [1/08/14]:\n\n\u201cSiemens, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of offshore wind turbines, and its partners concede they underestimated the challenges behind offshore wind. The financial fallout from these challenges was highlighted on Thursday, when Siemens said it booked \u20ac128 million ($171 million) in new charges related to connecting offshore wind farms to the power grid. It blamed unexpectedly high costs for shipping, installing and starting up grid components.\u201d\n\nA Spiegel International article \u2018Turbine Trouble: Ill Wind Blows for German Offshore Industry\u2019 says, \u201cOperators of offshore wind farms depend on sufficiently high electricity prices to refinance their investments.\u201d This runs contrary to public interest. Citizens need commercially reasonable energy sources that are reliable, while offshore wind energy technology is historically not reliable, yet its price is high.\n\nThe stunning and sobering candor of an executive of the \u201cworld\u2019s largest\u201d manufacturer of wind turbines, Vestas, would be comical if not for the serious context \u2014 billions in public funding along with the sacrifice of the thousands of ocean acres that DOI intends to grant to wind LLCs.\n\nIn 2011, Anders S\u00f8e-Jensen, then president of the offshore division at Vestas said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like buying an old crappy car. It\u2019s starts cheap, but spends most of the time in the workshop costing you a fortune, so you didn\u2019t drive much, and your cost per driven mile is staggeringly high. It\u2019s the same with the cost of energy when you look at capital expense and operating costs with overall production.\u201d\n\nWhile President Obama\u2019s energy goals should be to deploy energy sources that are commercially reasonable, reliable, and reasonably safe, based on the best science, offshore wind has miserably failed to deliver public benefits to Europeans.\n\nU.S. citizens are entitled to a fair return for the use of the nation\u2019s oceanic resources. It\u2019s not too late for President Obama to call off the January 29, 2015 DOI North Atlantic auction that would exclusively serve the interests\u2019 of wind developers.\n\nDurkin is a retired realtor, a small business owner and a resident of central Massachusetts.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Offshore wind has historically failed to deliver public benefits to Europeans.", "description": "Offshore wind has historically failed to deliver public benefits to Europeans.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Offshore wind has historically failed to deliver public benefits to Europeans.", "title": "Offshore wind farms are no public benefit", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/226050-offshore-wind-farms-are-no-public-benefit", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/226050-offshore-wind-farms-are-no-public-benefit", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-06T09:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Barbara Durkin", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-06T09:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/226050-offshore-wind-farms-are-no-public-benefit", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Offshore wind has historically failed to deliver public benefits to Europeans.", "card": "summary", "title": "Offshore wind farms are no public benefit"}, "dcterms.title": "Offshore wind farms are no public benefit"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2aa\"", "article_summary": "But Siemens is not boasting offshore wind success, according to the Wall Street Journal [1/08/14]:\u201cSiemens, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of offshore wind turbines, and its partners concede they underestimated the challenges behind offshore wind.\nGE deployed the Cape Wind prototype GE 3.6 MW wind turbines at Arklow, the wind farm offshore of Ireland.\nU.S. rate and taxpayers are unacceptably exposed by this administration\u2019s blind eye to the UK\u2019s failed offshore wind program.\nADVERTISEMENTUK\u2019s offshore wind energy projects' results should serve as the catalyst for termination by the administration of its proposed ocean auction to wind limited liabilities corporations.\nGE subsequently \u201cdiscontinued\u201d the Cape Wind 3.6 MW wind turbine even while Cape Wind, the wind farm planned for offshore Massachusetts, was under permit review by the DOI."}
