Four people have been injured, two of them critically, in a crash Friday evening on the Kansas Turnpike.

The crash happened around 8:15 p.m. in the southbound lanes at mile marker 101. That's near the Matfield Green service area in Chase County.

The Kansas Turnpike Authority said a Chevy Suburban was illegally stopped in the right lane, forcing a Toyota Prius to stop behind it. A third car, a Ford Fusion, attempted to avoid colliding with the other two vehicles and drove onto the right shoulder. The Fusion was then hit by a fourth vehicle, a 2008 Chevy, which was also avoiding vehicles stopped in the roadway.

The driver of the Fusion, 33-year-old Geralyn Hale-Lashley was hospitalized along with three passengers: 27-year-old Brittanya Byrd, as well as two boys, ages 7 and 10. All are from Wichita.

KVOE reports Hale-Lashely was taken by ambulance to Wesley Medical Center in Wichita, where she is listed in critical condition.

The two boys were flown to hospitals in Wichita and Topeka. Jaydin Lashley, 7, is in critical condition at Wesley Medical Center. Jaron Lashley, 10, is no longer listed as a patient in Topeka.

Reports state the driver of the Toyota Prius suffered "possible" injuries. No one else was hurt.

The crash remains under investigation.
