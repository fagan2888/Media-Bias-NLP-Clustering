In his first campaign ad, 8th Congressional District candidate Warren Davidson pledges to repeal Obamacare and “destroy every ISIS stronghold.”

The businessman from Troy released the advertisement Tuesday on his website, WarrenDavidson.com, and after the typical candidate introduction seen in many initial campaign ads, but he touts his military experience, talking about being a West Point graduate and Army Ranger.

The ad is currently airing on FoxNews.

Davidson is one of three candidates for this office once held by former U.S. Speaker John Boehner who has six figures in their campaign coffers, and is positioning himself as the anti-establishment candidate — a movement being demonstrated in the GOP presidential race with the surge of real estate mogul Donald Trump.

Davidson has been Endorsed by Washington, D.C.-based Club for Growth, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Urbana, and Citizens for Community Values, and his campaign announced Wednesday evening the endorsement of Clark County Commissioner Rick Lohnes.
