Rand Paul on Tuesday officially sued the Obama administration, seeking to stop it from enforcing a federal banking law that has led large numbers of Americans overseas to renounce their citizenship.\n\nIn a move with implications for his 2016 presidential bid, Mr. Paul joined six other plaintiffs in a suit filed by Republicans Overseas Action (ROA), arguing that the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is unconstitutional.\n\nThe lawsuit maintains Mr. Paul has unique standing as a plaintiff since it argues the Obama administration violated the right of himself and other 99 senators to advise and consent on agreements with foreign countries.\n\nSEE ALSO: Brash and belligerent, Donald Trump comes out on top of Republican polls\n\nThe 2010 law, passed by a Democratic Congress, has been a centerpiece of President Obama\u2019s campaign to crack down on wealthy Americans he says have been dodging taxes by hiding their money overseas.\n\nBut it has become enormously controversial, empowering foreign banks to turn over overseas Americans\u2019 private information to foreign governments, who then must turn it over to the Treasury Department.\n\nThe lawsuit argues the agreements the Treasury Department reached with foreign countries to gain access to Americans\u2019 banking information violates the Constitution\u2019s Article II, Section 2 that requires two-thirds of U.S. senators present and voting to approve a foreign treaty.\n\nSEE ALSO: Bob Goodlatte wants answers from Loretta Lynch on Obama drug pardons\n\nThe suit also claims the law has inflicted unprecedented hardship on American expatriates, preventing them from getting banking services overseas and causing many to renounce their citizenship to avoid onerous invasions of their privacy and financial penalties.\n\nThe lawsuit could also have a political impact as the Republican Party tries to recruit the 8.7 million U.S. citizens living and working abroad to back it in next year\u2019s presidential elections. That would be a significant advantage for the GOP\u2019s presidential nominee if enough absentee overseas votes are cast in swing state where small margins make large differences in awarding electoral college votes to Oval Office hopefuls.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit speaks volumes about the Obama administration\u2019s lawlessness and disregard for the Constitution,\u201d said Jim Bopp Jr., lead attorney for the plaintiffs who, collectively, have eight separate constitutional claims against the law and its enforcement mechanisms.\n\nMr. Bopp noted he had only one Constitutional claim in the landmark Citizens United vs. FEC case, for which he was the original architect.\n\nA total of 1,335 Americans renounced their U.S. citizenship during the first three months of 2015, according to figures released by the IRS.\n\nThat suggests U.S. renunciations will hit another new high this year. Last year, 3,415 Americans gave up their citizenship \u2014 15 times more than in 2008.\n\n\u201cAmericans overseas are suffering egregious unconstitutional violations of their privacy and are facing draconian fines by the vigorous enforcement of the law by the Obama administration,\u201d said Mr. Bopp. \u201cThe vast majority of overseas Americans are law-abiding middle class Americans, but the Obama administration treats them all as tax cheats.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want the federal court to stop Obama\u2019s Internal Revenue Service by immediately issuing a preliminary injunction that will protect Americans overseas until a trial can be held by the court.,\u201d Mr. Bopp said.\n\nCritics emphasize the government overreach that they say the law\u2019s efforts to nail tax cheaters represents.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit\u2019s aim is to restore those overseas Americans\u2019 and \u2018green card\u2019 holders\u2019 full citizenship through legal action on constitutional grounds all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said ROA Vice Chairman and CEO Solomon Yue, a 15-year member of the Republican National Committee. \u201cThose Americans have constitutional rights to the pursuit of happiness at home and broad.\u201d\n\nROA notes that a study by Democrats Abroad, the overseas arm of the Democratic National Committee, shows FATCA \u201cwages war against overseas American women and middle-class taxpayers. The ROA lawsuit fights back on behalf of all Americans overseas to guarantee them their full constitutional protections.\u201d\n\nMr. Paul has long opposed FATCA and has introduced a bill to eliminate what he says are its unconstitutional provisions.\n\nHe has said the intent of the law was to \u201cprevent tax evasion by increasing access to overseas bank accounts held by U.S. citizens. However, any law enforcement benefits have been vastly outweighed by the deleterious effects of FATCA on economic growth and the financial privacy of Americans.\u201d\n\nThe problem he said is that FATCA \u201crequires the financial institutions of foreign countries to register directly with the IRS, and to provide financial information on the accounts of U.S. citizens \u2014 regardless of whether or not these U.S. citizens are suspected of tax evasion.\u201d\n\nMr. Paul argued that a \u201cfailure to comply with these requirements subjects that foreign financial institution to a 30 percent withholding of U.S.-derived revenues.\u201d\n\nThis he argues has had the practical effect of forcing those institutions to relinquish any association with U.S. customers \u2014 \u201cand to avoid direct investment in the United States. It goes without saying that overseas investment in the U.S. is an important engine of our economic growth and prosperity. FATCA endangers an estimated $25 trillion in foreign capital currently invested in the U.S.\u201d\n\nWhat may be even more troubling, he said, is that the implementation of FATCA has allowed the Treasury Department \u201cto make independent decisions with respect to the sovereignty of foreign nations and the privacy of United States citizens. In order to implement this law, Treasury has initiated intergovernmental agreements, citing the intent to engage in reciprocal information sharing with other nations.\n\n\u201cBut Treasury, without the consent and authority of Congress, will force U.S. financial institutions to provide the bank account information of private customers to foreign nations,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
