Charity hospitals will lose billions of federal aid beginning late next year, a cut that was supposed to be offset as more residents were covered by Medicaid.\n\nThe combination is a looming \u201cdouble whammy,\u201d said Shawn Gremminger, a lobbyist for America\u2019s Essential Hospitals in Washington, which represents those that care for the poor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not survivable.\u201d Shawn Gremminger\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not survivable,\u201d he said. \u201cHospitals are going to close.\u201d\n\nIn Louisiana, Baton Rouge General\u2019s Mid City hospital was already caught in that vise. It was flooded with the uninsured after a nearby charity hospital was closed. Louisiana provided a one-time injection of funds last year from the federal aid program that\u2019s about to be cut. With that money gone, the hospital is closing the emergency room.\n\n\u201cIt was unsustainable,\u201d said Mark Slyter, the hospital\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nWhile Republican governors in states including Indiana, Ohio and New Jersey have expanded their Medicaid programs under Obamacare, Jindal, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, has remained steadfast in his opposition.\n\nJindal\u2019s Approach\n\nA health-policy expert who began his political ascent as chief of Louisiana\u2019s state hospital system in 1996, Jindal, 43, has said adding to the federal program would put almost half of Louisiana on government assistance. Jindal instead decided to turn management of the state\u2019s charity hospitals over to private operators, a step his administration says has resulted in reduced wait times and better care at a lower cost.\n\n\u201cInstead of expanding Medicaid, we have chosen to improve health care and expand access for all Louisianans by transforming our state-run charity hospital system,\u201d Shannon Bates Dirmann, a spokeswoman for Jindal, said in an e-mail.\n\nIn Baton Rouge, a city of 229,000, about one-fourth of whom live below the poverty line, the emergency room\u2019s closing has been met with protests by residents and lawmakers who say Jindal\u2019s policies are hurting the poor.\n\n\u201cThe governor is putting ideology ahead of the welfare of the state,\u201d said state Representative Alfred Williams, a Democrat from Baton Rouge. \u201cHe has an agenda and it\u2019s to run for president of the United States. And if that causes the people of Louisiana to suffer, then I believe he\u2019s OK with that.\u201d\n\nBuilding Pressure\n\nKathy Kliebert, the secretary of Louisiana\u2019s Department of Health and Hospitals, said Mid City\u2019s financial issues preceded the Medicaid decision and changes to the state hospital system. She said it was undermined by market forces as rival specialty hospitals lured away insured patients.\n\n\u201cMid City has had financial problems for 10 years,\u201d she said.\n\nNationally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 has eased the strain of caring for the uninsured. The law allowed for making Medicaid available to those earning as much as 138 percent of the poverty level, or about $16,200 for an individual. The expense is fully paid by the federal government through 2016 before being phased down to 90 percent.\n\nOpting Out\n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 said it was up to states to decide whether to expand the program, the decisions initially broke down along party lines as Republicans questioned whether the federal government would keep its pledge to pay for it.\n\nTen of 28 states that have since decided to do so were led by Republicans. A new wave of the party\u2019s governors in states including Tennessee, Wyoming and Utah tried to follow this year, though they have been stymied by lawmakers.\n\nBy January, 11.2 million more people were enrolled in Medicaid and its related program for children than during the three months that ended September 2013, before the provision took hold. In states that boosted the scope of Medicaid, uncompensated care costs dropped by $5 billion in 2014, twice as much as in those that didn\u2019t, according to estimates released by the Obama administration.\n\nIn Louisiana, Obamacare would have added 242,000 to the program, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a Menlo Park, California-based nonprofit that tracks health-care policy.\n\nFunding Cuts\n\nNationwide, charity hospitals are set to lose money from a Medicaid fund that partially offsets the cost of treating those who can\u2019t pay.\n\nInitially scheduled to kick in last year, the cuts were delayed by Congress until late 2016. The funding will decline by $35 billion during the following eight years, according to a 2014 analysis by researchers at Georgia State University in Atlanta and Tulane University in New Orleans. It\u2019s not yet known how Louisiana will be affected, said Bates Dirmann, Jindal\u2019s spokesperson.\n\nBaton Rouge General\u2019s Mid City hospital is a harbinger of the effect those reductions will have in states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid.\n\nMid City wasn\u2019t the area\u2019s safety-net hospital. It became one accidentally in 2013, when Jindal closed the nearby Earl K. Long Medical Center, which was part of a network of state teaching hospitals charged with caring for the poor.\n\nWhen the Long hospital closed, Louisiana directed its patients and federal aid money to Our Lady of the Lake, a Catholic hospital in a wealthier, southern part of East Baton Rouge Parish.\n\nShorter Trip\n\nMany of the poor showed up instead at the closer Mid City emergency room, which had to take them under federal law. Jerry Dean Johnson, 64, said Our Lady is at least 13 minutes farther from her home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too far,\u201d said Johnson, a Medicaid patient who has lung disease and has been rushed to Mid City twice in four months. \u201cI think if I had to go way down there I would have died.\u201d\n\nMid City\u2019s uninsured patients rose by 400 a month, a 30 percent jump, said Slyter, its CEO. Psychiatric consultations rose almost 70 percent, also a spillover from the shuttered hospital, he said.\n\nThe state gave Mid City $23 million in one-time emergency funding in 2014 to keep the doors opened.\n\nExpanded Medicaid would have relieved some of pressure on the emergency room, although it wouldn\u2019t have saved an operation that was losing $2 million a month because of the uninsured, Slyter said.\n\n\u201cIt would not have been a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s one of several things that would have helped.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Margaret Newkirk", "description": "The shutdown serves as an early warning for hospitals in states like Louisiana, where Governor Bobby Jindal turned down federal money to expand Medicaid.", "parsely-section": "politics", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "The shutdown serves as an early warning for hospitals in states like Louisiana, where Governor Bobby Jindal turned down federal money to expand Medicaid.", "title": "Baton Rouge Emergency Room Shows the Cost of Obamacare Fight", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-24/baton-rouge-emergency-room-closing-shows-cost-of-obamacare-fight", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iG.hN_IS4rsg/v3/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The shutdown serves as an early warning for hospitals in states like Louisiana, where Governor Bobby Jindal turned down federal money to expand Medicaid.", "title": "Baton Rouge Emergency Room Shows the Cost of Obamacare Fight", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-24/baton-rouge-emergency-room-closing-shows-cost-of-obamacare-fight", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iG.hN_IS4rsg/v3/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"status": "The shutdown serves as an early warning for hospitals in states like Louisiana, where Governor Bobby Jindal turned down federal money to expand Medicaid."}, "parsely-title": "Baton Rouge Emergency Room Shows the Cost of Obamacare Fight", "parsely-tags": "Health,Bobby Jindal,Baton Rouge,Louisiana,Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "NLOAT16TTDT301", "parsely-author": "Margaret Newkirk", "date": "2015-03-24T11:00:00.000Z", "keywords": "Health,Bobby Jindal,Baton Rouge,Louisiana", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Health,Bobby Jindal,Baton Rouge,Louisiana", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-03-24T11:00:00.000Z", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iG.hN_IS4rsg/v3/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-24/baton-rouge-emergency-room-closing-shows-cost-of-obamacare-fight"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbea1\"", "article_summary": "A Baton Rouge hospital is closing the only emergency room on the city\u2019s impoverished north side, a real-world ripple effect of the ideological clash over President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care law.\n\u201cHospitals are going to close.\u201dIn Louisiana, Baton Rouge General\u2019s Mid City hospital was already caught in that vise.\nBaton Rouge General\u2019s Mid City hospital is a harbinger of the effect those reductions will have in states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid.\n\u201cThe governor is putting ideology ahead of the welfare of the state,\u201d said state Representative Alfred Williams, a Democrat from Baton Rouge.\nLouisiana provided a one-time injection of funds last year from the federal aid program that\u2019s about to be cut."}
