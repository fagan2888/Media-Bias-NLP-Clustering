I run these hills. I train on these hills. Nobody\u2019s going to run them better than me.\u201d\n\nThe Dilliner, Pa., resident repeated her women\u2019s marathon title Sunday, crossing the finish line in 2 hours, 34 minutes and 6 seconds for the 26.2 miles, and collapsing into the arms of marathon CEO Patrice Matamoros as she draped an American flag around the two-time champion. Ms. Santucci is only the third woman in race history to win consecutive titles. The most recent was in 2001 and 2002.\n\nKenya\u2019s Stephen Njoroge claimed the men\u2019s title, clocking in at 2:15:19. Pennsylvania native Tyler McCandless was the top American male finisher, placing fourth at 2:18:29.\n\nMs. Santucci accomplished two of her three goals for this race \u2014 she won again and made her family and friends proud \u2014 but fell short of breaking the race record of 2:29:50 set in 1988.\n\nAlthough Ms. Santucci said she thought her training went well enough to suggest that she could set a record, the weather held her back from having a flawless run. The morning temperature was near perfect in the 50s, but the unrelenting sunshine and higher temperatures toward the end of the race sapped her energy.\n\n\u201cIt kind of evaporates all the fluids inside of you,\u201d Ms. Santucci said. \u201cYou just kind of get dehydrated faster out there. I definitely felt it in my legs as the hills were coming on.\u201d\n\nSo it really took all of her reserve just to beat out the second-place finisher, Kenya\u2019s Aliphine Tuliamuk-Bolton \u2014 a training partner of this year\u2019s Boston Marathon winner, Caroline Rotich. Ms. Tuliamuk-Bolton led for nearly the entire race until the last mile, when Ms. Santucci had enough kick to surpass the marathon rookie. Despite a tough last eight miles, Ms. Santucci said she just wanted the win more so that she didn\u2019t disappoint her home-state supporters.\n\n\u201cIt was just go for it, just show her what you got, just give her no hope,\u201d Ms. Santucci said. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty smiley kind person off the course. But on the course, I\u2019m willing to go to the death.\u201d\n\nMs. Tuliamuk-Bolton said it was Ms. Santucci\u2019s experience that helped her push through the fatigue to take the lead. And although the Kenyan said she was disappointed in her finish, she was pleased with her first marathon experience as a whole.\n\n\u201cI loved the course,\u201d she said. \u201cMore importantly, the spectators were amazing. They were cheering like crazy. I really loved that. And I loved the city. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nWith the win, Ms. Santucci earned $13,500 for winning the women\u2019s race and also being the top American finisher and Pennsylvania resident. She also received a bonus for clocking an Olympic qualifying time.\n\nMr. Njoroge placed second in 2013 but outlasted a tight pack of competitors this year to hang on for the win. When the previous race leader, Eritrean Mulue Andom Berhe, dropped out of the race because of an injury with about a half-dozen miles to go, Mr. Njoroge took control.\n\n\u201cI am very happy,\u201d Mr. Njoroge said. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve trained for this marathon since January, and my wish is to come to win.\u201d\n\nBut the second-place finisher, Ethiopian Negash Abebe Duki, said that if the course were just a half-mile longer, he could have caught the champion \u2014 he was less than 25 seconds behind.\n\n\u201cI felt like right at the end I was catching up to him,\u201d Mr. Abebe Duki said in Amharic through an interpreter. \u201cBut the race was almost over.\u201d\n\nKenya\u2019s Kimutai Cheruiyot won the men\u2019s half marathon in 1:03:16, and Kenya\u2019s Susan Jerotich topped the women\u2019s field in 1:13:25.\n\nMegan Ryan: mryan@post-gazette.com, 412-263-1722 and Twitter @theothermegryan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stephen Njoroge finished in 2:15:19, Clara Santucci in 2:34:06.\u00a0Kimutai Cheruiyot won the half in 1:03:16, Susan Jerotich in 1:13:25.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "On a silver chain hanging from Clara Santucci\u2019s neck hangs a pendant engraved with the Pittsburgh skyline and the words, \u201cI run this town.\u201d Because when it comes to the Pittsburgh Marathon, the Greene County resident certainly does run the town \u2014 literally and symbolically. \u201cI was thinking about that on the hills,\u201d Ms. Santucci said. \u201cThese are my hills.
