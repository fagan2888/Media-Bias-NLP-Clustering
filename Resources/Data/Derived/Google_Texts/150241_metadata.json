That is not going to produce a sustainable recovery.\u201d\n\nThe specter of European countries forging ahead with its anti-climate change initiatives while their economies are heading into the tank encapsulates a dilemma that has bedeviled industrialized and emerging economies for years.\n\nEven as they reached this major global warming accord, elements of the agreement were \u201cwatered down\u201d to account for countries like Poland that rely on carbon-heavy coal, and for nations like Britain that were unwilling to embrace new, tough requirements for switching to renewable sources of energy, the New York Times reported.\n\nFears of literally ruining the environment and fueling costly and lethal natural catastrophes by continuing to depend on fossil fuels for much of their energy collide with worries that a carbon tax or other schemes to reduce consumption will drive up energy costs for average people and eliminate many jobs in the industrial and utility sectors.\n\nRelated: The Pros and Cons of Obama\u2019s New Carbon Rule\n\nChris Warren, communications director for the industry backed Institute for Energy Research, argues that proposals for reducing carbon emissions ranging from a cap-and-trade scheme to a consumer tax to tougher Environmental Protection rules for power plant emissions all would hurt the economy and jobs.\n\n\u201cAll of these proposals \u2013 whatever you call them \u2013 will increase electricity rates,\u201d Warren said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no way getting around that. People that are most impacted by that are usually lower-income people or people on fixed income or larger families, because they spend a greater portion of their income on electricity and energy costs in general.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look at the countries whose economies have been growing in recent years \u2013 like China and India \u2013 and they\u2019re burning a lot of coal and a lot of natural gas and oil to get [ahead] just as developed countries in the West have done. They\u2019re not going to risk their economies and the livelihood of their people in the name of reducing C02 emissions.\u201d\n\nBut others strongly disagree.\n\nRelated: India\u2019s Resistance to Climate Change Gives Way to Deal\n\n\u201cThe global climate change is a massive, looming problem that the world has not addressed \u2013 neither the developing world nor the undeveloped world, and we need to commit to reducing emissions over time, clearly,\u201d said Alice Rivlin, a former Clinton-era White House budget director and chief of the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\u201cDrastic action to reduce carbon emissions certainly would [slow economic growth], but gradual actions over time \u2013 things enacted now that take effect over time such as carbon taxes \u2013 would doubtless help no matter how fast the economy recovers,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo reports released earlier this month by Climate Policy Initiative argue that a move to clean-energy, low-carbon government policies to mitigate the impact of global warming could actually provide a boost to the economy. The studies content that that moving to those types of policies could save the global economy trillions of dollars in the next two decades to invest in economic growth.\n\n\u201cFor policymakers around the world wondering whether the transition to a low-carbon economy will help or hurt their countries\u2019 ability to invest for growth, our analysis clearly demonstrates that, for many, the low-carbon transition is a no-brainer,\u201d said Tom Heller, Climate Policy Initiative\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt not only reduces climate risks, its benefits are clear and significant.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Fights Global Warming, One Hot Spot at a Time\n\nThis debate has played out for two decades in Washington, where conservative Republicans and their allies in the business community repeatedly collided with environmental advocates. More often than not, the conservative forces have come out on top, especially during the administration of Republican president George W. Bush, who pulled out of the Kyoto treaty on climate change in 2005, saying it would have \u201cwrecked\u201d the U.S. economy.\n\nPresident Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress tried but failed early in Obama\u2019s first term to pass a cap-and-trade program that would allow industries and businesses to purchase and trade pollution credits while staying within a relatively strict cap on overall carbon emissions.\n\nRelated: Will $50 Million Move the Needle on Climate Change?\n\nObama has taken a series of unilateral steps \u2013 including promulgating EPA rules to cut back on power plant and car emissions \u2013 with no help from Congress. While the idea of cap-and-trade has been dormant for years, Tom Steyer, the billionaire San Francisco financier who is bankrolling a major push for Democratic Senate candidates in the mid-term campaign, is urging lawmakers and governors to get behind a new iteration of cap-and-trade.\n\nEurope for years has been far ahead of the United States and other countries in moving towards a \u201cgreen\u201d economy that is driven more by renewable energy sources than coal and gas \u2013 but with mixed results.\n\nAfter almost a decade of heated political debate, Australia last July became the first developed nation to repeal carbon laws that put a price on greenhouse-gas emissions, according to The Wall Street Journal. Australia's Senate voted 39-32 to repeal a politically divisive carbon emissions price that contributed to the undoing of three Australian leaders since it was first suggested in 2007, The Journal reported.\n\nAustralia has the world's 12th largest economy and is one of the world's largest per capita greenhouse gas emitters because of its reliance on coal-burning power stations. The former Labor government that pioneered the carbon tax argued that the move would cut emissions by 160 million metric tons by 2020.\n\nRelated: Greenhouse Emissions Have Hit a New Record\n\nThe measure offered voters billions of dollars in compensation through tax breaks and welfare payments for increased costs \u201cstemming from one of the most dramatic reforms ever attempted in the energy-reliant economy,\u201d according to The Journal.\n\nAfter the global financial crisis struck in 2008 and a decade-long mining boom ended, the economy slowed and many jobs disappeared. That\u2019s when Australian voters rejected the climate laws and the politicians who supported them.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A decision announced last week by European leaders to slash their countries\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2030 poses a serious dilemma for the 28-nation bloc that signed on.
