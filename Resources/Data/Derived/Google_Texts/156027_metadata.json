Pat McCrory\u2019s administration to acquire the 308-acre property, which is the site of a former psychiatric hospital.\n\nThe city has plans to turn the property into a destination park, and officials have until Dec. 31 to find a way to pay the $52 million price tag for the sale.\n\nJoey Stansbury, a member of the Wake Citizens Coalition, a watchdog group, thinks turning the site into a park is unnecessary.\n\n\ufeff\u201cWe already have a large number of parks scattered throughout the city, and I think people continue to use those,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't think people will invest the time to come down here when they could go to other parks.\u201d\n\nMatt Jones enjoys flying drones on the property.\n\n\ufeff\u201cI'm real happy that they're turning this into a park,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hope that they keep a space where people can do stuff like this.\u201d\n\n\n\nMcCrory, Raleigh Mayor Nancy McFarlane and city officials could not be reached for comment.
