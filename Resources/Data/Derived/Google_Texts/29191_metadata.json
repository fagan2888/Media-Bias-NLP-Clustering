And by \"this\" I mean this extremely lame excuse of a diary that absolves Christie of anything nefarious. The guy is a thug - a mobster. There is NO PLACE in an honest political party for this guy.\n\n---Commenter Alphcon at RedState\n\nAll together now: 1\u20262\u20263\u2026\n\n-\n\nPuppy Pic of the Day: Even dogs hate the damn alarm clock\u2026\n\n-\n\nCHEERS to positive ink. Check out the headlines Republicans are waking up to this morning:\n\n\n\nOn track!\n\n\u2022 Associated Press: \u201cHealth care enrollment spikes in Utah in December\u201d\n\n\u2022 Detroit News: \u201cFeds: Michigan experiences 11-fold increase in health care sign-ups\u201d\n\n\u2022 Sun-Sentinel: \u201cObamacare enrollment gains traction in Florida\u201d\n\n\u2022 Stevens Point Journal: \u201cObamacare enrollment soars in Wisconsin\u201d\n\n\u2022 Albuquerque Business First: \u201cNew Mexico\u2019s Healthcare.gov enrollment soars\u201d\n\n\u2022 WSFA: \u201cMore Alabamians signing up for health insurance\u201d\n\n\u2022 Capital New York: \u201cStrong Obamacare numbers from NY exchange director\u201d\n\n\u2022 Des Moines Register: \u201c7,500 Iowans have signed up for private insurance on healthcare.gov, compared to 757 a month ago\u201d\n\n\u2022 The Gazette: \u201cColorado health insurance enrollments continue at steady pace\u201d\n\n\u2022 WLTX: \u201cHealth Insurance Enrollment Spikes in South Carolina\u201d\n\n\u2022 Billings Gazette: \u201cMontana sign-ups for Obamacare policies surge in December\n\n\"Happy Drink Tickle Time!\"\n\nNumbers are soaring everywhere: six million signups through the exchanges or Medicaid expansion so far, and that doesn't include the last two-and-a-half weeks. At this rate the ACA will hit its March goal easily, and effectively torch the basket Republicans have put all their campaign rhetoric in. I haven't signed up yet, but I probably will soon. I'm waiting for God to give me a sign. Specifically: \"Enroll Now, Get Free Mouse Pad!\" What can I say...I'm a sucker for cheap freebies.to the sake-fication of America. Heckuva job, right-wingers. While you pinheads were obsessed with your certainty that Obama was going to \"take away 'r gerns,\" Japan was busy takin' away our Jim Beam. Yes, it's true, they bought the company, so get used to it . The new company, Suntory, says that beyond renaming Maker's Mark \"Hello Happy Princess Kentucky Tummy Tickle Drinky Time,\" they have no plans to change a thing.\n\nJEERS to Governor Payback. I can't keep up with all the charges---snubbed mayors, back-stabbings, financial misdeeds, revenge, incompetence---being slapped to the hull of the S.S. I'm Not A Bully. So let this be your proverbial picture worth a thousand words:\n\n\n\nAnd guess what falls in our lap this afternoon at 3? Why, Governor Christie's state of the state address . We hear he plans to deliver it from a bus in case he need to throw anyone under it at the last minute.\n\nCHEERS to stopping with all the shooting and the banging and the bayoneting and whatnot. 230 years ago today, on January 14, 1784, Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris, officially ending the War of Independence. It also included earmarks for a pantaloon museum, a giant biodome for the study of butterfly flatulence, and a bridge to nowhere. Say this for Congress---they learned quickly.\n\n\n\nGutsy students.\n\nto the legacy of Franklin McCain. He was one of the young men who stood up for their civil rights in February, 1960 by sitting down at a \"whites only\" Woolworth lunch counter and demanding to be treated equally. By July the store changed its policy and McCain could sit down and eat Woolworth lunch counter food to his heart's content. McCain passed away at 73 last week. Doctors say his heart stopped due to the lingering effects of eating Woolworth's lunch counter food.\n\nCHEERS to a somewhat enduring career in animation. Unreal---anyone born in 1987 or later has never known life without The Simpsons. After spending a couple seasons as \"shorts\" on The Tracey Ullman Show, Homer & Co. began their regular run as a half-hour show---with the full title sequence---on Fox on this date in 1990. For the most part, it's as sharp as ever, and they apparently have no plans to quit anytime soon. Today in the C&J cafeteria:\n\n\n\n\u2026and keep 'em comin'.\n\n-\n\nFive years ago in C&J: January 14, 2009\n\nCHEERS to Hillary Clinton. She aced her confirmation hearing yesterday and there's zero suspense about whether or not she'll be confirmed as Secretary of State. And get this: she says the Obama administration wants to sit down with people we don\u2019t necessarily like and do something radical: talk about stuff. It's just crazy enough to work.\n\n-\n\nAnd just one more\u2026\n\n\n\nNO labels, No Labels?\n\nNot even this label?\n\n-\n\nto smoke where there ain't never gonna be fire. No Labels 2.0 launched one year ago today with a BIG HAPPY MEETING in New York . The goal of the organization, of course, is to bring liberals and conservatives together in a happy circle of Kum By Yah'ness. But there remain a couple niggling issues: first, the head of the group, Republican Mark McKinnon, was previously in tight with the destructive George W. Bush administration, and the No Labels co-chairs are Republican Jon Huntsman from red state Utah and Republican senator with a \"D\" after his name Joe Manchin, from red state West Virginia. And second, the group's goal is to bring the left and right together to solve what's paralyzing Congress\u2026which is. Pardon my mixed metaphor, but by not recognizing the really nasty and vindictive elephant in the room, they're just putting lipstick on a pig. Sorry, guys, but your assertion that \"both sides are guilty\" is faulty from the get-go. So, one year later, my label for the new No Labels remains the same: no sale.\n\nI hereby label this day \"Tuesday!\" Have a good'un. Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about today?\n\n-\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE\u2026\n\nToday's Republican Politician Horoscopes\n\nAries A good day to pretend you care about deficits.
