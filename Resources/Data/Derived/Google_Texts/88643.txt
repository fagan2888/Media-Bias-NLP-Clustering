A Hudson County attorney who just won a big case against Hoboken raised questions about whether Mayor Dawn Zimmer’s infamous diary is legit in an interview on Fox News this week.

Attorney Louis Zayas, who represented former Hoboken public safety director Angel Alicea in a wrongful termination suit last year, told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly on Wednesday that Zimmer said in her deposition, and later on the witness stand, that she didn’t keep any kind of journal to document city business.

“I find it curious that now she’s alleging that she had some sort of journal,

Zimmer’s diary is at the heart of her allegations that Gov. Chris Christie’s administration threatened to withhold Hurricane Sandy relief funds from Hoboken unless Zimmer supported a politically connected real-estate deal in the city’s north end.

To prove her case, Zimmer has produced diary entries she said she wrote in May 2013 that include this about Christie: “I thought he was honest. I thought he was moral. I thought he was something very different.”

Yesterday it was revealed the city of Hoboken has received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office regarding Mayor Dawn Zimmer’s allegations against top officials in Gov. Chris Christie’s administration.

“The City of Hoboken has received a subpoena for documents and is fully cooperating,” Zimmer spokesman Juan Melli told the Star-Ledger.

Christie has denied all of Zimmer’s allegations, and Thursday Hoboken spokesman Juan Melli told the Star-Ledger that Zayas’ claims are baseless.

On her show Wednesday night, Kelly noted that while Zimmer has appeared on CNN and MSNBC, she has not sat down with Fox News.

“The mayor’s a woman we have tried to speak with repeatedly.” Kelly said.
