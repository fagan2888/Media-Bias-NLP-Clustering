This is happening at a time when force is being used in Egypt -- and elsewhere in the Middle East -- against the Muslim Brotherhood, the Salafis, terrorists and their sympathizers. This is a time when Islamists have few places to go to in the wide-open desert atmosphere of the Middle East, except perhaps to join the mess in Syria and Iraq, or otherwise reform and become ordinary citizens.\n\nObama could not have picked a worse time to ease immigration requirements for those linked to terror, and who have nowhere else to go and have suddenly found themselves, after the counter-revolution in Egypt, as targets for imprisonment, contempt, or even shooting.\n\nIslamists are now undoubtedly celebrating Obama\u2019s decision to ease the pressure on immigration of terror-linked individuals. Indeed, where else can they go to practice their fanaticism and find newly found respectability and hospitality? To America.\n\nBy weakening immigration laws that protect Americans from Islamic terror, Obama is now sending the wrong message both to his own citizens and to the Muslim world. He is basically saying that he does not mind taking in fleeing terrorists and their sympathizers. And he does not seem to care at all about appearances or if he this casts more suspicion on his reputation, despite the constant rumors we all know about, that he is a secret Muslim and that his brother Malik has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nWhat is also strange is the US State Department is not welcoming fleeing Christians in the Middle East as they should. Most of the visa applications submitted by the desperate and oppressed Egyptian Christians are denied. It was reported that only about 800 to 900 applications were approved by the US for Christian Egyptian immigrants out of 20,000 applications.\n\nThis also comes amidst accusations and rumors in Egypt that President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are aiding terrorists and conspiring with the Muslim Brotherhood. One would think that the US would be happy that the Egyptian government and others are clamping down on radical Muslim groups who are ruining the lives of the ordinary citizens in the Middle East. But instead, the Obama administration changes immigration laws for their \u201ceyes only\u201d to welcome escaping Muslim troublemakers whose activities are now unwelcome in Egypt.\n\nObama is doing this not only amidst claims that he is supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, but he also appears to the Muslim world as responding positively to the radical Sunni Cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who recently called on the US government to wage jihad for Allah, to help support the \u201cfreedom fighters,\u201d meaning terrorists, in Syria, and adding that \u201cAllah willing, your [US] aid will increase.\u201d This is the first time in history that a radical Muslim leader publicly asks America to join in the jihad for the sake of Allah.\n\nThis is also the same administration that revoked the asylum visa already granted to a German Christian family by a Memphis immigration judge. Obama\u2019s Department of Justice is forcing the deportation of a peaceful Christian German family that seeks refuge in the US to home-school their children. It is the same administration that is allowing the illegal immigrant relatives of Obama to live in US public housing and that granted Obama\u2019s Kenyan brother a 501c3 non-profit status within 30 days of his application, while patriotic Tea Party citizens have not received theirs yet after a three and four year wait.\n\nReverse discrimination is being practiced in the open by the Obama administration against Christians, whites and other patriotic citizens like Dinesh D\u2019Souza and the Tea Party.\n\nTo the savvy analyst of Muslim culture, Obama\u2019s immigration policy is clearly supporting the Islamic jihad agenda and helping to transplant jihadists' activities in a new unsuspecting land. It is aiding the spread of the \"Religion of Peace\u201d propaganda in our public schools and making the questioning of Muslims taboo even for our homeland security. This administration is creating a new generation of Americans that is being indoctrinated at a similar level of indoctrination that is occurring to Arab kids in the Islamic Middle East. All the while, the Islamists to claim their supposed victim-hood as an excuse for their belligerence and dominance. And they use and abuse US fears of being called racist or Islamophobic every time an American objects to Islam as oppressive. This way they can build mosques everywhere, including on the ruins of 9/11, while churches are being destroyed in the Middle East.\n\nOne can't help but marvel at how easy America has capitulated after only one major terror attack.\n\nThe reckless and dire situation regarding Islamic immigration and penetration -- and putting certain foreign interests ahead of American citizens -- has really gotten out of hand. Most sane-minded Americans are frozen, defeated and helpless. America, with Obama\u2019s blessings, is slipping away and surrendering to the Islamic invasion. And if anyone objects, they are called the \u201cR\u201d word: Racist.\n\nIn whose best interest is Obama working for? Not even the liberals should celebrate this. While pacifying the radical left with the failed Obamacare and other environment and energy projects, the president keeps them busy defending him against the big bad Republicans. What need does the US meet when it welcomes in those who had some connections with terror groups? Who is America pandering to or targeting to give asylum to? Why gamble with the safety, security and peace of American citizens to that extent?\n\nIf this situation continues, the American people will wake up one day with Muslim-only zones across the US, women and gays harassed and persecuted in every US city that will be prone Chechnya-style terrorism and calls for a separatist movement. This is the history of Islam repeating itself wherever it goes.\n\nIt is time for a Tahrir \u2018freedom\u2019 square movement in America against the progressives who put Obama in office.\n\n*\n\nDon't miss Jamie Glazov's video interview with Walid Shoebat, who sheds disturbing light on the Obama administration's Islamist odyssey, the terror links of Obama's brother, Malik Obama, The Case for Islamophobia, and much, much more:\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.\n\nTo sign up for The Glazov Gang: Click here.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "The president eases immigration requirements for those linked to terror.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "The president eases immigration requirements for those linked to terror.", "title": "Jihad Migrating to Red States -- With Obama\u2019s Blessing", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/218340/jihad-migrating-red-states-obamas-blessing-nonie-darwish", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:40:00-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/218340/jihad-migrating-red-states-obamas-blessing-nonie-darwish", "description": "The president eases immigration requirements for those linked to terror.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jihad Migrating to Red States -- With Obama\u2019s Blessing"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-09T19:31:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:40:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca06f\"", "article_summary": "What is also strange is the US State Department is not welcoming fleeing Christians in the Middle East as they should.\nThis way they can build mosques everywhere, including on the ruins of 9/11, while churches are being destroyed in the Middle East.\nTo the savvy analyst of Muslim culture, Obama\u2019s immigration policy is clearly supporting the Islamic jihad agenda and helping to transplant jihadists' activities in a new unsuspecting land.\nThis administration is creating a new generation of Americans that is being indoctrinated at a similar level of indoctrination that is occurring to Arab kids in the Islamic Middle East.\nBy weakening immigration laws that protect Americans from Islamic terror, Obama is now sending the wrong message both to his own citizens and to the Muslim world."}
