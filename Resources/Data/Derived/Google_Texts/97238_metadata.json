Chapters on environmental and labor standards are sure to get a lot of attention, but there is one chapter in particular that should be of concern to those concerned with innovation and freedom of expression: the chapter on intellectual property.\n\nIn recent years, the intellectual property (IP) system has been twisted beyond its original intention. Instead of providing incentives for creators, it is now a tool of media conglomerates to shut down competition and capture monopoly profits almost indefinitely. The current copyright term has been extended to the life of the author plus 70 years. Does anyone seriously believe that creative works would suddenly dry up if authors could only collect royalties for 50 years after their deaths? The continued extensions of these terms don\u2019t help creators, they help the Walt Disney Company keep Mickey Mouse from slipping into the public domain well after the iconic rodent\u2019s 80th birthday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe result of all this is actually the stifling of innovation, where a lack of clarity over long-dead rights holders has a chilling effect on creators afraid of inviting lawsuits, and the ability to build on previous discoveries remains limited.\n\nThe IP chapter of TPP should be dismaying to would-be reformers, because instead of reining in the kudzu-like growth of America\u2019s intellectual property system, the deal would export many of our worst laws to countries that can afford them even less than we can. Here are a few examples:\n\nExtended Patent Lengths\n\nApart from codifying the \u201c70 years after the life of the creator\u201d copyright term for other countries, the plan also calls for extended patent lengths to compensate for regulatory review time. This mainly applies to pharmaceuticals that routinely undergo lengthy delays before being allowed to market.\n\nWhile the problem of regulatory review periods is correctly diagnosed here, the solution goes in the wrong direction. We should be trying to minimize review periods rather than extending patent durations. The former results in medicine being cheaper and more readily available, the latter does the opposite. This is especially crucial in some of the partner countries where lack of access to medicine is a much more serious problem than in the United States.\n\nPatents on New Uses of Existing Products\n\nAnother provision that keeps drug prices higher for longer allows new patents on existing products that have been only slightly tweaked. This allows companies to protect their products from competition indefinitely by making small adjustments every few years, a process known as \u201cevergreening.\u201d This is not a reward for genuine innovation, but a way to protect monopoly profits in perpetuity.\n\nPresumptive Copyrights\n\nAmong the many legal stipulations in the trade deal is the presumption that a copyright exists unless it can be proven otherwise. This tilts the balance of court cases in favor of plaintiffs and will make nuisance suits easier and more profitable. It also disincentivizes content creators, who will be increasingly fearful of inadvertently infringing on a presumed copyright. This is made especially scary by the deal\u2019s insistence on....\n\nCriminal Penalties\n\nIntellectual property violations have traditionally been handled as a civil matter, where the demonstration of harm could result in infringers having to pay damages. This deal calls for criminal proceedings and criminal penalties, including jail time, for copyright violations. This is presumably supposed to serve a deterrent, but surely there are better uses for our already overcrowded prisons than to clog them up with kids who downloaded a Metallica song or uploaded a TV clip to Youtube.\n\nCivil Asset Forfeiture\n\nCivil asset forfeiture is an insidious procedure that allows law enforcement to take property that is suspected of being involved in a crime. There\u2019s no due process, and it only takes a suspicion for you to be robbed of your property. Once that happens, the odds of getting it back are long, to say the least, and even if you are willing to fight it, the legal costs can be overwhelming. The TPP allows civil asset forfeiture for property suspected of violating IP law.\n\nSuspension of Imports and Exports\n\nA similar provision allows government authorities to suspend imports and exports of anything suspected of violating IP laws. This seems especially counterproductive given that the whole point of the agreement is to promote more free trade. This provision could easily be abused, and allows the blocking of trade for political purposes with little recourse for importers and exporters.\n\nI could go on, but I think the point is made. Exporting overly restricting IP laws to other countries is one of the major reasons why free trade advocates remain suspicious of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nAlbright is a research analyst at FreedomWorks.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A lack of clarity over long-dead rights holders has a chilling effect on creators afraid of inviting lawsuits.", "description": "A lack of clarity over long-dead rights holders has a chilling effect on creators afraid of inviting lawsuits.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A lack of clarity over long-dead rights holders has a chilling effect on creators afraid of inviting lawsuits.", "title": "What the Trans-Pacific Partnership gets wrong about intellectual property", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/259991-what-the-trans-pacific-partnership-gets-wrong-about", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/259991-what-the-trans-pacific-partnership-gets-wrong-about", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-13T11:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Logan Albright", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-13T11:00:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/259991-what-the-trans-pacific-partnership-gets-wrong-about", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A lack of clarity over long-dead rights holders has a chilling effect on creators afraid of inviting lawsuits.", "card": "summary", "title": "What the Trans-Pacific Partnership gets wrong about intellectual property"}, "dcterms.title": "What the Trans-Pacific Partnership gets wrong about intellectual property"}, "article_summary": "In recent years, the intellectual property (IP) system has been twisted beyond its original intention.\nThe TPP allows civil asset forfeiture for property suspected of violating IP law.\nWith the final text of all 30 chapters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) finally available, there is a lot to scrutinize.\nExporting overly restricting IP laws to other countries is one of the major reasons why free trade advocates remain suspicious of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nWhile the problem of regulatory review periods is correctly diagnosed here, the solution goes in the wrong direction."}
