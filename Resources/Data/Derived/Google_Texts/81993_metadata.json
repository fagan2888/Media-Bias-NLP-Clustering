When Democratic nominee Chad Taylor withdrew his name \u2014 albeit with little explanation \u2014 on Wednesday, it was viewed as a potential boon for Democrats in their quest to keep a Senate majority. It would have paved the way for independent candidate Greg Orman to mount a head-to-head challenge against incumbent U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts, a Republican.\n\nBut Kobach told reporters Thursday that after review, he determined Taylor did not meet Kansas law's requirements to withdraw from the race. Kansas law states that \"no person who has been nominated by any means for any national, state, county or township office may\" withdraw unless they declare they are \"incapable of fulfilling the duties of office if elected\" or in case of the death of a candidate.\n\nKobach said Taylor did not meet those qualifications.\n\n\"We now have no choice to keep his name on the ballot,\" he told reporters Thursday.\n\nTaylor and Orman's campaigns didn't immediately respond to request for comment about the news. One national Republican operative familiar with the race said the decision was to be expected.\n\n\"Secretary of State follows law, dog bites man,\" the operative said.\n\nTaylor's withdrawal could have meant Roberts would a far more daunting path to re-election \u2014 and his campaign was furious Wednesday night. After Taylor dropped out, the Roberts campaign issued a statement that accused Orman and Democrats of entering into a \"corrupt bargain\" to retain the Senate majority.\n\n\"Chad Taylor\u2019s withdrawal from the U.S. Senate race reveals a corrupt bargain between Greg Orman and national Democrats including Senator Harry Reid that disenfranchises Kansas Democrats,\" said Leroy Towns, Roberts' executive campaign manager. \"It makes clear what has been obvious from the start: Orman is the choice of liberal Democrats, and he can no longer hide behind an independent smokescreen.\"\n\nNow with Taylor remaining on the ballot \u2014 even if he chooses not to campaign \u2014 he could siphon off votes from Orman and provide a clearer path to victory for Roberts.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Brett LoGiurato", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Another stunning turn in Kansas.", "creator": "brettlogiurato", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/kansas-senate-chad-taylor-greg-orman-2014-9", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5408d3bc69bedd807f9d3033-506-253/the-democrats-just-got-some-bad-news-in-the-kansas-senate-race.jpg", "title": "The Democrats Just Got Some Bad News In The Kansas Senate Race", "site": "bi_politics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Elections, Kansas, Senate 2014, Election 2014, Brett LoGiurato,", "description": "Another stunning turn in Kansas.", "author": "Brett LoGiurato", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-04", "sailthru.title": "The Democrats Just Got Some Bad News In The Kansas Senate Race", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5408d132ecad04f36b9d3039-50-50/the-democrats-just-got-some-bad-news-in-the-kansas-senate-race.jpg", "news_keywords": "Elections, Kansas, Senate 2014, Election 2014, Brett LoGiurato,", "tbi-image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5408d132ecad04f36b9d3039/the-democrats-just-got-some-bad-news-in-the-kansas-senate-race.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2014-09-04", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/brett-logiurato"}, "sailthru.description": "Another stunning turn in Kansas.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Another stunning turn in Kansas.", "title": "The Democrats Just Got Some Bad News In The Kansas Senate Race", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/kansas-senate-chad-taylor-greg-orman-2014-9", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5408d3bc69bedd807f9d3033-1190-625/the-democrats-just-got-some-bad-news-in-the-kansas-senate-race.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "The Democrats Just Got Some Bad News In The Kansas Senate Race", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5408d132ecad04f36b9d3039/the-democrats-just-got-some-bad-news-in-the-kansas-senate-race.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a56\"", "article_summary": "\"Chad Taylor\u2019s withdrawal from the U.S. Senate race reveals a corrupt bargain between Greg Orman and national Democrats including Senator Harry Reid that disenfranchises Kansas Democrats,\" said Leroy Towns, Roberts' executive campaign manager.\nThe Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Kansas who dropped out of the race Wednesday will have to remain on the ballot in November, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) said Thursday.\nAfter Taylor dropped out, the Roberts campaign issued a statement that accused Orman and Democrats of entering into a \"corrupt bargain\" to retain the Senate majority.\nBut Kobach told reporters Thursday that after review, he determined Taylor did not meet Kansas law's requirements to withdraw from the race.\nWhen Democratic nominee Chad Taylor withdrew his name \u2014 albeit with little explanation \u2014 on Wednesday, it was viewed as a potential boon for Democrats in their quest to keep a Senate majority."}
