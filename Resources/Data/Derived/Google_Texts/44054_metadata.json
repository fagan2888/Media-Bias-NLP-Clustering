LaVontae died shortly after 4 p.m.\n\nIt's not yet clear what happened between the child's pick up from his home and his discovery outside the elementary school \u2013 a six-hour period.\n\nThe child's body overheated \u2013 hyperthermia \u2013 according to Larry Carroll, a Jefferson County deputy coroner.\n\nHyperthermia, a condition involving abnormally high body temperature, is often cited when children are left inside hot vehicles.\n\nMonday's high of 87 degrees marked the hottest day of 2016 in Louisville so far and nearly broke a record high of 90 degrees, according to the National Weather Service\n\nLouisville Metro Police is investigating the case and will hand it over to the Commonwealth Attorney's Office sometime next week to determine if criminal charges should be filed, police spokesman Dwight Mitchell said Wednesday.\n\nThe businesses' suspension will remain in effect until the cabinet's investigation ends. A woman answering the phone Tuesday at one of the day cares declined comment.\n\nTwo child care centers operated by K & Q, Inc. were found to be in violation of health and safety state standards when investigated by the cabinet six times in the last four years, online records show.\n\nInspectors concluded that at times children at the center weren't adequately supervised and that its director did not always have proper background check documentation for employees or emergency contact info for children in its care, among other violations.\n\nIn an October 2015 investigation, the cabinet found one of the centers wasn't following transportation regulations. Some children were signed off a transport van within a minute of being signed on while others were logged onto the van for hours. The investigation revealed that the transportation log was used only to record when students arrived after school, not monitor their movement on vehicles.\n\nThe cabinet is working with families to find new day care providers and is offering counseling through Seven Counties Services for the children who attended the day care with the boy.\n\nReporter Matthew Glowicki can be reached at 502-582-4989 or mglowicki@courier-journal.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1WekSkx", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "State working with families to find new day care providers after boy found unresponsive in van", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "State working with families to find new day care providers after boy found unresponsive in van", "title": "Day care closed after boy's death in hot van", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2016/04/20/day-care-closed-after-boys-death-hot-van/83290734/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "State working with families to find new day care providers after boy found unresponsive in van", "title": "Day care closed after boy's death in hot van", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d12dcab8829eb0a232b11ad304b0f3e035e326bb/c=499-0-2501-2002&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/20/Louisville/Louisville/635967698798752391-Daycare-ordered-closed-after-childs-heat-death-BB-0014.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Louisville Metro Police", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Louisville Metro Police", "title": "Day care closed after boy's death in hot van", "author": "Matthew Glowicki", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/278caa94eb8808c78ced2af9c56b2d8fc64d2329/c=749-0-2251-2002/local/-/media/2016/04/20/Louisville/Louisville/635967698798752391-Daycare-ordered-closed-after-childs-heat-death-BB-0014.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1c11a10c60493676b78ac18218e9072b569c25a9/c=499-0-2501-2002/local/-/media/2016/04/20/Louisville/Louisville/635967698798752391-Daycare-ordered-closed-after-childs-heat-death-BB-0014.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e2c4e138449a98ee7baa4b4a814263ed5baf5cf7/c=169-0-2832-2002/local/-/media/2016/04/20/Louisville/Louisville/635967698798752391-Daycare-ordered-closed-after-childs-heat-death-BB-0014.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffd871700330237bd3df78d6e85e8c89fcf8f981/c=0-154-3000-1849&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/04/20/Louisville/Louisville/635967698798752391-Daycare-ordered-closed-after-childs-heat-death-BB-0014.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-20T18:33:18.960000-04:00", "shorthed": "Day care closed after boy's death in hot van", "articleid": 83290734, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/322f5d74305547090bc274f56107e40846bee274/c=0-154-3000-1849/local/-/media/2016/04/20/Louisville/Louisville/635967698798752391-Daycare-ordered-closed-after-childs-heat-death-BB-0014.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5730e35b236e529ed0af8e9444730ffd6641d42/c=939-0-2060-2002/local/-/media/2016/04/20/Louisville/Louisville/635967698798752391-Daycare-ordered-closed-after-childs-heat-death-BB-0014.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Lil Kings and Queens Learning Academy, LaVontae Swain, Matthew Glowicki, boy dies in van, child hot car death"}, "article_summary": "LaVontae Swain, who attended one of the day care centers, died Monday afternoon after police said he spent three to four hours inside a van operated by an unidentified day care employee.\nThe cabinet is working with families to find new day care providers and is offering counseling through Seven Counties Services for the children who attended the day care with the boy.\nApril 20, 2016 (Photo: Brian Bohannon, Special to the C-J)Buy PhotoDays after a two-year-old boy died in a hot van operated by one of its employees, a day care was ordered closed Wednesday by the state.\nThe Cabinet for Health and Family Services issued an emergency license suspension Wednesday afternoon to two child care centers operating under the name Lil' Kings & Queens Child Care, 8505 and 8409 Terry Road.\nBuy Photo Jefferson County School buses arrive to drop off children at 8505 Terry Road, one of two child care centers operating under the name Lil' Kings &\u00caQueens Child Care."}
