Even experienced intensive care doctors seldom see it, and, since it was nighttime, no such physician was in the ICU. Pinning down the diagnosis was critical\u2014and in this case Berlin, Md.\u2019s Atlantic General Hospital had back-up.\n\nA critical care doctor 125 miles away was monitoring the patient\u2019s health via voice, video and high-speed data lines constantly streaming information about vital signs, medications, test results and X-rays, a telemedicine service known as Maryland eCare. The physician quickly verified that the patient had the deadly infection and arranged immediate transfer to another hospital with a surgeon who could remove the infected tissue.\n\nAtlantic General is one of Maryland eCare\u2019s six original community hospital clients, which have a total of 72 ICU beds. By the end of the year, the program will go live in three more Eastern Shore hospitals, adding 18 more ICU beds.\n\n[See also: Tele-ICU comes of age.]\n\nStudies have shown that patients do better and leave sooner from ICUs managed by intensivists, another term for critical care doctors. But intensivists are in short supply nationwide, and small community hospitals like Atlantic General have a difficult time recruiting and retaining them, let alone paying their salaries. Connecting intensivists to small ICUs via telemedicine, proponents say, is the next best thing to hiring them.\n\nTelemedicine, the exchange of medical information between sites via electronic communications, is being used not only by ICUs but also by other hospital departments, home health agencies and private doctors\u2019 offices. But skeptics suggest that small ICUs might be able to improve care with less expensive measures. Telemedicine now costs hospitals roughly $40,000 to $50,000 a year for each covered bed. Initially, adaptation of telemedicine in ICUs nationwide was rapid, but a new study suggests it is slowing.\n\nOne of Maryland eCare\u2019s 20 intensivists monitors ICU patients from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. weeknights and for 24 hours on Saturdays and Sundays. They\u2019re stationed at computers in Maryland eCare\u2019s COR\u2014Central Operations Room\u2014which last year moved from the Christiana Care Health System in Wilmington, Del., to the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore. On weekdays, when the hospitals\u2019 critical care doctors are at work, eCare critical care nurses staff the COR computers.\n\nCritical care specialist Atif Zeeshan and another intensivist work in Atlantic General\u2019s ICU from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on alternating weeks, and they\u2019re on call 24/7. Zeehan said he was at first leery of telemedicine. Four years after his eight-bed ICU hooked up with Maryland eCare, Zeehan is a believer. \u201cThere have been cases where lives were saved with eCare intervention,\u201d he says.\n\nMaryland eCare was established with a $3 million grant from CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, which helped cover capital expenses, such as computer and video connections. Participating hospitals pay Maryland eCare an annual fee for each ICU bed. Other eCare clients are Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Salisbury, Union Hospital in Elkton, Meritus Medical Center in Hagerstown, Calvert Memorial Hospital in Prince Frederick and MedStar St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Leonardtown.\n\nZeeshan\u2019s initial skepticism isn\u2019t unusual. \u201cNobody wants to be dictated to,\u201d acknowledges Marc Zubrow, a critical care and lung specialist and eCare Maryland\u2019s medical director. \u201cAn absolutely huge part of my job,\u201d says Zubrow, is to \u201cconvince the local medical community that this will not negatively impact patient care and might possibly improve patient care.\u201d\n\nHospital representatives routinely visit the Baltimore COR, and Zubrow and members of his team regularly visit the community hospitals and \u201cget very close with the local bedside people.\u201d\n\nAnd sometimes to patients\u2019 families. Zubrow shared an eCare doctor\u2019s notes about an interaction with a patient\u2019s daughter (stripped of information that could identify the patient). The woman, who\u2019d flown in to be at her critically ill mother\u2019s bedside, arrived around 3 a.m. and spent a few minutes video-chatting with the eCare intensivist on duty.\n\n\u201cI told her that nothing we do medically is going to improve her mother\u2019s condition or meaningfully prolong her life,\u201d according to the doctor\u2019s notes. \u201cI urged her to allow us to focus on treating her mother\u2019s pain and suffering\u2026I offered my support and told her I would speak with her again at any point tonight.\u201d\n\nCommunity hospitals say telemedicine helps critically ill patients be treated close to home and family. Even with extra oversight, however, these hospitals are still not equipped to care for all critically ill patients, so telemedicine intensivists help them decide which patients should be transferred.\n\nTelemedicine has helped improve the care of ICU patients says registered nurse Anne Lockhart, who directs the unit at Calvert Memorial. Lockhart says that includes a reduction in the number of patients contracting pneumonia as a result of being on a ventilator.\n\n[See also: Researchers call for EHR triaging in ICU.]\n\nSince implementing telemedicine, \u201cwe dramatically reduced our ICU mortality rate,\u201d says Ed Grogan, vice president of information services and chief information officer at Calvert Memorial.\n\nBut Jeremy Kahn is skeptical. An associate professor of critical care, medicine and health policy at the University of Pittsburgh, he says assessing telemedicine\u2019s effectiveness in the ICU is tricky. Comparing mortality rates before and after implementation of telemedicine doesn\u2019t account for the fact that \u201coutcomes in the ICU get better over time, no matter what,\u201d Kahn says.\n\nA better comparison would be to other, less-expensive, measures, such as using more non-physician providers\u2014physician assistants and nurse practitioners\u2014at ICU patients\u2019 bedsides, Kahn said.\n\nWhile Maryland eCare is adding hospitals, Kahn says adoption of telemedicine in ICUs nationwide is slowing. In a study published online in October by Critical Care Medicine, Kahn and his colleagues found that the number of U.S. hospitals using telemedicine in ICUs increased from 16, or 0.4 percent, in 2003, to 213, or 4.6 percent, in 2010, with usage doubling in the first four years but dropping to average growth of 8.1 percent in the last four.\n\n\u201cIn an era of cost constraints, I feel we need to be simultaneously exploring cheaper ways to get the same outcome,\u201d Kahn says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say we should not explore telemedicine.\u201d\n\nThis article was reprinted from kaiserhealthnews.org with permission from the Henry J.
