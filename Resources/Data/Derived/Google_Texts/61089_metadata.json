She said they had also applied for a HACCP Australia rating, which is the highest grade for food management and takes eight months to complete.\n\nThe Gap Tavern, owned by the ALH Group, was fined $28,000 for cleanliness issues including having live cockroaches in November 2013.\n\nALH Group spokesman said the organisation took food safety very seriously and had already taken steps to address the issues raised by the council.\n\n\u201cWe have a robust ongoing audit process,\u201d he said.\n\nShingle Inn director Andrew Bellchambers said its fine related back to 2012 when nearby construction work had disturbed the basement and created a pest problem.\n\nHe said attempts were made to keep it under control, but the council declared it unsatisfactory.\n\nThe firm had changed pest management suppliers, redesigned the kitchen and regained a four-star rating.\n\nBrisbane Lifestyle Chairman Cr Krista Adams said the council made no apologies for carrying out rigorous inspections and they responded to every complaint.\n\n\u201cPeople can be more confident than ever with 91.5 per cent of Brisbane restaurants now \u2018stepping up to the plate\u2019 with a rating of three stars or above,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis transparent approach to auditing along with the financial impost on businesses, act as an effective significant deterrent to reoffend, and so we see businesses really clean up their act.\u201d\n\nCOUNCILS TURN BLIND EYE\n\nMAJOR cities and tourist destinations throughout the state are hiding details about restaurants prosecuted for repeated dodgy hygiene practices, which could include insects crawling through the kitchen and food contamination.\n\nThere is now pressure on them to follow Brisbane City\u2019s Council\u2019s lead by naming and shaming eateries that flunk inspections and introducing a star rating system for food safety.\n\nDiners on the Gold Coast and in Cairns could be eating at restaurants repeatedly fined for breaching health standards but wouldn\u2019t know because their councils refuse to reveal who they are.\n\nIn Cairns, three restaurants have even been shut down temporarily by the courts to bring them back up to scratch.\n\nTop restaurateurs and food safety advocates say consumers deserve to know which eateries have been caught out so they can make informed choices about where they eat. Gold Coast City Council confirmed it had prosecuted five eateries in 2013-14, with an average fine of $17,500, while another 98 were given a $550 on-the-spot fine.\n\nWhile a council spokeswoman admitted there was a matter of public interest in naming restaurants that regularly breached health safety rules, the council still would not reveal any names.\n\n\u201cWhile it may be in the public interest for the media to report on noncompliant premises at the time of prosecution, City of Gold Coast does not wish to name and shame premises that have been prosecuted in the past and may be now fully compliant,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite this, she said those taken to court had usually displayed a pattern of not following the rules.\n\nA Cairns Council spokeswoman said it was not the council\u2019s policy to reveal the names of restaurants that had been prosecuted.\n\nBut she said three had been shut down temporarily because of poor hygiene, while another eight had been issued fines.\n\nOther councils such as Townsville were willing to reveal eateries that violated health standards.\n\nThe Chilli Jam Noodle Bar in Townsville was fined $5000 on April 24 for handling food in a way that made it unsuitable for sale \u2013 the only prosecution in the 2013-14 financial year.\n\nSince the successful EatSafe program was introduced by Brisbane City Council, it has spread to others including Logan and Bundaberg that have adopted similar programs.\n\nRestaurant 2 owner David Pugh, who helped set up Brisbane\u2019s EatSafe program, said it was important to name repeat offenders.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be published,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for Brisbane it\u2019s good enough for cities and towns in the rest of Australia. People need to be informed about who is looking after the best interests of their clients.\u201d\n\nMr Pugh said publishing breaches put pressure on eateries to maintain standards.\n\nFood Safety Information Council boss Juliana Madden said there was no reason not to name restaurants that had been successfully prosecuted for breaches.\n\nQueensland Health Health Protection Unit boss Sophie Dwyer said food safety rating schemes were a matter for local governments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "COCKROACHES in the kitchen, rat droppings in the deep fryer and salmonella are just a few of the nasties that Brisbanes food safety inspectors are finding on the menu at some of the citys most popular restaurants.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/top-franchises-and-wellknown-restaurants-among-brisbane-eateries-slapped-with-fines-for-dodgy-hygiene-and-health-practices/news-story/b2a36d6ef13191a801bf874d4e37b6ee", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/97a2771f8b61ffc0bc8f97fec9008a85", "type": "article", "description": "COCKROACHES in the kitchen, rat droppings in the deep fryer and salmonella are just a few of the nasties that Brisbane\u2019s food safety inspectors are finding on the menu at some of the city\u2019s most popular restaurants.", "title": "Do you want flies with that?"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/97a2771f8b61ffc0bc8f97fec9008a85", "title": "Do you want flies with that?", "description": "COCKROACHES in the kitchen, rat droppings in the deep fryer and salmonella are just a few of the nasties that Brisbane\u2019s food safety inspectors are finding on the menu at some of the city\u2019s most popular restaurants.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@couriermail"}, "robots": "noarchive", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/b2a36d6ef13191a801bf874d4e37b6ee?domain=couriermail.com.au"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "articleid": "b2a36d6ef13191a801bf874d4e37b6ee", "keywords": "food safety, popular restaurants, four-star rating, dodgy hygiene, health practices, Top franchises, pest management suppliers, public interest, highest grade, ongoing audit process, Food safety inspectors, pest problem, food management, health standards, cleanliness issues, hygiene standards, robust ongoing audit, transparent approach, takeaway chicken store, rigorous inspections, financial impost, Rodent droppings, live cockroaches, city health, kitchen sink, wall surfaces, construction work, city council, frying unit, mushroom risotto, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, Cairns, Cairns, Queensland Council, Brisbane City (Soccer team) Council, Gold Coast, Queensland Council, Safety Information Council, David Pugh, Juliana Madden, Andrew Bellchambers, Henry Leung, Sophie Dwyer, Matthew Killoran", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-19T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-07-19T08:36:57.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc845\"", "article_summary": "Queensland Health Health Protection Unit boss Sophie Dwyer said food safety rating schemes were a matter for local governments.\nTop franchises and well-known restaurants were among the eateries slapped with a whopping total of $600,000 in fines for dodgy hygiene and health practices during the 2013-14 financial year.\nFood Safety Information Council boss Juliana Madden said there was no reason not to name restaurants that had been successfully prosecuted for breaches.\nFood safety inspectors slapped more than 30 restaurants and cafes with fines as part of the city council\u2019s EatSafe program in a bid to clean up the industry.\nALH Group spokesman said the organisation took food safety very seriously and had already taken steps to address the issues raised by the council."}
