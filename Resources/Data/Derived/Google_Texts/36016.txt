House District 47 State Rep. Clarice Navarro-Ratzlaff made a stop Saturday at the Fremont County Republican Headquarters in Cañon City on her birthday to announce her campaign for re-election.

"It's been an amazing year to be able to represent the people of House District 47," Ratzlaff said. "When I walk into that state capital, I'm representing all of you. I can't express how proud I am of that. And I am so, so excited to go back and represent you all."

District 47 includes Fremont, Otero and Pueblo counties.

"This seat matters...," Ratzlaff said on her website. "...the people of House District 47 deserve a strong voice in the Colorado State Legislature."

Ratzlaff said this is her first term, and "that's why it's so important to be re-elected in 2014." According to Ratzlaff, nobody believed a Republican would win the seat.

"I'm excited to start fresh and overcome what they said was not possible," she said.

Ratzlaff said that also contributes to the "target on her back" for the upcoming election. She said she needs support because she cannot keep the seat without it.

"I'm honored to be your state representative," Ratzlaff said. "It's important to me to hear from you, when I'm serving, as well."

Ratzlaff resides in Pueblo and said she visits Cañon City every time she's invited.
