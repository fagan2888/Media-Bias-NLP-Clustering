Having a leopard as a pet gives the characters extra power, helping players beat their friends.\n\nDeng and tens of millions like her have made China Apple's third-largest market for software sales, and a huge chunk of that comes through WeChat. Known locally as Weixin, WeChat had 438 million monthly active users globally, mostly in China, at the end of June, and has rapidly evolved from a messaging tool into a digital Swiss Army knife, allowing users to send messages, play games, book taxis and shop online.\n\nThe app has proved a winning formula in getting people in China, a market notorious for not paying for software, to connect their bank accounts with their phones and pay for virtual goods like extra lives and power-ups in mobile games.\n\nRead MoreApple moving on from nude celebrities to new products\n\nApple takes a 30 percent cut on all sales.\n\n\"We're seeing some substantial strength there,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said of China in a July earnings call. \"The thing that's actually growing the most is the iTunes, Software and Services category, which has the App Store in it. That area is almost doubling year over year.\"\n\nApple's Greater China revenues, which include Hong Kong and Taiwan, soared 28 percent in April-June from a year earlier to $5.9 billion, and globally, iTunes, Software and Services sales were the company's second-fastest growing product category, up 12 percent year-on-year to $4.5 billion.\n\nTencent was the top game publisher for Apple's iOS operating system in China by revenue for both June and July, according to App Annie, a company that measures app usage. Apple is this week expected to launch its new iPhone - with a gamer-friendly larger screen.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Deng and tens of millions like her have made China Apple's third-largest market for software sales, and a huge chunk of that comes through WeChat.", "author": "CNBC", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Tens of millions of users have made China Apple's third-largest market for software sales, and a huge chunk of that comes through WeChat.", "title": "WeChat helps Apple rack up bonus points in China", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/07/wechat-helps-apple-rack-up-bonus-points-in-china.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/04/24/101610757-Screen-Shot-2014-04-24-at-10.08.04-AM.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tens of millions of users have made China Apple's third-largest market for software sales, and a huge chunk of that comes through WeChat.", "title": "WeChat helps Apple rack up bonus points in China", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/07/wechat-helps-apple-rack-up-bonus-points-in-china.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/04/24/101610757-Screen-Shot-2014-04-24-at-10.08.04-AM.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Mobile, Business, Apple Inc, Tencent Holdings Ltd, China Mobile Ltd, Alphabet Class A, Microsoft Corp, Naver Corp, Chinese Yuan / US Dollar FX Cross Rate, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-09-07T19:38:55-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Mobile", "modified_time": "2014-09-07T19:38:55-0400", "tag": "Chinese Yuan / US Dollar FX Cross Rate"}, "pageNodeId": 101978381, "news_keywords": "Asia, China, Mobile, Social media, WeChat, Apple, KaKao, Google"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd94c1\"", "article_summary": "Deng and tens of millions like her have made China Apple's third-largest market for software sales, and a huge chunk of that comes through WeChat.\n\"We're seeing some substantial strength there,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said of China in a July earnings call.\n\"The thing that's actually growing the most is the iTunes, Software and Services category, which has the App Store in it.\nApple is this week expected to launch its new iPhone - with a gamer-friendly larger screen.\nApple has a lot for which to thank people like Deng."}
