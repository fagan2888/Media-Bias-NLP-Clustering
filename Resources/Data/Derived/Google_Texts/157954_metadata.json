She read the email on her iPad, held above her bruised and battered knees, as she sat waiting for the nurse to call her name.\n\nThe message came from Colorado HealthOP, the nonprofit insurance cooperative that she joined after retiring two years ago. The email said that state regulators won\u2019t let the co-op offer plans through the state\u2019s exchange in 2016. So she\u2019ll have to find a new carrier when the enrollment period begins next month.\n\n\u201cIt really couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time,\u201d Lewis said. The recent retiree from Lakewood was there to see a doctor about what she feared was a blood clot.\n\nAround three weeks prior, she and her husband Norm were in a serious car accident. They were driving up Fremont Pass near Leadville when a car speeding down lost control. The Lewises were hit head on \u2014 totaling their car and leaving them both battered.\n\nNorm got the worse of it, but Debbie is still hurting too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got sore this and sore that,\u201d she told The Colorado Independent. \u201cAnd about a million bruises \u2014 too many to count.\u201d\n\nThough the hospital bills haven\u2019t come in yet, Lewis is confident her insurance will cover them. Colorado HealthOP did commit to paying claims through the end of the year. But she is nervous about what\u2019s to come.\n\n\u201cOn top of the crash, I really don\u2019t need the additional stress of, \u2018Oh, what am I going to do without insurance now?'\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI\u2019m not old enough to get on Medicare, so until then I\u2019m kind of screwed.\u201d\n\nLewis is one of 80,000 Coloradans who lost coverage last week when the Colorado Division of Insurance decided that Colorado HealthOP isn\u2019t in financial shape to cover all its members\u2019 claims next year.\n\nThe co-op\u2019s financial viability has been under watch for nearly a year now. Its coffers were looking fine until the first of this month when the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, a subset of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, walked back on reimbursement promises it had made through the risk corridor program.\n\nThe program was established by the Affordable Care Act with the understanding that setting premiums for the previously uninsured or underinsured according to higher standards of coverage \u2014 like, for example, no longer being able to deny coverage based on a pre-existing condition \u2014 is risky business. So for the first three years of Obamacare, the federal government promised to help insurers stomach that risk by paying companies whose claims exceed premiums, and collecting from those whose fell short. But that cushion deflated when the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services announced insurers would only see 12.6 percent of what they\u2019re entitled to under the program.\n\nColorado HealthOP was expecting to get $16.2 million. Instead, it got $2 million. And that\u2019s why the co-op\u2019s rainy day fund doesn\u2019t meet minimum requirements set by the Department of Insurance.\n\nIndependent projections had the co-op on track to be profitable in 2016, and could have started to pay back federal start-up loans ahead of schedule. But without the cash it was promised by the feds, the nonprofit will be forced to default on $72 million in loans and send its members back out into the marketplace.\n\nColorado HealthOP\u2019s chief executive Julia Hutchins said she was \u201castonished and disappointed\u201d by Department of Insurance\u2019s decision, which she called \u201cirresponsible and premature\u201d in a statement released last week.\n\n\u201cColorado HealthOP is a profitable start-up insurance company that is in a strong financial position and, for two years, has served the critical needs of Coloradans by enhancing competition in the Colorado insurance market, driving down prices in the state health insurance marketplace and offering new, innovative choices to its more than 80,000 members throughout Colorado,\u201d Hutchins said. \u201cBy choosing this course of action, the Division has let local and national politics hurt Coloradans\u2019 access to low-cost healthcare options and assessed Colorado taxpayers with significant avoidable costs.\u201d\n\nNearly 40 percent of Coloradans who purchased health insurance through the state exchange in 2015 are members of the co-op. As a nonprofit, the co-op gives members a voice in the benefits and services they want for as low a premium as possible, rather than having to turn a profit for corporate stakeholders. Colorado HealthOP estimates that defaulting on its federal loans will leave taxpayers with a $40 million tab.\n\nColorado Insurance Commissioner Marguerite Salazar called the situation \u201ctruly unfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur decision is a direct result of this shortfall by [the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services], and I sympathize with the HealthOP, but the Division has requirements and it has to protect consumers,\u201d she said in a statement put out on Friday.\n\nThe time is right to shut down the co-op, according to the commissioner, because open enrollment begins in less than a month.\n\n\u201cTo delay any longer would undermine the open enrollment process \u2014 impacting the entire health insurance market in Colorado and negatively impacting Colorado consumers,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cAnd it would have been even more costly to consumers if this action had to take place once 2016 started.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the co-op challenged the Division of Insurance\u2019s decision in federal district court. The filing outlines various possibilities for alternative funding to keep the co-op afloat. One of the most promising, according to the filing, is an advancing merger deal with another mission-aligned nonprofit insurance co-op. Other possible solutions include getting a loan from a re-insurance company or a private venture capital firm.\n\n151019 Motion for TRO and PI \u2013 Court Stamped by Natalie Stein\n\n\u201cOf course, Colorado HealthOP will require a reasonable time to pursue the possible solutions to replace the previously unanticipated but impending 2014 funding shortfall from [the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] in 2015,\u201d the motion states. And what\u2019s a reasonable amount of time? The co-op is \u201csupremely confident\u201d it could be done in four weeks.\n\nBut if it can\u2019t continue to operate in 2016, per the Division of Insurance\u2019s decision, the co-op will have to default on its loans. And that, the motion states, will cause \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Colorado HealthOP and its 80,000 policy holders. That kind of injury, by definition, can\u2019t be adequately compensated in cash or in court, so the filing asks the court for immediate injunctive relief instead.\n\nBut that request was denied in a hearing the same day it was filed. In the end, an agreement was reached for \u201can orderly wind-down\u201d of the co-op.\n\nOregon\u2019s health insurance co-op also shuttered Friday, bringing the number of failed nonprofit insurance co-ops up to eight. (Others have failed in Kentucky, Louisiana, Iowa/Nebraska, New York, Nevada and Tennessee.) That means around a third of the 23 co-ops created under the ACA have tanked less than two years in.\n\nA report by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s office of inspector general this summer found that most co-ops weren\u2019t enrolling enough members or bringing in enough money. Low enrollment could be attributed to technical difficulties like website glitches, long wait times, delays in obtaining required licenses, management shake-ups and high prices. Colorado HealthOP, on its part, had higher enrollment than what was projected \u2014 by 121 percent. But with far higher expenses from claims than income from premiums, the co-op closed out its books in 2014 having lost more than $20 million.\n\nHHS Inspector General Report\n\nColorado Senator Cory Gardner found the inspector general\u2019s report cause for concern. In September, he wrote a letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell asking her to investigate Colorado HealthOP\u2019s financial solvency.\n\nNow that the co-op has indeed gone under, Gardner finds it \u201cinfuriating\u201d to see so many individuals and families lose coverage \u201cas a result of poor planning and bad policy.\u201d In a press release last week, he wrote, \u201ctaxpayers are on the hook for millions of dollars in loans given out to the co-op, money that will likely never be repaid.\u201d The co-op\u2019s closure, as he tells it, \u201ccan be added to the very long list of Obamacare\u2019s broken promises.\u201d\n\nOthers on the right agree that the co-op model was always destined for failure.\n\n\u201cWhat we are witnessing is the fulfillment of long-told prophecies of what would happen as a result of this complicated and dangerous version of fake health care reform,\u201d executive director of the free-market advocacy group Advancing Colorado Jonathan Lockwood wrote in a statement about Colorado HealthOP\u2019s closure.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s story is exactly why people across America are looking for a repeal of Obamacare and a replacement, with true reforms that lift us all up, with expanded choice, more options, more competition and more positive outcomes for more people, all with greater affordability.\u201d\n\nBut the National Alliance of State Health Co-ops insists the closures are a failure of the federal government to follow through on its obligations, and not a failure of the co-op model unto itself.\n\n\u201cWith the Department of Health and Human Services already issuing lower Affordable Care Act enrollment projections and health insurance giants merging to further limit competition, the presence of co-ops is needed now more than ever,\u201d said National Alliance of State Health Co-ops CEO Kelly Crowe in a statement. \u201cThough federal regulators have taken some modest steps to ease co-ops\u2019 short term financial burdens, a firmer commitment to fulfill the obligations of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s risk programs is needed to provide stability to the marketplaces.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Congress actively undercut the risk corridor program that would have kept co-ops in Colorado and around the country alive. In a scarcely noticed provision of the massive 2015 spending bill dubbed \u201cthe Cromnibus,\u201d Republicans in the House of Representatives required the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services to keep its risk corridor program revenue neutral. It sounds innocuous \u2014 fiscally conservative at a time when deficits are high and budgets are tight. But in effect, the provision means that the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services can\u2019t draw funds from any other source to finance the risk corridor payments it owes. It can only pay out what insurers pay in \u2014 hence the multi-billion dollar shortfall in what the government promised to these co-op startups.\n\nThough the provision that tied up co-op funding was likely not the deciding factor in lawmakers\u2019 votes on the behemoth of a bill, this is how the Colorado delegation voted: Democrat Ed Perlmutter, Republicans Mike Coffman, Cory Gardner and Scott Tipton \u201cyea;\u201d Democrats Diana Degette, Jared Polis and Republican Doug Lamborn \u201cnay.\u201d\n\nLegislation to repeal the risk corridor program entirely has cropped up several times over the years, always fizzling out but never without significant Republican support. Cory Gardner and Doug Lamborn co-sponsored the Obamacare Taxpayer Bailout Prevention Act in the House in 2013. Then when Gardner moved to the Senate, he put his name on the bill again.\n\nLiberals have been frustrated by Republicans\u2019 attempts to cripple Obamacare, then point to its stumbles as a sign of failure and a cause for repeal. Every step in the law\u2019s implementation has been political in one way or another.\n\nAmy Runyon-Harms said she thinks Colorado HealthOP \u201cwas set-up to fail by design by those who wanted to see it fail.\u201d As executive director of Colorado\u2019s largest online progressive advocacy organization ProgressNow, Runyon-Harms saw the co-op as \u201cthe closest thing we had to a public option in this environment [\u2026] It\u2019s very sad to see that go away.\u201d\n\nApart from the politics, senior director of policy and analysis at the Colorado Health Institute Amy Downs thinks the co-op\u2019s closure is a testament to just how hard it is to open up a new insurance carrier.\n\n\u201cI mean, you need a lot of money,\u201d she told The Colorado Independent. \u201cIt\u2019s a really competitive market.\u201d\n\nColorado\u2019s individual insurance market is indeed one of the most competitive in the country with seven major insurance carriers to choose from. The only other state with as many is Oregon, and none have more.\n\nThe Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation developed the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to measure the distribution of market share across insurers. Index values range from 0-10,000, with lower numbers indicating a more competitive market. Colorado\u2019s clocks in at 1,792 \u2013compared to a national median of 3,888 \u2014 making it the third most competitive market in the country.\n\nNear term, Colorado HealthOP\u2019s exit from the market will have the biggest impact on its policy holders who\u2019ll have to start shopping around for a new plan come November 1.\n\nLast year, the co-op offered the cheapest premiums in most regions of the state \u2014 which could very well account for why 40 percent of Coloradans who bought insurance through the state exchange went for Colorado HealthOP plans.\n\nIt\u2019s yet unclear how these 80,000 people will fare without the co-op.\n\n\u201cIn some cases they might find price breaks,\u201d senior communications expert at the Colorado Health Institute Joe Hanel said. \u201cBut when insurance rates come out later this week, we\u2019ll probably see average increases across the board.\u201d\n\nInsurance carriers submitted requests for setting 2016 premium rates to the Division of Insurance in May. Regulators review those requests all summer and into the fall. Premiums will likely be set later this week, but Hanel doubts whether the co-op\u2019s closure will have any effect on them.\n\n\u201cThat ship has pretty much already sailed.\u201d\n\nPlus, the exit of one carrier is hardly the sole factor affecting market rates.\n\n\u201cThe degree to which younger, healthier people are signing up [for health insurance] matters a lot,\u201d Hanel said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of consolidation going on among big national carriers. So it\u2019ll be hard to tease out prices based only on the co-op closure.\u201d\n\nConnect for Health Colorado spokesman Luke Clarke said the state exchange will focus on making people aware of all the options still available to them. \u201cConsumers did lose one choice, yes, but there\u2019s still a lot out there.\u201d\n\nThe co-op\u2019s exit does mean that this year\u2019s tax credits will have to be revalued. Tax credits are bench-marked according to the second cheapest silver plan on the market, which, without Colorado HealthOP\u2019s low premiums, will likely be higher than last year. So even if premiums do go up, tax credits will follow suit. But, of course, choosing the right plan all depends on individual circumstance \u2014 where you live, whether you have a family, how much you make and how much care you\u2019re likely to need.\n\nConnect for Health advises individuals who are in the market for a new plan to consult with a broker or a navigator. Doing so is free.\n\n\u201cNobody enjoys it. I mean insurance isn\u2019t fun, but it\u2019s really worth sitting down with someone and working through your options,\u201d Clarke said.\n\nDebbie Lewis certainly isn\u2019t looking forward to it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping I don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d she said. \u201cIt all happened so recently, so I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nBut with the crash not so far in her rearview, Lewis knows that having to switch insurance carriers \u2014 tedious or inconvenient though it may be \u2014 really isn\u2019t the end of the world.\n\n\u201cSo it goes, I guess.\u201d\n\nPhoto by Health Care Costs, Creative Commons, via Flickr.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "Debbie Lewis was in\u00a0the\u00a0emergency room Friday when she found out her health insurance carrier is\u00a0going out of business.
