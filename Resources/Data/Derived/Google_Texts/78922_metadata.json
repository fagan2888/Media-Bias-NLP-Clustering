Barbara Boxer Barbara BoxerTrump and Sanders whip up debate buzz Boxer: Sanders appeals to young voters with grandpa effect The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (D-Calif.) and Edward Markey (D-Mass.), it\u2019s been more than 20 years since Congress set aside funds to help schools address asbestos exposure.\n\n\u201cMany schools built before the early 1980s almost certainly contain asbestos, and almost every week brings another story of asbestos found in schools \u2013 disrupting education, displacing students and disturbing parents,\u201d the report\u2019s author and EWG Action Fund Advisor Bill Walker said in a release. \u201cIt\u2019s a national problem that demands a national solution, starting with a total ban on asbestos.\u201d\n\nThe report comes as lawmakers on Capitol Hill debate how best to reform the nation's toxic chemical laws with two competing bills in the Senate.\n\nEnvironmentalists have widely opposed the bill introduced by Sens. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) and David Vitter (R-La.) despite the fact that it appears to have enough bipartisan support to be the winning legislation.\n\nThe action fund report said 1984 was the last time the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted a nationwide survey to determine the extent of the potential dangers asbestos posed to students, faculty and other school employees.\n\nOf the 2,600 public school districts and private schools sampled, the action fund said EPA estimated that 15 million students and 1.4 million teachers, administrators and other employees \u2013 in almost 35,000 schools \u2013 were at risk of exposure to deadly airborne asbestos fibers.\n\nThe report calls on Congress to restore funding to school districts for asbestos abatement and enact a total ban on the toxic substance, which can be attributed to more than 10,000 deaths a year.\n\nIn a statement, US EPA said the agency is reviewing the report.\n\nDuring a press conference Tuesday, Boxer called on Udall and Vitter to \u201cfix their toxic chemical bill before it goes to mark-up as early as next week.\u201d\n\nBoxer said the Udall-Vitter bill is worse than the current TSCA law because it only provides for the assessment of 25 chemicals over five years, it \u201ceviscerates states rights to protect their people from cancer-causing chemicals and \u201cit does nothing to address asbestos.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bill doesn\u2019t even mention the word asbestos,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd experts say regulation of asbestos under the Udall-Vitter bill will never, ever happen.\u201d\n\nIn a response Tuesday evening, Udall\u2019s office called those statements \u201cblatantly false.\u201d\n\n\"It is blatantly false to say that Senator Udall's bill would prevent the regulation of asbestos,\u201d Udall\u2019s Spokeswoman Jennifer Talhelm said in a statement. \u201cSenator Udall's bill specifically corrects the flaws in current TSCA to finally give EPA the ability to regulate asbestos as well as BPA, styrene, and many other dangerous chemicals. If we don't act \u2014 or if we hold out for an unworkable proposal \u2014 these chemicals will continue to flow through commerce unregulated, and our kids will never have the protection they need to be safe.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "EWG's report comes as lawmakers debate how to reform the nation's chemical laws.", "description": "EWG's report comes as lawmakers debate how to reform the nation's chemical laws.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "EWG's report comes as lawmakers debate how to reform the nation's chemical laws.", "title": "Report urges Congress to restore funding for asbestos removal in schools", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/239606-report-urges-congress-to-restore-funding-for-asbestos-removal-in-schools", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-22T10:10:23-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-04-22T10:10-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/239606-report-urges-congress-to-restore-funding-for-asbestos-removal-in-schools", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-21T18:25-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "David Vitter, Environmental Working Group, United States, Asbestos and the law, Education, Environment, Toxic Substances Control Act, asbestos,Barbara Boxer,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-21T18:25:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-22T10:10:23-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/239606-report-urges-congress-to-restore-funding-for-asbestos-removal-in-schools", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "EWG's report comes as lawmakers debate how to reform the nation's chemical laws.", "card": "summary", "title": "Report urges Congress to restore funding for asbestos removal in schools"}, "dcterms.title": "Report urges Congress to restore funding for asbestos removal in schools"}, "article_summary": "), it\u2019s been more than 20 years since Congress set aside funds to help schools address asbestos exposure.\nSchool districts have long been on their own when it comes to dealing with asbestos, a new report from the Environmental Working Group Action Fund found.\nThe report calls on Congress to restore funding to school districts for asbestos abatement and enact a total ban on the toxic substance, which can be attributed to more than 10,000 deaths a year.\n\u201cSenator Udall's bill specifically corrects the flaws in current TSCA to finally give EPA the ability to regulate asbestos as well as BPA, styrene, and many other dangerous chemicals.\n\u201cAnd experts say regulation of asbestos under the Udall-Vitter bill will never, ever happen.\u201dIn a response Tuesday evening, Udall\u2019s office called those statements \u201cblatantly false.\u201d\"It is blatantly false to say that Senator Udall's bill would prevent the regulation of asbestos,\u201d Udall\u2019s Spokeswoman Jennifer Talhelm said in a statement."}
