Now that Republicans run the show, opponents of sensible and effective family planning are back to kill it off for good. Last Tuesday, a House subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services proposed to eliminate all Title X funding \u2014 about $300 million \u2014 from a 2016 spending bill.\n\nThe bill would also slash funding by up to 90 percent for sex education, specifically President Obama\u2019s teen-pregnancy prevention initiative. The only winner was abstinence-only education, whose funding the subcommittee voted to double, despite the fact that it has basically no effect on abstinence and has been associated with higher rates of teen pregnancy.\n\nMeanwhile, Title X, which was enacted by overwhelming bipartisan majorities in Congress in 1970, is caught up once again in the nation\u2019s abortion wars \u2014 even though like all federal programs, it is barred from providing any funding for abortions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublicans have complained that this ban is subverted by Planned Parenthood, which performs abortions and is Title X\u2019s biggest recipient. They want to deny the organization any federal funds at all. But 90 percent of the women who visit Planned Parenthood clinics are there to get contraception or other reproductive health care, not abortions.\n\nWhat Title X grants actually do is help prevent unwanted pregnancies \u2014 more than one million in 2012, which translates to about 363,000 abortions avoided. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization, every public dollar spent on family planning services saved about $7 in costs related to pregnancy, birth and infant care, as well as sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer. So the proposal to slash the program\u2019s funding is not just inhumane, it\u2019s also fiscally dumb.\n\nSadly, that\u2019s no surprise coming from the House Republicans, whose zeal to stop the government from providing an essential service like health care to lower-income Americans has also resulted in dozens of votes to cripple or repeal the Affordable Care Act. (The new spending bill would also roll back much of the health care law.)\n\nThis latest bill aims squarely at one of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable groups \u2014 poorer women, many of whom live in rural areas with little access to health care of any kind. So much for compassionate conservatism.\n\nCorrection: June 22, 2015\n\nAn earlier version of this editorial imprecisely described how savings are achieved from family planning services. Most come from reduced costs related to pregnancy, birth and infant care, with a smaller portion related to reduced sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150622032119, "twitter": {"description": "In efforts to block funds for abortion, programs that actually reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies are being cut back.", "title": "Republicans Take Aim at Poor Women", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/opinion/republicans-take-aim-at-poor-women.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003752643"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/20/opinion/22mon3web/22mon3web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/opinion/republicans-take-aim-at-poor-women.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003752643", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/opinion/republicans-take-aim-at-poor-women.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Republicans Take Aim at Poor Women", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 22, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Senate", "keywords": "Editorials,Abortion,Sex Education,Women's Rights,Republican Party,House of Representatives,Senate,Pregnancy and Childbirth,Teenage Pregnancy,Law and Legislation,United States,United States Politics and Government,Women and Girls,Birth Control and Family Planning", "news_keywords": "Editorial,Abortion,Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/20/opinion/22mon3web/22mon3web-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "In efforts to block funds for abortion, programs that actually reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies are being cut back.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/20/opinion/22mon3web/22mon3web-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "In efforts to block funds for abortion, programs that actually reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies are being cut back.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 22, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-06-22", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Birth Control and Family Planning", "published": "2015-06-22", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "slug": "22mon3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150622163854, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/opinion/republicans-take-aim-at-poor-women.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/20/opinion/22mon3web/22mon3web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In efforts to block funds for abortion, programs that actually reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies are being cut back.", "title": "Republicans Take Aim at Poor Women"}, "pdate": 20150622, "des": "Birth Control and Family Planning", "articleid": 100000003752643, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Republicans Take Aim at Poor Women", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf8d\"", "article_summary": "But 90 percent of the women who visit Planned Parenthood clinics are there to get contraception or other reproductive health care, not abortions.\nWhat Title X grants actually do is help prevent unwanted pregnancies \u2014 more than one million in 2012, which translates to about 363,000 abortions avoided.\n(The new spending bill would also roll back much of the health care law.)\nLast Tuesday, a House subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services proposed to eliminate all Title X funding \u2014 about $300 million \u2014 from a 2016 spending bill.\nMost come from reduced costs related to pregnancy, birth and infant care, with a smaller portion related to reduced sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer."}
