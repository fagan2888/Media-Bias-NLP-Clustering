20 Things You Might Not Know About Robert A. Heinlein, Part 1: His Maculate Origin

1. When Robert A. Heinlein was a child, his family was so poor that "[H]e slept on a pallet on the floor for years, in a constant state of amiable warfare with baby sister Louise, 'A notorious pillow swiper.'"

Most of the writers who, in later years, would apostrophize Heinlein as “too optimistic” and turn their stories into “poverty porn” could probably have benefited from having some idea what true poverty was. Even those of us who were poor as children for some time were never so poor as to have rationed pillows.

Heinlein wrote rags to riches stories, of which those who believe the individual is powerless before his fate disapprove. But Heinlein’s own life is a refutation of their theories, so they can go suck an egg, as far as I’m concerned.
