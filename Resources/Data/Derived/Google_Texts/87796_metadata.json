But NASA needs a bigger and stronger parachute if it wants to send astronauts there.\n\nWeather permitting, the space agency will conduct a test flight Tuesday high in Earth\u2019s atmosphere that\u2019s supposed to simulate the thin Martian air.\n\nCameras rigged aboard the vehicle will capture the action as it accelerates to four times the speed of sound and falls back to Earth. Viewers with an Internet connection can follow along live.\n\nEngineers cautioned that they may not succeed on the first try.\n\n\u201cAs long as I get data, I\u2019ll be very happy,\u201d said project manager Mark Adler of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nLanding has always been \u201cone of the big technology challenges for a human Mars mission,\u201d American University space policy professor Howard McCurdy said in an e-mail.\n\nWith plans to land heavier spacecraft and eventually humans, NASA needed a heftier solution. So it designed a supersonic parachute that\u2019s 110 feet in diameter \u2014 twice as big as the one that carried the 1-ton Curiosity rover in 2012. It\u2019s so gigantic that it can\u2019t fit into the wind tunnels that NASA typically uses to test parachutes.\n\nNASA plans more test flights next year before deciding whether to use the new parachute on a future Mars mission.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NASA to test giant Mars parachute on Earth", "title": "NASA to test giant Mars parachute on Earth", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/01/nasa-to-test-giant-mars-parachute-on-earth/", "image": {"width": 490, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140601__20140602_A14_ND02MARSp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140601__20140602_A14_ND02MARSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-01T21:23:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:32:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd056a\"", "article_summary": "NASA plans more test flights next year before deciding whether to use the new parachute on a future Mars mission.\nSo it designed a supersonic parachute that\u2019s 110 feet in diameter \u2014 twice as big as the one that carried the 1-ton Curiosity rover in 2012.\nLanding has always been \u201cone of the big technology challenges for a human Mars mission,\u201d American University space policy professor Howard McCurdy said in an e-mail.\nIt\u2019s so gigantic that it can\u2019t fit into the wind tunnels that NASA typically uses to test parachutes.\nBut NASA needs a bigger and stronger parachute if it wants to send astronauts there."}
