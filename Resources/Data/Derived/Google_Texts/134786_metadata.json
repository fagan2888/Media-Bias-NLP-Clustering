In 2015, Claudia Rankine\u2019s \u201cCitizen\u201d stayed on the monthly race and civil rights list all year; it\u2019s currently No. 5. A hard-to-classify volume of prose poems, or lyrical essays, about daily encounters with racism \u2014 \u201cI wanted to replicate the sense of having these stories come at you,\u201d Rankine told The New Statesman \u2014 the book has also spent time on the paperback nonfiction list and, more counterintuitively, the monthly relationships list. (One place it hasn\u2019t appeared yet is the monthly politics list, although that may change now that a young woman in Illinois was spotted reading it at a Trump rally.) The people who compile the Times lists aren\u2019t the only ones who have struggled to define Rankine\u2019s book. Last winter, \u201cCitizen\u201d became the first title ever nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award in two categories: A finalist in criticism, it won in poetry. So what is this book, exactly? And how does Rankine feel about efforts to pin it down? \u201cIf we leave the structural hybridity of \u2018Citizen\u2019 aside,\u201d she told me via email, \u201cI want to believe there is a recognized veracity of experience for the people categorizing the book. Each feels \u2018Citizen\u2019 satisfies some truth or intention for their category. I am a poet, and I didn\u2019t fictionalize the accounts told to me or taken from my life or from the news; I simply submerged my thinking into the \u2018ethical loneliness\u2019 (a phrase taken from the title of Jill Stauffer\u2019s excellent book) that the sentences accumulated. The lyrical reflection of lives struggling to negotiate racism in our culture apparently feels authentic to many categories. That seems right.\u201d Then she quoted a line from \u201cSentences and Paragraphs,\u201d by Gertrude Stein: \u201cNever ask any one what a sentence is or what it has been.\u201d\n\nOff the Leash: Another best-selling poet this year was Mary Oliver, whose collection \u201cDog Songs\u201d hit the monthly animals list three times. True to its title, the book gathers poems (and one essay) about dogs. \u201cI think they are companions in a way that people aren\u2019t,\u201d Oliver told The Times when it was published in 2013. \u201cThey\u2019ll lie next to you when you\u2019re sad. And they remind us that we\u2019re animals, too.\u201d In the essay that closes the volume, \u201cDog Talk,\u201d Oliver allows herself a bit of a rant against leashes: \u201cThe other dog \u2014 the one that all its life walks leashed and obedient down the sidewalk \u2014 is what a chair is to a tree. It is a possession only, the ornament of a human life. Such dogs can remind us of nothing large or noble or mysterious or lost. They cannot make us sweeter or more kind. Only unleashed dogs can do that.\u201d\n\nPhoto and Verse: What was the most expensive work of poetry in 2015? According to the used-books website AbeBooks, it might have been a 1930 edition of \u201cThe Bridge,\u201d by Hart Crane, with photographs by Walker Evans, that fetched $10,000.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20151218112436, "twitter": {"description": "Claudia Rankine\u2019s hard-to-classify \u201cCitizen\u201d stayed on the monthly race and civil rights best-seller list all year.", "title": "Inside the List", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/books/review/inside-the-list.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004097708"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/27/books/review/27list-rankine/27list-rankine-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/books/review/inside-the-list.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004097708", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/books/review/inside-the-list.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "books/review", "hdl_p": "Inside the List", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/books/review/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 18, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Books and Literature", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Gregory Cowles", "SCG": "review", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By GREGORY COWLES", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Claudia Rankine\u2019s hard-to-classify \u201cCitizen\u201d stayed on the monthly race and civil rights best-seller list all year.", "tom": "List", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/27/books/review/27list-rankine/27list-rankine-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Claudia Rankine\u2019s hard-to-classify \u201cCitizen\u201d stayed on the monthly race and civil rights best-seller list all year.", "CG": "books", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 18, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "List", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/books/index.html", "section": "Sunday Book Review", "modified": "2015-12-25", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/books/review/index.jsonp", "tag": "Books and Literature", "published": "2015-12-18", "section-taxonomy-id": "7B052F64-13C5-4631-ACE4-F1BAA9706061"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "27insidelist", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151225010611, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/books/review/inside-the-list.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/27/books/review/27list-rankine/27list-rankine-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Claudia Rankine\u2019s hard-to-classify \u201cCitizen\u201d stayed on the monthly race and civil rights best-seller list all year.", "title": "Inside the List"}, "pdate": 20151218, "des": "Books and Literature", "articleid": 100000004097708, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Inside the List", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/27/books/review/27list-rankine/27list-rankine-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "List"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think they are companions in a way that people aren\u2019t,\u201d Oliver told The Times when it was published in 2013.\nThe people who compile the Times lists aren\u2019t the only ones who have struggled to define Rankine\u2019s book.\nIn 2015, Claudia Rankine\u2019s \u201cCitizen\u201d stayed on the monthly race and civil rights list all year; it\u2019s currently No.\nOnly unleashed dogs can do that.\u201dPhoto and Verse: What was the most expensive work of poetry in 2015?\nTrue to its title, the book gathers poems (and one essay) about dogs."}
