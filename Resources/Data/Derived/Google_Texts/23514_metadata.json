(AP) - This may seem like the winter that will never end, but inside a grow room at Green Sense Farms it is forever summer.\n\nWith 70 degree temperatures and 70 percent humidity, basil, chives, cilantro, lettuce, parsley and dill are thriving.\n\nStacked on shelves that reach the ceiling of the nearly 100-cubic-foot grow room, the leafy vegetables and herbs are getting just the right amount of light via LED grow bulbs. They receive water and nutrients fed by technology.\n\nA second 100-cubic-foot grow room is getting readied to grow just lettuce.\n\nSoil isn\u2019t necessary here. Seeds are planted in coconut husk pucks, a renewable source excellent for seed germination because of its moisture retention abilities. Even the air that circulates in the room is controlled for the precise temperature, humidity and dust control.\n\n\u201cWe are just doing the old thing, only better. We are bringing food closer to the people,\u201d Robert Colangelo, manager and co-founder of Green Sense Farms, told The (Munster) Times (http://bit.ly/1dnoBc6). \u201cOur goal is to grow the best leafy greens and herbs in the world.\u201d\n\nThe farm can produce produce year around, renewing crops every 20 to 30 days.\n\nThe farm is under the watchful eye of Lane Patterson, the \u201cplant\u201d manager, who most recently spent nine years at the South Pole growing vegetables at a similar farm.\n\nThe Portage farm has been some four years in the works, said Colangelo, an Illinois native who hosts his own radio show and authored books on the environment. He found more and more people were talking about food.\n\nThe idea for the indoors urban garden went through many iterations, working with Phillips as its technology partner on lighting and conducting research with Purdue University.\n\n\u201cIt was being persistent and not quitting. It was a big challenge to find the right building, centrally located,\u201d Colangelo said.\n\nThey settled on 30,000 square feet within a building at AmeriPlex at the Port business park. Colangelo said a keys to the business are making it available to mass populations of urban areas and making it cost effective.\n\nColangelo said it took about 18 months to find the right building.\n\nBy locating in Portage, Green Sense Farms will be able to market locally grown vegetables and herbs to five states: Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin. It can serve about 40 million people in a 200-mile radius.\n\nMost of its customers are restaurants, grocers and produce sellers, including Whole Foods. It also will be selling to the general public when it officially opens April 1. The public will be able to purchase excess product and will be advised of its availability through social media and its website: greensensefarms.com.\n\n\u201cIn less than a year, both of those grow rooms will be filled. We\u2019ll be next embarking on a farm to institution project,\u201d he said. Colangelo said the farm is working with Purdue to establish a similar indoor farm that would be used to train agricultural students on indoor, organic gardening and supply produce to the university.\n\n\u201cOur motto is to reduce, reuse, recycle and get to a zero-waste facility,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cPart of our goal is to make Portage proud and make it a sustainable community.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times, http://www.thetimesonline.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "This may seem like the winter that will never end, but inside a grow room at Green Sense Farms it is forever summer.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/23/its-summer-all-the-time-at-nw-indiana-indoor-farm/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "This may seem like the winter that will never end, but inside a grow room at Green Sense Farms it is forever summer.", "title": "It\u2019s summer all the time at NW Indiana indoor farm"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "This may seem like the winter that will never end, but inside a grow room at Green Sense Farms it is forever summer.", "card": "summary", "title": "It\u2019s summer all the time at NW Indiana indoor farm"}, "Author": "JOYCE RUSSELL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Green Sense Farms, Robert Colangelo"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd974d\"", "article_summary": "A second 100-cubic-foot grow room is getting readied to grow just lettuce.\n(AP) - This may seem like the winter that will never end, but inside a grow room at Green Sense Farms it is forever summer.\nColangelo said the farm is working with Purdue to establish a similar indoor farm that would be used to train agricultural students on indoor, organic gardening and supply produce to the university.\n\u201cOur goal is to grow the best leafy greens and herbs in the world.\u201dThe farm can produce produce year around, renewing crops every 20 to 30 days.\nThe Portage farm has been some four years in the works, said Colangelo, an Illinois native who hosts his own radio show and authored books on the environment."}
