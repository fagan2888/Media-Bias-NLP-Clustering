The filing period closes Feb. 28.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s Sen. Kay Hagan, a Democrat, is seen as vulnerable in her bid for reelection in a race into which Americans for Prosperity is pouring $1.4 million in television advertising, linking Hagan with Obamacare.\n\nHagan will face Will Stewart and Fred Westphal in the May 6 Democratic primary. The Republican primary will pit perceived frontrunner state Speaker of the House Thom Tillis against Ted Alexander, Greg Brannon, Heather Grant, Mark Harris and Edward Kryn.\n\nThroughout the 18 westernmost counties of North Carolina, there will be 11 races for seats in the state House of Representatives, nine of which are currently held by Republicans.
