Associated Press\n\nIt is bad karma in sports to root for injuries of any kind for an opponent, but no one within the U.S. soccer community will shed many tears if reports of Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s ailing knee prove true.\n\nAccording to the Portuguese Sports Daily Record, Ronaldo cut his training short Wednesday to ice a knee that has been bothering him for the past several weeks. That isn\u2019t out of the ordinary, and Portugal\u2019s soccer association didn\u2019t release any statement on the matter.\n\nHowever, a not-completely-fit Ronaldo would be truly troublesome for Portugal, one of the favorites coming into the tournament but who have been bitten by the injury bug since the opening whistle Monday against Germany. Defender Fabio Coentrao and striker and Hugo Almeida suffered leg injuries in the first half that will keep them from playing Sunday. Coentrao appears out for the tournament and Almeida is out for the group stage. In addition, defender Pepe is suspended after being sent off for head-butting Thomas Muller.\n\nThe U.S. has its own injury issues. Jozy Altidore is out with a pulled hamstring and Clint Dempsey has a broken nose, but no one will ever confuse Altidore and Dempsey with Ronaldo and Coentrao.\n\nRonaldo was visibly struggling at the end of the game with Germany and also in recent training sessions.\n\nA spokesman for Portugal couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.\n\nWednesday was an off day for the U.S. team, which landed in S\u00e3o Paulo, at 4 a.m. Tuesday. The Americans held a light late-afternoon workout before returning to their downtown hotel.\n\nKlinsmann was as optimistic as possible about Altidore\u2019s future in the tournament Tuesday evening though it appeared bleak. \u201cAll you do as a coach is give him a positive hug and tell him, \u2018Listen, you\u2019ll be back and stay positive; you\u2019ll be back,\u201d\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t cut if off now.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I told him right away in the locker room as well. I keep him positive and we have big hope that he\u2019s coming back in this tournament.\u201d\n\nAs for who replaces Altidore, Aron Johannsson seems to be the most likely candidate. He replaced Altidore Monday night and played a serviceable, though hardly outstanding match.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go too deep into details, because obviously we want Portugal to guess a little bit as well, but you know when one of your key players is not available, does it change certain things? Absolutely it does,\u201d Klinsmann said. \u201cJozy is a very strong key player in our group, so we\u2019ll think about the right way to handle that situation. We\u2019ll still field 11, you know; we\u2019re not a man down.\u201d\n\nKlinsmann said defender Matt Besler, who strained a hamstring, is fine for Sunday. Dempsey may play with some sort of mask to protect his broken nose. The challenge will be breathing in the heat and humidity of Manaus.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Reports are surfacing that Cristiano Ronaldo could be out of the game with the USA, and maybe for the rest of the tournament.", "title": "Ronaldo Could Be Out of the U.S. Game, and Possibly the World Cup", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/dailyfix/2014/06/18/ronaldo-could-be-out-of-the-u-s-game-and-possibly-the-world-cup/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DH802_ronald_P_20140618140239.jpg"}, "site": "WSJDailyFix", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Life", "article.headline": "Ronaldo Could Be Out of the U.S. Game, and Possibly the World Cup", "description": "Reports are surfacing that Cristiano Ronaldo could be out of the game with the USA, and maybe for the rest of the tournament.", "article_section": "Life", "author": "Matthew Futterman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Daily Fix Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Daily Fix", "article.summary": "Reports are surfacing that Cristiano Ronaldo could be out of the game with the USA, and maybe for the rest of the tournament.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-18T18:04:28-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/dailyfix/2014/06/18/ronaldo-could-be-out-of-the-u-s-game-and-possibly-the-world-cup/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-DFB-21549", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Life", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Reports are surfacing that Cristiano Ronaldo could be out of the game with the USA, and maybe for the rest of the tournament.", "title": "Ronaldo Could Be Out of the U.S. Game, and Possibly the World Cup", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/dailyfix/2014/06/18/ronaldo-could-be-out-of-the-u-s-game-and-possibly-the-world-cup/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DH802_ronald_P_20140618140239.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Daily Fix", "article.id": "BL-DFB-21549", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-18T20:21:07-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd416d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAll you do as a coach is give him a positive hug and tell him, \u2018Listen, you\u2019ll be back and stay positive; you\u2019ll be back,\u201d\u201d he said.\nCristiano Ronaldo has ice put on his left knee after a training session of Portugal in Campinas, Brazil.\nRonaldo was visibly struggling at the end of the game with Germany and also in recent training sessions.\nJozy Altidore is out with a pulled hamstring and Clint Dempsey has a broken nose, but no one will ever confuse Altidore and Dempsey with Ronaldo and Coentrao.\nAccording to the Portuguese Sports Daily Record, Ronaldo cut his training short Wednesday to ice a knee that has been bothering him for the past several weeks."}
