The industry, which comprises health practitioners that primarily evaluate, diagnose and treat speech, language, cognitive-communication and swallowing disorders, typically services clients in schools, healthcare facilities and hospitals. In recent years, rising student enrollment rates have stimulated demand for the industry's diagnostic and treatment services. Most importantly, increased access to health insurance as a result of healthcare reform has better enabled individuals to afford industry services, as many speech-language pathology services are covered by health insurance. As a result, industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 2.6% during the five years to 2015, nearing $3.1 billion in 2015.\n\nThe passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010 has been a boon to the industry. According to IBISWorld Industry Analyst Dmitry Diment, \u201cUnder the healthcare reform law, subsidized state and federal healthcare exchanges have expanded private health insurance rolls since 2014 by mandating that all individuals obtain coverage or face a penalty. As a result, more individuals have obtained private health insurance coverage, better enabling them to access industry services.\u201d Moreover, the PPACA has increased the number of individuals with government health insurance by expanding access to Medicaid. Consequently, in states that decided to participate in the expanded Medicaid program, the number of people covered rose substantially. In states where Medicaid covers speech-language pathology services, industry operators have benefited substantially.\n\nThese trends are expected to continue in the next five years. \u201cGrowth of the industry's main markets, students and the elderly, is expected to remain strong,\u201d says Diment. \u201cIn particular, the aging of the population will increase demand for industry services because people typically require more medical care as they age.\u201d Although the PPACA will continue to increase access to industry services by expanding health insurance rolls, the industry is expected to face pressure from falling Medicare reimbursement rates, stymying profit growth. Nonetheless, revenue is projected to continue rising during the five years to 2020.\n\nFor more information, visit IBISWorld\u2019s Speech-Language Pathologists in the US industry report page.\n\nFollow IBISWorld on Twitter: https://twitter.com/#!/IBISWorld\n\nFriend IBISWorld on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/IBISWorld/121347533189\n\nIBISWorld industry Report Key Topics\n\nThis industry comprises establishments of health practitioners that primarily evaluate, diagnose and treat speech, language, cognitive-communication and swallowing disorders.\n\nIndustry Performance\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nKey External Drivers\n\nCurrent Performance\n\nIndustry Outlook\n\nIndustry Life Cycle\n\nProducts & Markets\n\nSupply Chain\n\nProducts & Services\n\nMajor Markets\n\nGlobalization & Trade\n\nBusiness Locations\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nMarket Share Concentration\n\nKey Success Factors\n\nCost Structure Benchmarks\n\nBarriers to Entry\n\nMajor Companies\n\nOperating Conditions\n\nCapital Intensity\n\nKey Statistics\n\nIndustry Data\n\nAnnual Change\n\nKey Ratios\n\nAbout IBISWorld Inc.\n\nRecognized as the nation\u2019s most trusted independent source of industry and market research, IBISWorld offers a comprehensive database of unique information and analysis on every US industry.
