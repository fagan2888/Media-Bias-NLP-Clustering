I am honored to stand with the United Steelworkers as we fight to maintain the economy ladder of opportunity that leads to prosperity, allowing the children of labor everywhere to inherit a better country than they found.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe brothers and sisters of USW 1196 are proud to endorse Erin McClelland in her bid to be the next representative of Pennsylvania\u2019s 12th Congressional district,\u201d USW 1196 President Fran Arabia said. \u201cWe need more people like that in Congress, and we\u2019re confident Erin McClelland will be a champion for working families.\u201d\n\nThe McClelland campaign noted that the Gamesa USA wind turbine plant in Cambria County recently closed, a development they blamed on GOP Rep. Keith Rothfus and his complicity in letting a wind energy tax credit expire.\n\nThis is the second union endorsement of the week for McClelland, who also earned the backing of the IBEW 29 on Tuesday.\n\nMcClelland is currently competing against John Hugya, former Rep. John Murtha\u2019s Chief of Staff and a Korean War veteran, for the Democratic nomination in the 12th district.\n\nFebruary 27th, 2014 | Posted in Congress, Front Page Stories, Top Stories | 1 Comment", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic candidate secured the backing of the influential steelworkers union.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/pa-12-mcclelland-endorsed-by-usw-local-1196/55587/", "description": "The Democratic candidate secured the backing of the influential steelworkers union.", "title": "PA-12: McClelland Endorsed by USW Local 1196"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7b6\"", "article_summary": "PA-12: McClelland Endorsed by USW Local 1196Written by Nick Field, Contributing WriterDemocratic Congressional candidate Erin McClelland received the endorsement today of the United Steelworkers Local 1196.\nThe 1196 is the oldest USW local in the United States and it represents the workers of the ATI Allegheny Ludlum.\n\u201cI grew up in the Alle-Kiski Valley and have friends and family that have worked at Allegheny Ludlum,\u201d McClelland responded.\n\u201cUSW 1196 represents the heart of what was once called \u2018Death Valley\u2019 due to the many men and women who died fighting for safe working conditions, fair wages, and a reasonable workday.\nThis is the second union endorsement of the week for McClelland, who also earned the backing of the IBEW 29 on Tuesday."}
