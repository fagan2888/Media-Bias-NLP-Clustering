North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System battled through a sluggish first half, with the Great Neck, N.Y.-based health system still feeling the financial chill from last year's icy, bitter-cold winter.The poor weather led to decreases in patient volumes, especially for scheduled procedures, officials said in a financial disclosure to bondholders (PDF) . It also had to deal with higher temporary staffing, snow removal and utility costs.In addition, North Shore-LIJ is still in the early stages of launching and running its own health insurance operation , North Shore-LIJ CareConnect, which started offering commercial and Medicaid managed-care plans late last year. The plans are available both on and off New York's insurance exchange, created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

North Shore-LIJ is still working to staff and build its insurance arm, which has driven up expenses, executives said. In the first half of 2014, North Shore-LIJ's health insurance companies brought in more than $32 million in premium revenue.North Shore-LIJ's operating margin in the first six months of this year (PDF) totaled 1.1%, down from 1.7% in the same period in 2013. Revenue increased 4.9% to $3.6 billion as more volumes shifted to the outpatient setting. However, expenses increased at a faster 5.5% clip, leaving the system with a $38.1 million operating surplus. That's down more than a third from $57.2 million recorded in the first half of 2013.However, like many other health systems , investment income made up for much of the decline on the operations side. North Shore-LIJ's total surplus rose almost 25% to $122.2 million. That equated to a 3.4% overall margin, compared with 2.9% in the first six months last year.North Shore-LIJ has 15 hospitals, according to its website, and is the dominant provider on New York's Long Islandâ€”and it's in the process of nabbing several facilities outside of its main service area. The system has signed initial deals this year to take over 189-bed Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y., and 238-bed Phelps Memorial Hospital in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.Earlier this month, North Shore-LIJ also signed a deal with the Cleveland Clinic to become the Clinic's exclusive heart partner in New York. North Shore-LIJ will be able to perform cardiovascular services for anyone within the Cleveland Clinic's national network of large employers in exchange for a management fee.Follow Bob Herman on Twitter: @MHbherman
