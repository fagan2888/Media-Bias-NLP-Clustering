So much so, in fact, that the health system is hiring for the newly created position of senior vice president of population health.\n\n\n\nThe idea is to find someone who can help accelerate MetroHealth\u2019s transformation from a health system that only cares for people when they\u2019re sick into one that keeps people healthy. This individual, who will report directly to MetroHealth CEO Dr. Akram Boutros, will develop and lead programs that will help the system find the root causes of patients\u2019 health risks and \u201cupstream our intervention to make the biggest impact,\u201d according to an email from Boutros.\n\n\n\nThis, of course, isn\u2019t MetroHealth\u2019s first foray in the population health arena.\n\n\n\nAs Medicaid eligibility expanded under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and before that, through an experimental waiver in Cuyahoga County \u2014 the health system has retooled itself to manage the health care of these challenging populations. Some of those efforts include the usual targeted outreach to high-risk patients. Other efforts include offering patients transportation and even legal assistance.\n\n\n\nThe health system has also taken over the local care coordination efforts for CareSource, a nonprofit Medicaid managed care plan, and launched a Medicare accountable care organization. \u2014 Timothy Magaw\n\n\n\n\n\nGiant Tonka truck revs up smiles at Clinic\n\nThe Ford Motor Co. brought a bigger-than-life-size Tonka truck \u2014 and plenty of presents \u2014 to the Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s Hospital for Rehabilitation on Thursday, July 30, for a Christmas in July event.\n\n\n\nThe vehicle has a dump truck body on one of Ford\u2019s prototypes for a model year 2016 F-750 truck, said Mark Lowrey, marketing manager for the F-series fleet trucks. The company worked with Funrise Toy Corp., which has a license from Hasbro for the Tonka brand, to create the truck with the Tonka labels and in the trucks\u2019 \u201ciconic\u201d yellow.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe general public has really taken to this,\u201d Lowrey said.\n\n\n\nThe vehicle was debuted at a truck show in March and has made appearances at kid-friendly events, Lowrey said, but the visit to the hospital was the first of its kind. Ford has a big presence in the Cleveland area, and the F-650 and F-750 will be made at the Avon Lake plant. The company wanted to do something for the community and show its commitment for the Cleveland area, Lowrey said. The toys were donated by Funrise. \u2014 Rachel Abbey McCafferty\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall business center goes to college\n\nSmall business owners on the far East Side now have plenty of free expertise under one roof.\n\n\n\nThe Ohio Small Business Development Center serving Lake and Geauga counties has moved to Lakeland Community College. Previously, the program had been co-sponsored by the Lake County Ohio Port and Economic Development Authority and split between two locations in Painesville and Kirtland.\n\n\n\nThe new location, located off Interstate 90 at the state Route 306 exit, will allow small business owners the opportunity to access the college\u2019s other resources catered toward the business community, including free access to fully equipped, professional office space.\n\n\n\nAll of the resources from the Ohio Small Business Development Center will continue and are still free to residents of Lake and Geauga counties who own or want to start a small business. They can seek help with business planning, market research, human resources, regulatory guidance and finding capital and financing. \u2014 Timothy Magaw\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Behind the news with Crain's Cleveland Business writers.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Cleveland Business", "description": "Behind the news with Crain's Cleveland Business writers.", "title": "Reporters' Notebook: Aug. 3, 2015", "url": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20150802/NEWS/150739927/reporters-notebook-aug-3-2015", "image": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/assets/cc/CCLB_Iconv2.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainscleveland", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#a91d38", "fb": {"app_id": 730748806957003}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "published_time": "2015-08-02T04:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-02T08:27:00-04:00"}, "verify-v1": "Q00KiEdlx7oJ8JL4E1sfoHDh6tgQLZQyOh8A1oVCsIs=", "theme-color": "#a91d38"}, "article_summary": "So much so, in fact, that the health system is hiring for the newly created position of senior vice president of population health.\n\u2014 Timothy MagawGiant Tonka truck revs up smiles at ClinicThe Ford Motor Co. brought a bigger-than-life-size Tonka truck \u2014 and plenty of presents \u2014 to the Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s Hospital for Rehabilitation on Thursday, July 30, for a Christmas in July event.\nThis, of course, isn\u2019t MetroHealth\u2019s first foray in the population health arena.\nAll of the resources from the Ohio Small Business Development Center will continue and are still free to residents of Lake and Geauga counties who own or want to start a small business.\nThe idea is to find someone who can help accelerate MetroHealth\u2019s transformation from a health system that only cares for people when they\u2019re sick into one that keeps people healthy."}
