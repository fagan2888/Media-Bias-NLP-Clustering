Or that it could cause more global crises in the next few years?\n\nThat\u2019s the argument of Benn Steil, a prominent economist who recently wrote a well-received book on the 1944 Bretton Woods conference that led to the creation of the IMF and World Bank. He\u2019s now director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nSteil points out that investors dumped Ukrainian bonds in the summer of 2013 after the Fed initially began to signal publicly that it would soon begin to taper \u2013 or cut purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. The panic among investors sent interest rates soaring on Ukrainian bonds and made it harder for the government to finance its operations.\n\nThe result: then-Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych spurned economic ties with Europe, in Steil\u2019s telling, and turned to Russia for help to ease a growing financial crisis. The stunning reversal led to massive civil demonstrations that forced Yanukovych to flee and induced Russia to invade and annex the Crimean region of Ukraine.\n\nIn an article in Foreign Affairs, Steil says the Fed is legally bound by U.S. law to take the necessary steps to heal the economy with little regard for the global consequences. Yet he points out that countries around the world might take defensive action to protect themselves \u2013 perhaps by manipulating the value of their currencies \u2013 and Steil says U.S. political leaders should cut them some slack.\n\n\u201cIf Washington can\u2019t lead,\u201d Steil says, \u201cit should at least get out of the way.\u201d\n\n- Jeffry Bartash\n\nFollow Jeffry on Twitter @jbartash\n\nFollow Capitol Report on Twitter @capitolreport\n\nMore must-reads from MarketWatch:\n\nThe crazy reason this woman couldn\u2019t get Obamacare\n\nFed\u2019s Yellen ain\u2019t all that confident about the economy, either", "article_metadata": {"article.author": "MarketWatch", "description": "One author says the Federal Reserve helped stir the upheaval in Ukraine.", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "article.id": "BL-MWEB-6417", "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "One author says the Federal Reserve helped stir the upheaval in Ukraine.", "title": "How the Fed helped cause Ukraine crisis", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/06/19/how-the-fed-helped-cause-ukraine-crisis/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "One author says the Federal Reserve helped stir the upheaval in Ukraine.", "title": "How the Fed helped cause Ukraine crisis", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/06/19/how-the-fed-helped-cause-ukraine-crisis/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.published": "2014-06-19T11:42:43-04:00", "article.access": "free", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "article.type": "Capitol Report", "article.page": "Capitol Report Blog", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/06/19/how-the-fed-helped-cause-ukraine-crisis/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article.created": "2014-06-19T11:42:43-04:00", "article.updated": "2014-06-19T11:44:32-04:00", "keywords": "economy,Federal Reserve,interest rates,Ukraine", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "article.section": "Blogs", "article.headline": "How the Fed helped cause Ukraine crisis", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "economy,Federal Reserve,interest rates,Ukraine"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe08f5\"", "article_summary": "Did you know the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to withdraw stimulus from the U.S. economy helped caused the political upheaval in Ukraine?\nAFP/Getty Images Fed\u2019s Janet Yellen can\u2019t help but cause crisis somewhere in the world.\nThe stunning reversal led to massive civil demonstrations that forced Yanukovych to flee and induced Russia to invade and annex the Crimean region of Ukraine.\nSteil points out that investors dumped Ukrainian bonds in the summer of 2013 after the Fed initially began to signal publicly that it would soon begin to taper \u2013 or cut purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.\nThe result: then-Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych spurned economic ties with Europe, in Steil\u2019s telling, and turned to Russia for help to ease a growing financial crisis."}
