The report, \"Analysis of Rehabilitation and Habilitation in Qualified Heath Plans,\" explains how Marketplace plans cover rehabilitation and habilitation services.\n\n\n\n\"This updated analysis is part of AOTA's ongoing efforts to monitor and influence how occupational therapy is covered in ACA Marketplaces,\" said Frederick P. Somers, Chief Executive Officer of AOTA. \"Consumer access to occupational therapy services is often critically important to their ability to fully participate in everyday life activities, whether it is an adult recovering from illness or injury or a child with a disability trying to engage as fully as possible in school or play.\"\n\n\n\nThe full 2016 report can be read at www.aota.org/ehb-update.\n\n\n\nA consumer looking for information about occupational therapy coverage should be able to tell whether occupational therapy is covered under rehabilitation and habilitation, the number of visits covered or any quantitative limits on occupational therapy services and whether the deductible applies to occupational therapy services.\n\n\n\nAOTA created a previous report in the summer of 2014 when millions of Americans began using their ACA Marketplace plans for the first time. According to AOTA's analysis of hundreds of insurance plans, around 19% of Summaries of Benefits and Coverages (SBCs) included all three characteristics in 2016, up from fewer than 9% in 2014.\n\n\n\nThe findings in the 2016 report are similar to those in 2014: In many cases consumers still do not have access to adequate information about rehabilitative and habilitative benefits, and some plans still seem to not be complying with state benchmark standards for rehabilitation and habilitation. The lack of adequate information is particularly pronounced for habilitative services.\n\n\n\n\"AOTA urges policymakers, insurance companies and others to review how these services are being covered and the information available to consumers,\" Somers said. \"The promise of the [ACA] cannot be fully realized unless consumers have the complete range of information they need to make informed health insurance decisions.\"\n\nDaily News Watch Archives\n\n", "article_metadata": {"title": "AOTA Report Analyzes Affordable Care Act Coverage of Occupational Therapy", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "1D3D12CA6B4BD31B466486D3472E9E23", "google-site-verification": "_P1g32CdeDQoP1lIgYJpFOk1n5_NNKdkm19sby11xjI", "verify-v1": "OnOXGFlrpbkMSS3mTXziAzzjc9Yf2dJbhcL5moFcTGg=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A consumer looking for information about occupational therapy coverage should be able to tell whether occupational therapy is covered under rehabilitation and habilitation, the number of visits covered or any quantitative limits on occupational therapy services and whether the deductible applies to occupational therapy services.\nPrint Article Email Article BETHESDA, MD-The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), unveiled an updated report analyzing Marketplace plans available under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\nThe report, \"Analysis of Rehabilitation and Habilitation in Qualified Heath Plans,\" explains how Marketplace plans cover rehabilitation and habilitation services.\n\"This updated analysis is part of AOTA's ongoing efforts to monitor and influence how occupational therapy is covered in ACA Marketplaces,\" said Frederick P.
