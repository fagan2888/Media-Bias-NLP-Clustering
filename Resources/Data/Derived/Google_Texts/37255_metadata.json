They should be. This week\u2019s pitiful economic growth scorecard of 0.2 percent economic growth for the first quarter of this year means the Obama slow-growth machine grinds onward. It\u2019s the slowest recovery in a half-century. The \u201cSummer of Recovery\u201d Joe Biden promised back in 2009 still hasn\u2019t arrived \u2014 six years later.\n\nThis is a national crisis, not any less significant than the burning of Baltimore last week. Actually, the two may be tied together. Economist Arthur Laffer shows that racial rioting in big cities is negatively associated with an economic growth rate. In the late 1960s and 1970s, cities become war zones, but the rioting almost entirely disappeared in the high-flying 1980s and 1990s, when incomes were rising and job growth surged. Under President Obama\u2019s slow-growth economy, urban unrest is bubbling over.\n\nThe attached figure compares the growth rate for this recovery versus those over the past 50 years. We are $1.6 trillion lower on current gross domestic product than we should be. Even more amazing: With a Reagan-style recovery, we\u2019d have $2.5 trillion more output and income today. On average, every family in America would have $20,000 more annual income. That\u2019s the crisis that has Americans feeling so angry. It is, to borrow a phrase from Mr. Obama about the Baltimore riots, \u201ca slow-rolling crisis.\u201d He could have meant the economy.\n\nOne finding in this latest GDP report is especially worrisome. Business \u201cnonresidential fixed investment\u201d \u2014 which is spending by companies on plant, equipment, facilities and technology fell by 3.4 percent. Spending on structures fell by an astounding 23 percent. This business spending statistic is a fairly good leading indicator of where the economy is headed. Business investment in this recovery has been slow, and that may be a result of the business bashing that goes on in Washington month after month. The Obama tax increases on capital gains and dividends \u2014 which are direct taxes on the returns from business investment \u2014 haven\u2019t helped, either.\n\nWhen we get bad news like this, there\u2019s always some excuse from the White House. The weather. The labor strike at the ports this winter. Ebola. The euro-crisis. George W. Bush. Maybe next they can blame Herbert Hoover.\n\nSome economists on the left such as Paul Krugman of The New York Times are blaming fiscal and monetary \u201causterity\u201d in America and Europe. Austerity? The U.S. government has borrowed $7 trillion in six years. The Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet has expanded by $3.5 trillion. This is austerity?\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Obama is still trying valiantly to put lipstick on this economic pig. His spin forever will be that he saved America from a second Great Depression. Really? Mr. Obama\u2019s own White House estimates on job growth show that the economy performed worse than it would have without the trillions of dollars of government borrowing. In other words, we would have been better off not borrowing $830 billion back in 2009.\n\nA new book by James Grant titled \u201cThe Forgotten Depression\u201d should be required reading at the White House. It tells the story of the early 1920s when the economy crashed after Woodrow Wilson\u2019s disastrous \u201cprogressivism.\u201d When the economy tanked, President Harding simply let the recession burn itself out. By doing so, along with the Harding-Coolidge tax cuts, the result was the Roaring \u201820s, which was one of the most prosperous decades in American history.\n\nFortunately, there are natural tailwinds that should accelerate growth over the next year or so. Low energy prices are an underappreciated stimulus. The strong dollar is bringing record amounts of new investment and construction to the United States. Profits, especially for the tech sector and companies such as Apple and Google are still very high.\n\nBut there\u2019s no getting back that nearly $2 trillion of GDP that is now permanently missing. It\u2019s one reason for black rage in the cities. The Obama growth deficit is this president\u2019s enduring legacy. We can now officially declare Obamanomics a grand failed experiment. Let\u2019s hope the history books get it right so we are never, ever foolish enough to try this again.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Moore is a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a Fox News contributor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Are the alarm bells finally clanging at the White House and in Congress?
