More than half are between 45 and 64. One needn\u2019t be a doctor, or a mathematician, to grasp the negative implications for rates within the insurance exchanges.\n\n\u201cIf you want young people to sign up maybe you shouldn\u2019t have made the law so that you can stay on your parents\u2019 plan until you turn 26,\u201d joked Jimmy Kimmel. The late-night host played a skit featuring a near-retirement couple listing their various medications. \u201cBut fortunately,\u201d Martha explains, \u201cwe don\u2019t have to pay for it.\u201d \u201cYou do,\u201d Alex tells the viewers. His wife matter-of-factly reports, \u201cYou young people are paying for our drugs and our doctors.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s truth in comedy. An Affordable Care Act that infantilizes adults by enabling them to remain on their parents\u2019 plans as though still children further infantilizes them in its marketing. The president banks on the stupidity of young people, the constituency that, save for African Americans, he most owes his power to. Why would \u201cJulia\u201d and \u201cPajama Boy\u201d enroll in Obamacare for benevolent reasons? People sign up for government programs for subsidies, not to subsidize.\n\nThis reality has prompted a governmental disinformation campaign unrivaled in American history. Thankfully, the marketing, like the website, appears as the handiwork of government incompetents the likes of which even the most cynical Tea Partier couldn\u2019t dream up.\n\nPajama Boy projected the administration\u2019s image of its ideal male \u2014 castrated, dependent, weak, a beta-being so unthreatening as to be ideally suited to lead into Rachel Maddow on primetime. That image \u2014 diametrically at odds with the one employed to recruit young men to fight the nation\u2019s wars \u2014 thankfully spoke to few possessing the XY chromosomes.\n\nThe inability to convince young Americans to bankroll older, wealthier Americans through Obamacare as they already do through Social Security has set the administration and its boosters into panic mode. Obamacare isn\u2019t getting young people in part because Obama doesn\u2019t get young people. Most 52-year-old men don\u2019t.\n\nEnlisting Magic Johnson, a grandfather whose initial NBA retirement occurred before the births of most of the graduating members of the college class of \u201914, to implore young people to sign up for Obamacare exemplifies this. \u201cYoung people think they\u2019re Superman, like nothing\u2019s ever going to happen to them,\u201d the Hall of Famer observed in a YouTube clip. \u201cBut, trust me: someday something\u2019s going to happen. And you\u2019re going to need a quality health plan. So, make sure you get Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBut when young people think \u201cObamacare\u201d they don\u2019t think \u201cquality health plan.\u201d They think intergenerational scam.\n\nIf generation iPhone doesn\u2019t identify with the NBA star last seen on the court wearing tall socks and short shorts, then the administration might next try Bob Cousy or the Big O to reach the kids. Magic\u2019s message merely proved the administration chronologically confused. Other gimmicks insult the target audience. The administration\u2019s acolytes in Colorado, for instance, imagine young men as imbeciles and young women as sluts.\n\n\u201cOMG, he\u2019s hot! Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s as easy to get as this birth control,\u201d explains a woman in a government advert for Obamacare that inadvertently doubles as a public service announcement regarding herpes. \u201cMy health insurance covers the pill, which means all I have to worry about is getting him between the covers.\u201d \u201cKeg stands are crazy,\u201d explains an ad that touts \u201cBrosurance.\u201d \u201cNot having health insurance is crazier.\u201d The graphic depicts three morons doing their best impersonation of the Alpha Betas from Revenge of the Nerds.\n\nThe propaganda, in the style of a Chris Christie Hurricane Sandy television spot, issues a \u201cthanks obamacare\u201d shout out to the great leader. How ungrateful 73 million millennials are for not saying a \u201cthanks obamacare\u201d by signing up.\n\nThe \u201980s-ish garb donned by the \u201cBros for Life\u201d depicted in the surreally stupid ad indicate, like Magic\u2019s failed assist, that older people, who stand to benefit from the participation of younger people in Obamacare, came up with the campaign. They\u2019re about as fluent in the lingo of youth as Joe Friday on late-sixties-era Dragnet, only they don\u2019t know it.\n\nThe Obamacare salesmen relate to twentysomethings as caricatures, not real people. The ads reflect this visually in the manner that the actual program does economically. The administration expected an entire demographic to act against its interests.\n\nCartoons and imaginary friends may do this. Flesh-and-blood people rarely do.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "So, make sure you get Obamacare.\u201dBut when young people think \u201cObamacare\u201d they don\u2019t think \u201cquality health plan.\u201d They think intergenerational scam.\nThe administration\u2019s acolytes in Colorado, for instance, imagine young men as imbeciles and young women as sluts.\nWhy would \u201cJulia\u201d and \u201cPajama Boy\u201d enroll in Obamacare for benevolent reasons?\nThat image \u2014 diametrically at odds with the one employed to recruit young men to fight the nation\u2019s wars \u2014 thankfully spoke to few possessing the XY chromosomes.\nPajama Boy projected the administration\u2019s image of its ideal male \u2014 castrated, dependent, weak, a beta-being so unthreatening as to be ideally suited to lead into Rachel Maddow on primetime."}
