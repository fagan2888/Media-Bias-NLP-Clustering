The MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference is now in its ninth year. What started as a small data-centric gathering of a few dozen people has exploded to a massive all-encompassing sports business convention. This year's conference brought 3,100 people to Boston, a growth of 55 percent over last year.

Jessica Gelman is the conference's chair and co-founder. She spoke with CNBC about some of the trends she is seeing this year. Gelman's day job is at Kraft Sports Group, owners of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.

"People are trying to keep pace with all of the analytics out there, and that is where all the data and tech firms come to play," said Gelman in response to a question about how big a presence the startup and venture capital community has become at the conference.

While baseball and basketball have led the way in the analytics revolution, soccer is only now starting to find its moment. "What we saw with the World Cup this past summer was incredible," says Gelman.
