Buckley, Politics News\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s op-ed in the New York Times marks the whimpering end of an unholy alliance. The letter itself was a ham-handed attempt to capture the 2016 evangelical vote before Sen. Ted Cruz does. But the very crudity of his piece revealed that the union at the heart of Movement Conservatism is ripping apart.\n\nIn his op-ed, Jindal undertook to explain to business leaders how Movement Conservatism works. Its political strategy, he lectured, \u201crequires populist social conservatives to ally with the business community on economic matters and corporate titans to side with social conservatives on cultural matters.\u201d The governor is right: Since the 1980s big business interests have managed to secure policies that have concentrated wealth at the very top of the economic ladder, and they have managed their coup only with the help of the votes of social conservatives.\n\nBut Jindal\u2019s hyperbolic posturing as he warns \u201cany corporation\u201d \u201cbullying\u201d social conservatives into accepting same-sex marriage to \u201cSave your breath,\u201d reveals a touchstone moment: This grand alliance is over.\n\nIts end has been a long time coming. The toxic amalgam of economic and social reactionaries that Jindal identified began to mix after the Second World War. Americans in that era rallied behind the New Deal consensus. Reactionary businessmen loathed business regulation and taxation, but had no luck convincing voters to turn against the policies most saw as important safeguards against another Great Depression. Then, in 1951, a wealthy young writer suggested that social issues might be the way to break popular support for the New Deal. William F. Buckley, Jr. advanced the idea that unfettered capitalism and Christianity should be considered fundamental American values that could not be questioned. According to him, anyone who called for an active government or a secular society was an anti-American collectivist in league with international communism.\n\nFew Americans paid much attention to an argument that equated even Republican President Eisenhower\u2019s wildly successful capitalist economy with communism. But desegregation gave Buckley\u2019s Movement Conservatism the popular social issue it needed to turn Americans against an active government. The year after the Supreme Court handed down the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision outlawing segregation, Buckley launched his National Review, which quickly tied business regulation to unpopular desegregation of public schools. Buckley hired Virginia newspaper editor James Kilpatrick to assure readers that an active government that protected the rights of black Americans undermined American \u201cfreedom.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Review, Eisenhower\u2019s 1957 use of the troops to desegregate Little Rock High School illustrated the New Deal\u2019s destruction of America itself. The troops escorting black students into white schools were paid with tax dollars. This, in the formulation of Buckley and his allies, was a redistribution of wealth. Congress levied taxes on white people, forcing them to pay their hard-earned money into the treasury, which government officials turned around and used to give unearned advantages to poor blacks. Desegregation enabled Movement Conservatives to describe American \u201cfreedom\u201d as a marriage of social conservatism to unfettered capitalism.\n\nThis odd formulation, in which equality became inequality and fairness turned into unfairness, slid into the fringes of the Republican Party with the rise of Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona as a national figure. His supporters launched his 1960 candidacy for the presidential nomination with a declaration of Movement Conservative principles, ghost-written by Buckley\u2019s brother-in-law. \u201cThe Conscience of a Conservative\u201d maintained that government protection for African-Americans was unconstitutional. It undermined property rights by redistributing tax dollars, and thus destroyed \u201cliberty.\u201d Goldwater captured the Republican presidential nomination in 1964, but voters revealed the unpopularity of his ideas when he carried only his home state of Arizona and the five states of the Deep South: South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. It seemed the union of big business and social conservatism had collapsed.\n\nBut, over the next 20 years, that alliance would strengthen until it came to dominate American politics.\n\nOne of Goldwater\u2019s key supporters in 1964 was an actor and spokesman for General Electric: Ronald Reagan. In a folksy televised speech just before the election, Reagan called out a dangerously intrusive government run by out-of-touch elites. America faced a clear choice. On the one hand was \u201cindividual freedom;\u201d on the other, \u201cthe ant heap of totalitarianism.\u201d When Reagan made a strong push for the 1968 presidential nomination, and George Wallace ran on a third-party ticket, Eisenhower\u2019s far more moderate vice president Richard Nixon had little choice but to promise Goldwater voters in the Deep South that he would bow to their racial prejudices. This was the \u201cSouthern Strategy,\u201d as Republican political operative Lee Atwater later explained in a vicious 1981 interview in which he deployed the n-word freely. Rather than explicitly invoking racism, he said, Movement Conservatives talked about desegregation, states\u2019 rights and cutting taxes. Economic language didn\u2019t create the same backlash because it was far more abstract than racial slurs, but it accomplished the same thing. It equated an activist government with the redistribution of white wealth to minorities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wall Street and religious right were a winning team \u2014 for the rich.
