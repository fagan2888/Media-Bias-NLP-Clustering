Photo: Getty Images\n\nAnte Covic and Shannon Cole have committed their futures to Western Sydney Wanderers after signing contract extensions with the A\u2013League premiers.\n\nCovic, the Wanderers veteran goalkeeper, was coming off contract at the end of the season but quashed any suggestions that he was set to hang up his gloves at the season's end. Instead, he will continue his tenure between the posts at Parramatta Stadium for at least one more year.\n\nThe 38 year-old was named the goalkeeper of the year last season and is targeting a return to the national steam as a result of his form with the Wanderers, whom he will continue playing for at least until the end of the 2014/15 season.\n\nVersatile: Shannon Cole has extended his deal at Parramatta until the end of the 2015/16 season. Photo: Brendan Esposito\n\n\"I'm obviously very happy with signing for another year. I've been here since day one and as long as my performances are up to scratch, I'm in line for a new offer,\" Covic said. \"I want to continue playing and I'm playing well and I have a great drive to keep playing. It was an easy and comfortable decision to sign a new deal.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShannon Cole was rewarded for his recent form with a two-year contract extension. Cole has flourished in more of an attacking role at the Wanderers and his new deal will tie him to the club until the end of the 2015/16 season.
