Although some people weren\u2019t overly impressed with the experience, this didn\u2019t stop the company from moving an impressive number of copies during the first week of release.\n\nAccording to the Daily Star, Watch Dogs sold approximately four million copies during its first seven days on retail shelves. This essentially makes it one of the most successful launches in gaming history.\n\n\u201cThe results we achieved in the first week of launch are amazing and prove Ubisoft\u2019s commitment to developing new blockbuster IP and thoroughly new-gen experiences,\u201d company sales director Darren Bowen explained.\n\nNot surprisingly, Ubisoft recently announced that Watch Dogs is officially a franchise. In fact, Gamespot reports that work has already begun on the next installment of the series. However, it\u2019s unclear if the company intends to crank out sequels as fast as Assassin\u2019s Creed.\n\n\u201cWith such strong sales momentum and positive feedback from gamers, \u2018Watch Dogs\u2019 has positioned itself as the must-have game of the moment. We\u2019re really proud of this achievement, and are confident that the \u2018Watch Dogs\u2019 brand has a promising future. We have a movie deal already for \u2018Watch Dogs.\u2019 So yeah, I\u2019d call it a franchise.\u201d Ubisoft marketing executive Tony Key recently explained.\n\nAlthough Watch Dogs took over half a decade to develop, apparently the company is hoping to get a sequel on retail shelves in a much shorter timeframe.\n\nCreative director Jonathan Morin told Eurogamer earlier this year:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not going to be the same amount of time if we ever embark on such a journey. A big part of it was defining whatever \u2018Watch Dogs\u2019 is. Once you have that starting point, then what becomes interesting is what players want more of \u2014 what comes next? Especially with the delay we have just been really concentrating on getting it [the original \u2018Watch Dogs\u2019] launched. After that we\u2019ll see where it goes \u2014 I think Ubisoft is showing more and more that they\u2019re willing to take the time for it to be right.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Watch Dogs fans who can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s in store for hacking hero Adrien Pierce, we don\u2019t have a release date for the sequel as of this writing. Are you happy that Ubisoft plans to turn the game into a full-blown franchise? What would you like to see more of in the follow-up?\n\n[Image via Ubisoft]", "article_metadata": {"description": "One thing's for certain: Expect more Watch Dogs installments in the near future.
