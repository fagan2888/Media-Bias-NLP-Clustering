Each ad is targeted at a specific group: young adults, women and minorities. Ad designers say they hope their creations will go \u201cviral\u201d and draw more healthy people to the federal and state-run exchanges.\n\nHowever, the groups\u2019 tactics seem to be drawing more frenzied disapproval than fervor for the ACA.\n\nOne ad\u2014labeled \u201chosurance\u201d by critics\u2014urges women to get health insurance that covers birth control so they can land a \u201chot guy.\u201d Another boasts, \u201cKeg stands are crazy. Not having health insurance is crazier. Don\u2019t tap into your beer money to cover those medical bills. We got it covered.\u201d\n\nEven actor Ryan Gosling was used to appeal to younger Americans. Drawing on the popularity of the \u201cHey Girl\u201d meme featuring Gosling, one of the \u201cGot Insurance?\u201d ads reads, \u201cHey girl, you\u2019re excited about easy access to birth control and I\u2019m excited about getting to know you.\u201d\n\nThe ads have been condemned by critics from both sides of the political aisle. Conservative talk show host Dana Loesch called them \u201cthe \u2018You\u2019re a whore\u2019 ad for Obamacare,\u201d while the left-leaning Planned Parenthood Votes Colorado actually thought the ads were a parody created by opponents of healthcare reform.\n\n\u201cUnfortunate that anti-Obamacare folks are slut-shaming women who use birth control,\u201d the group tweeted.\n\nAdam Fox, the director of strategic engagement for the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, isn\u2019t too bothered by the controversy the ad campaign has generated, however.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been fun to watch how it all plays out,\u201d Fox told Business Insider. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen both positive and negative reactions, but if people are seeing the ads and purchasing health insurance, that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nPhoto Source: DoYouGotInsurance.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/non-profits/racy-obamacare-ads-stir-controversy-16202.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/gotinsurance.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "Brosurance?
