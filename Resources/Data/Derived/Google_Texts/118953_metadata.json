( Courtesy photo )\n\nTrevor Thomas called it the world's highest-stakes game of connect-the-dots.\n\nHe recently hiked the Colorado Trail \u2014 489 miles from Denver to Durango.\n\nAlone and blind.\n\nThe lengthy, rugged terrain that crosses eight mountain ranges and six national forests is challenging for even seasoned hikers, let alone someone with a disability such as Thomas'. The full trek typically takes four to six weeks to conquer.\n\n\"The list of things I had to deal with that other hikers don't is very long,\" Thomas says.\n\nMaps and trailheads aren't written in braille. Bridges are sometimes washed out and trails newly diverted in directions not marked on maps. Then there are the logistics of simply setting up the tent, never knowing what's for dinner (every package feels the same) and the inability to see a storm on the horizon.\n\nTrevor Thomas and Tennille encounter snow at Segment 25 of the Colorado Trail.

In 2001, Erik Weihenmayer made it to the top of Mount Everest, and he completed the Seven Summits in 2008, traveling with a team. Weihenmayer went blind from retinoschisis as a teenager.\n\nLike Weihenmayer, Thomas was born with vision. When he was earning an economics degree at the University of Colorado-Boulder and lived an active, adrenaline-packed life in Boulder, he could see.\n\nIt was after he moved to Charlotte, N.C., and turned 35 that he noticed his vision had grown a little blurry, especially at nighttime when he was driving. He went to the eye doctor to get glasses, like many members of his family had done as they grew older.\n\n\"That started an eight-month nightmare, seeing every specialist, some of the best in the world for eyes,\" Thomas says. \"Every day, my vision was getting worse, and it felt like my world was closing in on me.\"\n\nNo one could tell him what was wrong.\n\nAnd they never could with certainty, he says. His own autoimmune system was attacking the maculars in his eyes, and the specialists didn't know why, he says.\n\nAs his vision declined, he says, his life grew smaller. Soon, he had to stop driving. Then he didn't feel safe leaving his house alone to get the mail.\n\n\"I convinced myself it was all a bad dream, and one day I was going to wake up and everything was going to be OK,\" Thomas says. \"When the reality set in that this was my new state in life, that hit hard.\"\n\nBefore, he was in law school, on the path to becoming an attorney. Suddenly, he was learning to spell the word cat with his fingers.\n\n\"It was very demoralizing,\" he says.\n\n'Do this or die'\n\nThomas wasn't excited by the idea of hiking. For the former Porsche racer and mountain biker, it sounded boring.\n\nTrevor Thomas and Tennille reach the San Juan Mountains, near San Gabriel Peak. (Courtesy photo)\n\nLittle did he know, it soon would become the most adrenaline-packed experience of his life, a true test of survival.\n\nAt the bottom of his depression, he decided to hike a trail with his white walking cane, to reclaim some independence without the risks of traffic.\n\nThe cane wasn't his style.\n\nHe went to an outdoor store to buy trekking poles, and the young sales associate there casually mentioned he had just completed the Appalachian Trail.\n\n\"He was talking about this adventure he was on in the woods for six months, with bear attacks and he almost froze to death,\" Thomas says. \"That got my attention. That sounded right up my alley.\"\n\nWhen he walked out of the store, he had decided to hike the trail. Somehow, some way.\n\n\"That was my line in the sand: Do this or you're going to die,\" he says. \"So I took hiking and turned it into an extreme sport.\"\n\nHe spent 18 months studying the trail and memorizing the landmarks. He compiled many descriptions of the trail, until he felt as if he had the most comprehensive and accurate description possible. The sales associate who sold him the poles read Thomas his journals from his journey.\n\n\"Eighteen months after I went blind, I was standing at Springer Mountain, like everyone else with a dream,\" Thomas says. \"It was there where I decided I was going to get to the end of the trail and get my life back, or I would die trying.\"\n\nHe did it.\n\nTrevor Thomas and Tennille take a break along the Colorado Trail earlier this summer. (Courtesy photo)\n\nThomas followed one crucial rule: Unless he was 100 percent certain he was headed the right way, he did not move forward. If needed, he would stop and wait for another hiker to pass, so he could ask. He relied on fellow hikers on the busy trail.\n\nHe broke down the 2,000-mile trail into small chunks \u2014 not one day at a time but one step at a time, from one landmark to the next.\n\nWith no GPS, Thomas clocked the distance between landmarks by tracking his cadence over time.\n\nBut at the end, Thomas says, he wanted more.\n\n\"I needed to have true independence,\" he says. \"I needed to be able to do what everyone else was doing: hike alone and be confident in my abilities to be able to do it.\"\n\nReturn to Colorado\n\nThomas was going to hike the Colorado Trail.\n\nHe hiked other trails and researched the challenging Colorado Trail for years. Technology caught up with his needs, and talking smartphones gave him the ability to upload information and listen to it in the wilderness.\n\nIn 2011, he was going to hike the Colorado Trail with a partner \u2014 the companion wouldn't lead the expedition but would serve as a backup, just in case.\n\nHis partner never showed up.\n\nThomas hiked the first five segments of the trail alone, before he had to turn back.\n\n\"I knew I wouldn't be able to do it,\" Thomas says. \"I vowed and declared when I had to come back empty-handed in 2011, I was going to figure out a way to come back and do the trail self-navigated.\"\n\nHe says he had the technical skills and the trail memorized in his head. All he needed were eyes.\n\nA guide dog had eyes.\n\nBut guide dogs aren't trained to work on trails. They're taught to help people navigate around town.\n\nThomas decided to change that.\n\nAfter three years of training with Guide Dogs for the Blind in San Rafael, Calif., a guide dog named Tennille became the world's first and only backcountry guide dog, trained to identify water sources, signs, intersections.\n\nA Boulder business, In Clover, sponsored Tennille, providing her with dietary supplements to keep her healthy.\n\nThe biggest challenge was teaching a dog to generalize knowledge, to not just look for a specific sign but to look for any sign, Thomas says.\n\nNow Thomas' challenge was having a partner who cannot talk. Nonverbal communication is the bond.\n\n\"I'm the big-picture guy. I have the knowledge where we are going and what we are looking for. She's the detail girl. She fills in the blanks for me,\" Thomas says. \"Between the two of us, we find what we are looking for. Then we know where we are and move on to the next point.\"\n\n'Let it ride'\n\nAt the highest point on the Continental Divide, the storm dropped in like a nuclear bomb. Thomas could feel lightning in the air. The temperature plunged by 50 degrees. Rain sliced sideways through the air, followed by hail.\n\nThe mountain storm arrived early, at 10 a.m., and there were no trees to hide behind.\n\nThomas hit his wall.\n\n\"Any time you're on an expedition, you're going to get to a point where you have your doubts. You've been cold for too long,\" he says. \"If you don't get to that point, you haven't chosen an expedition that is challenging enough.\"\n\nHe says he wasn't sure he should continue, but he didn't have enough time to go back down.\n\nSo he followed his own advice: If you're not 100 percent sure, don't move.\n\n\"Let it ride,\" he says.\n\nThey waited it out, and the storm faded.\n\nThomas and Tennille completed the trail in 41 days and one hour, one day faster than his goal, and averaged slightly more miles per day than a typical hiker, he says.\n\nThey became the first and only blind hiker and guide dog team to figure out how to hike solo, he says.\n\n\"As far as an accomplishment goes, it was everything I had hoped for,\" Thomas says.\n\nFinally, he says, he feels confident in his independence.\n\nThat's not to say he's satisfied. He's headed to Kentucky's longest trail, the Sheltowee Trace Trail, in September. In the spring, he wants to be the first solo blind hiker to hike the Grand Canyon rim to rim to rim.\n\n\"Hiking has invaded my soul, and I don't think I'm ever going to quit,\" Thomas says. \"When I'm out on the trail, that's when I get to feel normal. That's when I get to feel alive.\"\n\nAimee Heckel: 303-473-1359, heckela@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/aimeemay", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_28679810/blind-cu-grad-hikes-entire-colorado-trail-thanks", "sailthru.author": "By Aimee Heckel \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28679810:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-23T06:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Not content to rely on human partners and knowing guide dogs aren't trained to work on trails, Trevor Thomas worked with a California group to turn a gal named Tennille into the world's first backcountry guide dog.", "title": "Blind CU grad hikes entire Colorado Trail \u2014 thanks to a special dog", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_28679810/blind-cu-grad-hikes-entire-colorado-trail-thanks", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0821/20150821__23DCPCOVw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Lifestyles", "modificationDate": "2015-08-23T13:25:00-0600", "endDate": "2025-08-21T11:22:40-0600", "news_keywords": "Lifestyles, Lifestyles news, Boulder Colorado Lifestyles news, Boulder Colorado news, Lifestyles Boulder news, Lifestyles Colorado news, US Lifestyles news, world Lifestyles news.", "byline": "By Aimee HeckelStaff", "pubDate": "2015-08-21T15:18:22-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-23T06:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Blind CU grad hikes entire Colorado Trail &mdash; thanks to a special dog", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0821/20150821__23DCPCOVw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Not content to rely on human partners and knowing guide dogs aren't trained to work on trails, Trevor Thomas worked with a California group to turn a gal named Tennille into the world's first backcountry guide dog.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_28679810/blind-cu-grad-hikes-entire-colorado-trail-thanks", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Not content to rely on human partners and knowing guide dogs aren't trained to work on trails, Trevor Thomas worked with a California group to turn a gal named Tennille into the world's first backcountry guide dog.", "title": "Blind CU grad hikes entire Colorado Trail \u2014 thanks to a special dog"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0821/20150821__23DCPCOVw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37d5\"", "article_summary": "Trevor Thomas and guide dog Tennille overlook the Platte River in Segment 2 of the Colorado Trail.\nHe recently hiked the Colorado Trail \u2014 489 miles from Denver to Durango.\nThey became the first and only blind hiker and guide dog team to figure out how to hike solo, he says.\nHe hiked other trails and researched the challenging Colorado Trail for years.\nTrevor Thomas and Tennille encounter snow at Segment 25 of the Colorado Trail."}
