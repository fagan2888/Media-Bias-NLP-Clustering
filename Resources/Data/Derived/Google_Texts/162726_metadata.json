That means many, including those at greater risk, can\u2019t get psychiatric care, a development that can have tragic consequences.\n\nShannon Pettypiece of \u201cBloomberg News\u201d wrote about recently and joins us now.\n\nYou found a very disturbing scenario of someone who had an appointment to see a doctor, ran out of meds before then, what happened?\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE, BLOOMBERG: Well, basically his mother had been trying for months to get this man, who is in his 30s, who had been hearing voices, having paranoia, thinking there were drones flying overhead, the CIA was in his apartment.\n\nEveryone knew something was wrong. He had been hospitalized. They\u2019ve been to the emergency room.\n\nBut his family says they just couldn\u2019t get him an appointment with a psychiatrist in time to keep him on the medication he needed. Either doctors didn\u2019t take their insurance, they just wouldn\u2019t return their calls, they had months-long wait, or they didn\u2019t want to see him because he was a tough patient, he had history of substance abuse, he had paranoia. He was a difficult case. Doctors prefer an easier case.\n\nSo, after all of this, you know, his mother, his friends, his family trying, they did finally get him an appointment and the medication ran out. And, unfortunately, it ended very tragically. He murdered his mother with a kitchen knife. And everybody in the aftermath was saying, how could something like this happen? How could a man with family support, in a suburb of New York City, not be able to get help?\n\nAnd one of the main reasons is because you have such a limited number of doctors willing to take the hard cases and take people with insurance.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And you abstract up from that and you talk a little bit about the cycles that are at work here. I mean, it\u2019s not just the doctor\u2019s fault. I mean, it\u2019s really the supply, the demand \u2014 the whole system seems stacked against someone like this getting the care.\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: Yes, and doctors say we\u2019re just not going to deal with it. There\u2019s enough demand from people who will pay cash, so we\u2019ll just, you know, focus on those patients.\n\nThe insurance industry says, well, their job is to get the best value for their customers, which is the patient. You know, they \u2014 if they have to pay doctors more, they\u2019re going to have to increase co-pays and premiums.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Right.\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: You know, no one wants to pay for health care these days. Everyone wants to control costs. So, the insurers say they\u2019re trying to do what is in the best interest of their clients.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, what are some of the, kind of, larger picture influences? I mean, how did the recession play into this? Or how did Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act play into this?\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: Well, $4 billion got cut from state mental health budgets during the recession. That\u2019s money that goes to support community clinics that are supposed to be the safety net. And on the Obamacare front, Obamacare did try to address this issue, requiring insurers to provide mental health services, not just, you know, medical services.\n\nBut the problem is you might have insurance but can\u2019t find a doctor who will take your insurance. Or you might \u2014\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Because it didn\u2019t add 1,000 new psychiatrists into the system.\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: Right. And there are some indications that the Obamacare insurance plans pay doctors even less than other private insurance plans, so doctors are even less likely to take the plans sold on the Obamacare change.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right. Shannon Pettypiece of \u201cBloomberg News\u201d, thanks so much.\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fewer and fewer psychiatrists are accepting patients who use either private insurance or Medicare rather than cash to pay for sessions.
