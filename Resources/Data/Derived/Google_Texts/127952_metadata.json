Every year since 1992, the Jules Verne Aventures association has organised the Festival Jules Verne, a meeting place for all lovers of science fiction with concerts, films or sountracks.

MacGyver always seemed to get out of tight spots and survived. So, what the heck does MacGyver have to do with the economy?\n\nEconomic prosperity will depend on new approaches by companies, communities, states and the nation, application of scientific knowledge, the ability to be inventive, and the willingness to take risks in the face of uncertainty. We now find ourselves in an environment that demands all these skills and more. Like MacGyver, we must have the ability to deal with ever-changing conditions, new competitive forces some of which reveal themselves overnight, and the death of traditional businesses replaced by new upstarts. We definitely live in times of exponential change.\n\nMany, including those among us in Fond du Lac County, feel nothing but fear as a result of this exponential change. That is a natural emotion but it can also be paralyzing. Was MacGyver scared when faced with uncertainty and seemingly unsolvable situations? Of course, any of us would be frightened but the difference is that MacGyver drew energy from the challenges to find novel solutions. Citizens of Fond du Lac County, we must do the same to find economic success moving forward.\n\nFond du Lac County has experienced success in manufacturing that provided the cornerstone of the local economy. Healthcare has grown substantially to become the second largest employment sector in the county. But the evolving new economy will impact these sectors. Manufacturing will still be a major contributor to the economy but with decreasing employment moving into the future. Fond du Lac County\u2019s recent ranking as ninth in the nation\u2019s small metros for advanced manufacturing specialization is a recognition of technology application in production. Where healthcare is headed is anyone\u2019s guess at this point. Bottom line: we must explore and pursue new opportunities and new business sectors.\n\nThe pursuit of new economic opportunities will require approaches much different from those of the last 50 years! Those approaches must involve collaboration and cooperation among governments and organizations, regional initiatives, and a focus on a workforce that has expertise in S.T.E.M.-based (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education and skills. These are no longer casual choices but absolute requirements for success.\n\nThe Fond du Lac County Economic Development Corporation (FCEDC) has led the creation of a collaborative network of resource providers called IGNITE! Business Success. IGNITE! is comprised of 16 organizations dedicated to supporting entrepreneurial development in Fond du Lac County. This network is unique in Wisconsin and is garnering national attention.\n\nFCEDC is also in discussions with surrounding counties in terms of marketing the region. Such an effort creates more \u201ccritical mass\u201d in terms of economic development assets and is more attractive to companies searching for new locations.\n\nThe FCEDC is committed to supporting the County\u2019s existing businesses through assistance for their sustainability and growth. Existing business programs are no longer based on models involving interviews with company officials, issuing reports, or attempting to solve problems that should have never developed in the first place. It\u2019s about making sure that the business climate in Fond du Lac is the best in Wisconsin, period!\n\nThe FCEDC has a business intelligence capability that no other economic development organization possesses in Wisconsin and which very few in the Midwest have. This allows the FCEDC to provide market and other research to businesses at very affordable costs.\n\nWe must continually look for inventive ways of growing the economy in the midst of great change and make the best utilization of resources for maximum impact. Again, the way we have done things in the past will no longer produce results. Redundancies and duplications must be eliminated. We must be willing to take risks, and have the mindset of the entrepreneur\u2026try something, if it works build on the idea; if it doesn\u2019t work, quit and try something else.\n\nAlthough MacGyver was fictional, his message was very relevant: do not fear change, improvise as needed and innovate, innovate, innovate. If we do these things, we will succeed.\n\nSteve R. Jenkins is president of the Fond du Lac County Economic Development Corporation.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://fondul.ac/1NwMlrl", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Secret agent Angus MacGyver\u2019s inventive use of common items was legendary", "og": {"site_name": "Action Reporter Media", "description": "Secret agent Angus MacGyver\u2019s inventive use of common items was legendary", "title": "What MacGyver can teach us about the economy", "url": "http://www.fdlreporter.com/story/opinion/2015/08/15/macgyver-can-teach-us-economy/31774645/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/fdlreporter.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Secret agent Angus MacGyver\u2019s inventive use of common items was legendary", "title": "What MacGyver can teach us about the economy", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/247f98a0c292d1115c12af61477e0d43743a0822/c=0-0-2589-2589&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/15/FondduLac/B9318459112Z.1_20150815094735_000_GSHBKHDPN.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@fdlreporter", "site": "@fdlreporter", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884281456", "fb": {"app_id": 175275349169565}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Fond du Lac County has experienced success in manufacturing that provided the cornerstone of the local economy.\nMany, including those among us in Fond du Lac County, feel nothing but fear as a result of this exponential change.\nSteve R.
