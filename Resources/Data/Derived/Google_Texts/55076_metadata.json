The total cost of the cases is just over $2.4 million with nearly three months left in the fiscal year. This compares to a total of 12 such cases in all of 2013, which cost a total of $2.8 million.\n\nIn a report to the board, the agency reported that $4.6 million has been spent on inmate hospitalization in the first half of this fiscal year compared to about $1.2 million in the same period in the previous year. Outside medical costs, such as prescription drugs and hospitalization, were projected to cost $18 million this year and $18.8 million in fiscal year 2015 in the budget approved by the 2013 Legislature.\n\nThe state is now getting some financial help for prison medical spending due to changes resulting from the federal Affordable Care Act, which expanded eligibility requirements for inmates starting Jan. 1. The Legislature projected savings of $2.7 million this fiscal year and $5.2 million in the coming fiscal year that begins July 1 because of the changes.\n\nContact Capital Bureau reporter Sean Whaley at swhaley@reviewjournal.com or 775-687-3900.
