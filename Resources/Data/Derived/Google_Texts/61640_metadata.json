As another mixed year comes to an end, Salon asked a range of liberal or left groups and leaders to lay down benchmarks for 2014.\n\nWe emailed advocates with a simple task: Identify a few concrete victories they and their allies could realistically achieve on their issues by Dec. 31, 2014. Here\u2019s some of what they said. Call them New Year\u2019s resolutions if you must. Come next December, we\u2019ll assess how they fared:\n\nStop the Keystone Pipeline: \u201cIn 2014, the Other 98% will shame the Corporate Caucus, stop the disastrous Keystone XL Pipeline and help to raise the federal minimum wage\u2026 We will make the consequences of the White House approving the Keystone XL Pipeline so toxic, the benefits of rejecting it will far outweigh those of approving it\u2026 [And] given the massive outpouring of support and solidarity we saw on [the minimum wage] in 2013, we think this is a fight we can win in 2014.\u201d \u2014 Alexis Goldstein, communications director of The Other 98%\n\nPass ENDA, immigration reform and voting rights: \u201c[W]e need the House to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act; fair immigration reform legislation; and to restore the heart of the Voting Rights Act, so unceremoniously gutted by the Supreme Court this past year. We must win on these issues in 2014; we can win on these issues in 2014.\u201d \u2014 Rea Carey, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund\n\nLegal pot in Oregon: \u201c2014 looks like it will be a very good year for drug policy reform. Legal sales of marijuana will actually start in Colorado, Washington and Uruguay. Oregon and possibly other U.S. states will vote to legalize marijuana, and serious debates on cannabis legalization will emerge in state legislatures across the U.S. as well as throughout the Americas and Europe. Incarceration in the U.S. will decline more than ever before. Growing numbers of elected officials will speak out for major reform of drug policy. Challenges to the international drug prohibition regime will proliferate around the world.\u201d \u2014 Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance\n\nEnd out-of-state prisoner transfers: \u201cThe findings of our report last month showed that there are more than 10,500 prisoners that are shipped across state lines to for-profit prisons from four sending states: Hawaii, California, Idaho and Vermont. In 2014, I\u2019m hopeful that at least one of those states will end the practice of shipping prisoners out of state while developing common-sense ways to reduce prison overcrowding.\u201d \u2014 Bob Libal, executive director of Grassroots Leadership\n\nGet corporations to challenge governments to be green: \u201cIf 2014 looks anything like 2013, then industry and corporate cash will still effectively run our Congress and state governments\u2026 we\u2019ll continue to directly challenge companies like Apple, Facebook and Google to adopt renewable energy programs, and this will help us move massive destructive utility companies like Duke Energy in North Carolina to adopt real clean energy solutions. And as we get corporations to put pressure on governments, we\u2019ll also be working with a wide range of progressive groups like the NAACP and the Communications Workers of America to push for Senate rules reform and to get corporate money out of our elections, so we actually have a functioning democracy. All this while we continue to fight corporations like Shell and Gazprom to save the Arctic from oil spills and climate destruction.\u201d \u2013 Phil Radford, Greenpeace executive director\n\nWin divestment from private prisons: \u201cWe\u2019re making significant progress in our campaign urging institutional investors to divest from private prison corporations, whose profit motive drives draconian criminal justice policy that preys upon black families and communities, and we expect to unveil several important wins coming out of our behind-the-scenes discussions with key investors next year. We\u2019re turning a string of victories on challenging television programming that exploits stereotypical, dehumanizing portrayals of black people (Oxygen\u2019s \u201cAll My Babies\u2019 Mamas,\u201d Fox\u2019s \u201cCops\u201d) into prospective discussions with network executives about the more varied, multidimensional and relatable representations audiences expect in 2014.\u201d \u2013 Rashad Robinson, Color of Change executive director\n\nLimit police Internet surveillance: \u201cIn 2014, we can ensure thousands of new radio stations \u2014 stations that represent the issues and voices of traditionally marginalized communities \u2014 get on the dial\u2026 we\u2019re fighting to make sure the cost of local calls from prison and detention centers are reduced in 2014\u2026 [And] our fight is to pass legislation in Congress to ensure transparency in digital data collection, mechanisms to opt out of digital data tracking, and protections from over-reaching Internet surveillance and racial profiling online. We also believe we can win the fight to get local governments to adopt digital privacy protections that place equity standards on police departments getting grants to expand their Internet surveillance capacity.\u201d \u2014 Malkia Cyril, Center for Media Justice executive director", "article_metadata": {"description": "From legalizing pot to stopping the Keystone Pipeline, progressive groups pledge what they'll win next year", "title": "New Year\u2019s resolutions for the left: What liberals can win in 2014", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From legalizing pot to stopping the Keystone Pipeline, progressive groups pledge what they'll win next year", "title": "New Year\u2019s resolutions for the left: What liberals can win in 2014", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/01/new_years_resolutions_for_the_left_what_liberals_can_win_in_2014/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/marijuana_plant.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From legalizing pot to stopping the Keystone Pipeline, progressive groups pledge what they'll win next year", "title": "New Year\u2019s resolutions for the left: What liberals can win in 2014", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/marijuana_plant.jpg", "creator": "@josheidelson", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Josh Eidelson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Best of 2013, Deportation, divestment, Editor's Picks, Education, Fast food, Housing, Immigration, Labor, left, liberal, marijuana, Police, Prison, Progressive, Race, Students, Surveillance, tuition, wages", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As another mixed year comes to an end, Salon asked a range of liberal or left groups and leaders to lay down benchmarks for 2014.\nWe must win on these issues in 2014; we can win on these issues in 2014.\u201d \u2014 Rea Carey, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action FundLegal pot in Oregon: \u201c2014 looks like it will be a very good year for drug policy reform.\nGrowing numbers of elected officials will speak out for major reform of drug policy.\nWe emailed advocates with a simple task: Identify a few concrete victories they and their allies could realistically achieve on their issues by Dec. 31, 2014.\nCall them New Year\u2019s resolutions if you must."}
