A portion of the lawsuit filed by the widow of Toms River native Dustin Friedland, who was gunned down in an apparent carjacking in the Short Hills Mall parking garage Dec. 15, is being contested in court by the corporation that owns the shopping establishment, according to a story on NJ.com.

Friedland was an attorney in Hoboken. His widow, Jamie Schare Friedland, filed a lawsuit seeking punitive damages from the mall’s owners, claiming it had cut back on security.

Michigan-based Taubman Centers, Inc., Short Hills Associates, LLC and Michael McAvinue, the mall’s general manager filed a motion that is scheduled for a hearing on Friday. The attorneys are contesting that the widow’s claim for punitive damages fails to prove the mall showed intentional wrongdoing. The owners of the mall countered that the claims by the widow lack any factual basis.

According to the complaint, “the ambulance squad was delayed because the ambulance could not fit under the parking deck’s ceiling, forcing emergency workers to roll a stretcher up the ramp and then wheel Dustin Friedland back down,” according to the report

Four men are facing murder charges in connection with the slaying.
