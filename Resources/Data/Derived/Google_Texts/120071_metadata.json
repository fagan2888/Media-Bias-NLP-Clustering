Drugs like Adderall and Ritalin have a reputation as \u201cgood-grade pills\u201d and \u201ccognitive enhancers\u201d that produce near-immediate improvements in the ability of children to pay attention in school.\n\nThe thing is, studies tracing the impact of ADHD meds report no improvement in academic performance in the long term, as Nature reports in a new review of existing research , and kids taking the drugs are in some cases more likely to drop out of school.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why this would be happening. The glib answer would be pharmaceutical marketing blitzes have duped us into believing the products\u2019 brain-boosting properties. But a study from the 1970s, which predates big-budget ad campaigns for the stimulants, points the way to a more persuasive\u2014and and potentially more worrying\u2014explanation.\n\nWhen the researchers in that study asked parents and teachers to evaluate ADHD children\u2019s scholastic performance before and after medication, they found that though the children\u2019s grades stayed the same, adults believed they improved, reports Nature.\n\nNature\n\nWorse, parents\u2019 and teachers\u2019 inclinations to mistake manageability for academic improvement could actually be exacerbating children\u2019s academic problems. A recently published long-term study of ADHD medication in Quebec (pdf, p. 25, registration required) found that, despite consistent Ritalin dosages, there was \u201clittle overall improvement in outcomes\u201d in the short term\u2014and in the long term, more of these kids dropped out of school and reported unhappiness.\n\n\u201cBy making children less disruptive, ADHD medication could decrease the attention that they receive in the average classroom and reduce the probability that the child receives other needed services,\u201d wrote the study\u2019s authors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In fact,\u00a0children taking the drugs are in some cases more likely to drop out of school, according to a new review of existing research.", "author": "Gwynn Guilford", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "In fact,\u00a0children taking the drugs are in some cases more likely to drop out of school, according to a new review of existing research.", "title": "Study: Adderall Doesn't Help Kids Get Better Grades", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/AP04050506037/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/02/study-adderal-doesnt-help-kids-get-better-grades/283841/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39d6\"", "article_summary": "NatureWorse, parents\u2019 and teachers\u2019 inclinations to mistake manageability for academic improvement could actually be exacerbating children\u2019s academic problems.\nDrugs like Adderall and Ritalin have a reputation as \u201cgood-grade pills\u201d and \u201ccognitive enhancers\u201d that produce near-immediate improvements in the ability of children to pay attention in school.\nWhen the researchers in that study asked parents and teachers to evaluate ADHD children\u2019s scholastic performance before and after medication, they found that though the children\u2019s grades stayed the same, adults believed they improved, reports Nature.\nBut a study from the 1970s, which predates big-budget ad campaigns for the stimulants, points the way to a more persuasive\u2014and and potentially more worrying\u2014explanation.\n\u201cBy making children less disruptive, ADHD medication could decrease the attention that they receive in the average classroom and reduce the probability that the child receives other needed services,\u201d wrote the study\u2019s authors."}
