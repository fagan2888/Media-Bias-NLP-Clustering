The definition of Democratic is relating to or supporting democracy.\n\nSo when did the Democrat Party become the Democratic Party? Democrat leaders \u2013 Obama, Reid, Pelosi, Clinton, Sanders, Wasserman-Schultz \u2013 are as far as you could possibly get from being Democratic.\n\nDo you remember the Obamacare debates of 2008, when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi notoriously demanded of her House members, that we have to vote for the bill \u201cso that we can find out what is in it.\u201d\n\nNot one single Republican in the United States Senate voted for Obamacare, after the administration notoriously drafted the bill behind tightly closed doors. The two Democrats\u2019 two presidential contenders are both socialists of varying degrees. One could even argue that they strongly resemble communists.\n\nI can imagine that the meeting went something like this\u2026\n\n\u201cDebbie, since our President rules by executive orders and has no taste for the Constitution, what can we do to make the American people think we are still Democratic?\u201d\n\n\u201cHillary, let\u2019s change the name of our party to the \u2018Democratic Party,\u2019 that way nobody can say that we\u2019re not DEMOCRATIC\u2026 Get it?\u201d\n\nIf you thought you belonged to a party that cared, you are sadly mistaken.\n\nDid you want to be told what health insurance you can have? Did you want all of your medical and personal info put online by the government? Do you like being asked by your doctor, \u201dare you nuts, yet?\u201d Do you want to keep your gun for self-defense?\n\nDid you want the Somerset Plant and the Huntley Plant closed? What took their place? How do we make up for the lost power?\n\nDid you want your Military reduced below longtime standards set by our military leaders? Ask any fired General or Secretary of Defense what they think. That\u2019s right \u2013 if they don\u2019t agree things are great \u2013 Obama replaces them with someone who does! That\u2019s real progressive leadership!\n\nFortunately \u2013 and in my humble opinion \u2013 Hillary will be indicted for violating multiple Sections of Title 18 USC regarding her failure to treat classified information as such and for a host of other charges (including conspiring to sell our uranium to Russia in return for donations to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nThe evidence and charges will be so overwhelming and egregious that Attorney General Loretta Lynch will be forced to prosecute. Mrs. Clinton has lied, cheated, and stolen so many times \u2013 always dodging the bullet. But not this time: her behavior is on par with espionage, the Hobbs Act, and treason!\n\nVoting for Hillary because she\u2019s a woman would be like biting a dog turd because it looks like a Tootsie Roll. Voting for Hillary is equally as distasteful.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Niagara Falls Reporter", "description": "The lexical definition of Democracy is\u00a0a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and", "title": "The \u201cDemocratic\u201d Party And Hypocrisy At Its Best! - Niagara Falls Reporter", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 750, "identifier": "http://niagarafallsreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DilauraTN.jpg", "height": 795}, "url": "http://niagarafallsreporter.com/democratic-party-hypocrisy-best/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://niagarafallsreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DilauraTN.jpg", "description": "The lexical definition of Democracy is\u00a0a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and", "card": "summary", "title": "The \u201cDemocratic\u201d Party And Hypocrisy At Its Best! - Niagara Falls Reporter"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://niagarafallsreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/20http://southbuffalonews.com5/http://southbuffalonews.com2/SiteIcon-5675ehttp://southbuffalonews.com9evhttp://southbuffalonews.com_site_icon.png", "article": {"section": "Columns", "published_time": "2016-04-13T22:20:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "So when did the Democrat Party become the Democratic Party?\nDemocrat leaders \u2013 Obama, Reid, Pelosi, Clinton, Sanders, Wasserman-Schultz \u2013 are as far as you could possibly get from being Democratic.\nVoting for Hillary because she\u2019s a woman would be like biting a dog turd because it looks like a Tootsie Roll.\nThe definition of Democratic is relating to or supporting democracy.\nThe evidence and charges will be so overwhelming and egregious that Attorney General Loretta Lynch will be forced to prosecute."}
