Among the more troubling proposals in the party\u2019s election manifesto is one to \u201crevise and update\u201d the country\u2019s nuclear doctrine.\n\nNeither Narendra Modi, the party\u2019s candidate for prime minister, nor any of his allies have fully explained what they have in mind. Some news reports suggest the B.J.P., the Hindu nationalist party, may not just reconsider but jettison India\u2019s \u201cno first use\u201d policy that was adopted in 1999 when the party was previously in power. The policy committed the country to show restraint in not being the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict.\n\nThe lack of clarity about the party\u2019s intentions on this issue introduces more uncertainty into an already unstable region. Should Mr. Modi scuttle the \u201cno first use\u201d policy if he wins, he would exacerbate tensions with China, which subscribes to the policy, and Pakistan, which does not.\n\nThe unresolved conflict over Kashmir between India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars since 1947, and the existence of extremist groups in the Afghan-Pakistan border region make any shifts in nuclear policies particularly dangerous.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndia and Pakistan, each with about 100 nuclear weapons and building more, have little regular communication, which raises the potential for miscalculation. Pakistan, in fact, has the world\u2019s fastest-growing nuclear arsenal and recently added short-range tactical nuclear weapons that experts say are more likely to be used in battle. That existing threat, however, is not a reason for India to abandon its \u201cno first use\u201d doctrine; its conventional arsenal is far superior to Pakistan\u2019s and sufficient to respond to most threats.\n\nAlthough the B.J.P. initiated the \u201cno first use\u201d policy in India, a B.J.P.-led government also conducted a series of nuclear tests in 1998. In signaling its willingness to take a more provocative stance toward Pakistan and China, the party does not advance India\u2019s interests.\n\nThe current government led by the Congress party has focused somewhat more on developing the country\u2019s civilian nuclear energy sector rather than on nuclear arms. In fact, last week, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh proposed a global framework to promote a \u201cno first use\u201d doctrine among nuclear weapons states, a laudable goal.\n\nInstead of abandoning the \u201cno first use\u201d doctrine, whoever wins the election would do better to commit himself to improving ties with Pakistan and starting an arms control initiative that could lead to a regional equilibrium on these dangerous weapons.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140409205326, "twitter": {"description": "A troubling campaign proposal by the front-running party in the current national elections could mean revising a \u201cno first use\u201d policy.", "title": "A Risk to India\u2019s Nuclear Doctrine", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/opinion/a-risk-to-indias-nuclear-doctrine.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002817509"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/opinion/a-risk-to-indias-nuclear-doctrine.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002817509", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/opinion/a-risk-to-indias-nuclear-doctrine.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "A Risk to India\u2019s Nuclear Doctrine", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 9, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Bharatiya Janata Party", "keywords": "Nuclear Weapons,Modi  Narendra,Bharatiya Janata Party,India,International Relations,Pakistan,China,Editorials", "news_keywords": "India,Pakistan,China,Editorial", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Modi, Narendra", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A troubling campaign proposal by the front-running party in the current national elections could mean revising a \u201cno first use\u201d policy.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A troubling campaign proposal by the front-running party in the current national elections could mean revising a \u201cno first use\u201d policy.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 9, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-04-14", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Editorials", "published": "2014-04-09", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "geo": "China", "slug": "10thu2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140414022605, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/opinion/a-risk-to-indias-nuclear-doctrine.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A troubling campaign proposal by the front-running party in the current national elections could mean revising a \u201cno first use\u201d policy.", "title": "A Risk to India\u2019s Nuclear Doctrine"}, "pdate": 20140409, "des": "Editorials", "articleid": 100000002817509, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "A Risk to India\u2019s Nuclear Doctrine", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "article_summary": "Among the more troubling proposals in the party\u2019s election manifesto is one to \u201crevise and update\u201d the country\u2019s nuclear doctrine.\nIn fact, last week, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh proposed a global framework to promote a \u201cno first use\u201d doctrine among nuclear weapons states, a laudable goal.\nThe policy committed the country to show restraint in not being the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict.\nPakistan, in fact, has the world\u2019s fastest-growing nuclear arsenal and recently added short-range tactical nuclear weapons that experts say are more likely to be used in battle.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyIndia and Pakistan, each with about 100 nuclear weapons and building more, have little regular communication, which raises the potential for miscalculation."}
