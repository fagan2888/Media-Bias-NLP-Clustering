He was in the throes of a terrible season with the Avalanche, his point production way down, his body banged up with injuries. He was an occasional tenant in the doghouse of his coach, Joe Sacco. Everything had always come so easy to the 20-year-old, but suddenly he was hit with the first real crisis of confidence in his life.\n\n\u201cI was letting my confidence get shaken badly by a lot of things that maybe were a little unfair and a little tough to handle at that age,\u201d Duchene said. \u201cAfter I kind of got to that rock bottom, it was tough. I had times where I could barely look at myself in the mirror. I was kind of like a duck; I was calm on the outside, but paddling for my life underneath the surface.\u201d\n\nSo he did something about it.\n\nLast summer, Duchene started seeing a sports psychologist. Many athletes do this, but don\u2019t like to talk about it. Duchene is proud he did it, and has no hesitation talking about it. Talking to a psychologist has helped him have a different view of himself, and what he needed to do to get to where he is now: happy, productive and better equipped to handle the pressures of his job.\n\n\u201cMy first (couple of years), if I wasn\u2019t scoring or things weren\u2019t going well, I would come to practice the next day and I would put so much pressure on myself to score. And then if I didn\u2019t, I would get down and it would carry on to the next day,\u201d Duchene said. \u201cNow, if I have a slump, I just stay consistent with what works, because it will eventually work.\n\n\u201cSame thing on the flip side; before if I got hot, I would be so excited and on cloud nine. I may be like that now on the inside, but I don\u2019t show it.\u201d\n\nDuchene not only changed his mind-set before last season, he changed his body. He switched to a gluten-free diet, which helped him drop weight without sacrificing muscle mass. He played well in the NHL\u2019s lockout-shortened season and was rewarded this past offseason with a five-year, $30 million contract extension that will kick in next season. While he was happy with his growth on the ice, he was still miserable much of the time. Losing does that.\n\nHe also wasn\u2019t happy playing for Sacco. At the time, he kept his opinions to himself. But no more.\n\n\u201cThere were very few people in this (dressing) room who were happy. Our style of play, it wasn\u2019t right for this team. We knew it would fail,\u201d Duchene said. \u201cThat was the hard part. We knew (any) success was going to be short-lived. It was hard to really be excited about it. For myself, it was really hard to look at what we were doing and think it would keep on working. I can honestly say now, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d\n\nDuchene loves the fast-pace system and personal style of his new Avs coach, Patrick Roy.\n\n\u201cThe one thing with Patrick is, there\u2019s no doghouse. If you\u2019re not doing what you\u2019re supposed to do, he\u2019s going to bring you in, he\u2019s going to sit you down and you\u2019re going to correct it constructively and then you\u2019re going to move on from there. You don\u2019t stay in that doghouse,\u201d Duchene said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I can honestly say everyone in this room is excited.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s always been a plan (here). People are professionals and they always have a plan, but is it the right plan? We\u2019ve had a young, fast, offensively gifted team for four years and haven\u2019t been able to show that every night. The only time we ever seemed to play that way was against a team that really opened it up and let us play that way.\u201d\n\nSacco, now an assistant coach with the Buffalo Sabres, declined to comment when informed of Duchene\u2019s remarks. Avalanche center Paul Stastny said he had some of the same frustrations under the former regime.\n\n\u201cOur roster was never depleted. I think we had a lot of skill. Sometimes you just have to put the right parts together,\u201d Stastny said. \u201c(Roy) has done a good job putting all the pieces together.\u201d\n\nAs for Duchene, Stastny said he is showing maturation.\n\n\u201cThe way he prepares for stuff, he\u2019s grown into more of a team guy. He\u2019s developed his game, not just offensively,\u201d Stastny said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to take more of a leadership role with younger players and be more vocal.\u201d\n\nOne thing Duchene said he learned through his struggles is to never give in.\n\n\u201cI made a decision to never let anyone rattle me, not let anyone rattle me or rattle my confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cI was living and dying with every game and that was a problem. Now I look at everything as a whole.\u201d\n\nWINNIPEG AT COLORADO\n\n6 p.m. Sunday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Evander Kane: Kane was the player taken immediately after Matt Duchene (fourth overall) in the 2009 NHL draft, by the Atlanta Thrashers. A skilled power forward, Kane has been somewhat hidden in obscurity playing for the small-market Jets and their woebegone former identity in Atlanta. Like a lot of other Jets, he has gotten off to mostly a mediocre start, but he has great talent.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nAvalanche: Semyon Varlamov will start in goal for the Avs. \u2026 Winnipeg is now in the same division as the Avs (Central) after playing in the Eastern Conference its first two years back in the NHL. \u2026 Varlamov\u2019s record at home is 4-1, with a goals-against average of 2.02 and .938 save percentage. \u2026 The Avs won\u2019t play again until Friday in Dallas after Sunday\u2019s game. On Saturday night, when they host the Canadiens, the Avs will retire the No. 52 jersey of former defenseman Adam Foote.\n\nJets: Entering Saturday\u2019s game in Dallas, the Jets had gone 19 consecutive power-play opportunities without a goal. \u2026 Winnipeg is likely to start backup goaltender Al Montoya against the Avs. \u2026 Winnipeg entered Saturday ranked 26th in the NHL in faceoffs at 45.2 percent.\n\nAdrian Dater, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Matt Duchene loves fast-pace system and personal style of Patrick Roy", "title": "Matt Duchene loves fast-pace system and personal style of Patrick Roy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/26/matt-duchene-loves-fast-pace-system-and-personal-style-of-patrick-roy/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131026__20131027_CC1_SP27HKNAVSp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131026__20131027_CC1_SP27HKNAVSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-26T20:16:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T06:35:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad2b\"", "article_summary": "If you\u2019re not doing what you\u2019re supposed to do, he\u2019s going to bring you in, he\u2019s going to sit you down and you\u2019re going to correct it constructively and then you\u2019re going to move on from there.\n\u201c(Roy) has done a good job putting all the pieces together.\u201dAs for Duchene, Stastny said he is showing maturation.\nI can honestly say now, it\u2019s not like that.\u201dDuchene loves the fast-pace system and personal style of his new Avs coach, Patrick Roy.\nAnd then if I didn\u2019t, I would get down and it would carry on to the next day,\u201d Duchene said.\n\u201cSame thing on the flip side; before if I got hot, I would be so excited and on cloud nine."}
