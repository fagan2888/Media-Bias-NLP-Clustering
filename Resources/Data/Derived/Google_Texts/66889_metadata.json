Basically, the experiment shows that smartphones, tablets, and even lame PCs have allowed everyone everywhere to commit a significant chunk of their personality and memory to units outside their actual brain. Think about it: You think you know your friend\u2019s cellphone number and your schedule for next week \u2014 but would you still know these things if you lost your iPhone?\n\nTogether with developments like Google\u2019s widely publicized Glass unit, these types of ideas have many academics, artists, and armchair thinkers guessing as to where we\u2019re headed as a population. Will all next-generation social interaction take place in a digital setting? Have we all become cyborgs?\n\nJenny Lee, a British artist and head of Studio Aikieu, invites us to consider the fate of a tech-driven population in her new piece, Immateriality / The Future Human. \u201cImmateriality seeks to critically engage the public to question the future implications of how we choose to utilize science and technology in the future,\u201d she writes. \u201cScientists believe that as technology continues to advance, a new human will evolve.\u201d\n\nThe idea is pretty straight-forward: With technology like Google Glass, what\u2019s stopping us from cherry picking the world\u2019s aesthetics and generating a refined, \u201cbetter\u201d version of the world before us? In a haunting and thought-provoking video reel, she shows how a new world can be pulled before your eyes, layered over the real. \"With my project, it's the idea that we're utilizing technology as a means to evolve beyond biological bodies,\" she said, speaking to Fast Company. \"What I wanted to do is consider new technology as augmented reality \u2014 the idea that we can place a digital mask over the real world.\"\n\nImmateriality | The Future Human from jenny lee on Vimeo.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "face, 50 years, jenny lee, studio aikieu", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "What will our faces look like in 50 years?
