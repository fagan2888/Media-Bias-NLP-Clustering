The new Torrent files have a pay gate to access a bundle of files.. The files can be anything, but in this case is an \u2018album\u2019. It\u2019s an experiment to see if the mechanics of the system are something that the general public can get its head around \u2026 If it works well it could be an effective way of handing some control of internet commerce back to people who are creating the work.

It\u2019s a self-contained embeddable shop front\u2026 The network not only carries the traffic, it also hosts the file. The file is in the network. Oh yes and it\u2019s called Tomorrow\u2019s Modern Boxes.
