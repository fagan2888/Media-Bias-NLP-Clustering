He came into contact with eight other children who tested positive for the bacterium, but the other kids have not gotten sick from the infection, likely because they were vaccinated. Pau is the first recorded case of a child with diphtheria since 1986, when the so-called \u201cstrangling angel of children\u201d disease was eradicated due to vaccination efforts.\n\nAccording to The Local, the parents of the 6-year-old \u2014 who had refused to immunize their child \u2014 feel \u201cdestroyed and cheated\u201d by the anti-vaccination movement.\n\n\u201cThey are a lovely couple and both feel a terrible sense of guilt,\u201d Antoni Mateu, the regional secretary for public health in Catalonia, said during a press conference.\n\nDiphtheria is a bacterial infection that attacks the nose and throat, causing sore throat, fever, swollen glands, and weakness/fatigue. Children with diphtheria will typically experience a thick, gray substance coating the back of their throat, which makes it difficult to breathe. While it\u2019s rare, it\u2019s a serious disease that requires immediate care in the hospital. If treatment isn\u2019t given in time, diphtheria can damage the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. The disease is airborne, spread through coughing or sneezing.\n\nAnti-vaxxers \u2014 many of whom claim vaccination is toxic and unnecessary, and also causes autism \u2014 have influenced parents in the U.S. as well as Europe in recent years, even though the studies they claim are true have been debunked. The measles outbreak that occurred in California in December 2014 was likely due to the state\u2019s low vaccination rates. But time and time again, scientific evidence points to the fact that vaccination isn\u2019t harmful; in fact, there is no link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines simply save thousands of lives by avoiding preventable diseases.\n\nConvincing anti-vaxxers that vaccines are safe may be easier said than done, but we can\u2019t wait for them to learn the hard way, like Pau\u2019s parents. Hundreds of children\u2019s lives could be saved if governments and schools were stricter with vaccination regulations.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Barcelona, Pau is currently in the intensive care unit where doctors are treating him in a \"critical but stable\" condition.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "spain, anti-vaxxers, diphtheria", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Diphtheria was eradicated in Spain three decades ago, but it's now back due to misguided efforts of the anti-vaccination movement.", "title": "Diphtheria Is Back In Spain, Thanks To Anti-Vaxxers", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/diphtheria-stricken-boy-becomes-spains-first-case-28-years-thanks-anti-vaxxers-337454", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/10/vaccination.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Diphtheria was eradicated in Spain three decades ago, but it's now back due to misguided efforts of the anti-vaccination movement.", "title": "Diphtheria Is Back In Spain, Thanks To Anti-Vaxxers", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/diphtheria-stricken-boy-becomes-spains-first-case-28-years-thanks-anti-vaxxers-337454", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/10/vaccination.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/10/vaccination.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-10T12:32:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-10T12:32:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Diphtheria was eradicated in Spain three decades ago, but it's now back due to misguided efforts of the anti-vaccination movement."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8abf\"", "article_summary": "Pau is the first recorded case of a child with diphtheria since 1986, when the so-called \u201cstrangling angel of children\u201d disease was eradicated due to vaccination efforts.\nDiphtheria was eradicated in Spain in 1986 due to vaccination efforts \u2014 but a recent dip in vaccination rates (thanks to the anti-Vaxxer movement) has resulted in a new diptheria case.\nNearly 30 years ago, diphtheria was completely eradicated in Spain; but now it appears to be back, with a 6-year-old boy hospitalized and eight other patients in isolation.\nDiphtheria is a bacterial infection that attacks the nose and throat, causing sore throat, fever, swollen glands, and weakness/fatigue.\nChildren with diphtheria will typically experience a thick, gray substance coating the back of their throat, which makes it difficult to breathe."}
