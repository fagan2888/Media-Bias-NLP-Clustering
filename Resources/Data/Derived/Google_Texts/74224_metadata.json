Compliance for Medicare Advantage patients was better at 30 percent to 50 percent.\n\nThe incentive program comes a month after Highmark reduced payments by 4 percent to primary care doctors who treat people with ACA coverage. The insurer lost $590 million on the policies in 2015.\n\nDr. John praised Highmark for the new incentive funding, saying it recognizes the work of primary care doctors while allowing the insurer to collect the full amount of allowable reimbursement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d Dr. John said. \u201cIt recognizes the hard work family physicians do on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nKris B.
