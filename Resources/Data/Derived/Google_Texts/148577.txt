“The infrastructure of our country is a laughingstock all over the world,” he continued.

“Our airports, our bridges, our roadways – it’s falling apart,” he argued. “It’s a terrible thing to see.”

Trump posted the clip amid rumors he will seek the presidency in 2016 as a Republican candidate.

“Our politicians are all talk, no action,” Trump charged in Wednesday’s recording.

Trump on Wednesday additionally urged lawmakers to erect barriers against illegal immigrants along America’s border with Mexico.

“Millions of people are flowing across our southern border,” he said. “We’ve got to build a real wall.”

“With all of this, our country has tremendous potential,” Trump concluded. “Let’s make America great again.”

The famous billionaire has not yet decided on his 2016 aspirations. Trump said last Saturday that he finds Democrats and Republicans equally disappointing.

“Politicians are never going to solve all the problems we have,” he argued. “They’re too deep-seeded.”

“All the people you’re listening to, you can forget it,” he said of the overall 2016 field.

Trump would compete with Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas), Rand Paul (Ky.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) if he entered the GOP’s 2016 field.
