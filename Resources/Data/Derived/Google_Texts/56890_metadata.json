Rand Paul (R-KY), calling a \u201cpress conference\u201d that only one reporter\u2014this one\u2014showed up to.\n\nIt\u2019s a shocking embarrassment given the fact the national Democrats had been promoting the event as a prebuttal to Paul\u2019s big speech here, his first since announcing earlier this week he\u2019s running for president of the United States.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn doing so, the state Democrats here actually undercut the stance Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) has taken on abortion in response to a line of questioning Paul trapped her into after mainstream media reporters attempted to trip him up on the subject. In fact, two high-ranking South Carolina Democrats\u2014the vice chairwoman of the state party and the chairman of the Charleston city Democratic Party\u2014went on record to defend aborting babies who weigh 7 pounds, which is in many cases mere days or weeks from birth.\n\n\u201cMore reporters were in attendance than the legitimate number of Democratic candidates in South Carolina,\u201d South Carolina GOP chairman Matt Moore said in an email to Breitbart News after the event, poking fun at the Democratic Party failures in his state. \u201cTheir bench is currently thinner than the Atlanta Braves\u2019. If they were handing out speaking fees, Hillary might have attended.\u201d\n\nPaul had been scheduled to roll out his South Carolina presidential campaign at the U.S.S. Yorktown later in the day\u2014which he did, with reporters from outlets ranging from Breitbart News, the New York Times, Bloomberg Politics, to television networks and more present, along with hundreds of supporters including high-profile lawmakers.\n\nBut the night before Paul\u2019s speech, national Democrats\u2014in conjunction with the South Carolina Democratic Party\u2014called for a press conference in the Commodore Room at the Charleston Harbor Resort to bracket Paul\u2019s speech with negative criticisms about him from the left. Usually, such matters will garner at least a little bit of press.\n\n\u201cIn advance of Rand Paul\u2019s official campaign launch in South Carolina on Thursday, South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison and leaders from around the lowcountry will hold a press conference at the Charleston Harbor Resort at Patriots Point to discuss the damaging impact a Rand Paul presidency would have on young people, women, the middle class, and families across the Palmetto state,\u201d the release sent out on Wednesday evening by national Democrats with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) read. \u201cThe state leaders will highlight the fact that no matter how desperately Rand Paul tries to rewrite his record, it\u2019s impossible for him to hide from his reckless and outdated views during his launch in Mt Pleasant, or at any other point during the campaign.\u201d\n\nAfter RSVP\u2019ingand checking in with plans to show up, this reporter made his way to the event to see what the local Democrats had to say and maybe ask a question or two. Arriving around 10:15 a.m., this reporter was the first\u2014and eventually would be the only\u2014person to show up from the entire media, and the only person to show up who wasn\u2019t there as part of the official Democratic Party delegation despite the fact that several reporters were in South Carolina from national media outlets. The rest of the five or six people at the event were Democratic Party activists, including Chairman Harrison. Two college students, who were aligned with the College Democrats and were supposed to speak if there was a press conference, walked in and sat down in the chairs.\n\nOne local Democratic Party activist, who didn\u2019t identify himself by name but was part of the group of officials there, set up a sign with tape stuck to the podium at the front of the room that branded the \u201cpress conference\u201d for the SCDP\u2014or South Carolina Democratic Party. The room\u2014complete with about 20 chairs for all the reporters the Democrats were expecting\u2014overlooked a beautiful and luxurious outdoor pool with lounge chairs, canopies, and palm trees all around it.\n\nAs the start time was getting closer and closer, the local activist who had just taped the SCDP sign to the podium called someone on his cell phone\u2014presumably the national Democratic official who has handling RSVPs from press for the event\u2014and asked for a list of RSVPs. Several minutes later, at this point well after the start time for the press conference, Harrison\u2014the South Carolina Democratic Chairman\u2014said they were waiting for a few other reporters to show up. Five or so more minutes later, when nobody did, he said that the local networks would just take a statement they could air on their broadcasts later. This reporter offered to do the same and just take a prepared statement, but Harrison and the other Democrats present insisted on rearranging the chairs in the room and having a circle roundtable discussion about their concerns with Rand Paul.\n\nThat\u2019s when things got a little bit weird.\n\nKicking off the \u201croundtable discussion,\u201d Harrison hammered Paul for \u201ctrying to claim he\u2019s a new different kind of Republican, a Republican that will reach out to communities like the African-American community and Hispanic community.\u201d\n\nHarrison said that Paul \u201csays that \u2018I\u2019m the Republican that can reach out to African Americans\u2019 well, I\u2019m sorry when you don\u2019t support the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act and you don\u2019t support important civil rights legislation and you make these gaffes about these various things in civil rights history, that\u2019s not the way to\u2014\u201c\n\nAt that point, this reporter interjected asked him what he thinks of Paul\u2019s work on criminal justice reform, and specifically about his REDEEM Act with Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) where conservatives and liberals agree the government has been sometimes too heavy-handed in dealing with nonviolent offenders on minor crimes. Harrison actually ended up praising Paul for the criminal justice reform work, but argued Paul hasn\u2019t done enough for the black community because Paul is an ardent opponent of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one issue,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThe African-American community is not monolithic. We aren\u2019t only concerned about criminal justice issues. We are concerned about healthcare and he doesn\u2019t support the Affordable Care Act or Medicaid expansion that would take place and would help, here in South Carolina, almost 400,000 people in this state. I applaud him for working with Sen. Booker and I would love to see more of this partisan working across the aisles to try to get things done on behalf of the American people but when you take a look at things like shutting down the government and everything else he had one good day. That does not mean you are now qualified to be president and to say that you have this mantle of \u2018I can bring people together,\u2019 because that\u2019s just not his record.\u201d\n\nAt that point, this reporter asked the panel of Democrats for their thoughts on abortion\u2014specifically whether any of them would back allowing a seven pound baby to be aborted in the uterus, a question Paul himself had put to DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz the day before in Milford, New Hampshire, when the mainstream media was coming after him. Wasserman Schultz still hasn\u2019t answered the question Paul put to her personally, but these local Democrats did a great job answering for her.\n\n\u201cI think on that part, too, the Democratic Party is diverse. People have a range of thoughts on that,\u201d Brady Quirk-Garvan, the chairman of the Charleston, South Carolina Democratic Party, answered first.\n\n\u201cI mean, a seven pound baby is like a week from being born,\u201d this reporter said, wondering why Democrats like these would support aborting a baby that late in a pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ludicrous question,\u201d Kaye Koonce, the vice chairwoman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said. \u201cHe [Paul] was deflecting the questions to him to a ridiculous question to someone who\u2019s not running for president.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s real piece,\u201d Quirk-Garvan added. \u201cDebbie Wasserman Schultz is a wonderful congresswoman who is not running for president. Rand Paul is and he won\u2019t answer where he stands on abortion and I think that\u2019s the real question: Where does he stand as the person who\u2019s wanting to be in the White House? To me it seems like it\u2019s more games on his part. You know, he deflects the question.\u201d\n\nThey still weren\u2019t being clear with their answers, so this reporter followed up again: \u201cBut would anybody here support aborting a seven pound baby in the uterus?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould anybody anywhere?\u201d Koonce asked in response.\n\n\u201cWell then why didn\u2019t the chairwoman answer that?\u201d this reporter asked again.\n\nKoonce said that Wasserman Schultz hasn\u2019t answered Paul\u2019s question because she\u2019s a career politician.\n\n\u201cWell, I think she is a politician just like he is and actually her answer was \u2018I support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved,\u2019 so if there\u2019s some doctor out there that said that was a necessary procedure and that\u2019s what he advised his patient then that should be between the two of them not the government,\u201d Koonce said. \u201cRand Paul was for exceptions to the abortion ban before he was against them. You can\u2019t get a straight answer from him on that. I would love for you to be the reporter when you go down the street today to get that straight answer from him on exceptions to the abortion ban.\u201d\n\nAt that point, I followed up with Koonce again. \u201cAnd also kind of following up on her statement that the government shouldn\u2019t be involved, do you take that to mean the government shouldn\u2019t be funding Planned Parenthood or should they be involved in that avenue?\u201d this reporter asked.\n\n\u201cIt was in the decision between the woman and her family and her doctor on what to do\u2014not who would fund what would be done,\u201dshe said. \u201cYou see? I don\u2019t think that was a part of her question and at the end of the day it\u2019s way over my pay grade.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood does a lot more than just abortion related type things,\u201d Harrison jumped in.\n\nLater, after the Democrats defended Obamacare as a \u201csuccess\u201d for several minutes, the conversation turned to all the new polls showing that Hillary Clinton\u2014the likely Democratic Party frontrunner in 2016\u2014is trailing Paul in several key states like Colorado, Pennsylvania, and now Iowa.\n\n\u201cI think that we would welcome\u2014and would beat\u2014any Republican, but we would really welcome Rand Paul to be the GOP nominee,\u201d Quirk-Garvan said in response to a question about the Democrats\u2019 thoughts on why Paul is beating Clinton in major polls in presidential swing states right now. \u201cHe is a far right wing ideologue. And I think when it\u2019s early and people haven\u2019t gotten a chance to meet him all that much, he sounds nice on the surface. But I think a year and a half of exposing Rand Paul for the right wing lunatic that he is will go a long way in driving his poll numbers down. So if the Republican Party wants to nominate him, more power to them\u2014and we look forward to defeating him in 18 months.\u201d\n\nHarrison used his answer to hammer Paul for his interview on the Today show, suggesting that his battle with Savannah Guthrie over unfair questions showed Paul to have thin skin.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you what, if he couldn\u2019t take the questioning on the Today show without getting upset, let him go to a few Iowa fairs and go to New Hampshire in the winter and then come down here to South Carolina and get roughed up a little bit by some of the questions he\u2019s going to get from everyday Americans in these states,\u201d he said. \u201cHis skin is too thin to be president of the United States. He doesn\u2019t think that someone should question his thoughts, his ideology or his beliefs. If you\u2019re president of the United States, you have to be president of all the people not just some of them and not just yourself. I just don\u2019t think Rand Paul has the mettle, the gravitas to be president of the United States. But if the Republicans want to nominate him, go right ahead.\u201d\n\nKoonce implied she thinks Paul is sexist.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s telling with all the kerfuffles that two times he\u2019s sort of \u2018shushed\u2019 female reporters and yesterday someone I think whispered in his ear that he needs to be just as big a jerk to male reporters so it\u2019s not so obvious. Then he chooses Debbie Wasserman Schultz to question\u2014someone not running for president,\u201d Koonce said.\n\nUnforturnately for Democrats, the New York Times\u2019 Jeremy Peters undercut that line of criticism with a simple tweet. \u201cRand patronizing women reporters is a catty, clever DNC line. But it\u2019s not accurate. I can attest,\u201d Peters wrote via Twitter, adding that Phillip Elliott of the Associated Press and John Harwood of CNBC can back him up on that.\n\nAfter that, the Democrats sought to use the roundtable to hammer Paul on student loans and on the \u201cPaycheck Fairness Act\u201d\u2014a Democratic messaging bill that Paul hasn\u2019t voted for\u2014for several minutes before this reporter told them he had to go cover Paul\u2019s speech, bringing the painfully awkward session to an end after nearly 20 minutes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MOUNT PLEASANT, South Carolina \u2014 The Democratic Party of the State of South Carolina failed tremendously in an attempt to bracket a speech here by newly announced presidential candidate Sen.
