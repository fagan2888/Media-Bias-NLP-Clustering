In his response statement, Hannity called Schultz a \"total buffoon\" and wrote, \"I really have better things to do with my time.\"\n\n\u201cWhile I understand little Eddie desperately needs attention, he unfortunately does not have the intelligence, wit, humor or debating skills,\" Hannity said.\n\nBut on Monday's segment of \"Pretenders,\" the MSNBC host immediately called Hannity's bluff, claiming that he \"doesn't have the guts to go head to head\" in an on-air debate.\n\n\"Now he says he doesn't have any time for me, yet he sure as hell loves playing me on his show,\" Schultz said.\n\nSchultz also made sure to show Hannity just how much \"wit\" and \"humor\" he really has, featuring Hannity dressed as a cowardly lion and referring to him as \"The Cowardly Liar.\"\n\n\"Hannity claims that I\u2019m looking for attention? Excuse me? I\u2019ve been in this business for 35 years. I\u2019ve got all the attention I want,\u201d Schultz said. \"Hannity uses his TV show as a means to twist the facts about Obamacare because he hates the president. If Sean Hannity wants to pretend he\u2019s not a coward on debating me or correcting his mistakes, he can keep on pretending.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: The Debates The Debates\n\n1 of 39 Kennedy vs Nixon '60 From ABC News, portion of first presidential debate September 26, 1960.
