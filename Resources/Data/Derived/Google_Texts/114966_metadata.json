While the president admitted 2013 has been a rough year he is still hopeful about his next three years in office.\n\nEvery year the First Family decides to head back to the president\u2019s birth state of Hawaii for a tropical vacation, but their plans are usually delayed due to an unsettled Congress.\n\nThis year, however, they actually started their vacation on time and President Obama kicked things off with a day of golf.\n\nThe First Family touched down in Hawaii on Friday and on Saturday the president was spotted out at a golf course near the Marine Corps base along with White House chef Sam Kass, trip director Marvin Nicholson, and close friend Bobby Titcomb.\n\nBefore the president could even begin what he hoped would be a quiet round of gold, onlookers had already lined up along the road to watch the president\u2019s motorcade ride by.\n\nDespite the large crowds the president was still seen smiling inside his vehicle while wearing a tan baseball cap, a white golf shirt and a pair of sunglasses.\n\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama and daughters Sasha and Malia weren\u2019t spotted out during the president\u2019s golf trip but they were likely enjoying some peace and quiet at the beachside home in Kailua where the First Family will be staying during their vacation.\n\nThe first dogs Sunny and Bo were also brought along on the trip.\n\nThe peaceful atmosphere of Hawaii\u2019s breathtaking shores is exactly what the president and First Family need after a rough end to 2013.\n\nThe items on President Obama\u2019s to-do list that earned his re-election in 2012 have slowly, but surely been shot down one-by-one.\n\nThe National Rifle Association has remained strong against gun reform proposals and ultimately won the fight against President Obama\u2019s wish for more gun control.\n\nThen the laugh of the Affordable Health Care Act was crippled by server website issues and a complicated user interface that prevented many people from even completing the enrollment process.\n\nUltimately, the president\u2019s approval ratings were pushed down to levels that closely match those of President Bush. With more serious problems awaiting solutions it\u2019s likely that the beginning of 2014 will be a pivotal moment for the president and his administration.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrible year,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University. \u201cIt can be rescued. There are good reasons to believe he will end his presidency in better shape than today.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama also felt like 2013 brought along some serious challenges but he is hopeful about what the following three years may bring.\n\nDuring a recent press conference the president said \u201c2014 can be a breakthrough year for America\u201d despite 2013 being a year full of \u201cnear-death experiences.\u201d\n\nThe president hopes to deliver on this statement and in order to do so he has been careful not to become too relaxed while on his family vacation.\n\nIn addition to hitting the golf course, President Obama spent Saturday conferring with top advisers about the ongoing tense situation in South Sudan.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "President Obama and the First Family have kicked off their Hawaii vacation despite pessimistic attitudes in Congress regarding the current state of the economy.
