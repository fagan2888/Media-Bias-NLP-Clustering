Consumers clearly prefer the personal ratings and information available via apps with ridesharing services to trusting the regulators of taxi companies that have given them stodgy, low-quality, expensive services for decades.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no justification for regulating this market, other than basic insurance requirements, now that technology has solved any information problems between consumers and providers of paid rides,\u201d Moore said.\n\nIncreasing Market Size\n\nPeer-to-peer economy services benefit consumers and should be only lightly regulated, Moore says.\n\n\u201cThese ridesharing services are increasing the market for paid rides,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThat is good for the economy and the environment, so legislators should no put any barriers in the way. The only regulations needed now are basic insurance requirements.\u201d\n\nSlow Adoption of Improvements\n\nMatt Blackburn, a policy analyst for the nonpartisan Pioneer Institute, says the traditional taxicab industry has a history of being slow to respond to consumers\u2019 demands.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the way that taxis have historically functioned, they have been especially slow to adopt technological improvements that consumers have long called for,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cSome examples in the last 10 years are credit card readers and GPS. These are things that are very basic [and] that improve the consumer experience that the market really demands. There\u2019s no incentive for taxi companies to meet consumer demands, because they weren\u2019t worried about losing any market share.\u201d\n\nKimberly Morin (kimberlyamorin@gmail.com) writes from Brentwood, New Hampshire.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nBrad N.
