TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - A South Florida Democrat on Thursday proposed a constitutional amendment aimed at automatically restoring the voting rights of many convicted felons.



Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, filed the proposal (SJR 192) for consideration during the 2016 legislative session, which starts in January.



If approved by the Legislature, the proposal would go on the November 2016 ballot.



The measure seeks to restore the voting rights of felons who have completed their sentences. People with restored rights also would be eligible to hold public office.



Automatic restoration would not apply to felons convicted of sexual offenses or homicide.
