That included 495,073 people who newly signed up for 2015 coverage.\n\nThe state was aiming for 1.7 million enrolled in the second year of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut the state said it started the fall renewal season with fewer people than expected because a lower percentage of customers paid their initial premium and fewer people joined during a special enrollment period due to losing a job or moving out of Medi-Cal.\n\nWhile short of its overall goal, the state said it made progress with some key groups, such as Latinos and young people.\n\nAmong those eligible for federal premium subsidies, 37% of new enrollees identified themselves as Latino. That was up from 31% in 2014.\n\nThe percentage of new enrollees who are 18 to 34 also increased to 34% compared with 29% last year.\n\nAs for health insurers, HMO giant Kaiser Permanente made the biggest move in 2015.\n\nIt grabbed 28% of new enrollment, tied for the top spot with Anthem Blue Cross.\n\nKaiser significantly lowered its rates for this year after finishing fourth in the exchange last year with a 17% share of the market.\n\nBlue Shield of California suffered the biggest dropoff in new business, capturing just 19% of new enrollment after getting 27% in the first year.\n\nOverall, Anthem remained the leader in exchange enrollment with 28% of new business and renewals, state figures show.\n\nBlue Shield remained in second with 25%, followed by Kaiser with 24% share and Health Net Inc. with 18%.\n\nTogether, the state's four largest health insurers hold 95% of the Covered California market. Consumers in Northern California counties, in particular, have complained about the lack of competition and choices in their area.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obamacare: Agents signed up 43% of new California enrollment", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "California fell short of its second-year enrollment goal for Obamacare , but don't blame insurance agents.", "title": "Obamacare: Agents signed up 43% of new California enrollment", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-covered-california-20150309-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54fdbab5/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-covered-california-20150309", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, covered california, insurance agents, affordable care act", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83009947", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-03-09", "Description": "California fell short of its second-year enrollment goal for Obamacare, but don't blame insurance agents.
