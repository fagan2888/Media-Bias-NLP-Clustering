Ben Carson suggests a flat tax between 10 and 15 percent. Ted Cruz wants to eliminate the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nBut many of the candidates' own claims about their tax plans were not grounded in facts. What's more, experts said, the idea that you could cut taxes without blowing up the federal debt is mathematically and politically impossible.\n\nMost of the plans trumpet giveaways on the tax side but offer almost no specifics on how to reduce spending, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nAccording to analysis by the free market-oriented think tank the Tax Foundation, all but one of the formal plans released by GOP candidates would lead to revenue loss.\n\n\"It's a race to a bottom in terms of the revenue component here. We cannot deliver $10 trillion in tax cuts,\" Goldwein said. \"Each new plan seems to be more expensive. That may sound great to the voters. It's all goodies and relatively little pain. But when you have trillions of dollars in tax cuts, you create a hole for yourself that'll be hard to dig out of.\"\n\nProjections of the economic impact of the plans may also understate just how much revenue would be lost. Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan think tank Tax Policy Center pointed out that people could adjust their accounting to take advantage of the incentives under each plan. What's more, the plans lack detail, and the Tax Policy Center has declined to analyze them until more specifics are released.\n\nExperts agreed that none of the plans as they stand have any chance of being enacted. Most of them are more symbolic posturing than realistic policy agendas, according to Joseph Thorndike, a tax historian at the nonprofit Tax Analysts.\n\nAmbitious calls for reform and cuts are nothing new \u2014 even the flat tax has enjoyed \"several flurries of interest\" \u2014 but very few of them see the light of day, Thorndike told us. Ronald Reagan, who delivered on the broad strokes of the tax plan he campaigned on, is one exception to the rule, but Reagan \"also walked back on a lot of that over the years.\"\n\n\"Take these plans with a healthy dose of salt. A grain's not enough,\" Thorndike said.\n\nSo with many spoonfuls of salt, we took a look at claims from the five leading GOP candidates about their tax plans. We found a flurry of half-truths and downright falsehoods.\n\nTrump's not-so-revenue-neutral plan\n\nTrump, the GOP frontrunner, released his formal tax plan in September, which aims to (you guessed it) \"make America great again\" through a variety of tax changes:\n\n\u2022 Four income tax brackets with rates of 0, 10, 20 and 25 percent, with no deductions except for the charitable and mortgage interest deductions;\n\n\u2022 A corporate tax rate of 15 percent, an end to the deferment of overseas corporate income, and repatriating of foreign income at a 10 percent rate;\n\n\u2022 A pass-through business income tax rate of 15 percent;\n\n\u2022 A capital gains tax at 0, 15 and 20 percent; and a tax on carried interest as ordinary income;\n\n\u2022 Elimination of the alternative minimum tax, the estate tax and the Affordable Care Act taxes.\n\nTrump claims that this plan will cut taxes without raising the deficit because of all the economic growth it will spur, but PolitiFact rated that claim False. Free market-oriented and liberal groups alike say Trump's tax plan would lead to at least a $10 trillion revenue loss over a decade, even if it did create economic growth.\n\nTo make the plan revenue neutral, Trump would have to make huge spending cuts. But the scale of those costs would not be realistic, analysts said, especially since Trump himself has said he intends to protect popular but costly programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThe hole in Carson's tithe-based tax plan\n\nCarson, the former neurosurgeon, has yet to release a formal tax plan. This is what he has proposed so far:\n\n\u2022 A flat income tax rate of 10 to 15 percent, phased in over time, with no deductions or loopholes;\n\n\u2022 A six-month tax hiatus for corporate profits overseas, but 10 percent has to be used in enterprise zones;\n\n\u2022 A corporate tax rate of 15 to 20 percent;\n\n\u2022 Eliminating the payroll tax, estate tax and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDuring the debate, CNBC moderator Becky Quick pointed out that Carson's proposed flat tax would lead to a $1.1 trillion hole per year. Carson denied this, but by Quick's and his own math, it would.\n\nUnder Carson's plan, the government would collect about $2.6 trillion in income and corporate taxes, about $0.6 trillion short of anticipated revenue and $1.1 trillion short of spending. Even if he leaves other sources of revenue intact, his proposal to get rid of the payroll and estate taxes alone puts him in this hole.\n\nCarson crunched the numbers himself, saying his plan comes out even, if you tax GDP (gross domestic product, a measure of the overall economy) at 15 percent. Experts told us it's not possible to tax all of GDP, and even if you could, it would still create a $1 trillion hole.\n\nWe rated Carson's claim that it wouldn't as False.\n\nRubio's tax plan and the working class\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio has seen an uptick in the polls thanks to his performance in the CNBC debate. He has proposed the following:\n\n\u2022 Collapse the current seven brackets to just three \u2014 15 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent \u2014 and set the top bracket's rate lower than the current 39.6 percent top rate;\n\n\u2022 Exempt interest, dividends and capital gains from income taxes;\n\n\u2022 Repeal the alternative minimum tax, the estate tax, and all taxes levied under the Affordable Care Act;\n\n\u2022 Reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, down from 35 percent;\n\n\u2022 Create a new, partially refundable child tax credit of up to $2,500 per child;\n\n\u2022 Replace the standard deduction with a new refundable personal tax credit of $2,000 for individuals or $4,000 for married couples filing jointly. This credit would phase out at $150,000 for individuals and at $300,000 for married couples filing jointly and would disappear entirely at $200,000 for individuals and $400,000 for married couples filing jointly.\n\nRubio said the poor would receive more benefits \"percentage-wise\" than the rich under his tax plan.\n\nThat's partially accurate. While the largest percentage gains would show up in the bottom 20 percent of Americans, the biggest gains in terms of raw dollars go to the top. We rated his claim Half True.\n\nCruz's growth promise\n\nDuring the debate, Texas Sen. Cruz touted what his plan would accomplish for the economy. Here are some of its features:\n\n\u2022 Impose a single individual income tax rate of 10 percent on all income sources, including capital gains and dividends;\n\n\u2022 Eliminate all existing deductions, except on mortgage interest and charitable contributions, but implement a $10,000 standard deduction;\n\n\u2022 Implement a 16 percent business flat tax (essentially a value-added tax) and eliminate the corporate income tax;\n\n\u2022 Repeal the payroll tax, the alternative minimum tax, the estate tax and the Affordable Care Act;\n\n\u2022 Abolish the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nCruz said his proposal would cause the economy to grow 14 percent, according to the pro-growth Tax Foundation. We didn't rate his claim, but we should note that Cruz neglected to mention that the foundation calculated an estimate for the growth generated over a 10-year period. In other words, it's not an annual growth rate of 14 percent. It's also worth noting that prominent scholars have criticized Tax Foundation's models in the past for overly optimistic estimates of how much tax policy proposals would impact the economy.\n\nBush's tax plan and the middle class\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's proposal emphasizes streamlining the tax code. His plan:\n\n\u2022 Cut the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three with rates of 10, 25 and 28 percent, down from a current top rate of 39.6 percent;\n\n\u2022 Lower the top corporate tax rate and taxes on capital gains to 20 percent;\n\n\u2022 Eliminate the estate tax, gift tax, Alternative Minimum Tax and the Affordable Care Act (and its 3.8 percent surtax on investment income);\n\n\u2022 Limit itemized deductions to 2 percent of adjusted gross income, except for charitable contributions, and eliminate deductions for state and local taxes;\n\n\u2022 Increase standard deductions for single filers by $5,000 and for joint filers by $10,000 and double Earned Income Tax Credit for childless workers.\n\nThis plan, says Bush, \"actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.\"\n\nOur research showed that middle-class families could potentially realize a higher percentage tax break, based on Bush's plan. But Bush's own analysis looked only at those who don't itemize deductions. In practice, it's likely the highest earners would see the real windfall from Bush's plan. We rated Bush's claim Mostly False.\n\nWaiting for details\n\nSo far, nine out of the 14 Republican candidates have rolled out formal tax plans, but only seven had enough details for the Tax Foundation to model, said foundation president Scott Hodge.\n\nAs the field narrows, the plans could become more substantive or disappear into the ether.\n\n\"The interesting question is when we boil down to fewer candidates whether candidates will refine their plans further,\" said Williams, of the Tax Policy Center. \"Some have lots of detail already. But others, particularly Carson, have only dim outlines and some \u2014 (Carly) Fiorina, (Lindsey) Graham \u2014 have offered nothing beyond the broadest of platitudes.\"\n\nWilliams and Thorndike, the tax historian, both see a divide between the mainstream plans that retain most of the current tax code (Bush, Trump, Rubio) and the ones that seek to radically change it (Carson, Cruz, Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul).\n\nThe more conventional plans that propose modest changes have some potential, but that doesn't mean they're ready to go as-is, according to Goldwein.\n\nAnd keep in mind Congress has a huge role in creating a new tax system, as legislation has to make it through both the House the Senate.\n\nThe makes challenges facing the more ambitious plans all the more difficult. According to Thorndike, if voters elect a Republican president and Republicans retain control of both chambers of Congress, \"we might see some pretty dramatic legislation \u2014 not an $11 trillion tax cut like Donald Trump wants, but a cut.\"\n\n\"But any other arrangement?\" he said. \"There'll be no significant tax reform.\"\n\nTimes staff writers Lauren Carroll, Joshua Gillin and Louis Jacobson contributed.
