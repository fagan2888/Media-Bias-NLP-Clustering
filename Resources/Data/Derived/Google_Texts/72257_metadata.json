The first relates to engagement with stakeholders and legislators. We\u2019ve learned a lot through our dual eligibles [demonstration project].\u201d\n\nThe department conducted an extensive and ongoing series of stakeholder engagement events with the duals project, Douglas said, including webinars, workshops and large information-gathering stakeholder meetings.\n\n\u201cWith our SPDs (seniors and persons with disabilities), we didn\u2019t do enough of that,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cAs we look at other transitions, we want to make sure we have enough outreach.\u201d\n\nDouglas said experience has shown the importance of several factors, including:\n\nGetting patient data to the plans in a timely manner;\n\nEnsuring more people understand they have the right to continuity of care;\n\nMonitoring the performance of health plans; and\n\nImproving outreach to providers.\n\n\u201cWe want to have more engagement directly with providers,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cWe also have an ombudsman grant from CMS to do more work on that front.\u201d\n\nDouglas took responsibility for missteps in utilizing the medical exemption review process during the transition of seniors and persons with disabilities.\n\n\u201cWe made major mistakes as a department,\u201d Douglas said.\n\nIn particular, he said, DHCS needs to do a better job of informing beneficiaries about their right to a medical exemption review.\n\nVanessa Cajina, a legislative advocate for the Western Center on Law and Poverty, praised Douglas for his remarks and for the renewed commitment to patients\u2019 continuity of care, but said a lot of damage already has been done.\n\n\u201cSadly that has come at the expense of the health of some of our beneficiaries,\u201d Cajina said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>An Assembly health committee hearing yesterday examined the long list of current and pending Medi-Cal managed care transitions with the goal of correcting missteps of the past and avoiding new ones in the future.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "An Assembly health committee hearing yesterday examined the long list of current and pending Medi-Cal managed care transitions with the goal of correcting missteps of the past and avoiding new ones\u2026", "title": "Medi-Cal Transition \u2018Lessons Learned\u2019", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/lessons-learned-from-medical-transitions/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2013-10-24T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-24T03:00:00+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2526\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA significant concern of mine is to bring public transparency and accountability to the Medi-Cal managed care program,\u201d Pan said.\nWith the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the pending expansion of Medi-Cal coverage, the transparency and accountability so vital to all of those Medi-Cal managed care transitions could be compromised, Pan said.\n\u201cEven as we\u2019re expanding Medi-Cal, we want to make sure we pay close attention to those people who are already in the Medi-Cal program.\u201dDHCS Director Toby Douglas offered a long list of \u201clessons learned\u201d that can help the department improve on previous transitions.\n\u201cWe made major mistakes as a department,\u201d Douglas said.\n\u201cWe want to make sure the ACA implementation doesn\u2019t interfere with our recent transition programs,\u201d Pan said."}
