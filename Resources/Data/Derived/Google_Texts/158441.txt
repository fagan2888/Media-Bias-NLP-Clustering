The health plan that Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Wisconsin will sell on the marketplace, or exchange, for individuals and families will be tied to a narrow network of hospitals and doctors.

The network will include Aurora Health Care, ThedaCare and Aspirus as well as other physician practices and clinics.

Anthem Blue Cross is the only established insurance company that intends to sell health plans in southeastern Wisconsin through the marketplaces that will be set up next month under the Affordable Care Act.

The company's health plan will be available in eastern and in north-central Wisconsin.

"We have invested a lot of time and money," said Larry Schreiber, president of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Wisconsin. "We are looking to bring as many people as we can into our plans and onto the exchange."

Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative, a nonprofit insurance company created by a coalition of religious groups and other organizations, and Molina Healthcare Inc., which sells health plans for people covered by Medicaid and Medicare, also plan to participate in the exchanges in the Milwaukee area.

Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative also will sell a health plan tied to Aurora's network of hospitals and doctors. It also is offering a health plan with a broader network.

Last summer, Anthem Blue Cross reached an agreement with Aurora to offer a health plan to employers tied to Aurora's network of hospital and doctors.

The health plan that will be offered on the exchange adds physician practices and clinics to the network.

Anthem Blue Cross stressed that it will continue to offer the same health plans now available to employers.

People who buy health insurance on their own also will be able to renew their existing plans with Anthem Blue Cross.

The company, however, does not plan to accept new customers for those plans.
