Eugene, Ore. — Kelsey Card's successful year ended just short of an incredible accomplishment.

Card, who recently finished her junior season at the University of Wisconsin, was fourth in the discus at the U.S. Outdoor Championships on Saturday. The top three advance to the World Championships.

Card heads home after breaking her own Big Ten record with a toss of 196 feet and seven inches. Gia Lewis-Smallwood won the event at 207 feet. Card was two feet short of the third-place finisher.

Card was coming off a pair runner-up finishes in the discus and shot put at the NCAA Outdoor Championships earlier this month.

Card was 18th in the shot put on Thursday.

UW's Zach Ziemek was still buzzing about earning a spot for the World Championships by finishing third in the decathlon on Friday.

"It felt awesome to wear the Wisconsin jersey again after redshirting the collegiate season," Ziemek said. "I knew I had to make the team by running well in the 1,500 meters and I was able to put everything I had into it and it is amazing that I'm able to represent Wisconsin and the United States in Beijing."

Ziemek also topped the "A" qualifying standard for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. He could qualify for the Games if he gets a top-three finish at next year's USA Olympic Trials.

UW's Deanna Latham is in 11th place after the first day of the heptathlon. She has 3,431 points after finishing 10th in the 100-meter hurdles, 11th in the high jump, ninth in the shot put and 13th in the 200 meters.
