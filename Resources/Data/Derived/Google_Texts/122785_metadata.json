If Obamacare didn\u2019t kick in for you yet, and you have no other insurance, just go to your neighborhood barber shop.\n\nNope, that\u2019s not a typo, I said \u201cbarbershop.\u201d\n\nThanks to a grant for $8.5 million from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to Cedars-Sinai, 20 Los Angeles black barbershop employees will be trained to check patrons for high blood pressure, the medical center announced.\n\n\u201cUncontrolled hypertension is one of the biggest health problems facing the African-American community today,\u201d said Dr. Ronald G. Victor, director of the Hypertension Center at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, in a statement released by the medical center. The statement says that the 2011 Victor\u2019s study showed that if barbers checked their clients\u2019 blood pressure during visits and encouraged \u201d \u2026 patrons with hypertension to follow up with physicians, hundreds of lives could be saved annually.\u201d\n\n\u201cHypertension is called the silent killer because there are no symptoms,\u201d Victor said in the statement. \u201cWe need to find a way to reach out to the community and prevent the serious complications caused by high blood pressure because all too often, by the time a patient finds out they have the condition, the heart and kidneys already have been damaged.\u201d\n\nAfrican Americans have historically been known to be disproportionately affected by high blood pressure due to poor diet, lack of exercise and higher levels of stress. Black-owned barbershops and hair salons should prove to be an effective means of reaching this segment of the population.\n\nAccording to the Cedars-Sinai statement, Victor\u2019s study also demonstrates that \u201d \u2026 if hypertension intervention programs were put in place in the estimated 18,000 African-American barbershops in the U.S., it would result in the first year in about 800 fewer heart attacks, 550 fewer strokes and 900 fewer deaths.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope that the new trial\u2019s outcomes will show an even greater benefit while lowering the cost of providing high-quality health care for hypertension in a high-risk population,\u201d Victor said in the statement.\n\nRead more at Cedars-Sinai.\n\n16 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?
