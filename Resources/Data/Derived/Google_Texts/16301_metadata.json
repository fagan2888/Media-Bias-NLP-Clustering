There\u2019s no resurrected person of the week, thank goodness.\n\nBellamy wants to test the remains against the living Jacob. The Langstons object. And Elaine isn\u2019t very interested in knowing what happened to undead Dad, Caleb Richards, either. I can\u2019t decide if this is plausible or not. If you weren\u2019t sure you wanted to know, would you go to lengths to stop from finding out? It\u2019s worth considering. Because after all, what if he\u2019s one of those clever simulating alien-types from Star Trek. You know? Maybe your returned loved one is in reality a blob of squeaky gelatin. This week\u2019s episode is a little deeper on atmosphere, a little slower on plot, than the pilot. That\u2019s all to the good.\n\nFred the sheriff is angry in an overkill kind of way. He tells his daughter that her mother had post-partum depression, and is mad at her when that doesn\u2019t stop her from wanting to open the tomb. For him it\u2019s about desecration, not fact-finding. For Lucille and Fred Langston, not wanting the tomb opened is about emotional pain.\n\nAnd we finally got Jacob out of his death clothes and into new little boy clothes as he goes to play soccer with other little boys. But it\u2019s not easy being newly not-dead: the other parents call their kids off the field. I wonder what exactly they think their kids could catch from resurrected Jacob? I guess the families are scared in a general way. Bellamy suggest they lie about who Jacob is, for now. I don\u2019t know, is it just me, or would most kids want to run up and quiz the new boy about being dead, I mean, how cool is that?\n\nRev. Tom tells Lucille, Jacob\u2019s mom, that some people in the congregation were also kind of freaked out, and thinks pretending Jacob is someone else is a good idea. And he refuses to meet Jacob, although he was once Jacob\u2019s best friend, e though Jacob is sitting right there. But then he does stop by later. While Tom sets up a video game, Jacob recalls how a he used to set up the film in a favorite teacher\u2019s class. Tom hadn\u2019t thought about her for years, but \u201cshe was my favorite teacher,\u201d Jacob says. Aw, poor kid. If it really is him, this memory isn\u2019t 32 years old, for him. Lucille runs hurriedly from the kitchen hearing raised voices of \u201cno\u201d and \u201cback up\u201d and is relieved to find it\u2019s just Jacob and Tom playing a video game together. \u201cThis is the first time you\u2019ve played this?\u201d Tom says. Yep. Kids are that good at picking up electronic games.\n\nThe older dead not dead person, Caleb Richards, is more articulate than Jacob, and actually wears hospital clothing when they examine him, unlike Jacob who stayed in that damn sweatshirt for a week. Maggie, the doctor (are there no conflicts of interest in Arcadia?) is puzzled by how he had had a heart attack three days ago when he said he woke up. She too wonders if they cremated the wrong person. Elaine says all that matters is her dad is back and he\u2019s different. And, she says, maybe some things are more important, when Maggie asks her if she wants to know the truth. Later, she sees his jacket lying on a chair and flashes back to him wearing it at an open casket funeral, where she put a note in his pocket. She digs into the pocket, but the note is not there. Ray tells Elaine that he\u2019s been watching \u201cthat man\u201d and he\u2019s not dad, he\u2019s pretending. Maybe it is just a squeaky blob of gelatin for real. Out of the mouth of the unstable, eh? But maybe these people don\u2019t know they are imposters Dad is digging in the yard something that looks like a grave when he has a flashback to having a heart attack. That seems to unnerve him, but he keeps digging, and stops when he finds something white in the hole\u2014a piece of a shirt? I couldn\u2019t tell. Later Dad catches Ray snooping in his room. And we see Dad pull the note from Elaine out of his Bible, and fold it up. He seems to have seen it before.\n\nMaggie finds the man her mother had an affair with. He tells her he\u2019s not her father, but he waited by the river until someone found her. He did not leave her. \u201cShe found us,\u201d he tells someone we can\u2019t see.\n\nThe second time Jacob is at the playground, Lucille tells Bellamy they\u2019ve decided Jacob shouldn\u2019t have to lie. Then we see Elaine\u2019s dad talking to him\u2014shudder. Bellamy runs over. What did he say? \u201cLie,\u201d Jacob replies.\n\nWe end at the grand tomb opening.\n\nWhat do you think? Are people not nearly curious enough? Is the atmosphere on? What was the white thing in the hole? Are the dead people who they claim to be?", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Here's our recap of \"Resurrection.\"", "title": "\u2018Resurrection, Season 1, Episode 2, \u2018Unearth\u2019: TV Recap", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/03/16/resurrection-season-1-episode-2-unearth-tv-recap/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BY254_resurr_P_20140316222226.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "\u2018Resurrection, Season 1, Episode 2, \u2018Unearth\u2019: TV Recap", "description": "Here's our recap of \"Resurrection.\"", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Gwen Orel", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Here's our recap of \"Resurrection.\"", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-03-17T02:23:19-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/03/16/resurrection-season-1-episode-2-unearth-tv-recap/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-80330", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Here's our recap of \"Resurrection.\"", "title": "\u2018Resurrection, Season 1, Episode 2, \u2018Unearth\u2019: TV Recap", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/03/16/resurrection-season-1-episode-2-unearth-tv-recap/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BY254_resurr_P_20140316222226.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-80330", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-17T02:24:07-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14a8\"", "article_summary": "Omar Epps and Frances Fisher in \u201cResurrection.\u201d Photo by Guy D\u2019AlemaTo open the tomb on \u201cResurrection,\u201d or not open the tomb?\nGetting the tomb open, the obvious step to discovering if dead Jacob is in two places at once, is the major plot point threading through this episode.\nRay tells Elaine that he\u2019s been watching \u201cthat man\u201d and he\u2019s not dad, he\u2019s pretending.\nThis week\u2019s episode is a little deeper on atmosphere, a little slower on plot, than the pilot.\nTom tells Lucille, Jacob\u2019s mom, that some people in the congregation were also kind of freaked out, and thinks pretending Jacob is someone else is a good idea."}
