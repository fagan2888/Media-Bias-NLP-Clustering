One person was treated at a Topeka hospital after he was injured in a rear-end collision Saturday morning on the city’s east side.

The accident was reported around 9:10 a.m. at S.E. 6th and Branner.

Police at the scene said a white Chevrolet pickup truck was traveling west on S.E. 6th just east of S.E. Branner when it ran into the back of a black, four-door Ford Fusion car.

After the impact, both vehicles traveled west across S.E. Branner, with the Fusion stopping on the east end of the Oscar Stauffer Viaduct — or S.E. 6th Street Bridge — and the pickup truck coming to rest in the right lane just west of S.E. Branner.

Police said the driver of the Ford complained of neck and back injuries, and he was being evaluated at the scene by American Medical Ambulance personnel. He was later treated at a local hospital.

The driver of the Chevy pickup was reported uninjured.
