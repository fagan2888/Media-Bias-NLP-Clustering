R&B singer Rihanna came second with 8.4 million tags. She was also named Spotify's most-streamed female artist for a second consecutive year.\n\n(Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Eric Kelsey and Philip Barbara)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Pop singer Miley Cyrus and the trial of boyfriend-killer Jodi Arias dominated Yahoo's online searches in 2013, the web search engine said on Tuesday, while rapper-producer duo Macklemore & Ryan Lewis dominated music streams on Spotify.", "title": "Miley Cyrus, Arias murder trial top Yahoo's 2013 searches", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20131203&t=2&i=817185070&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBRE9B21R3O00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
