But when a movie controversy crested, Philip Anschutz\u2019s Regal Cinemas caved.\n\nWhen the top movie-theater chains in the United States dropped Seth Rogen and James Franco\u2019s Kim Jong Un assassination comedy The Interview\u2014ostensibly over fear of terrorist attacks against their theaters\u2014Regal Cinemas was the greatest loss.\n\nRegal Entertainment Group is the biggest and most geographically diverse theater company in the country. It operates over 7,000 screens all over America. Industry sources with knowledge of the situation tell The Daily Beast that Regal and AMC Theatres were the \u201c\u201dfirst dominos to fall\u201d in the top-five theater circuits, essentially sealing the fate of The Interview.\n\n\u201cDue to the wavering support of the film The Interview by Sony Pictures, as well as the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats, Regal Entertainment Group has decided to delay the opening of the film in our theatres,\u201d Regal announced in their statement.\n\nRegal\u2019s move brings back into the public view a right-wing media baron who would rather be elsewhere. The chain\u2019s biggest owner is a secretive deeply conservative billionaire and devout Christian who is, according to The New Yorker, \u201cthe man who owns L.A.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhilip Anschutz, whose investment fund owns about 47 percent of Regal\u2019s shares, has all the makings of a major-league boogeyman of the left\u2014like a Rupert Murdoch or a Koch brother. He presides over a sprawling media and sports empire that spans from the Lakers to The Chronicles of Narnia. He has donated generously to conservative (and anti-gay) causes and candidates, including Rick Santorum, both Bush presidents, John McCain, and Mitt Romney. Last year, Regal Entertainment Group slashed some workers\u2019 hours down to 30 per week, blaming Obamacare. And Media Matters, the liberal media-watchdog group, labeled Anschutz, \u201cthe other right-wing media mogul you should worry about\u201d in 2009.\n\nAnd in 2002, Fortune magazine honored Anschutz with the distinction of America\u2019s \u201cgreediest executive.\u201d\n\nAlong with his large-scale philanthropic efforts, Anschutz owns a slew of news outlets such as the Washington Examiner and the neoconservative flagship The Weekly Standard, the latter of which he purchased from Murdoch's News Corp for roughly $1 million in 2009.\n\nThe Weekly Standard ran a couple items the day after the theaters and Sony dumped The Interview: \u201cThe surrender to North Korea is a historical moment,\u201d Bill Kristol, the magazine\u2019s editor, blogged. \u201cThe capitulation to North Korea could be\u2014unless we reverse course in a fundamental way\u2014a signpost in a collapse of civilizational courage.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccollapse\u201d started on Tuesday when Carmike Cinemas announced their decision to drop The Interview from its 278 theaters, several other major theater chains followed suit the next day, which caused Sony to ditch the planned Christmas Day release. The combined action set a very dangerous precedent\u2014all because of pro-North Korean hackers\u2019 threats that the Department of Homeland Security has said are not credible.\n\n\u201cThese guys are afraid of what happened to Sony happening to them I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Michael Goldfarb, a Weekly Standard contributing editor and a big player in neoconservative circles. \u201cThe government isn\u2019t doing anything to help them as they face the threat of attack by a foreign power. It\u2019s a disgrace but they aren\u2019t equipped to deal with this kind of thing.\u201d\n\n(The U.S. government has reportedly determined that the North Korean regime was \u201ccentrally involved\u201d in the Sony email hack, though this conclusion has its share of skeptics.)\n\nNowadays, it looks like Anschutz is trying to get out of the multiplex business. In October, news broke that Regal hired Morgan Stanley to explore a possible sale. As for whether or not Anschutz will personally address the international Interview affair?
