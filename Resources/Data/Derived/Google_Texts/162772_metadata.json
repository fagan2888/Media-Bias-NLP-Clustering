This isn\u2019t a bad thing; you can\u2019t understand Jim Crow without understanding the significance of the Klan, for example. But it\u2019s not an entirely good one, either.\n\nThe problem with focusing so much on these potent symbols is that it can lead us to a mistaken conclusion: namely, that the only evil of Jim Crow (and U.S. white supremacy in general) was manifested in these menacing, otherworldly forms, rather than in the system\u2019s more humdrum and everyday modes of dehumanization. The problem with the former is easily solved. Today, the burning cross, the noose and the Klansman are all enemies of polite society. But those subtler manifestations of apartheid \u2014 the interlocking social networks and political institutions that together worked to disempower black citizens and deny them their rightful place as full members of the community \u2014 have proven more difficult to shake.\n\nThe proof is all around us, but if you want a more tangible example, the news out of Ferguson, Missouri, is happy to oblige.\n\nAfter briefly turning the small, hard-luck suburb into the center of the world, the media has as of late been paying much less attention to the story of Michael Brown\u2019s killing, mostly because people on both sides of the controversy have been stuck in an anxious holding pattern, waiting to see if a county grand jury will bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson. Many observers, and seemingly most pro-Brown Ferguson protestors, expect it will not; and many are already positioning themselves to win the war for public opinion that will ensue the moment the charges (or lack thereof) come down.\n\nThat\u2019s the tense atmosphere into which the New York Times and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch recently dropped two bombs, both of which cited unnamed government sources saying evidence suggests Wilson\u2019s claim to have shot Brown only after the youth tried to nab his gun \u2014 and to have killed Brown only after the wounded and unarmed teenager decided to charge him head-on \u2014 is indeed the case, in spite of what multiple eyewitnesses have said. As more than a few people noticed, the leaks all seemed to go in a certain direction (Wilson\u2019s). Rather unnecessarily, the Brown family\u2019s lawyer assured the media that the leaks weren\u2019t coming from them. More necessarily, a forensic pathologist quoted extensively in the Post-Dispatch story said her remarks were taken out of context.\n\nAt this point in the story, anyone familiar with the dynamics of American race politics would suspect that like countless racially stratified and unharmonious small-town authorities before it, the establishment in Ferguson was doing its damnedest to quash an embarrassing investigation and protect one of its own. Perhaps aware of the likely widespread nature of that view, former St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch was swiftly thereafter quoted speculating that the leaks weren\u2019t coming from Ferguson authorities, but rather were the result of the Department of Justice\u2019s machinations. Because the feds recognize that it\u2019s \u201cprobably very unlikely\u201d that Wilson will be charged, Fitch said, the DOJ was selectively leaking evidence in order to \u201clet people down slowly\u201d before the announcement of no charges being filed came.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A string of leaks to the media protecting Darren Wilson are part of a very big problem.
