What has kept you here? My family lives here and I was born here.\n\nIf you could design a robot that could do anything, what would that robot do? I saw a demonstration of a humanoid robot that was programmed to work with kids with special needs such as autism, and I thought that something like that would be interesting to work with. For next year in robotics at school, though, I would like to learn how to program line sensors on the robot to sense lines that are taped down on our playing field so it can score more easily.\n\nWho inspires you to work hard in school, and why? I want to do my best in everything, so a lot of times I make myself work hard. I also like to keep up with or go further than my friends, so they help me do my best that way. My dad encourages me to learn more about the subjects than what I learn in school, too, and he helps me with that, particularly in math.\n\nWhat's the biggest worry or concern in your life right now? I don't know.\n\nWhat gives you joy? I enjoy reading and writing.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-review/ci_27741368/100-morgan-chen", "modificationDate": "2015-03-28T19:10:49-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_CHEN~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2025-03-18T22:36:47-0600", "description": "Age: 13\nOccupation: Student at Westview Middle School\nHow many years have you been in the St.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27741368:view"}, "startDate": "2015-03-29T01:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-review/ci_27741368/100-morgan-chen", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_CHEN~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Age: 13\nOccupation: Student at Westview Middle School\nHow many years have you been in the St.", "title": "100: Morgan Chen"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Age: 13\nOccupation: Student at Westview Middle School\nHow many years have you been in the St.", "title": "100: Morgan Chen", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-review/ci_27741368/100-morgan-chen", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_CHEN~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-29T01:00:00-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "sailthru.title": "100: Morgan Chen", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Community Review", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_CHEN~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-03-28T19:12:48-0600", "news_keywords": "longmont, colorado, community, review, weld, county, top 100, community review, longmont times call, longmont colorado"}, "article_summary": "I want to do my best in everything, so a lot of times I make myself work hard.\nWho inspires you to work hard in school, and why?\nI also like to keep up with or go further than my friends, so they help me do my best that way.\nMorgan ChenAge: 13Occupation: Student at Westview Middle SchoolHow many years have you been in the St. Vrain Valley?\nMy dad encourages me to learn more about the subjects than what I learn in school, too, and he helps me with that, particularly in math."}
