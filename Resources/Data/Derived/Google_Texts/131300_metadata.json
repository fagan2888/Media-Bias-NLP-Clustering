Whether you\u2019re a high school kid, college student, or a doctoral candidate, lectures and seminars simply won\u2019t stick unless you follow up with arduous self-study and independent research.\n\nUnfortunately, most American students appear to go about this the wrong way. By evaluating some of the nation\u2019s most commonly applied study habits, researchers from Kent State University have determined that very few live up to their reputation. Re-reading, highlighting, and summarizing are examples of \u201clow-utility\u201d habits that may actually hurt your performance. Why?\n\nMyth: Re-reading will increase my understanding of the material, since my brain will process it twice.\n\nDoes It Really Work?\n\nKind of. Re-reading has been shown to facilitate memorization, and will thus benefit students working with two-dimensional data \u2013 terminology, grammatical rules, formulas, structural detail, and so on. Comprehension, however, appears to remain the same.\n\n\u201cConcerning criterion tasks, the effects of rereading do appear to be durable across at least modest delays when rereading is spaced,\u201d study author John Dulonsky told PsychCentral. \u201cHowever, most effects have been shown with recall-based memory measures, whereas the benefit for comprehension is less clear.\u201d\n\nFor this reason, the study habit requires you to distinguish between your mnemonic and analytic capacity. Ask yourself if you\u2019ll have to do more than regurgitate the material. Sometimes, the answer is yes \u2013 but if it\u2019s not, you might be wasting your time.\n\nMyth: Highlighting will improve my performance, because it forces me to interact with the material.\n\nDoes It Really Work?\n\nWhen it comes to highlighting and underlining, your technique is crucial. Unless you\u2019re properly mapping the argument in the passage, you\u2019re most likely distorting it. For this reason, highlighting may not only waste time, but impair your performance as well.\n\n\u201cIn most situations that have been examined and with most participants, highlighting does little to boost performance,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cIt may help when students have the knowledge needed to highlight more effectively, or when texts are difficult, but it may actually hurt performance on higher-level tasks that require inference making.\u201d\n\nWhen read in sequence, your highlights should not form a disjointed aggregate of in-depth details, but a bullet-point summary of the relevant passage. Otherwise, your brain is entertaining two disparate versions of the text.\n\nTogether with annotation and commentary, proper highlighting represents an important part of the transition from high school academics to higher education. If you haven\u2019t reached first-year college writing, talk to your teacher or advisor \u2013 they\u2019re usually happy to help.\n\nMyth: Writing a brief summary is a sure way to improve both comprehension and retention, as it forces me to interpret and relate the material in my own words.\n\nDoes It Really Work?\n\nLike highlighting, summarization is an example of metadata \u2013 the holy grail of academic analysis, and the very foundation of scientific inquiry. Restating a textbook chapter\u2019s central argument is extremely difficult, and is usually not perfected until your final year of college. Unless you\u2019re a graduate student, you will almost certainly misrepresent some aspect of the passage, or skew its internal logic. (And make no mistake \u2013 professors are irremediable sticklers for internal logic, especially if they\u2019re teaching their own textbook.)\n\nInstead of producing your own, verbal summary, try to interact with the argument in a different way. Case application, schematic representation, and written questions are some examples of more \u201ccost-effective\u201d study habits.\n\nSource: Dunlosky, J.
