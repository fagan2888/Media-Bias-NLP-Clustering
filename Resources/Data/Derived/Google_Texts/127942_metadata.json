Its ongoing refusal to follow the law is absurd, particularly since much of [what] we are asking for is information that the IRS has already provided voluntarily to Freedom From Religion Foundation.\u201d\n\nThe IRS began producing documents in July, months after the ADF and Judicial Watch had sued the agency for failing to comply with a Freedom of Information Act request. But even then the agency withheld more than 10,000 of the 16,000 requested documents, and thousands of the released documents were completely redacted, according to the ADF.\n\nPHOTOS: Best states for concealed carry \u2014 ranked worst to first\n\n\u201cThe Obama IRS first ignored the ADF FOIA request and is now stonewalling in federal court,\u201d Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a press release. \u201cThe public has a right to know about any new IRS guidelines for investigating the practice of our basic First Amendment freedoms.\u201d\n\nThe IRS could not be reached for comment by press time.\n\nIn its 2014 lawsuit the atheist group demanded that the IRS enforce the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits tax-exempt organizations from making political endorsements for elected office. It authorizes the IRS to regulate sermons and other speech to ensure churches comply with the provisions of their designations.\n\nLegal scholars have speculated that the tax-exempt status of churches and other religious groups may be vulnerable in light of the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which struck down state laws banning same-sex marriage.\n\nDuring oral arguments, Associate Justice Samuel Anthony Alito Jr. asked Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. whether religious entities that subscribe to the traditional view of marriage would be at risk of losing their tax-exempt status should the laws banning same-sex marriage be struck down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly going to be an issue,\u201d Mr. Verrilli said. \u201cI don\u2019t deny that.\u201d\n\nGiven the IRS\u2018 alleged targeting of conservative and tea party groups, some members of Congress have expressed concern about the church investigation procedures.\n\nA 2014 letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen signed by nine members of Congress asked the agency to provide a copy of the rules for investigating churches.\n\n\u201cOur country has a long history of religious leaders speaking freely on matters of public discourse,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cWhether it is Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. leading the charge against segregation, or preachers opposed to the Vietnam War, Americans expect their religious leaders to be able to speak freely to their flock without government oversight. The recent agreement by the IRS seems to impinge on these fundamental rights protected by the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom of religion, speech, and assembly.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply troubled by these allegations and would like your assurance that these claims are false.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Government watchdog groups have filed a motion in federal court to compel the IRS to reveal how it determines when to initiate \"church investigations\" after accusing the tax-collecting agency of \"stonewalling\" efforts to bring to light its procedures.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Government watchdog groups have filed a motion in federal court to compel the IRS to reveal how it determines when to initiate \u201cchurch investigations\u201d after accusing the tax-collecting agency of \u201cstonewalling\u201d efforts to bring to light its procedures.", "title": "IRS sued for refusing to release secret \u2018church investigations\u2019 procedures", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/10/irs-sued-for-refusing-to-release-secret-church-inv/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/10/irs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/10/irs.jpg", "description": "Government watchdog groups have filed a motion in federal court to compel the IRS to reveal how it determines when to initiate \"church investigations\" after accusing the tax-collecting agency of \"ston", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS sued for refusing to release secret \u2018church investigations"}, "Author": "Bradford Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Internal Revenue Service"}, "article_summary": "PHOTOS: Christians in HollywoodBut nobody knows what those \u201cprocedures\u201d are for conducting \u201cchurch investigations,\u201d the watchdog groups said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t deny that.\u201dGiven the IRS\u2018 alleged targeting of conservative and tea party groups, some members of Congress have expressed concern about the church investigation procedures.\n\u201cThe IRS is not above the law, and Americans deserve to know the truth about the agency\u2019s secret deals with activists,\u201d ADF Legal Counsel Christina Holcomb said in a press release.\n\u201cThe IRS has a legal obligation to explain why it is hiding things or else produce documents.\nIt authorizes the IRS to regulate sermons and other speech to ensure churches comply with the provisions of their designations."}
