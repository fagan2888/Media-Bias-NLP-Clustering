I went to go out to dinner Friday evening in Lynnwood to Azteca near Alderwood Mall and as I drove near the parking lot I noticed it was empty, thinking that was quite unusual for a Friday evening. Then as I got closer, I noticed it was dark inside and all the signs were gone. No “Closed for Remodeling” or “Moved to ...” signs in the window — just done. Another long-established restaurant in Snohomish County has closed its doors. I can't help but think this is yet another result of failing Obamanomics and Obamacare. Be very careful who you vote for in November because your next “meal out” could be the soup kitchen. Richard Quint
