The president said that the United States would join \u201cwith our friends and allies to degrade, and ultimately destroy, the terrorist group.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why America\u2019s War with ISIS Will Take Years\n\nRather than deploying U.S. combat troops to seek out and destroy the enemy, he said, the campaign would be waged with a \u201csteady, relentless effort\u201d conducted through airstrikes in Iraq and Syria\n\nWhile the administration can definitely cite a few important breakthroughs \u2013 including the Iraqi allied ground forces\u2019 victory against ISIS recently \u2013 the terrorist group has become too entrenched and widespread to defeat in the foreseeable future.\n\nU.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Commander Gen. Lloyd Austin told the House Armed Services Committee in March: \u201cThe enemy is now in a \u2018defensive crouch\u2019\u201d and is unable to conduct major operations. But as Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations writes, \u201cThere\u2019s no end in sight for an air campaign that has killed some 8,500 militants and cost more than $2 billion.\u201d One of the biggest problems, he says, is that there aren\u2019t enough competent Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces to do the job.\n\n\u201cThe Pentagon has released a series of maps that purportedly detail the loss of territory under control by ISIS,\u201d Zenko wrote. \u201cHowever, the number and competence of Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces required to ultimately defeat [ISIS] militants on the ground, and then control, secure, and administer newly freed territory, are lacking.\u201d\n\nRelated: How ISIS Could Drag the U.S. into a Ground Fight\n\nZenko\u2019s second point was that even with a \u201cunited front\u201d of nearly five dozen allied countries, the U.S. is doing most of the heavy lifting in waging the air war against ISIS. His point gained added resonance after British Prime Minister David Cameron and his Conservative Party scored a surprising and convincing victory last week to gain a second term.\n\nCameron has sought to steer his country on a centrist path that included tough austerity measures and a dramatic scaling back of the United Kingdom\u2019s military presence overseas. Those policies were only reinforced by Cameron\u2019s strong showing at the polls.\n\nAfter losing a crucial 2013 parliamentary vote authorizing military force in Syria, Cameron has pulled Britain back from global affairs,\u201d as The Washington Post recently noted, allowing other countries to address Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the alarming growth in strength of ISIS. Last January, President Obama reportedly told Cameron that Britain must adhere to its military spending commitment to NATO or set a damaging example to its European allies. Obama and other U.S. military officials have said that Britain\u2019s failure to hit a military spending target of two percent of its GDP would be a serious blow to the military alliance.\n\nSince the Great Recession, the British Army lost fully 20 percent of its troops--from 102,000 to 82,000 since 2010. According to press reports, there are plans to add reservists.\n\nRelated: Cameron touts UK vote win as mandate for \"tough\" EU renegotiation\n\nBritish aircraft and unmanned drones have been used to attack ISIS emplacements in Iraq with more than 200 bombs and missiles, according to a new report by The Guardian. ISIS targets included 20 buildings, at least two containers and 65 trucks. As the Guardian noted, British air operations are a small fraction of those carried out by U.S. aircraft and drones, which have struck more than 6,000 targets as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, according to recent Pentagon figures.\n\nAs Zenko wrote, U.S. officials have done everything they can to stress the contribution being made by coalition members in waging air ware against ISIS. Last September, the U.S. even refused to expand the scope of its targets until those partners publicly committed their support. \u201cIt is no surprise, given its vastly larger and more proficient aerial capabilities, that the United States has been the primary source of all airstrikes against ISIS, even while the number of participating militaries has increased from 9 to 12 since September.\u201d\n\nThe following table shows the breakdown of coalition support for the 3,731 air strikes against ISIS.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Two things can be said with certainty about the U.S.-led coalition\u2019s nine-month campai", "title": "Britain Hangs Back As the U.S. Pays $2.2 Billion to Fight ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/12/Britain-Hangs-Back-US-Pays-22-Billion-Fight-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-airstrikes_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/12/Britain-Hangs-Back-US-Pays-22-Billion-Fight-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-airstrikes_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Two things can be said with certainty about the U.S.-led coalition\u2019s nine-month campai", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Pentagon has released a series of maps that purportedly detail the loss of territory under control by ISIS,\u201d Zenko wrote.\nAs Zenko wrote, U.S. officials have done everything they can to stress the contribution being made by coalition members in waging air ware against ISIS.\nLast September, the U.S. even refused to expand the scope of its targets until those partners publicly committed their support.\nLast January, President Obama reportedly told Cameron that Britain must adhere to its military spending commitment to NATO or set a damaging example to its European allies.\nSince the Great Recession, the British Army lost fully 20 percent of its troops--from 102,000 to 82,000 since 2010."}
