(CNSNews.com/Penny Starr)\n\n(CNSNews.com) \u2013 Vice President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he and President Barack Obama made \u201ctough and incredibly unpopular decisions\u201d when they took office, including the Affordable Care Act, supporting the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen the president and I took office, we knew we had to make some tough and incredibly unpopular decisions,\u201d Biden said at a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace event in Washington, D.C. \u201cI\u2019m sure some of them were unpopular with you as well as Democrats and Republicans.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden cited the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, or the Stimulus Act, which cost taxpayers more than $800 billion dollars, and TARP, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2008, and Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act, legislation to regulate financial institutions.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Recovery Act, which was over $800 billion in spending in an 18-month period, TARP \u2013 voting to support TARP in the Congress was like \u2026 putting rattlesnakes in people\u2019s kitchens,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI mean \u2013 because the very people they blamed for the problem were being bailed out.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden also cited the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act, the federal bailout of the U.S. auto industry and the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, as successful laws despite their unpopularity.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut as a result of those things, in my humble opinion, and because primarily the grit of the American people, we\u2019ve gone from economic crisis to recovery, and I think we\u2019re on the cusp of a genuine resurgence in the U.S. economy and U.S. growth,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\n\nLater in his remarks at the event, which focused on job creation and infrastructure investment, Biden specifically praised the Recovery Act, which he administered.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was the most competently run program in the history of the United States for the amount of money involved,\u201d Biden said, \u201cand it mattered.\u201d\n\n\n\nBiden said the Recovery Act improved more than 6,000 miles of rail, more than 350,000 miles of road and 20,000 bridges.\n\n\n\nHowever, a 2014 Wall Street Journal editorial, entitled \u201cObama\u2019s Stimulus Five Years Later,\u201d criticized the stimulus plan and Biden.\n\n\n\n\u201cShortly after the passage of the Recovery Act in 2009, Vice President Joseph Biden urged local politicians not to spend the money on \u2018stupid things.\u2019 They ignored his advice, and so did Mr. Biden,\u201d the editorial said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe federal government poured billions into the government and education sectors, where unemployment was low, but spent only about 10% on promised infrastructure, though the unemployment rate in construction was running in double digits,\u201d it stated.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd some of the individual projects funded by the law were truly appalling. $783,000 was spent on a study of why young people consume malt liquor and marijuana. $92,000 went to the Army Corps of Engineers for costumes for mascots like Bobber the Water Safety Dog. $219,000 funded a study of college \u2018hookups,\u2019\u201d the editorial added.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe failure of the stimulus was a failure of the neo-Keynesian belief that economies can be jolted into action by a wave of government spending,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cIn fact, people are smart enough to realize that every dollar poured into the economy via government spending must eventually be taken out of the productive economy in the form of taxes. The way to jolt an economy to life and to sustain long-term growth is to create more incentives for people to work, save and invest.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "Vice President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he and President Barack Obama made \u201ctough and incredibly unpopular decisions\u201d when they took office, including the Affordable Care Act, supporting the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.", "title": "Biden: Obama and I Made \u2018Tough and Incredibly Unpopular Decisions,\u2019 Including Obamacare, Recovery Act", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/penny-starr/biden-he-and-obama-made-tough-and-incredibly-unpopular-decisions-including", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/joe_biden_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-09T11:48:24-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-09T11:47:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T11:48:24-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vice President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he and President Barack Obama made \u201ctough and incredibly unpopular decisions\u201d when they took office, including the Affordable Care Act, supporting the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.", "title": "Biden: Obama and I Made \u2018Tough and Incredibly Unpopular Decisions,\u2019 Including Obamacare, Recovery Act", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/penny-starr/biden-he-and-obama-made-tough-and-incredibly-unpopular-decisions-including", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/joe_biden_0.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Vice President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he and President Barack Obama made \u201ctough and incredibly unpopular decisions\u201d when they took office, including the Affordable Care Act, supporting the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Later in his remarks at the event, which focused on job creation and infrastructure investment, Biden specifically praised the Recovery Act, which he administered.\n\u201cThe Recovery Act, which was over $800 billion in spending in an 18-month period, TARP \u2013 voting to support TARP in the Congress was like \u2026 putting rattlesnakes in people\u2019s kitchens,\u201d Biden said.\nHowever, a 2014 Wall Street Journal editorial, entitled \u201cObama\u2019s Stimulus Five Years Later,\u201d criticized the stimulus plan and Biden.\nBiden also cited the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act, the federal bailout of the U.S. auto industry and the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, as successful laws despite their unpopularity.\n\u201cShortly after the passage of the Recovery Act in 2009, Vice President Joseph Biden urged local politicians not to spend the money on \u2018stupid things.\u2019 They ignored his advice, and so did Mr. Biden,\u201d the editorial said."}
