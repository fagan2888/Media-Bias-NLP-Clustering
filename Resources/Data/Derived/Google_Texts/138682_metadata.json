Frank Garner has refused to sign a blanket pledge against expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and Americans for Prosperity-Montana is campaigning against him and two other lawmakers \u2014 state Reps. Jeff Welborn and Tom Berry \u2014 who have done the same.\n\nThe Koch-sponsored group is blanketing their House districts with mailers that show each lawmaker\u2019s face superimposed over a photograph of President Barack Obama.\n\nAbout 100 people turned out for a town hall meeting Thursday in Kalispell that was promoted by AFP, and Garner traveled eight hours from Helena to speak with his constituents after a reporter told him about the event, reported the Flathead Beacon.\n\n\u201cI support their right to have an opinion. I just didn\u2019t like how they did it,\u201d Garner said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even extend the courtesy of telling me about the meeting. What does that say about their intentions?\u201d\n\nDemocratic Gov. Steve Bullock wants to accept federal money to expand coverage to 70,000 low-income Montana residents, but the Republican statehouse majority opposes the measure.\n\nHowever, some GOP lawmakers, including Garner, have refused to dismiss the proposal outright and remain open to some type of expansion of health care coverage.\n\nGarner, the former police chief in Kalispell, said he understands his constituents better than an out-of-state group.\n\nVoters frequently interrupted the AFP presentation with laughter, booing, and other jeers from Garner\u2019s supporters.\n\n\u201cYou have pissed me off,\u201d one voter said. \u201cCharacter assassination does not go down well in Montana. If he has to take a pledge then I want it to be the Pledge of Allegiance, because they don\u2019t represent you, they represent me.\u201d\n\nAnother voter challenged AFP\u2019s activists to explain what they were up to and harshly rebuked their bosses.\n\n\u201cWhy did you call this a town hall meeting?\u201d said voter Nathan Kosted. \u201cI didn\u2019t get an invite. I wish I\u2019d been invited, because I want to know how we get the Koch Brothers out of politics. I want to know how we get you out of politics.\u201d\n\nAFP-Montana\u2019s state director, Zach Lahn, insisted the meeting was intended to send a message to lawmakers about what he described as a bad policy \u2013 but Garner dismissed the claim as absurd.\n\n\u201cIf the purpose is to make sure legislators know, then why am I the only one here? And why didn\u2019t I get an invite?\u201d Garner said as voters cheered.\n\n\u201cI promised the people here when I ran that I would listen to you and not out-of-town special interests,\u201d Garner said to wild applause. \u201cIf every time they want me to sign a pledge card and I don\u2019t do it they are going to rent a room and have a meeting, then this is going to get real expensive \u2014 because I\u2019m not signing the pledge card.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Americans-for-Prosperity-Montana-Facebook-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Koch stooges booed off stage in disastrous attempt to meddle in Montana\u2019s Medicaid debate"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhy did you call this a town hall meeting?\u201d said voter Nathan Kosted.\nI wish I\u2019d been invited, because I want to know how we get the Koch Brothers out of politics.\nThe Koch-sponsored group is blanketing their House districts with mailers that show each lawmaker\u2019s face superimposed over a photograph of President Barack Obama.\nHowever, some GOP lawmakers, including Garner, have refused to dismiss the proposal outright and remain open to some type of expansion of health care coverage.\n\u201cI promised the people here when I ran that I would listen to you and not out-of-town special interests,\u201d Garner said to wild applause."}
