In light of that, the host wrapped up the interview by asking if she regretted any of her part in the administration\u2019s handling of the attack. Rice initially said the siege on the U.S compound in Libya was a protest prompted by an anti-Islam video, but it soon came to light that it was an orchestrated terror attack.\n\n\u201cAs you look back at your involvement in all of that, do you have any regrets?\u201d Gregory asked on Sunday.\n\n\u201cDavid, no,\u201d Rice responded. \u201cBecause what I said to you that morning and what I did every day since, was to share the best information we that had at the time.\u201d\n\nThe former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations pointed out that she supplied what limited details were available when she appeared on TV the Sunday after the attack. Rice added that she received her information from the intelligence community.\n\n\u201cThat information turned out in some respects not to be 100 percent correct,\u201d she added. \u201cBut the notion that somehow I, or anybody else in the administration, misled the American people is patently false. And I think that that\u2019s been amply demonstrated.\u201d\n\nGregory asked Rice if the politics surrounding Benghazi had cost her the role of Secretary of State. Rice withdrew her name from consideration in December, three months after the attack in Libya, and John Kerry was confirmed instead. In response to Gregory, Rice said she didn\u2019t know if Benghazi had cost her the influential role.\n\nRice again promised that the U.S. would eventually find the people who attacked the U.S. compound in Libya, something that President Barack Obama pledged while on the campaign trail in 2012.\n\n\u201cThe investigation is ongoing and it has indeed made progress,\u201d she said. \u201cThe point is, we will get the perpetrators. We will stay on it until this gets done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "United States National Security Advisor Susan Rice doesn't regret any of the involvement she had in the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack, she told David Gregory on Sunday morning.", "title": "Susan Rice has 'no regrets' about her Benghazi involvement - Red...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 481, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/02/Susan-Rice-481x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/02/23/susan-rice-has-no-regrets-about-her-benghazi-involvement/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "susan-rice-meet-the-press", "published_time": "2014-02-23T15:01:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-23T15:25:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd60a5\"", "article_summary": "United States National Security Advisor Susan Rice doesn\u2019t regret any of the involvement she had in the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the Benghazi attack, she told David Gregory on Sunday morning.\nIn response to Gregory, Rice said she didn\u2019t know if Benghazi had cost her the influential role.\n\u201cAs you look back at your involvement in all of that, do you have any regrets?\u201d Gregory asked on Sunday.\nAnd I think that that\u2019s been amply demonstrated.\u201dGregory asked Rice if the politics surrounding Benghazi had cost her the role of Secretary of State.\nRice withdrew her name from consideration in December, three months after the attack in Libya, and John Kerry was confirmed instead."}
