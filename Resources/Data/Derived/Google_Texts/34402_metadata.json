But the five delegates awarded to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are now free agents because he ended his campaign, and Louisiana Republicans expect them to swing behind Mr. Cruz. Meanwhile, the state\u2019s five unbound delegates\u2014who are free to back the candidates of their choice\u2014also are more likely to back Mr. Cruz than Mr. Trump, according to GOP officials in the state.\n\nMore than that, however, Cruz\u2019s supporters have also nabbed five of Louisiana\u2019s six positions on the GOP convention\u2019s rule-writing committees.\n\nThe second step in the process is for those delegates to decide who will represent Louisiana on the three important convention committees\u2014 rules, credentials and the party platform. To make those choices, most of Louisiana\u2019s delegates gathered at a March 12 state convention to elect two members to each panel. No Trump backers won any of those slots. Five of the six committee members chosen back Mr. Cruz, and the sixth is uncommitted to a presidential candidate. Louisiana is the first state to name delegates to serve on the three committees. Those panels would become critical in a contested convention, which would take place if no candidate wins a majority of delegates on the first ballot. The rules panel will determine which candidates are eligible to be nominated for president, the platform panel will write the party\u2019s agenda, and the credentials panel will mediate disputes about which delegates can be seated.\n\nAt this point in the race Cruz would have to win 85 percent of the remaining delegates to secure the nomination before Cleveland\u2014a highly unlikely scenario. Thus, a contested convention becomes the only way forward for his campaign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Strategy. .05/27/2016 7:45:03AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Strategy.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Cruz Could End Up Winning More Delegates in Louisiana, Despite Losing to Trump", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/03/26/despite-losing-cruz-could-win-10-more-delegates-than-trump-in-louisiana-n2139148", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/82/2016-03-23T023141Z_2_LYNXNPEC2L1PT_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-CRUZ-AIPAC.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Strategy.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Cruz Could End Up Winning More Delegates in Louisiana, Despite Losing to Trump", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/03/26/despite-losing-cruz-could-win-10-more-delegates-than-trump-in-louisiana-n2139148", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/82/2016-03-23T023141Z_2_LYNXNPEC2L1PT_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-CRUZ-AIPAC.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Cruz Could End Up Winning More Delegates in Louisiana, Despite Losing to Trump, Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump may have won Louisiana by 3.6 percentage points, but Ted Cruz may walk away as the real winner.\nFive of the six committee members chosen back Mr. Cruz, and the sixth is uncommitted to a presidential candidate.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports:Trump and Cruz each won 18 delegates apiece based on the Louisiana results in the primary on March 5.\nBut the five delegates awarded to Florida Sen.
