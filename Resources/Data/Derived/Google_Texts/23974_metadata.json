As a result, \u201ca lot of people have ended up unnecessarily disabled, or died at an early age, because they were not getting that care,\u201d she says.\n\nNew subspecialty\n\nCedars is one of a handful of doctors in the Dallas-Fort Worth area who passed the first board certification exam, offered in October, for this relatively new subspecialty: adult congenital heart disease.\n\nThe field is emerging as a result of advances in modern medicine. The first successful surgeries to mend the hearts of \u201cblue babies\u201d were developed in the late 1950s, after the invention of the heart-lung bypass machine. In the decades that followed, new treatments for congenital heart defects were refined and became widely available. More and more children who would have otherwise died are living into adulthood.\n\nToday, the Adult Congenital Heart Association estimates that about 1 million to 1.5 million adults live with congenital heart disease. Estimates vary widely because there\u2019s no comprehensive tracking system.\n\nBut contrary to what their doctors may have told them, most of those patients aren\u2019t done with treatment, and many require ongoing, complex medical care that regular cardiologists aren\u2019t equipped to handle.\n\nErin Winsett, 35, of Plano discovered that when she began developing problems as an adult. Winsett had surgery when she was 22 months old for tetralogy of Fallot, a cluster of four different abnormalities of the heart that occurs in about 5 out of every 10,000 newborns. After the surgery, doctors told her parents that Erin could live a normal life.\n\n\u201cMy doctor told me the only thing I could not be was an Olympic athlete,\u201d she said. Even that caution seemed less relevant after Shaun White \u2014 who had surgeries as a baby for the same defect \u2014 won gold medals in snowboarding at the Olympics.\n\nWhen Winsett looked for a doctor to manage her care as an adult, she discovered that regular cardiologists didn\u2019t feel comfortable treating her. Then she found Dr. Beth Brickner, a member of the Adult Congenital Heart Disease team at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nBrickner warned Winsett that she\u2019s likely to need surgery down the road to replace her pulmonary valves, a fairly common follow-up procedure for patients like her. That\u2019s a source of anxiety, but Winsett feels she\u2019s in good hands.\n\n\u201cDr. Brickner has the knowledge that makes me feel comfortable in her care,\u201d she said.\n\nSpecial needs\n\nMany patients with congenital heart defects will need additional operations or medications as adults, Cedars says. Even after successful corrective surgery, the anatomy of their hearts is abnormal. Women need expert advice on whether it\u2019s safe to become pregnant, and if they do get pregnant, specialized management during the pregnancy.\n\nOn top of that, people born with heart defects are now living long enough to develop typical problems associated with aging \u2014 high blood pressure, obesity and acquired heart disease. Managing those problems can be problematic and complex.\n\nUntil recently, many patients stayed with their pediatric cardiologists well into adulthood, says Dr. Scott Pilgrim, medical director of the Adult Congenital Heart Disease program at Cook Children\u2019s Medical Center in Fort Worth. Pilgrim came to Cook\u2019s in 2014 when the clinic opened, in part, to serve the hundreds of patients who had remained in the pediatric hospital\u2019s system because they couldn\u2019t find satisfactory care elsewhere.\n\n\u201cCardiologists who treat adults are focused on acquired heart disease,\u201d Pilgrim said. Pediatric cardiologists, on the other hand, aren\u2019t equipped to manage conditions that usually don\u2019t crop up until adulthood, such as diabetes.\n\nPlus, every patient\u2019s case is different, and the issues can get complicated. But all three physicians interviewed for this story say that\u2019s what they love about the subspecialty.\n\n\u201cIf you take the same basic diagnosis, the treatment may be different for each patient with congenital heart disease that you see,\u201d Brickner said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes the field so challenging and exciting.\u201d\n\nPatients with congenital heart disease should see a specialist at least once for evaluation, and for regular follow-up exams as needed. According to the Adult Congenital Heart Association, adults with congenital heart disease have rates of emergency room visits, hospitalizations and intensive care unit stays that are three to four times higher than average.\n\nBrickner adds that it\u2019s important to see a specialist sooner, rather than later.\n\nChristine Teel, 39, of Garland is glad she didn\u2019t wait too long. She had surgery to correct tetralogy of Fallot as a baby. In her 20s, Teel began to have episodes where her heart would race during exercise. She saw two adult cardiologists, who tried a procedure but ultimately told her, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else we can do.\u201d\n\nBy way of an Internet search, Teel found UT Southwestern\u2019s program and ultimately underwent surgery to help manage the problem.\n\n\u201cHad I waited much longer, it would\u2019ve been too late,\u201d Teel said.\n\nAbout congenital heart defects\n\nA congenital heart defect is a problem with the heart\u2019s structure that is present at birth. Common problems include holes in the heart or defects in the heart valve, vessels or heart chambers. Heart defects often involve a combination of problems.\n\nCongenital heart defects are the most common birth defects, affecting about 1 percent of all babies, and range from relatively minor issues to serious, life-threatening defects. Symptoms include a bluish tint of the skin, shortness of breath, poor weight gain and problems with exercise. Most CHDs are diagnosed through tests such as an echocardiogram, MRI or cardiac catheterization.\n\nThe cause of congenital heart defects is not always known, but they do tend to run in families. Causes may include genetics, certain medications, drug or alcohol abuse during pregnancy, or a viral infection (such as rubella) during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nSome congenital heart defects may not be diagnosed until adulthood.\n\nThe Adult Congenital Heart Association, a patient advocacy group, is working to create an accreditation program for clinics specializing in adults with congenital heart disease. The group also helped pass legislation, as part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, for increased funding of research and surveillance.\n\nSOURCES: Adult Congenital Heart Association Fact Sheet (ACHAHeart.org), WebMD.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Doctors are paying fresh attention to adults whose long-ago surgeries might need new care.", "og": {"description": "Doctors are paying fresh attention to adults whose long-ago surgeries might need new care.", "title": "Old heart defects: Sometimes forgotten, never gone", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/health-and-fitness/health/20160201-old-heart-defects-sometimes-forgotten-never-gone.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/health-and-fitness/health/20160201-nh_21cedars_cover.ece/BINARY/original/NH_21Cedars_COVER", "height": 930}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-02-04T18:27:14Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-02-01T21:08:16Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Old heart defects: Sometimes forgotten, never gone\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/health-and-fitness/health/20160201-old-heart-defects-sometimes-forgotten-never-gone.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/health-and-fitness/health/20160201-nh_21cedars_cover.ece/BINARY/original/NH_21Cedars_COVER\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2632687\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-02-01T21:08:16Z\", \"section\": \"Health\", \"author\": \"MARY JACOBS\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/health-and-fitness/health/20160201-nh_21cedars_cover.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NH_21Cedars_COVER", "publishtime": "2016-02-01T21:08:16Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "About congenital heart defectsA congenital heart defect is a problem with the heart\u2019s structure that is present at birth.\nCongenital heart defects are the most common birth defects, affecting about 1 percent of all babies, and range from relatively minor issues to serious, life-threatening defects.\nToday, the Adult Congenital Heart Association estimates that about 1 million to 1.5 million adults live with congenital heart disease.\nIn the decades that followed, new treatments for congenital heart defects were refined and became widely available.\nThe cause of congenital heart defects is not always known, but they do tend to run in families."}
