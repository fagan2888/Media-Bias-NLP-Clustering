Below is an outline of the GOP’s debt-ceiling bill obtained by National Review Online. The document originated from staff to a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee and is dated yesterday. A GOP-leadership aide says there are some differences between this and their latest summary, so take that for what it’s worth. As always with the House Republicans, it is subject to discussion from members, many of whom are quite vocal in providing their input on such plans.

House leadership is planning to pass the bill as early as Saturday. The bill itself is expected to be released imminently. The outline is not a huge surprise — most of the provisions have been floated or leaked, but it’s interesting to see the breadth of the demands laid out on paper.

Voting to increase the debt ceiling is always a brutal vote for lawmakers, because it’s very unpopular with their constituents back home. House conservatives also worry about undermining the Senate process and particularly Senator Ted Cruz’s fight in that chamber. For example, there have been efforts to keep the House’s plans under the radar until after the final cloture vote in order not to hinder Cruz’s push for the GOP to filibuster.
