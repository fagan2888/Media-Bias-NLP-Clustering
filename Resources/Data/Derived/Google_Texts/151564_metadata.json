Later, a conservative congressman delivering the Tea Party\u2019s response to the speech accused lobbyists of \u201clining their pockets\u201d at the expense of taxpayers.\n\n\n\nThe bipartisan beating is nothing for an influence industry used to getting blamed for Washington\u2019s dysfunction. Still, the president\u2019s address was seen by some lobbyists as reinforcing an unfair and counterproductive stereotype.\n\n\n\n\"Overall, it was a confident upbeat speech that, as usual, took a populist swipe at lobbyists,\u201d said Nick Allard, the president and dean of Brooklyn Law School and a senior partner at the second largest lobby firm in Washington, Squire Patton Boggs. \"Making lobbyists the boogeyman in State of the Union addresses is becoming as predictable as shout-outs to featured guests in the gallery.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPrior to the prime-time event, the new president of the lobbyist trade group, now known as the Association of Government Relations Professionals (AGRP), had issued a statement asking Obama to lay off of K Street.A little more than halfway into the address, however, Obama blasted the lobbying community while talking about a need for bipartisan agreement on big-ticket items, including tax reform.\u201cLobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight,\u201d he said, as the television camera focused on House Ways and Means Committee Chairman(R-Wis.).\u201cThey\u2019ve riddled it with giveaways the superrich don\u2019t need, denying a break to middle-class families who do,\u201d he continued.K Street quickly took notice of the mention.James Hickey, a vice president of government affairs at Day & Zimmermann and the incoming president of AGRP, told The Hill that the rhetoric was a \u201ccheap shot\u201d by the president.\"We are not his 'deflated footballs,\u2019\u201d he said in an email, referencing a recent NFL scandal that alleges one team deflated game balls to secure a win.\u201cIf he wants to know how to avoid more legislative losses over the next two years he might want to just focus on calling better plays,\u201d Hickey continued. \u201cHe might also want to consider working with the lobbying and government relations community to help him get into that end zone.\u201dObama wasn\u2019t the only elected official to channel frustration at lobbyists on Tuesday evening.Florida Republican Rep. Curt Clawson, elected in a special election last summer, delivered the Tea Party response to the State of the Union. In what was one of five Republican rebuttals, he took an even bigger swipe at corporations, advocates, unions and trade groups.\u201cI ran for Congress because I was deeply concerned about the direction of our great nation,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw an America deeply divided, bogged down in partisan bickering with lobbyists and special-interest groups lining their pockets at the expense of hard-working Americans.\u201dAlthough Republicans who affiliate with the Tea Party differ from Obama and many Democrats in several ways, there is a common distrust about the influence of big corporations in politics.\u201cWe've seen both the far-left and the far-right critical of corporations\u2019 activities in Washington,\u201d said Stewart Verdery, a founder and partner at Monument Policy Group. \u201cI think most companies would be happy to disarm if what was going on in Washington wasn't so important to them.\u201dOn tax issues specifically, Monument Policy represents some of the biggest players in the game \u2014 including the U.S. Olympic Committee, which is involved in legislation questioning whether Olympic medals and winnings should be taxed, and Shell Oil. Verdery points out that smaller players have powerful trade groups working on their behalf, such as the National Federation of Independent Businesses.What defines a \u201c 'special interest' is all in the eye of the beholder,\u201d he added.Meanwhile, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who gave the official GOP response, hit many of the same populist notes as her Republican colleagues. She did not, however, mention the \u201cL\u201d word.\u201cCompromise is a good thing in the legislative process. But in politics, it's a bad thing,\u201d said David Urban, the president of American Continental Group. \u201cTo blame things on lobbyists is much easier to do, and it's [equivalent to] saying that, \u2018We can't come to some middle ground because of the fact that we're unwilling to move.\u2019 \u201dObama\u2019s harsh worst for lobbyists come as his administration has softened his position on them.On the campaign trail in 2007, he vowed not to take money from registered lobbyists \u2014 leaving a loophole for unregistered consultants that do similar work \u2014and pledged to keep them out of his administration.Once in the White House, however, he has tapped dozens of downtowners and former lobbyists for various executive roles. Perhaps most prominently, Obama brought on former telecommunications lobbyist Tom Wheeler, who became the head of the Federal Communications Commission.And K Street has played a prominent role in many of the administration\u2019s largest initiatives.While crafting the Affordable Care Act, for instance, the Obama administration sought input from all sectors that would be impacted \u2014 sweeping in some of the largest and most powerful trade groups in the country, Urban said.\u201cThis town would come to a screeching halt without the input and the contributions that lobbyists \u2014 and not just those registered ones \u2014 make in helping to get things done,\u201d he said, lumping constituents and smaller groups that visit members of Congress into the influence mix. \u201cYou get people who come down and express their opinions about the things that Congress is trying to do \u2014 and that's what the Constitution wants them to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "High-profile jabs at lobbyists this week further an unfair stereotype, they say.", "description": "High-profile jabs at lobbyists this week further an unfair stereotype, they say.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
