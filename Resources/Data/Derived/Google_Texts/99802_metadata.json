The week also marked the withdrawal from an election campaign of a U.S. senator, John Walsh, D-Mont., following New York Times revelations that he had plagiarized much of his final paper in a master\u2019s degree program at the United States Army War College in 2007.\n\nPlagiarism charges are, obviously, serious \u2014 serious enough to scuttle a political career or get a novel yanked from the marketplace (as happened to both \u201cHow Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life\u201d by Kaavya Viswanathan in 2006 and \u201cAssassin of Secrets\u201d by Q.R. Markham in 2011). Making such an accusation is a dramatic, attention-grabbing move, and it often seems to fill the sails of the accusers with the hot wind of righteous indignation. Comments threads fill up with thrillingly adamant remarks like \u201cIt\u2019s wrong. Period. He should be fired immediately and his fields sown with salt\u201d (or the professional equivalent thereof).\n\nWhat none of this acknowledges is just how commonplace plagiarism charges are, how thin most of the evidence is and how poorly the average person understands the nature of the transgression. Perhaps you have to be a literary journalist or editor to realize that just beneath the surface of conventionally reported news simmers a vast sea of semi-formed resentments, grievances and paranoia about intellectual theft, each believed in wholeheartedly by a handful of crusaders (or maybe just one) yet failing to convince more objective reporters. We\u2019re a plagiarism-obsessed society, partly because we know how much damage we can do to someone\u2019s career and life by accusing them of it, but largely because so many of us don\u2019t really grasp what plagiarism is.\n\nSen. Walsh\u2019s case meets the simplest and most clear-cut definition of the offense. It happened in an academic context and all such institutions maintain explicit and official policies, detailing what constitutes plagiarism and what penalties will be levied against those who engage in it. Students (even students for advanced degrees) go to school to learn from people who know more than they do, to absorb and contemplate the work of those who have gone before them. For that reason, universities must take pains to draw the line between a well-informed and -sourced work and an unacceptably derivative one, and draw it as finely and as brightly as possible. Walsh copied many passages from many sources, word-for-word, without quotation marks or attribution, a clear violation of any university\u2019s academic standards.\n\nNewspapers and other journalistic institutions, particularly high-profile operations with a great deal invested in their reputation for authoritativeness, have their own, and different, regulations regarding the use of other writers\u2019 work. When, two years ago, Fareed Zakaria, an author and pundit on politics and international affairs for Newsweek, CNN and Time, published a column on gun control in Time, he paraphrased a paragraph from a piece by New Yorker writer Jill Lepore that, in turn, summarized the work of a historian of the subject. The information in Lepore\u2019s paragraph was organized and presented in the same way, but with slightly different wording, and Lepore\u2019s article was not cited. Zakaria apologized, and was suspended by both Time and CNN. After a review of his previous commentary for them, both news organizations concluded that the incident was isolated (some outsiders have suggested that it was the work of a research assistant for the stretched-thin pundit), and reinstated him after six days.\n\nMuch greater disgrace awaited the pop-neuroscience writer Jonah Lehrer, who in 2012 was accused of the peculiar misdemeanor of plagiarizing himself. He had recycled material he had already published in a variety of newspapers as blog posts for the New Yorker, as well as in one of his books. Since Lehrer owned the work in question, this might not seem like much of a no-no \u2014 and had the reuse occurred in, say, the Huffington Post, most likely no one would have complained. They were his words, after all.\n\nBut the New Yorker had hired Lehrer as a staff writer. The magazine is considered a platinum-standard journalistic institution that pays its writers a living wage and therefore has the right to demand complete originality. Lehrer appeared to have broken faith with his employers rather than with the reading public at large \u2014 until, that is, Michael C. Moynihan of Tablet magazine discovered that Lehrer had also fabricated quotes, attributed to Bob Dylan, in his book \u201cImagine.\u201d Shortly thereafter, journalism professor Charles Seife was asked by Wired magazine to scrutinize Lehrer\u2019s work for that publication. He found 22 instances of \u201crecycling,\u201d outright plagiarism of other writers, copying of press releases (somewhat of a gray area, since these are written in the hope that they will be regurgitated by the press) and fabrication. Lehrer\u2019s career crashed and burned.\n\nSo even in the upper echelons of journalism, where writers are often required to sign contracts promising to abide by strict ethical standards, the significance of plagiarism is a matter of context. Zakaria erred on a minor scale and had a body of solid, respected work to serve as a counterbalance, so his reputation was quickly redeemed. Lehrer, whose self-plagiarism might go unremarked in other contexts, turned out to have committed the greater journalistic sin of making stuff up and to have inserted all sorts of fishy stuff into his work from the start. His reputation toppled. Ironically, the man in whose mouth Lehrer most liked to place his invented quotes, Bob Dylan, was also found to have plagiarized many passages in his 2004 memoir, \u201cChronicles, Vol. 1,\u201d from sources as diverse as Time magazine and the profanity-spouting screenwriter Joe Eszterhas. But no one is going to deny the overweening originality of Bob Dylan.\n\nSomething else surely figured in the Zakaria affair, even if none of the news organizations or Zakaria himself ever mentioned it, and that is the source of the original plagiarism accusation: a conservative website called Newsbusters. Zakaria had been the target of spurious charges of \u201cstealing\u201d from other right-wing journalists before, such as Jeffrey Goldberg\u2019s allegation that Zakaria \u201clifted\u201d a quote from Goldberg\u2019s interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; in truth, Zakaria quoted Netanyahu without specifically naming Goldberg as the interviewer. Goldberg\u2019s charge was, of course, a ludicrous reach, taking a pervasive form of journalistic usage (\u201cX said in an interview last week\u201d) and tarting it up as larceny. If Zakaria had been a political compatriot of Goldberg\u2019s it would, no doubt, have passed without notice or comment.\n\nA similar ulterior motive lies behind the accusations of plagiarism leveled against Rick Perlstein by author and consultant Craig Shirley this week. As Salon\u2019s Dave Dayen detailed on Wednesday, Shirley claims that Perlstein infringed on the copyright of his 2005 book, \u201cReagan\u2019s Revolution: the Untold Story of the Campaign That Started It All.\u201d In letters to Perlstein\u2019s publisher, Simon & Schuster, he demanded, according to the New York Times, \u201c$25 million in damages, a public apology, revised digital editions and the destruction of all physical copies of the book.\u201d The 19 alleged infractions in Perlstein\u2019s 880-page history include citing of historical facts and paraphrasing descriptions of events that Shirley witnessed (and Perlstein didn\u2019t) with attribution.
