Panetta is slated to testify before the select committee on Friday about his role before, during and after the siege on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya that killed four Americans, including the U.S. Ambassador. The deadly incident has created a veritable cottage industry of conspiracy theories about Clinton, who has been at the nexus of the investigation.\n\nThe panel, which on Wednesday surpassed the amount of time it took the 9/11 Commission to conduct its probe into the terror attacks, has long been a political lightning rod on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhen House Republicans voted to create the select committee in 2014, they argued a new examination was needed to explore unanswered questions about the administration\u2019s response to the assault. Democrats accused Republicans of launching a taxpayer funded smear campaign against Clinton designed to hamstring her then-expected White House bid.\n\nRelated: Benghazi Panel Calls in Heavy Hitters to Start 2016\n\nThat din increased in September after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) made comments that implied the inquiry was purely political and ratcheted up again after Clinton appeared before the panel in October in a marathon, 11-hour public hearing that revealed no \u201csmoking gun\u201d accusation against the nation\u2019s former No. 1 diplomat.\n\nSelect committee chair Trey Gowdy (R-SC), who long preached about keeping partisan politics out of the investigation, further damaged the panel\u2019s credibility last month when he endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) in the crowded GOP presidential primary. The nod led some to charge that he had been using his powers to bring down Clinton in order to boost Rubio all along.\n\nIn that context, Panetta\u2019s announcement, besides showing a complete disregard for the select committee\u2019s authority, only adds to the perception that the investigation has devolved into a platform for Democrats and Republicans to snipe at each.\n\nWhere things go with the $5.6 million-and-counting inquiry is anyone\u2019s guess. After former CIA chief David Petraeus went behind closed doors with the Benghazi panel on Wednesday, Gowdy said he wanted him to return for another day of questioning.\n\nRelated: Trump Gives Clinton a Boost as He Takes Aim at Gowdy on Benghazi\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of the select committee\u2019s final report. Democrats contend it\u2019s being timed for release this summer, presumably after Clinton becomes the Democratic nominee, in the hope of sinking her in November.\n\nOn Thursday, Gowdy, who in the past has hinted the final report might not be conclusive for some folks, declined to give a timeline. \u201cWell, boy, if you could help me speed up the administration to get me documents, I'd be grateful to you, Wolf,\u201d he said during an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer.\n\n\u201cI want to wrap up tomorrow, but I've got a dozen more witnesses and I've got three departments that haven't given me my documents. I want to get it done as soon as possible. Maybe they'll listen to you,\u201d the former federal prosecutor added. \u201cThey're not listening to me right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Leon Panetta\u2019s endorsement of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may have washed away the last vestiges that the House Select Committee on Benghazi\u2019s investigation into the deadly 2012 terror attacks will be remembered as little more than an expensive political exercise.", "title": "Here\u2019s Why the Benghazi Investigation Has Become a Political Sideshow", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/08/Here-s-Why-Benghazi-Investigation-Has-Become-Political-Sideshow", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10232015_Hillary_Benghazi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/08/Here-s-Why-Benghazi-Investigation-Has-Become-Political-Sideshow", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10232015_Hillary_Benghazi.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Leon Panetta\u2019s endorsement of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may have washed away the last vestiges that the House Select Committee on Benghazi\u2019s investigation into the deadly 2012 terror attacks will be remembered as little more than an expensive political exercise.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "When House Republicans voted to create the select committee in 2014, they argued a new examination was needed to explore unanswered questions about the administration\u2019s response to the assault.\nThe deadly incident has created a veritable cottage industry of conspiracy theories about Clinton, who has been at the nexus of the investigation.\nLeon Panetta\u2019s endorsement of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may have washed away the last vestiges that the House Select Committee on Benghazi\u2019s investigation into the deadly 2012 terror attacks is little more than an expensive political exercise.\nDemocrats accused Republicans of launching a taxpayer funded smear campaign against Clinton designed to hamstring her then-expected White House bid.\nPanetta is slated to testify before the select committee on Friday about his role before, during and after the siege on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya that killed four Americans, including the U.S."}
