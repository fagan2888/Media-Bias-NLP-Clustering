He is son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy who has for years refused to pay grazing fees, now totaling $1 million, for grazing his cattle on Bureau of Land Management land in Nevada.\n\nArmed defenders of Bundy confronted law officers in April, after a federal judge said Bundy\u2019s cattle could be taken if they continued to graze on BLM lands.\n\nAmmon Bundy was tasered after kicking a police dog.\n\nThe elder Bundy became a poster boy for Sean Hannity of Fox News and other conservative pundits, but was jettisoned after his racist \u201cI want to tell you one thing I know about the Negro\u201d remarks appeared in The New York Times.\n\nThe younger Bundy has been defiant in his rhetoric. \u201cWho is always been the aggressor, who is the one who is doing the wrong?\u201d he asked in one interview. \u201cAh \u2014 that is the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service \u2014 ya know these federal agencies \u2014 they\u2019ve been preying upon the people for years.\u201d\n\nGavin Seim, a convener of Saturday\u2019s rally, is a longtime defender of the Bundys. He declared, earlier this year, that \u201cThe Second American Revolution almost started\u201d at the Nevada ranch, when \u201chundreds of people were willing to due for your liberty.\u201d\n\nSeim ran for Congress in the 4th District earlier this year, taking 1.97 percent of the vote in August\u2019s primary.\n\nSeim has made expansive statements in buildup to Saturday\u2019s rally, declaring: \u201cWe the people, with the vested authority of absolute law, declare ALL restrictions and permits of ALL kinds to be VOID. If you want to buy or sell a tank, you have that right.\u201d\n\nAmmon Bundy has presented a similar, radical view of American federalism, telling an interviewer:\n\n\u201cWe have the right to protect our life, liberty and property first, and we give a little bit of that right to the county, and the county gives a little bit of that right to the state, and the state gives a little teeny part of that right to the federal government. And that\u2019s all the rights they have.\u201d\n\nThe rally will also hear from Mike Vanderboegh, an Alabama-based leader of the \u201cPatriot\u201d movement who came to prominence after the 1993 Waco standoff with a guide titled \u201cStrategy and Tactics for a Militia Civil War,\u201d with lessons on such subjects as the value of snipers.\n\nVanderboegh urged direct action at the time Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\n\n\u201cIf you wish to send a message that (House Speaker Nancy) Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear, break their windows,\u201d he told a rally. \u201cBreak them now. Break them and run and break again.\u201d\n\nHe has been equally defiant on gun safety laws, saying:\n\n\u201cThe recent spake of citizen disarmament laws in states like Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland and New York has led me on a campaign to defy, resist, evade and smuggle in opposition to those laws.\u201d\n\nInitiative 594, which took effect last week, requires a criminal background check for those purchasing firearms at gun shows and on line. Such checks are currently required of those buying guns from gun dealers.\n\n\u201cWe will buy and sell guns from whom we please: We will not submit to background checks,\u201d Seim proclaimed in announcing the December 13 rally. The rally emblem is a poster of two guns crossed.\n\nBut the Washington State Patrol has said it will not arrest demonstrators on Saturday who exchange firearms.\n\nWhile strident in their rhetoric, larger gun groups seem to be putting distance between themselves and the Saturday rally. Two groups, the Second Amendment Foundation and Citizens Committee for the Right to Bear Arms, have announced their own rally for Jan. 15 at the Legislature.\n\nDave Workman, a popular gun rights writer, seemed to downplay sponsors\u2019 early predictions that thousands would show up for Saturday\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cWeather may determine the size of the crowd as well as a conflict with the Washington Arms Collectors\u2019 gun show in Puyallup,\u201d Workman wrote on Monday.\n\nHe noted that on Jan. 15, the Legislature will be in session in Olympia.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Strange Bedfellows -- Politics News", "description": "Extreme anti-government figures, and veterans of an armed standoff with federal officers in Nevada, will headline a Saturday gun rally in Olympia, titled \u201cI Will Not Comply\u201d and keyed t\u2026", "title": "Anti-government, Nevada standoff figures at Saturday gun rally in Olympia", "url": "http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2014/12/09/anti-government-nevada-standoff-figures-at-saturday-gun-rally/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-09T22:55:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-13T22:45:06+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.7.5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc32\"", "article_summary": "Extreme anti-government figures, and veterans of an armed standoff with federal officers in Nevada, will headline a Saturday gun rally in Olympia, titled \u201cI Will Not Comply\u201d and keyed to defiance of voter-passed Initiative 594.\nDave Workman, a popular gun rights writer, seemed to downplay sponsors\u2019 early predictions that thousands would show up for Saturday\u2019s rally.\nSeim has made expansive statements in buildup to Saturday\u2019s rally, declaring: \u201cWe the people, with the vested authority of absolute law, declare ALL restrictions and permits of ALL kinds to be VOID.\nWhile strident in their rhetoric, larger gun groups seem to be putting distance between themselves and the Saturday rally.\nThe rally, slated for 11 a.m. at the State Capitol, will hear from Ammon Bundy."}
