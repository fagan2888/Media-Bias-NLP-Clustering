Access Health CT, however, was an exception.\n\nConnecticut\u2019s exchange went live that September\u2014ahead of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s deadline and five percent below budget. And while millions of uninsured Americans struggled with exchanges that were slow, error-ridden or simply down, Connecticut residents enrolled by the tens of thousands\u2014ultimately reducing the state\u2019s uninsured rate by 50 percent.\n\nIn the two years since, Access Health CT has continued to build on that initial success\u2014streamlining the process for consumers and steadily adding new functionality. The goal was not simply to maintain a functional government-run exchange, but to deliver an customer experience that exceeds the citizen expectations shaped by private-sector apps and online services.\n\nAccess Health CT embraced mobile early, developing a robust API and an extensible mobile platform that integrates closely with its backend systems. Connecticut consumers can not only access plan details from their mobile devices, but also screen themselves for benefit eligibility and even upload the documents needed to verify eligibility.\n\nAnd when the third open enrollment period commences on Nov. 1, Connecticut residents will be able to act on that research and actually enroll for insurance coverage through the Access Health CT mobile app. User tests suggest that \u201cmobile enroll\u201d can reduce the average application time to as little as 10 minutes.\n\nAccess Health CT is not the only successful state exchange, of course, and the federal government\u2019s HealthCare.gov has made great strides since its troubled debut. What truly sets the Connecticut effort apart\u2014and what earned it the Editor\u2019s Choice Award\u2014was the way the exchange was built with re-use and revision in mind.\n\nThe mobile platform in particular was developed from the ground up as a SaaS offering, readily reconfigurable to be deployed for other state-based exchanges or even private-sector insurance sites. that can be configured to provide a mobile platform and digital services to other state-based HIX, Private HIX, State Health and Human Services organizations and Insurance Carriers.\n\nSuch shareability doesn\u2019t mean much if the underlying system can\u2019t deliver, but Access Health CT has addressed back-end needs as well as citizen expectations. The security and privacy controls, data standards and flexible reporting functions all help to ensure the system can help Connecticut deliver on this critical mission. And other governments can do more than simply watch and learn.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Access Health CT connecticut, ACA", "og": {"url": "https://gcn.com/articles/2015/10/06/access-health-ct.aspx", "image": "https://gcn.com/~/media/GIG/GCN/Redesign/Articles/2015/October/accesshealthct.png", "site_name": "GCN", "description": "Connecticut proved that state exchanges could work from the get-go.
