President Obama and Elizabeth Warren have a disagreement about TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) and I must say that Warren has a valid point.

Obama, along with most Republicans, supports TPP which is an investment and regulatory treaty involving a dozen countries including the U.S., Canada, Japan, Mexico, Australia and Chile.

Now while I think the treaty is reasonable in principle, the problem is that nobody knows what’s in it. It’s contents have been kept secret. This is Warren’s principle complaint and she is right.

In other words, to paraphrase Nancy Pelosi, “We need to pass TPP to find out what’s in it.”

I just wish Warren upheld these principles of transparency during the Obamacare debate.

Conversely, I wish Republicans who argued for transparency in the Obamacare debate would argue for transparency where it concerns TPP.
