A spokeswoman for the House GOP Conference, speaking on background, said Leno would appear during one of the dinners, but would not specify which day. She said he will likely provide a \"dose of humor.\"\n\nLawmakers are expected to board buses this morning around 11:30 to head for Hershey. Once across the Pennsylvania border, the contingency of buses will be given a state police escort. Security during the two-day event will be provided by U.S. Capitol Police. Members of Congress are not generally entitled to Secret Service protection. Security at the event is expected to be high.\n\nLawmakers are expected to attend \"substantive joint policy\" sessions. All sessions are closed off to the media and the public. A media staging center will be held across the Hershey Lodge at the Lebbie Lebkicher's restaurant, which is adjacent to the resort center. Only media members with credentials for the event will be admitted.\n\nLawmakers are also expected to discuss health care, immigration reform and the budget. They are also expected to discuss the reconciliation process, a controversial and generally partisan process that both Democrats and Republicans have used in the past to pass legislation by a simple Senate majority of 51 votes. Democrats used reconciliation to enact a portion of Obamacare in 2010, and Republicans used it to enact Bush-era tax cuts.\n\nRepublicans, for the first time since 2006, control both the House and the Senate, but need several votes from Democrats if they are to override a presidential veto. President Obama has already vowed to veto several GOP-favored bills, including the Keystone XL pipeline project and any dismantling of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLawmakers will travel to Hershey with some staff and family members. Organizers remained tight-lipped about what types of excursions and activities were planned for those participating in the retreat. The Congressional Institute, a non-profit educational organization, is footing the bulk of the two-day event, and lawmakers are also ponying up to cover for added cost out-of-pocket.\n\nLawmakers are expected to be treated to lots of Hershey's chocolates, one organizer said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Congress,GOP-Retreat", "title": "GOP retreat in Hershey will involve policy talks, chocolate and a touch of humor", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"GOP retreat in Hershey will involve policy talks, chocolate and a touch of humor\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/01/gop_retreat_republicans_hershe_1.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/16768754-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14957760\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-14T15:41:57Z\", \"author\": \"Ivey DeJesus | idejesus@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@topmobile\",\"@topstories\",\"Congress\",\"GOP-Retreat\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/16768754-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@iveydejesus", "description": "Organizers of two-day Congressional GOP retreat in Hershey remain tight-lipped about the event.
