House GOP leaders are hoping to use a package of tax bills to ease the party’s weeks-long standoff over its budget.

The House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday released a “budget savings” package that it says will cut $16 billion in two years by targeting overpayments in government programs like ObamaCare.

The committee’s legislation makes no mention of an ongoing budget fight, but a spokeswoman for the committee confirmed the bills were “part of the larger budget effort.”

The trio of deficit-trimming bills comes as the House GOP remains locked in a battle over increased government spending, which has held up Speaker’s (R-Wis.) hopes of passing a budget by next month.

The bills are expected to be marked up next week, ahead of a full House vote on the budget resolution, a GOP aide said.

The $16 billion in savings — totalling $98 billion within a decade — is intended to appease fiscal conservatives, who have strongly opposed House GOP leaders’ budget plans that rely on a deal with the White House and would add about $30 billion in spending next year.

The proposed bills would crack down on ObamaCare subsidies and on child tax credits and state social services grants.

“The American people want Congress to fight fraud and cut wasteful spending — and that’s what these bills do. I look forward to moving these commonsense bills through our Committee and the House in the weeks ahead,” Brady wrote in a statement.
