(REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes)\n\n4362957\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s administration has decided to let the surrogate birth industry sell U.S. citizenship \u2014 and access to the U.S. welfare system \u2014 to foreign parents who never even set foot in the United States.\n\nThe fertility clinics will be able to pocket the profits, after granting access to American education, health, welfare and retirement services to the foreign children and the foreign parents.\n\nThe giveaway is accomplished by a surprise change in regulations, which redefined the term \u201cmother\u201d to include women who contract to carry other women\u2019s embryos to birth.\n\n\u201cUnder this new policy, a mother who meets this definition but does not have a genetic relationship with her child (for example, she became pregnant through an egg donor) will \u2026 be able to transmit U.S. citizenship to her child, if she is a U.S. citizen and all other pertinent citizenship requirements are met,\u201d says the announcement from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nThe announcement, which was made along with the Department of State, is titled \u201cUSCIS Expands the Definition of \u2018Mother\u2019 and \u2018Parent\u2019 to Include Gestational Mothers Using Assisted Reproductive Technology.\u201d\n\nThe change means that a woman who is a U.S. citizen can be hired by a reproductive medical clinic to become pregnant overseas and to give birth in China, Saudi Arabia, or anywhere else, and then effectively hand a U.S. passport to the baby.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge benefit to the child, because it makes him or her a U.S citizen, even if he or she never breathes American air, or lives among Americans, knows English or shares any American cultural norms or ideas with their natural-born American citizens.\n\nIt is also a huge benefit for the parents, because they too can get citizenship once their child becomes an adult. That citizenship allows them \u2014 and their other children \u2014 to move to the United States in time for them to access Obamacare or Medicare benefits in their retirement.\n\nThat\u2019s also a huge benefit to the companies that broker the birth contracts. They can now raise their prices to overseas customers because they can deliver U.S. citizenship with the baby, no matter where the parents are living or where the child is born.\n\nA 2013 Reuters story described how some wealthy Chinese were willing to pay surrogate agencies $120,000 for American women to give birth to their children in the United States, as a way of seeking U.S. citizenship for those children.\n\nBut the citizenship-selling decision leaves Americans to pay for the cost of educating foreign children, and for supporting foreign parents.\n\nIt also adds to the growing cultural diversity that studies show makes it more difficult for Americans to cooperate in communities, to maintain civil society or to influence their distant government in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe federal government is currently selling U.S. citizenship for the bargain price of roughly $500,000 under a so-called EB-5 investment visa.\n\nThe U.S. government also awards citizenship to nearly all children born inside the United States, including the children of tourists and illegal immigrants.\n\nThat generous policy has already prompted the creation of a new industry that cares for foreign mothers who fly into California and other states shortly before the U.S. birth of their foreign children.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "Foreign parents can pay a clinic to have an American child", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "President Barack Obama's administration has decided to let the surrogate birth industry sell U.S. citizenship --- and access to the U.S. welfare system --- to foreign parents who never even set foot i", "title": "Obama Administration Allows Fertility Clinics To Sell US Citizenship", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/28/obama-administration-allows-fertility-clinics-to-sell-us-citizenship/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/assisted-reproductive-technology-reuters-e1414524253453.jpg", "height": 516}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Foreign parents can pay a clinic to have an American child", "title": "Obama Administration Allows Fertility Clinics To Sell US Citizenship Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/28/obama-administration-allows-fertility-clinics-to-sell-us-citizenship/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/assisted-reproductive-technology-reuters-e1414524253453.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-28 15:29:21", "sailthru.title": "Obama Administration Allows Fertility Clinics To Sell US Citizenship", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "immigration,neil-munro", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "fertility,immigration", "sailthru.description": "President Barack Obama's administration has decided to let the surrogate birth industry sell U.S. citizenship --- and access to the U.S. welfare system --- to foreign parents who never even set foot i", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/assisted-reproductive-technology-reuters-e1414524253453.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "But the citizenship-selling decision leaves Americans to pay for the cost of educating foreign children, and for supporting foreign parents.\nThe fertility clinics will be able to pocket the profits, after granting access to American education, health, welfare and retirement services to the foreign children and the foreign parents.\nThe U.S. government also awards citizenship to nearly all children born inside the United States, including the children of tourists and illegal immigrants.\n(REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes)4362957President Barack Obama\u2019s administration has decided to let the surrogate birth industry sell U.S. citizenship \u2014 and access to the U.S. welfare system \u2014 to foreign parents who never even set foot in the United States.\nThat citizenship allows them \u2014 and their other children \u2014 to move to the United States in time for them to access Obamacare or Medicare benefits in their retirement."}
