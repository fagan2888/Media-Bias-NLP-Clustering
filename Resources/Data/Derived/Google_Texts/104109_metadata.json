The result is a mask of serene immobility, a face with a creaseless brow, a square firm jawline, lips feminine in their puffy fullness. His skin is impressively smooth and so pale as to lend him a lunar aspect. Strangers often inquire, Brandt said, whether he is from Sweden.\n\n\"Actually,\" he replies, \"I'm a Jewish kid from Newark.\"\n\nIt is easy to forget that little more than a decade ago, the medical means for staving off aging involved scalpels and a long recovery. Once facial fillers appeared, traditional face-lifts lost ground to rejuvenating treatments achieved with numbing cream and a simple injection.\n\nBrandt is quick to concede that his practice, like that of thousands of other physicians and practitioners in a multibillion-dollar business, is predicated on the principle that there is something inherently wrong with allowing nature to take its course.\n\nThere is a tendency among Hollywood stars and countless others increasingly plagued by the cultural obsession with youth and beauty, Brandt said, to cut too soon, to overfill, to go too far.\n\n\"When there's too much pulling, too many procedures, you lose the softness\" along with the personality of the face, its old familiar landmarks, he said. Asked whether he felt his experiments on himself had produced that effect, he replied, \"People think I look pretty good.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/04/hfwell08.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe07b1\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Fredric Brandt is an unnervingly ageless-looking personage, a man intimately familiar with the trick mirrors of society.\n\"When there's too much pulling, too many procedures, you lose the softness\" along with the personality of the face, its old familiar landmarks, he said.\nThe result is a mask of serene immobility, a face with a creaseless brow, a square firm jawline, lips feminine in their puffy fullness.\nAsked whether he felt his experiments on himself had produced that effect, he replied, \"People think I look pretty good.\"\n\"If I have nice skin,\" the performer said recently in an email, \"I owe a lot to him.\""}
