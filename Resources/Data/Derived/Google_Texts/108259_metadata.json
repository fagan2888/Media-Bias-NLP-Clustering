Gregory Porter, served as a community business counselor for the Center Township Trustee\u2019s office from 2010 to 2014. She was responsible for administering payments to Social Security recipients who couldn\u2019t manage their own money, including minors and senior citizens.\n\n\u201cShe instead used that money for her own personal expenses and for her own personal benefit,\u201d Minkler said.\n\nBatts-Porter\u2019s arrest comes on the heels of another embezzlement case involving an official from the Center Township Trustee Office, which manages more than $1 million annually for the Social Security Administration. The township\u2019s former chief financial officer, Alan S. Mizen, pleaded guilty in November to embezzling nearly $344,000 from a government account. Prosecutors said Mizen used the funds to purchase his home, a pickup truck and jewelry.\n\nProsecutors said there is no indication the two incidents are related, even though Batts-Porter and Mizen worked in the same office at the same time. There is also no evidence that the trustee\u2019s office was aware that the alleged crimes were taking place.\n\n\u201cTwo times in six months is two times too many,\u201d Minkler said. \u201cIt is time for the Center Township Trustee\u2019s office to police themselves and clean up their own mess.\u201d\n\nBatts-Porter faces up to 10 years in federal prison, if she is convicted. No future court date has been set.\n\nHer attorney, John Thar, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a phone message Friday seeking comment.\n\nJohn Schorg, a spokesman for the Indiana House Democrats, said Batts-Porter\u2019s father had no comment about the charges against his daughter.\n\n___\n\nFollow Lauryn Schroeder on Twitter at https://twitter.com/laurynschroed", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Indianapolis township official was charged with embezzling nearly $67,000 in Social Security payments intended for the elderly, disabled and needy, weeks after another official from her office pleaded guilty to embezzlement in an unrelated case.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/9/2nd-indy-government-official-charged-with-embezzle/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "An Indianapolis township official was charged with embezzling nearly $67,000 in Social Security payments intended for the elderly, disabled and needy, weeks after another official from her office pleaded guilty to embezzlement in an unrelated case.", "title": "Indianapolis township official accused of stealing $67K"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "An Indianapolis township official was charged with embezzling nearly $67,000 in Social Security payments intended for the elderly, disabled and needy, weeks after another official from her office plea", "card": "summary", "title": "Indianapolis township official accused of stealing $67K"}, "Author": "LAURYN SCHROEDER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Batts-Porter, whose father is Democratic state Rep.
