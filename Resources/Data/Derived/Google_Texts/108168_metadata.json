Marvin Stockwell is communications director.\n\n\"The majority of our patients in Memphis won't receive a subsidy through the Affordable Care Act because Tennessee did not, at least so far, didn't expand its Medicaid plan,\" Stockwell said.\n\nBut according to a Bankrate.com report 41 percent of uninsured Americans plan to remain uninsured.\n\n\"Frankly, I think that's when we'll see more acceptance is when people begin hearing their friends have had a good experience. Why are people electing to stay uninsured? It has a lot to do with the affordability issue,\" Stockwell said.\n\nThe Bankrate.com report says more than 40 percent say health insurance is still too expensive and they'd rather pay a fine and many are still unaware of healthcare subsidies.\n\nChrist Community Health Services also provides health care for Memphians and Shelby Countians who are uninsured.\n\nAmanda Chandler is director of population health at Christ Community, \"We've seen an increase since October since the opening of the Marketplace.\"\n\nShe says despite the media push, it's unfortunate many still have misconceptions about the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"I'm not sure why everyone would not be signing up for insurance. I think a lot of is just education that need to continue surround healthcare.gov,\" Chandler said.\n\nChrist Community will offer a healthcare enrollment event March 25 at Greater Community Temple Church on Winchester from 11 a.m to 6 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Memphis organizations say many uninsured Memphians have expressed interest in enrolling", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "WREG.com", "description": "Memphis organizations say many uninsured Memphians have expressed interest in enrolling", "title": "Who\u2019s Not Signing Up For the Affordable Care Act And Why?", "url": "http://wreg.com/2014/03/17/whos-not-signing-up-for-the-affordable-care-act-and-why/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvwreg.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/promo219361475.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwreg.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/promo219361475.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@3onyourside", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@3onyourside"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324690258", "fb": {"pages": 114737265221655}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wreg.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/9bc3246fbdba300537a296bf9ad07b3c?s=16", "application-name": "WREG.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wreg3", "published_time": "2014-03-17T21:14:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-17T21:14:50+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wreg3"}, "keywords": "news, affordable care act, amanda chandler, christ community health services, church health center, healthcare, healthcare.gov, marvin stockwell, memphis", "google-site-verification": "uJnF6Q7vJP3k7pEVLotNZ8dGfBwvCzC3at_F3MZ_CA4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ec6\"", "article_summary": "She says despite the media push, it's unfortunate many still have misconceptions about the Affordable Care Act.\nChrist Community Health Services also provides health care for Memphians and Shelby Countians who are uninsured.\nWell known celebrities such as NBA legends Alonzo Mourning and Magic Johnson are appearing in ads to get people to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, but are large numbers of Memphians enrolling?\n\"The majority of our patients in Memphis won't receive a subsidy through the Affordable Care Act because Tennessee did not, at least so far, didn't expand its Medicaid plan,\" Stockwell said.\nThe Church Health Center in Memphis provides affordable healthcare for the low-wage working, uninsured."}
