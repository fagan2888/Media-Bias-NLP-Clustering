And how wrong is Bernie Sanders on health care?\n\nBy Lauren Carroll, Will Cabaniss, and Linda Qiu\n\nAfter weeks of news about his blunt statements, billionaire Republican candidate Donald Trump offered more specifics Sunday about what policies voters could expect from a Trump White House.\n\nNBC\u2019s Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd questioned Trump in a lengthy sit-down interview about his ideas for immigration reform, legal exceptions for abortion, and whether he will, like some of his opponents, \u201crip up\u201d the Iran deal that lifts economic sanctions in exchange for the country not developing a nuclear weapon.\n\n\u201cThe problem is by the time I got in there, they will have already received the $150 billion,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDo you know if the deal gets rejected they still get the money? Which is something I found out a week ago. I couldn\u2019t believe it. If the deal gets rejected, they still get all of this money. Iran is going to be unbelievably powerful and unbelievably rich.\u201d\n\nHis claim that Iran will get $150 billion \u201ceven if the deal gets rejected\u201d rates Half True.\n\nThe $150 billion figure is on the high side of how much analysts expect Iran to receive in unlocked assets. Experts said the more common estimate is $100 billion, though the figure could run as low as $25 billion if the country\u2019s other financial obligations are taken into account, such as money Iran owes to China for infrastructure projects. The Obama administration has said that after Iran pays its outstanding financial obligations, it will have about $56 billion at its disposal.\n\nHowever, experts said Trump does have a point about what could happen if Congress rejects the deal and U.S. sanctions remain in place (surviving a presidential veto). Other countries in the United Nations and European Union could stop enforcing their own sanctions anyway, allowing Iran to access at least some of its assets that have been frozen under international sanctions.\n\n\u201cThere would be some crumbling of the sanctions wall, but that does not on its own free up the entire $100 billion,\u201d said Michael Malloy, a law professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law. He added that the United States controls much of the petroleum market, which is important to Iran\u2019s economy.\n\nAlso worth remembering is that the unfrozen assets would not come to Iran all at once, like a \u201csigning bonus,\u201d Malloy said.\n\nLater in the program, Todd questioned Democratic presidential candidate and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) about his call for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and if it would mean the end of Obamacare. Without saying yes, Sanders cited high costs for health care in the United States compared with its global competitors as reason for a single-payer system.\n\n\u201cWe spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nHis claim rates False.\n\nData from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development shows that U.S. spending per capita grew to $8,713 in 2013. This is the largest in the world by at least a couple thousand dollars, but Sanders put the difference too strongly by saying it was \u201calmost twice\u201d that of any other country.\n\nSwitzerland spent the second-highest amount on health care per capita at $6,325, and Norway came in third at $5,862.\n\nFellow outsider and Republican candidate Ben Carson seemed to acknowledge the populist following of Sanders in response to a question from Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace about his proposed flat tax rate of 10 percent, akin to the biblical practice of tithing.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Now, I know a lot of people say that\u2019s a problem because that guy\u2019s still got $9 billion left, we need to take his money. But you see, Chris, that\u2019s called socialism,\u201d Carson said. \u201cAnd I recognize a lot of people here who believe in socialism. That number is increasing.\u201d\n\nHis claim rates Half True.\n\nPolling experts said there\u2019s no data that consistently measures Americans\u2019 \u201cbelief\u201d in socialism over time, as \u201cwe haven\u2019t had a serious socialist movement or competitive party in the country,\u201d said Charles Franklin, a professor of public policy and law at Marquette University.\n\nFranklin\u2019s search of the University of Connecticut\u2019s Roper Center archive on public opinion got 70 hits for \u201csocialism\u201d out of more than 500,000 questions dating back to the 1930s.\n\nStill, two polls in recent years from Pew and Rasmussen Reports showed modest gains (within the margin of error, so the growth may not be statistically significant) for socialist views. The attitude is more favorable for young people, said Joseph Schwartz, a political theorist at Temple University.\n\n\u201cFolks under 45 did not come of political age during the Cold War,\u201d Schwartz explained. \u201cMillennials, I think, vaguely associate socialism more with Nordic social democracy than with authoritarian communism, so they see these countries as less unequal than more \u2018neoliberal\u2019 U.S.-style capitalism.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "punditfact"}, "keywords": "Iran, Fox News Sunday, Bernie Sanders, Sunday Talk, abortion, Ben Carson, Meet the Press, immigration, u.s. poli, Donald Trump, Donald Trump", "publicationDate": 201508170053, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Will Tehran really bank $150 million even if Congress rejects the Iran deal, as Donald Trump claims?
