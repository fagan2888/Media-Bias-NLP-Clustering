Here are three of the policies Republicans are likely to tackle as they take the reins in January 2015. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nJust like that, Washington\u2019s political landscape has shifted again.\n\nRepublicans expanded their majority in the House of Representatives and captured enough seats in the Senate to seize control of that body, splitting political power between the Capitol and the White House. And while it remains to be seen whether single-party control of Capitol Hill will diminish or deepen the gridlock in Washington, it has changed the outlook for some of the legislative items that tend to matter most to employers and entrepreneurs.\n\nThere are also new faces locally. Maryland voters elected Republican Larry Hogan governor, ensuring divided government in the Democratic-dominated state capital. And the District is getting a new mayor, Democrat Muriel E. Bowser.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample of some of the election\u2019s ramifications for:\n\nTaxes\n\nImmigration\n\nHealth care\n\nTrade\n\nWages\n\nGovernment contracting\n\nData security\n\nRetail\n\nBanking\n\nTaxes: Overhaul back in business\n\n\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nTax reform has been lingering just out of reach since the start of Obama\u2019s presidency, but it may have a real shot to reach his desk now that one party controls both chambers of Congress. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Rep. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who are likely to head finance committees in each chamber, have said that crafting a workable, comprehensive tax proposal would be a top priority. At a recent campaign stop, Ryan said he expects to have legislation ready sometime next year.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that a Republican-authored tax plan may sit better with smaller businesses than the alternatives pitched so far by the White House, as Ryan and others have insisted on an overhaul that includes lower individual rates and lower corporate rates (the Obama administration has pushed for corporate-only changes). Small-business groups have noted that most small companies are set up as pass-through entities, so their owners pay taxes as part of their individual taxes and would thus see no benefit from a law that merely lowers the corporate rate.\n\n\u2014 J.D. Harrison\n\nBack to Top\n\nImmigration: Get ready for more debate\n\n\n\nTop Republicans met with President Obama on Nov. 7 after warning him that changing U.S. immigration policy without involving Congress would invite \u201cbig trouble\u201d and make a future compromise impossible. (Dennis Brack/Pool via Bloomberg)\n\nRepublican leaders have long said, and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney reiterated last week, that the party would move immigration reform toward the top of its priority list if it took control of the Senate. And even with the president expected to circumvent lawmakers with executive action on some of the most immediate immigration-related challenges, it appears the GOP will start crafting its own broader package.\n\nWhile the devil will be in the details, and though it remains unclear just how broad an overhaul Republicans are interested in pursuing, there will be many business leaders pleased to hear that the issue could be back on the table. Some seasonal and tourism companies, for example, have complained that they are having trouble finding low-skill labor to help them operate during peak season. Meanwhile, technology executives have urged lawmakers to address what they see as a shortage in highly skilled workers in fields such as science and engineering.\n\n\u2014 J.H.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHealth care: The battle continues\n\nA man looks over the Affordable Care Act signup page on the HealthCare.gov website. (Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nWhile it has been the ultimate goal for some Republican lawmakers, the chances of a full repeal of President Obama\u2019s signature health-care reform remains unlikely. Some political analysts have said they expect to see a repeal bill now finally reach president\u2019s desk, but it would be swiftly vetoed by Obama. Republicans did not pick up enough seats to override a presidential veto.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not to say that the outcomes last week will not have a significant impact on the law. Republicans are likely to start pushing through proposals that would chip away at the statute, and they have put a bull\u2019s-eye on some of the most controversial provisions for small businesses \u2014 that is, rules requiring companies to provide health plans or pay a penalty, as well as language that define \u201cfull-time\u201d worker status as at least 30 hours per week.\n\n\u2014 J.H.\n\nBack to Top\n\nTrade: Prospects improve for agreements\n\nOutgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D- Nev.) (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nIn many cases, Republican control on the Senate will put a clamp on the president\u2019s agenda for his final two years, but there are a few exceptions. For example, his attempts to strike two massive trade deals \u2014 one across the Atlantic and another across the Pacific \u2014 have largely been thwarted by members of his own party, including now-outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.).\n\nWith Republicans at the helm, Obama may actually find it easier to close those deals. During a speech at the White House last week, he said trade talks would be one of the first items of business he discusses with Republicans on the Hill. If successful, the deals could be a boon for companies that bring in materials or goods from abroad, as well as those that are interested in selling to customers overseas.\n\n\u2014 J.H.\n\nBack to Top\n\nWages: Movement on minimums\n\nActivists and workers, demanding an increase in minimum wage, march holding placards past a McDonald\u2019s fast food restaurant in Manhattan, New York. (Adrees Latif/Reuters)\n\nPerhaps counterintuitively, an effort to raise the federal minimum wage could get a boost under the new Republican-led Congress. On the campaign trail, a number of GOP candidates expressed support for a higher wage floor \u2014 an increasingly popular position among voters in both parties, as evidenced by the fact that all five states with minimum wage hikes on the ballot last week approved them. There\u2019s some support for a higher federal limit as a way to bring some consistency to the hodgepodge of rates being set at the state and local level.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue that has split business owners down the middle, as some have warned that forcing higher pay would hit their bottom lines and force them to cut back on hiring. Others believe that higher wages would put more money into the their customers\u2019 pockets, resulting in more spending and higher sales.\n\n\u2014 J.H.\n\nBack to Top\n\nGovernment contracting: Breathing a little easier?\n\nContractors are waiting to see how Congress decides to fund the government before the end of the year. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nNow that Republicans are set to take control of the Senate, the outlook for government contractors, especially defense companies, appears the slightest bit sunnier.\n\nDefense companies from Lockheed Martin to Raytheon to BAE Systems overwhelmingly donated money to Republican campaigns in this election cycle, so the GOP\u2019s victory is certainly not unwelcome.\n\n\u201cDefense contractors almost never take sides in elections, but they know that Republicans are generally more likely to favor their programs than Democrats,\u201d said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst and consultant to Lockheed Martin.\n\nRegardless of who is in control, federal spending on defense is likely to increase, analysts say, because there is no shortage of global conflict at the moment.\n\nBoth parties are in agreement that the Pentagon needs additional support to address geopolitical threats such as the Islamic State and the Ebola crisis, said Ryan Crotty, fellow and deputy director in the international security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.\n\n\u201cThe question is, what pays for it?\u201d Crotty said. \u201cThere\u2019s a political mandate that any additional spending you want to do has to be paid for by spending less from somewhere else.\u201d\n\nIn the short term, contractors are waiting to see how Congress decides to fund the government before the end of the year. The government\u2019s continuing resolution expires on Dec. 11. A lame-duck Congress has to decide whether to extend that resolution and maintain current funding levels or appropriate new funds. Defense spending is one of the key components of any funding measure that Congress decides on.\n\nIn the long term, the new Congress must also tackle the issues of sequestration, the debt ceiling and Defense Department funding in fiscal 2016, which come to the fore early next year and affect all businesses, including contractors.\n\n\u201cIn terms of big issues, I don\u2019t think anybody expects major progress\u201d on budget priorities as a result of the election, said Stan Soloway, president and chief executive of the Professional Services Council, an Arlington-based trade group.\n\nInstead, smaller measures on issues such as fixing the Pentagon\u2019s procurement process are more likely, trade groups say.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an inclination to want to make government work well,\u201d said Elizabeth Hyman, executive vice president of public advocacy at TechAmerica, an advocacy group. \u201cWe hope to see common-sense procurement and acquisition reform.\u201d\n\nContractors are closely tracking changes in committee leadership after the Republican sweep.\n\nSen. John McCain, (R-Ariz.) has long been a vocal critic of cost overruns on big defense programs. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nFor instance, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is widely expected to lead the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nMcCain, a former Navy pilot, has long been a vocal critic of cost overruns on big defense programs including the F-35 jet, which might put some weapons systems under the scanner.\n\nBut McCain is \u201ca defense hawk\u201d by any definition, Thompson said.\n\n\u201cThat means if contractors can stand the pain, they\u2019re probably going to end up better off in the end,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) is expected to take over chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Committee from Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.). This could mean additional funding for the Navy to modernize its fleet and potentially benefit contractors such as shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls, Thompson said. But it also gives Mikulski a less prominent perch from which to advocate for the region\u2019s cybersecurity industry and press to locate the FBI\u2019s headquarters in Maryland.\n\nWith the election out of the way, contractors are expecting a little more economic certainty, if only for a little while.\n\nAt the very least, \u201ca Congress with one party holding both sides is more likely to be able to push through changes,\u201d Crotty said.\n\n\u2014 Amrita Jayakumar\n\nBack to Top\n\nData security: Hope for a federal data breach notification law\n\nA Home Depot sign is shown in Nashville, Tenn. Hackers stole 53 million email addresses in addition to payment card data from the retailer. (Mark Humphrey/AP)\n\nThere are currently 48 state laws governing how companies must notify their customers and employees if their data has been breached.\n\nThat makes it complicated for regional and national companies when a breach happens \u2014 if they are based in Washington but have employees or customers in a dozen states, for example, each of those dozen states\u2019 different laws apply to how the company must notify those people.\n\nFor that reason, the business community as a whole largely supports the passage of a single federal law so that in the event of a breach, companies would only have to comply with one law as opposed to 48 different laws when notifying the affected customers and employees.\n\nVersions of that legislation have been stuck in House and Senate committees, but now that the two chambers are both under Republican control, businesses are hoping that the passage of a unified federal standard will move more quickly.\n\n\u2014 Catherine Ho\n\nBack to Top\n\nRetail: Trouble for trolls and Internet taxes\n\nSenate Majority Whip Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) has been a champion of sales-tax fairness (T.J. Kirkpatrick/Getty Images)\n\nTaxes and patent trolls are two issues the retail industry is hoping the Republican-led Senate will take up in the next two years, according to David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation.\n\n\u201cFrom a government standpoint, we think [a Republican pick-up in the Senate] is an important step in the right direction,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong other measures, NRF officials said a Republican-led Congress is more likely to pass legislation limiting the reach of \u201cpatent trolls\u201d that have long plagued the retail industry with lawsuits, especially when merchants venture into e-commerce. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pulled the plug on a patent reform bill earlier this year, but a Republican-led Senate may be likely to resurrect talks, French said.\n\nThe lobbying organization warned that Republican control of Congress may make it trickier to pass a bill requiring online merchants to collect the same sales tax as their brick-and-mortar counterparts. Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) has been a champion of sales-tax fairness, and with Democrats taking a back seat in the Senate, that could become a fading priority.\n\n\u201cWith Durbin in the minority, the issue may be more challenging in 2015, so retailers need to step up efforts for the legislation to receive final passage during the lame-duck session,\u201d J. Craig Shearman, vice president of government affairs at the retail group, wrote on the federation\u2019s site Wednesday.\n\n\u2014 Abha Bhattarai\n\nBack to Top\n\nBanking: Time for relief\n\nFinancial institutions are hoping a Republican Congress will make for loosened regulation. (Mark Lennihan/AP)\n\nFour years after the implementation of the post-Great Recession Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, regulation is still top of mind for banks and credit unions.\n\nFinancial institutions are hoping a Republican stronghold in Congress will make for loosened regulation and tweaks to Dodd-Frank.\n\nIf nothing else, having a clear majority in both the House and Senate will help pass legislation more quickly, according to Katherine Marisic, vice president of political affairs for the National Association of Federal Credit Unions. The Democratic-led Senate has blocked recent attempts by the House at changing key measures of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n\u201cWe hope there is a real opportunity for some regulatory relief from Dodd-Frank that our members have been dealing with,\u201d Marisic said. \u201cThe Republican-held Senate and the Republican-held House may be willing to work together on this type of issue.\u201d\n\n\u2014 A.B.\n\nBack to Top\n\nRelated:\n\nCommercial real estate: Challenges await new mayor\n\nWhat Larry Hogan means for businesses in Maryland\n\nDistrict\u2019s new lawyer helped Venable grow", "article_metadata": {"description": "While it remains to be seen whether single-party control of Capitol Hill will diminish or deepen the gridlock in Washington, it has changed the outlook for employers and entrepreneurs.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "While it remains to be seen whether single-party control of Capitol Hill will diminish or deepen the gridlock in Washington, it has changed the outlook for employers and entrepreneurs.", "title": "What Republican control of Capitol Hill means to companies big and small", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-business/wp/2014/11/09/what-republican-control-of-capitol-hill-means-to-companies-big-and-small/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-business/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2014/11/cover1110.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-business/wp/2014/11/09/what-republican-control-of-capitol-hill-means-to-companies-big-and-small/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "capbizhero, election, midterm elections, republican senate, congress, bizpage", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "capbizhero, election, midterm elections, republican senate, congress, bizpage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6ec\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Abha BhattaraiBack to TopBanking: Time for reliefFinancial institutions are hoping a Republican Congress will make for loosened regulation.\nThe lobbying organization warned that Republican control of Congress may make it trickier to pass a bill requiring online merchants to collect the same sales tax as their brick-and-mortar counterparts.\nDefense companies from Lockheed Martin to Raytheon to BAE Systems overwhelmingly donated money to Republican campaigns in this election cycle, so the GOP\u2019s victory is certainly not unwelcome.\n(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)Now that Republicans are set to take control of the Senate, the outlook for government contractors, especially defense companies, appears the slightest bit sunnier.\nThe GOP gained control of the Senate Tuesday night, taking hold of the legislative agenda in that chamber."}
