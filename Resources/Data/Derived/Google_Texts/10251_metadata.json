But oh, The Kelly File outrage when the AP publishes photographs of Republican Senator Ted Cruz in front of a poster with a handgun that looks like it\u2019s pointed at him \u2013 at a \u201cCelebrate the 2nd Amendment\u201d event.\n\nHost Megyn Kelly announced in the opening of the discussion that the AP has now taken down the photos - but that was no reason not to gin up conservative victimhood and fury anyway. \u201cCritics are asking what the fallout would have been if this were the president standing there instead of Senator Cruz?\u201d she asked.\n\nFor analysis, \u201cindependent\u201d Kelly turned to one of FNC\u2019s favorite conservative hate mongers, Ann Coulter, \u201cthe author of \u2018Adios, America, the left\u2019s plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole!\u2019\u201d Kelly announced theatrically. \u201cIt\u2019s always fun to read the titles of your books,\u201d Kelly told her guest. Even though every one of Coulter\u2019s titles is an inflammatory insult toward liberals.\n\nFor extra conservative victimhood, Kelly said, \u201cIf that had been Hillary Clinton, if that had been President Obama, the left would have been losing their minds over this. \u2026The AP would they have done it?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be real here. Obama and Clinton would not have been at any \u201cCelebrate the 2nd Amendment\u201d event as Cruz was, so it\u2019s doubtful there would be any legitimate photo ops of them in front of a gun poster.\n\nBut Kelly and Coulter continued to suggest that the AP had somehow snapped the photo out of liberal vengeance. \u201cThat is so outrageous. Don\u2019t insult our intelligence by saying, \u2018Oh we didn\u2019t even notice,\u2019\u201d Coulter complained. Kelly said mockingly, \u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d\n\nCoulter then went on a jag of racial accusations that included, \u201cEverything reminds liberals that this is a racist country. It could be a warm summer\u2019s breeze.\u201d\n\nUnlike Kelly\u2019s rude treatment of African American Congressman Al Green (D-TX) who politely tried to explain why he joined a \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot\u201d protest in Congress, Kelly allowed Coulter to continue her diatribe unimpeded. In fact, Kelly chimed in when Coulter attacked the Southern Poverty Law Center as \u201cAmerica\u2019s leading hate group.\u201d\n\nKelly added, \u201cThey try to stand up, they say, against racism and so on, however this is the same group that once deemed Ben Carson, I think, some sort of major threat to the United States.\u201d Actually, the SPLC labeled him as an \u201cextremist\u201d based on his rhetoric.\n\nBack to the Cruz photo, Kelly said, \u201cGod forbid anything were to happen to Senator Ted Cruz, you know, as a result of this threatening photo. \u2026Shouldn\u2019t everyone be more careful if they\u2019re going to apply that kind of a standard to messaging?\u201c This, from the woman who defended Pamela Geller\u2019s Draw the Prophet event that actually did incite violence?\n\nWhat\u2019s even worse is that Coulter has a long history of advocating murder as a \u201cjoke.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, on Fox News, Coulter said about Ezekiel Emanuel, one of the ObamaCare architects, \u201cZeke Emanuel is on my death list. Hold the applause. I\u2019m going to be on the death panel.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Coulter wrote about riots in London: \"A few well-placed rifle rounds, and the rioting would end in an instant. A more sustained attack on the rampaging mob might save England from itself...\"\n\nIn 2013, Coulter responded to a comment by MSNBC host Martin Bashir wondering if having a family member killed is \u201cwhat it takes\u201d to get a Republican to support gun control bill. \u201cLet\u2019s start with Meghan McCain!\u201d Coulter quipped.\n\nIn 2002, Coulter was quoted as saying about the Oklahoma City bomber, \u201cMy only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building.\u201d\n\nMedia Matters has more of Coulter\u2019s murder fantasies.\n\nBut isn\u2019t it funny how Coulter got a pass on actually calling for murder while \u201cindependent\u201d Kelly obsessed about AP\u2019s now-removed photo?\n\nWatch it below, from the June 22 The Kelly File.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "jVwaURx8Tr7TdglLvB2nUlD0zVcUEo/mRDuqB8mKYrc=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/megyn_kelly_teams_up_with_murder_fantasist_ann_coulter_to_attack_ap_over_ted_cruz_gun_photo_062315", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Megyn Kelly Teams Up With Murder-Fantasist Ann Coulter To Attack AP Over Ted Cruz Gun Photo"}, "Title": "Megyn Kelly Teams Up With Murder-Fantasist Ann Coulter To Attack AP Over Ted Cruz Gun Photo"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCritics are asking what the fallout would have been if this were the president standing there instead of Senator Cruz?\u201d she asked.\nFor extra conservative victimhood, Kelly said, \u201cIf that had been Hillary Clinton, if that had been President Obama, the left would have been losing their minds over this.\nBack to the Cruz photo, Kelly said, \u201cGod forbid anything were to happen to Senator Ted Cruz, you know, as a result of this threatening photo.\nBut Kelly and Coulter continued to suggest that the AP had somehow snapped the photo out of liberal vengeance.\nBut isn\u2019t it funny how Coulter got a pass on actually calling for murder while \u201cindependent\u201d Kelly obsessed about AP\u2019s now-removed photo?"}
