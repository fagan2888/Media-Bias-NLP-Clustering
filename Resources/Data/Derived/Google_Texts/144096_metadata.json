The Rams close the regular season with games at New Mexico on Saturday and at Fresno State on Nov. 28, needing one victory to become bowl eligible.\n\nThe victory over UNLV gave the Rams their first two-game winning streak of the season, and it came with the help of junior Rashard Higgins catching seven passes for 102 yards and three touchdowns and sophomore Dalyn Dawkins rushing for 151 yards on 19 carries.\n\n\u201cJust the blood, sweat and tears that we put into the field,\u201d Higgins said of the Rams\u2019 seniors. \u201cNobody knows the feeling except us. It\u2019s a great feeling, and I\u2019m glad they got the \u2018dub\u2019 on their senior night.\u201d\n\nSaid first-year CSU coach Mike Bobo: \u201cWe wanted to come out and get a win for these seniors \u2026 a good group of guys that had played extremely hard. \u2026 I\u2019m really proud of how they weathered the storm this year. It would have been easy to pack it in, but they keep fighting. They have a chance to do something special here, three straight bowl games. Talk about leaving a legacy.\u201d\n\nBobo also challenged the seniors.\n\n\u201cI told them in the locker room: \u2018We have to finish. We\u2019re not done,\u2019 \u201d Bobo said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the last game of the season. We have a lot of football left to play, and I expect them to continue to lead.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico (6-4, 4-2) has made major progress in its fourth season with former Notre Dame coach Bob Davie. The Lobos are coming off a 31-24 road win over Boise State, the same Broncos who whipped CSU 41-10 in Fort Collins last month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched them a couple of times, and they\u2019re explosive and we have to be at our best,\u201d Bobo said of the Lobos. \u201cWe all want to go to a bowl game. We all want to have a winning season. But we have to go earn the right to play in a bowl game. We have to earn a winning season.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s expected that all FBS teams with at least six wins will receive a bowl berth. The Mountain West has eight bowl tie-ins, but it can\u2019t send teams to both the Las Vegas and Hawaii Bowls, which also can take independent Brigham Young. Also, the Cactus Bowl would come into play only if either the Big 12 or the Pac-12 can\u2019t fill its allotted slots.\n\nThe Mountain West tie-ins:\n\nDec. 19: New Mexico Bowl (Albuquerque), Las Vegas Bowl.\n\nDec. 22: Famous Idaho Potato Bowl (Boise).\n\nDec. 23: Poinsettia Bowl (San Diego).\n\nDec. 24: Hawaii Bowl (Honolulu).\n\nDec. 29: Armed Forces Bowl (Fort Worth, Texas), Arizona Bowl (Tucson).\n\nJan. 2: Cactus Bowl (Phoenix).\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei\n\nEye on\u2026 The Lobos\n\nColorado State at New Mexico, 3:30 p.m. Saturday, ROOT\n\nFor the record: The Bob Davie-coached Lobos (6-4, 4-2 Mountain West) are coming off a 31-24 victory at Boise State that made them bowl eligible.\n\nWho\u2019s hot: Senior running back Jhurell Pressley sparked the victory over Boise State, producing 132 yards rushing and a touchdown on only nine carries.\n\nWho\u2019s not: New Mexico\u2019s defense had trouble getting off the field against the Broncos, who had 114 offensive plays.\n\nStreaking: Sophomore wide receiver Delane Hart-Johnson has an 80-yard catch in back-to-back games.\n\nKey stat: New Mexico\u2019s defense has forced at least one turnover in 19 of the last 21 games.\n\nFYI: The Lobos have bowl eligibility for the first time since 2007. Davie, a former Notre Dame coach, was 11-26 in his first three seasons with the Lobos. He is 6-5 in his last 11 conference games.\n\nIrv Moss, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado State Rams hit the road for bowl eligibility", "title": "Colorado State Rams hit the road for bowl eligibility", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/15/colorado-state-rams-hit-the-road-for-bowl-eligibility/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151115__BN20151116_BB7_BNSP16FBCCSUp1.jpg", "height": 494}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151115__BN20151116_BB7_BNSP16FBCCSUp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-15T20:52:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:36:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23d9\"", "article_summary": "The Mountain West tie-ins:Dec. 19: New Mexico Bowl (Albuquerque), Las Vegas Bowl.\nBut we have to go earn the right to play in a bowl game.\nColorado State improved to 5-5 overall and 3-3 in the Mountain West with a 49-35 victory over UNLV on Saturday night at Hughes Stadium.\n\u201cWe all want to go to a bowl game.\nThe Rams close the regular season with games at New Mexico on Saturday and at Fresno State on Nov. 28, needing one victory to become bowl eligible."}
