Since then, he has cooled considerably, hitting just .208 in August with three homers and eight RBIs. Batting from the leadoff spot and facing new pitchers in a new league, Tulo has not been the offensive powerhouse the Blue Jays envisioned. Not yet anyway.\n\nSaunders\u2019 take: After hitting a two-run homer Friday night at Pittsburgh, Reyes was hitting .267 with three home runs and 11 RBIs. Although Reyes still has good speed, it has yet to transfer to games while wearing a Rockies uniform. From what I have seen, Reyes doesn\u2019t have Tulowitzki\u2019s arm or range. Friday night, Tulo wowed Toronto fans with one of his patented jump throws from short to throw out Detroit\u2019s Ian Kinsler. \u201cThat play Tulo made, it doesn\u2019t get any better than that,\u201d Blue Jays manager John Gibbons told reporters. Bottom line: After winning Saturday, Toronto is 23-5 since acquiring Tulo \u2014 and I have a feeling he will be special down the stretch.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Spotlight,Toronto Blue Jays,Troy Tulowitzki", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Troy Tulowitzki was slumping at the time of the trade, but he got off to a fast start in his first few games wearing Blue Jays blue.", "title": "Troy Tulowitzki: Spotlight on the Blue Jays shortstop", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/08/29/troy-tulowitzki-spotlight-on-the-blue-jays-shortstop/20805/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/07/troy-tulowitzki3-495x337.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Troy Tulowitzki was slumping at the time of the trade, but he got off to a fast start in his first few games wearing Blue Jays blue.", "title": "Troy Tulowitzki: Spotlight on the Blue Jays shortstop", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/08/29/troy-tulowitzki-spotlight-on-the-blue-jays-shortstop/20805/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/07/troy-tulowitzki3-495x337.jpg", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Troy Tulowitzki was slumping at the time of the trade, but he got off to a fast start in his first few games wearing Blue Jays blue."}, "article_summary": "Background: Tulo was slumping at the time of the trade, but he got off to a fast start in his first few games wearing Blue Jays blue.\n\u201cThat play Tulo made, it doesn\u2019t get any better than that,\u201d Blue Jays manager John Gibbons told reporters.\nBatting from the leadoff spot and facing new pitchers in a new league, Tulo has not been the offensive powerhouse the Blue Jays envisioned.\nFriday night, Tulo wowed Toronto fans with one of his patented jump throws from short to throw out Detroit\u2019s Ian Kinsler.\nSaunders\u2019 take: After hitting a two-run homer Friday night at Pittsburgh, Reyes was hitting .267 with three home runs and 11 RBIs."}
