In fact, both private companies and organizations with more than $1 billion in revenue felt they were more at risk from cybersecurity than reputation issues, according to the results of a new survey from accounting and advisory firm EisnerAmper LLP.\n\nThe firm\u2019s fifth annual Board of Directors Survey: Concerns About Risks Confronting Boards \u2013 which was conducted during January, February, and March 2014 \u2013 measured the opinions of directors serving on the boards of more than 250 publicly traded, private, and not-for-profit companies across a variety of industries. Fifty-three percent of the survey group identified themselves as serving on audit committees.\n\nOther than financial, corporate directors were asked to identify risks that concerned them the most. For the second-straight year, reputational risk was recognized as their primary concern (72 percent in 2014 versus 73 percent in 2013). However, cybersecurity/IT risk was second at 62 percent, up almost 10 percent from last year\u2019s survey. Regulatory compliance risk \u2013 the third-most highly ranked concern \u2013 dropped 6 percentage points to 50 percent in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe study found that with regulatory compliance factors, such as Dodd-Frank and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, having been rolled out, the level of concern about those regulations has actually dropped,\u201d Steven Kreit, a partner in EisnerAmper\u2019s public companies practice, said in a written statement. \u201cWhen we take into account additional feedback from the participants, it paints a picture of boards coming to terms with both Dodd-Frank and healthcare reform.\u201d\n\nAs might be expected, reputational risk was of paramount concern (82 percent) to not-for-profit organizations. Organizations with revenue of $1 million to $10 million were least concerned about reputational risk, with 60 percent of directors indicating it was a concern important to their boards.\n\nCybersecurity was the No. 1 concern for private companies (66 percent) \u2013 and a very close second for public companies (71 percent). Directors serving organizations with more than $1 billion in revenue also favored cybersecurity (73 percent) as the top risk, followed immediately by reputational risk (72 percent).\n\nTrending {{item['sft-title']}}\n\n\u201cThe financial cost and damage to reputation from a cyber/privacy breach is growing exponentially,\u201d Nancy Brady, director of IT risk services for EisnerAmper, said in the survey report. \u201cDirectors have recognized the increasing risk companies face related to cyber- and data security. Now they need to roll up their sleeves and, with the companies, address these risks.\u201d\n\nThough risk due to fraud did not rank in the top third of concerns, 39 percent of public company board members did show concern, making it a significant outlier among other types of organizations, according to EisnerAmper.\n\nConcern about CEO succession planning for private companies dropped by 14 percent to 34 percent, bringing it far out of line with public companies (55 percent) and not-for-profits (50 percent).\n\n\u201cThis is especially interesting considering the plethora of discussions around global battles for executive talent,\u201d EisnerAmper wrote in the survey report. \u201cHowever, private company boards are generally two to three times more concerned about outsourcing risk as compared to public and not-for-profit boards.\u201d\n\nCorporate directors surveyed indicated that while 85 percent of their CEOs have a strong understanding of broad-based risk assessment and 74 percent of chief executives have a firm grasp on regulatory compliance changes, only 51 percent have a strong understanding of cybersecurity issues. Only 58 percent of CFOs at their companies have a firm grasp of cybersecurity issues.\n\n\u201cDespite strong concerns about reputational risk and cyber- and data security, we saw little in the survey showing support for the resources necessary to address it,\u201d Kreit noted. \u201cWith many organizations admitting that they had no plans or relatively unsophisticated plans to address these top-rated risks, there is a need for boards to focus some of their strategic planning time on reevaluating how they will effectively handle concerns as they arise.\u201d\n\nRelated articles:\n\nSurvey: Most Tax Pros Lack Knowledge about Cyberattacks\n\nNSBA Survey: Cyberattacks Concern Small Business Owners\n\nCyberattacks and Hacktivism - Take Cover!", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Jason Bramwell"}, "dcterms.title": "Survey: Cybersecurity Is Keeping More Corporate Directors Up At Night", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Law and Enforcement"}}, "og": {"site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "Survey: Cybersecurity Is Keeping More Corporate Directors Up At Night", "url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/aa/law-and-enforcement/survey-cybersecurity-is-keeping-more-corporate-directors-up-at-night", "image": "http://www.accountingweb.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_medium/public/default-16x9.jpg?itok=FWa8WdE3", "updated_time": "2014-07-24T21:33:12+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/aa/law-and-enforcement/survey-cybersecurity-is-keeping-more-corporate-directors-up-at-night", "card": "summary", "title": "Survey: Cybersecurity Is Keeping More Corporate Directors Up At Night"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/aa/law-and-enforcement/survey-cybersecurity-is-keeping-more-corporate-directors-up-at-night", "dcterms.creator": "Jason Bramwell", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-24T21:33+00:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Article\"},{\"key\":\"subtopic\",\"value\":\"Law and Enforcement\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":[\"Law and Enforcement\",\"A&A\"]},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_18598\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-24T23:33:12+01:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-24T23:40:15+01:00"}, "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "Law and Enforcement", "sft-date": "Jul 24th 2014", "sft-type": "Article", "sft-topic": "A&A", "recs": {"category": "Article", "articleid": "node-18598", "publishtime": "2014-07-24T23:33:12:000Z"}, "sft-author": "Jason Bramwell", "sft-title": "Survey: Cybersecurity Is Keeping More Corporate..."}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcda9\"", "article_summary": "1 concern for private companies (66 percent) \u2013 and a very close second for public companies (71 percent).\nDirectors serving organizations with more than $1 billion in revenue also favored cybersecurity (73 percent) as the top risk, followed immediately by reputational risk (72 percent).\nFor the second-straight year, reputational risk was recognized as their primary concern (72 percent in 2014 versus 73 percent in 2013).\n\u201cDirectors have recognized the increasing risk companies face related to cyber- and data security.\n1 nonfinancial concern among corporate directors, cybersecurity/IT risk is gaining steam."}
