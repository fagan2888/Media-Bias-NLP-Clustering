Nestled between Cherokee Park and Seneca Park is one of Louisville's best hidden gems, Big Rock Park.

"It's one of the prettiest places in Louisville," said Mike O'Brien as he took a break from a 40 mile bike ride with Vicki King. "We ride through this park more weekends than we don't," he said.

Named after a large limestone rock that sits in Beargrass Creek, the park has been a site for picnickers, hikers and on this day, even dog training.

Tyler Ohlmann, of Rosie Dane Dog Training, led a group of about five dogs and their owners through different commands and tricks.

Off to the side there was John David Kolter and his three children, twins Lily and Ayden, 4, and Everett, 2, looking for little creatures in the water.

"We live in the neighborhood and we're trying to get in one of the last good days of the season," he said.

Kolter wasn't the only one taking advantage of the weather, four-year-old Evelyn Adams was being pushed on the swing by her father Joshua, referencing "Winnie The Pooh."

"She wanted to come visit the 100 acre wood," he said.
