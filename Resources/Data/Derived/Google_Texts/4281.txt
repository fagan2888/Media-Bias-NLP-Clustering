In an America where our national debt has twelve zeros behind the number 17, some may question the wisdom of the government spending half a million taxpayer dollars devoted to studying the wherefores and the whys of homosexuals in Peru contracting syphilis, as reported by the right-of-center news portal The Washington Free Beacon on Feb. 3, 2014.

With the sympathetic to syphilitics title of "Syphilis: Translating Technology to Understand a Neglected Epidemic," the National Institute of Health has pumped a whopping $464,272 to Peru's Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia since 2012.

But wait, there's more ...

If almost a half million of hard earned taxpayer dollars studying why gay and bisexual Peruvians men come down with a particular sexually transmitted disease after engaging in sexual congress with other homosexual and bisexual Peruvian men, rest assured that the Obama Administration has ensured that almost a third of a million more taxpayer dollars have been spent specifically on the Peruvian LGBT community.

A total of an additional $307,444 has been pumped into the Peruvian professorial pipeline for gay-centric studies and research.

A $160,920 American grant ensures "motivational messages" sent via "mobile-phone text messaging, email, or instant messaging robots" to give a gentle nudge to Peruvian homosexuals to get tested for HIV due to their proclivity for "MSM" (men having sex with other men).

$146,524 more Yankee dollars were earmarked for HIV prevention aimed at "MSM/transwomen."
