Grab a glass, a lanyard and your appetite and head for the Third Ward Saturday for the debut of Wine in the Ward.

From 2 to 6 p.m., participants can sample food and wine pairings at seven Third Ward restaurants while raising money and awareness for Our Space Inc., a nonprofit organization that empowers adults with mental illness.

Tickets for the benefit are $40 and include a wine glass and a VIP lanyard, plus access to eight wine and horsd'oeuvres pairings at seven restaurants, including Milwaukee Ale House, Kasana Cafe, the Hudson, Hinterland, Grafitto, the Irish Pub and Club Charlies.

Participants should check in at the Wine in the Ward booth inside the Milwaukee Ale House by 2 p.m. to pick up their glass and lanyard. Staff and volunteers will answer questions and provide assistance.

Tickets are available at the event's website, www.tourthebrews.com.
