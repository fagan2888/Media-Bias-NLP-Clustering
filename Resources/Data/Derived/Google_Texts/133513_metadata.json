Then we kind of realized what it was.\"\n\nMullen heard the shot around 11:30 Thursday night, right outside of his fraternity house on Pennsylvania Avenue. Shortly after, UK sent out a crime alert to students and staff.\n\nPolice say two men, armed with guns, robbed two students of their cell phones. The robbers had apparently followed those students all the way from Euclid Avenue.\n\nAt some point after the robbery, police say a shot was fired. It's unclear who fired the shot, but a shell casing was found near the scene. No one was hurt.\n\nThis robbery follows another that happened last week on East Maxwell, not far from campus.\n\nStudents tell WKYT's Whitney Wetzel these crimes are alarming, but they're not too worried.\n\n\"I mean I don't live too far from here, so seeing something happen right on your doorstep is a little bit concerning,\" says Mitch Cavallo, a student. \"But overall, I think campus safety is pretty solid, and you know what, at the end of the day these things happen.\"\n\nUK police say they're reviewing campus surveillance video.\n\nThe suspects are described as black men, around 5'9\" with medium builds. One had cornrows and was wearing dark, baggy clothes. The other was wearing dark jeans, a black and white striped sweatshirt and a white or light pink polo-style ball cap.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UK police issued an alert Thursday night after two men robbed two students at gunpoint and fired off a shot.", "language": "english", "author": "Whitney Wetzel", "og": {"url": "http://www.wkyt.com/home/headlines/UK-police-issue-alert-after-armed-robbery-278766381.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/POLICE+LIGHTS+656X369.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "UK police issued an alert Thursday night after two men robbed two students at gunpoint and fired off a shot.", "title": "Thieves rob two students on University of Kentucky campus"}, "twitter": {"description": "UK police issued an alert Thursday night after two men robbed two students at gunpoint and fired off a shot.", "creator": "@wkyt", "url": "http://www.wkyt.com/home/headlines/UK-police-issue-alert-after-armed-robbery-278766381.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/POLICE+LIGHTS+656X369.jpg", "title": "Thieves rob two students on University of Kentucky campus", "site": "@wkyt", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "fb": {"app_id": 52140914980, "pages": 33684860765}, "keywords": "Thieves rob two students on University of Kentucky campus", "google-site-verification": "FqJZslm8gAesoZ0HsqSrtOk2ypS-GmcIcdZP8leg9_I", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Thieves rob two students on"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf81c\"", "article_summary": "UK police say they're reviewing campus surveillance video.\nAn armed robbery happened right in the heart of University of Kentucky's campus, across the street from the library and near several fraternity and sorority houses.\nThe other was wearing dark jeans, a black and white striped sweatshirt and a white or light pink polo-style ball cap.\n\"But overall, I think campus safety is pretty solid, and you know what, at the end of the day these things happen.\"\nThis robbery follows another that happened last week on East Maxwell, not far from campus."}
