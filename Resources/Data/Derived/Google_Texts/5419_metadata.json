Abrams\u2019 \u201cStar Wars Episode VII\u201d basically broke the Internet earlier this week thanks to the sheer volume of news reports, Facebook shares, blog posts and Twitter reaction about the movie's change-of-date announcement. Not that fanboys need any excuse to completely and utterly freak out. But the \"Episode VII\" reschedule represents a significant pushback from Lucasfilm\u2019s April breaker that the franchise reboot\u2019s next installment would hit multiplexes \u201cSummer 2015.\u201d And of particular note to anyone capable of spelling Wookiee without the aid of a Holocron, it's the first time a \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie will reach screens in a month other than May.\n\nFor his part, Abrams blamed the delay on a \u201ctime frame\u201d issue with principal photography set to start in the first part of \u201914 in the U.K.\n\nNever mind Twitter king Bieber\u2019s alleged public outing as a Brazilian brothel habitu\u00e9. (Although this grainy video really is pretty fishy...) Making a different kind of IPO Sunday -- call it an interrupted public offering -- a trove of hundreds of previously unknown masterpieces by iconic artists including Otto Dix, Marc Chagall and Henri Matisse was uncovered in the Munich apartment of an elderly recluse. Many of the 1,400-some paintings were believed to have been confiscated by Nazis as part of a \"degenerate art\" purge during World War II.\n\nPHOTOS: Movie Sneaks 2013\n\nWhat made Hollywood sit up and take notice, however, was the dramatic convergence of life imitating art imitating life. The headlines skewed deliciously close to the log-line for George Clooney's historical drama \"The Monuments Men\" about a motley group of academics and historians entrusted during WWII to save thousands of art masterworks looted by the Third Reich. Robert Edsel, author of the book \"The Monuments Men,\" says the Munich find is just the tip of the iceberg and that he's talking to Sony, Fox and the filmmakers about another project.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Twitter IPO fever, 'Star Wars VII' delay, 'Monuments Men' stock rises", "date": "2013-11-09", "Description": "The Week That Was: Twitter's big IPO, Web frenzy on 'Star Wars VII' delay, Nazi art trove find mirrors Clooney's 'Monuments Men.'", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Big things really do come in small packages -- 140-character packages, to be exact.
