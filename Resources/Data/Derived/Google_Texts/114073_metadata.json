It\u2019s because proving that they offer coverage is so much work,\u201d Tracy Watts, Mercer\u2019s leader for health reform, said in a news release.\n\nThe deadline for reporting to the IRS about coverage in 2015 was extended from January to June, and at this point virtually none of the 644 survey respondents believe they will be liable for the \u201ca\u201d assessment \u2014 meaning they offered coverage to substantially all employees working 30 or more hours per week.\n\nOnly 8% of employers thought they might be at risk for the \u201cb\u201d penalty \u2014 meaning that some of their employees might qualify, and obtain, subsidized coverage on the exchange because their employer\u2019s plan did not offer affordable contributions or meet minimum plan value requirements.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that penalties are not going to amount to a huge source of revenue,\u201d said Beth Umland, Mercer\u2019s research director for health and benefits. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that employer penalties would raise $9 billion in revenue in 2016.\n\nBut when asked about the impact of the ACA on their organization, 20% of respondents said they have experienced higher cost and 29% reported making unwanted plan changes to avoid excise tax liability. At the same time, 84% said the additional administrative burden has had a significant impact \u2014 and 51% describe it as \u201cvery significant.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore than half of Americans already get their health insurance from their employer, and three out of four workers are satisfied with their health benefits,\u201d Watts said. \u201cUnder play or pay, employers have had to modify their plans, track worker hours, manage eligibility and report coverage to prove they are doing something they have been doing all along.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Half of the employers surveyed by Mercer say the additional administrative burden of showing ACA compliance has been \"very significant.\"", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Employers Feeling Pain of Obamacare Compliance\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2016\\/04\\/employers-feeling-pain-obamacare-compliance\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-04-13 13:21:46\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-04-14 09:07:38\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":488130,\"author_id\":\"583\",\"author_name\":\"Matthew Heller\",\"author_display_name\":\"Matthew Heller\",\"tags\":[\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Aggregation\",\"employer mandate\",\"excise tax\",\"Mercer\"],\"categories\":[\"Employee Benefits and Compensation\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Health Care\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\",\"Human Resources\"],\"image\":null}", "author": "Matthew Heller", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "Half of the employers surveyed by Mercer say the additional administrative burden of showing ACA compliance has been \"very significant.\"", "title": "Employers Feeling Pain of Obamacare Compliance", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2016-04-14T09:07:38+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2016/04/employers-feeling-pain-obamacare-compliance/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "Half of the employers surveyed by Mercer say the additional administrative burden of showing ACA compliance has been \"very significant.\"", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "Employers Feeling Pain of Obamacare Compliance", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "Employers Feeling Pain of Obamacare Compliance", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "date": 20160413, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Human Resources", "tag": "survey", "published_time": "2016-04-13T13:21:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T09:07:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, aggregation, employer mandate, excise tax, mercer, survey"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe18fa\"", "article_summary": "Half of the employers surveyed by Mercer say the additional administrative burden of proving compliance has been \"very significant.\"\nMore than two-thirds of employers favor repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate, citing the cost and administrative burden of showing they are in compliance, according to a new survey.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because they don\u2019t want to offer coverage.\nIt\u2019s because proving that they offer coverage is so much work,\u201d Tracy Watts, Mercer\u2019s leader for health reform, said in a news release.\n\u201cThis suggests that penalties are not going to amount to a huge source of revenue,\u201d said Beth Umland, Mercer\u2019s research director for health and benefits."}
