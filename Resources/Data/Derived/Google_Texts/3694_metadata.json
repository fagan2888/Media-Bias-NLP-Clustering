But for anyone who seriously believes (to cite New York Times columnist David Brooks\u2019 example) that allowing an evangelical wedding-cake baker to refuse to bake for a same-sex couple will strengthen evangelical Christianity, the lesson from America\u2019s Constitutional history of religious freedom is this: be careful what you wish for. They might just weaken religion instead.\n\nIn 1783, James Madison was back in Virginia from a three-year term in Congress, and serving as a delegate in the General Assembly. Then, as now, Christian churches were worried they were under threat, with their numbers dropping dramatically during the Revolutionary War.\n\nVirginia\u2019s canny and opportunistic former governor, the Revolutionary hero Patrick Henry, saw a ripe political issue in the churches\u2019 collapse. He proposed a new tax that would fund Christian churches. Madison was appalled by the breach of the church-state wall, and resolved to fight. He jotted down an outline of attacks on the tax, which he delivered, first in a speech, then in a letter several months later.\n\nIn a sweeping series of assaults, he charged that states had fallen precisely where church and state were mixed. He challenged Henry\u2019s assumption that moral decay was caused by the collapse in religious institutions; \u201cwar and bad laws,\u201d he said, were instead at fault.\n\nHe declared that religion belonged to the realm of conscience, not government. Men, considering only the evidence \u201ccontemplated by their own minds,\u201d could not be forced to follow the dictates of other men. Religion therefore was unreachable by politics, by the state. In other words, the statecould not support religion, because religion\u2019s strength depends on men\u2019s minds, reason, and conscience.\n\nMadison\u2019s letter sparked a petition drive that ultimately generated over 10,000 signatures, swamping Henry\u2019s bill. Madison\u2019s speech against Patrick Henry\u2019s religious tax went on to become his Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments, perhaps the Western world\u2019s most famous declaration of the doctrine of the separation of church and state.\n\nHis approach to true religious freedom went back to an instance of real religious intolerance, which today\u2019s supporters of religious freedom should look at for a contrast with their own political posturing.\n\nAs a recent college graduate back home in Virginia, the Father of our Constitution, James Madison, learned that a sect of Baptists had been imprisoned in nearby Culpeper for preaching without a license. Their captors were giving them only dry crusts of rye bread and water. One tormentor stood on a stool and urinated into the cell.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cCongress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d", "author": "Michael Signer", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\u201cCongress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d", "title": "David Brooks, wrong again: What \u201creligious freedom\u201d proponents don\u2019t understand about the Constitution", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/10/david_brooks_wrong_again_what_religious_freedom_proponents_dont_understand_about_the_constitution/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/david_brooks_stained_glass.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cCongress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/david_brooks_stained_glass.jpg", "title": "David Brooks, wrong again: What \u201creligious freedom\u201d proponents don\u2019t understand about the Constitution", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "David Brooks, wrong again: What \u201creligious freedom\u201d proponents don\u2019t understand about the Constitution", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, David Brooks, Indiana, Media Criticism, New York Times, Religious Freedom", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "His approach to true religious freedom went back to an instance of real religious intolerance, which today\u2019s supporters of religious freedom should look at for a contrast with their own political posturing.\nTopics: David Brooks, Indiana, Media Criticism, New York Times, Religious Freedom, News, Politics NewsThis week, proponents of today\u2019s \u201creligious freedom\u201d acts in Indiana and Arkansas seemed bewildered by the harsh national backlash against them.\nMadison\u2019s speech against Patrick Henry\u2019s religious tax went on to become his Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments, perhaps the Western world\u2019s most famous declaration of the doctrine of the separation of church and state.\nIn 1783, James Madison was back in Virginia from a three-year term in Congress, and serving as a delegate in the General Assembly.\nVirginia\u2019s canny and opportunistic former governor, the Revolutionary hero Patrick Henry, saw a ripe political issue in the churches\u2019 collapse."}
