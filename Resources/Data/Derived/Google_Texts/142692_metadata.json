The latest government figures show that during the third open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act coverage, which ended Sunday, 11.6 million people have signed up for or renewed a health plan through Jan. 23.\n\nThere are about three million people who now can't get government-funded insurance because their states haven't extended Medicaid eligibility, the WSJ notes. Yet that's still far fewer than the number of those who are eligible and choose not to sign up.\n\nAmong the biggest hurdles in getting people to sign up for Medicaid is the lack of knowledge surrounding their motivation for staying out of the system, according to the WSJ article. One possible reason, according to a pollster who has studied people's experiences with Medicaid, is that some may believe their situations are likely to improve and therefore aren't motivated to take action. As a solution, some states have experimented with making individuals eligible for long stretches of time, rather than continuously investing in reassessing their status.\n\nGovernment forecasters such as the Congressional Budget Office don't see the number of people who are unenrolled and Medicaid eligible changing much in the future, the article says. Still, expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act helped states streamline both the enrollment and renewal processes and increase administrative effectiveness , FierceHealthPayer has reported.\n\nThere were 71 million people signed up for Medicaid as of September 2015, the WSJ article says. Since the ACA took effect in the fall 2013, Medicaid has gained 13 million enrollees.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here is the Wall Street Journal article\n\n- here's the latest ACA enrollment figures\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nCMS launches effort to get children covered through Medicaid, CHIP\n\nAffordable Care Act improves Medicaid efficiency, enrollment\n\nReport: ACA has made Medicaid coordination, re-enrollment much smoother", "article_metadata": {"description": "As many as six million Americans are eligible to get nearly free healthcare through Medicaid but don't sign up, according to an article from the\u00a0Wall Street Journal.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "As many as six million Americans are eligible to get nearly free healthcare through Medicaid but don't sign up, according to an article from the\u00a0Wall Street Journal.", "title": "6 million Americans qualify for Medicaid but don't sign up", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/6-million-americans-qualify-medicaid-dont-sign/2016-02-01", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act ACA,Care Delivery,CMS,enrollment,Federal Marketplace,Marketing & Consumer Engagement,Medicaid,Medicare,CHIP", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Marketing & Consumer Engagement,Medicare,Medicaid,CHIP"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33ee\"", "article_summary": "As many as six million Americans are eligible to get nearly free health coverage through Medicaid but don't sign up, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nThere were 71 million people signed up for Medicaid as of September 2015, the WSJ article says.\nGovernment forecasters such as the Congressional Budget Office don't see the number of people who are unenrolled and Medicaid eligible changing much in the future, the article says.\nThere are about three million people who now can't get government-funded insurance because their states haven't extended Medicaid eligibility, the WSJ notes.\nSince the ACA took effect in the fall 2013, Medicaid has gained 13 million enrollees."}
