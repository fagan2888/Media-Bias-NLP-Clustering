This comes less than a week after a report from Bloomberg Intelligence found that the company, which has been \u201cworking to shed its \u2018Whole Paycheck\u2019 image, has become one of the cheaper chains for grocery shopping in Manhattan.\u201d\n\nRelated: Inequality Hits the Grocery Aisle\n\nThe two companies will pilot the in-store pickup option at some Austin and Boston stores in the next month, while Instacart will deliver from Whole Foods Market in all of the 15 cities it currently serves in the coming months.\n\nSome experts say Whole Foods is simply trying to play catch up.\n\nLarger players like Walmart have been delivering groceries online far longer; Amazon has been hammering consumers with ads pushing its Prime Pantry, which launched at the beginning of the year. Prime Pantry allows its Prime subscribers to shop online for popular household essentials and have them delivered to their door.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big ho-hum,\u201d Phil Lempert, editor of SupermarketGuru.com, told The Fiscal Times. \u201cOthers are doing it and it\u2019s a must have for Whole Foods but it won\u2019t help them significantly. It\u2019s just in 15 cities.\u201d\n\nSupermarkets such as ShopRite and Safeway as well as online exclusive grocers like Peapod and Fresh Direct are also pushing to extend their market share in the online grocery delivery marketplace.\n\nAccording to Lempert, Google Shopping Express, which has collaborated with several retailers including Costco, and car-sharing service company Uber (which recently announced it is collaborating with any store selling food to offer same-day delivery) are the ones to watch closely. He noted that one of their main advantages is that they are in the transportation business.\n\nRelated: Sneaky Ways Food Companies Make You Eat Price Increases\n\nWith its new offering, Whole Foods customers will be able to order at Instacart.com or via the Instacart mobile app by selecting their zip code, adding items to a virtual cart, and then choosing a delivery window. Instacart Personal Shoppers will confirm incoming orders on their smartphones, shop for the items at Whole Foods Market stores, and then deliver orders to customers in the designated delivery timeframe.\n\n\u201cWhole Foods Market is our most requested shopping destination, and we\u2019re happy to be working together to create a seamless, quick option for customers with busy lifestyles,\u201d Apoorva Mehta, CEO and founder of Instacart, said in a press release.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Competition has reached a whole new level among supermarkets as the industry is taking the battle to online grocery delivery.", "title": "Whole Foods Takes on Amazon and Walmart Online", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/09/Whole-Foods-Takes-Amazon-and-Walmart-Online", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05182010_WholeFoods_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/09/Whole-Foods-Takes-Amazon-and-Walmart-Online", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05182010_WholeFoods_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Competition has reached a whole new level among supermarkets as the industry is taking the battle to online grocery delivery.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdedda\"", "article_summary": "Competition among supermarkets has gone well beyond Wednesday\u2019s specials and reached a whole new level as the industry takes the battle to online grocery delivery.\nWhole Foods Markets announced Monday that it has partnered with Instacart to deliver groceries in as little as an hour.\nIt\u2019s just in 15 cities.\u201dSupermarkets such as ShopRite and Safeway as well as online exclusive grocers like Peapod and Fresh Direct are also pushing to extend their market share in the online grocery delivery marketplace.\nPrime Pantry allows its Prime subscribers to shop online for popular household essentials and have them delivered to their door.\nLarger players like Walmart have been delivering groceries online far longer; Amazon has been hammering consumers with ads pushing its Prime Pantry, which launched at the beginning of the year."}
