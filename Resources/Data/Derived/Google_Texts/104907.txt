Today, President Obama will take part in a town hall at the Newseum in Washington, DC to discuss the Affordable Care Act and how the law benefits the Latino community. The town hall is hosted by Univision, Telemundo, impreMedia and the California Endowment.

The town hall, which will be televised and livestreamed in both English and Spanish, will provide an opportunity for Latinos across the country to learn more about how to enroll in affordable, quality health care via the Health Insurance Marketplace.

You can join the conversation and submit questions on Twitter and Facebook using the hashtag #TuSaludyObama and #Asegurate.
