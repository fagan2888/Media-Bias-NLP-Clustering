And this week saw the party\u2019s free fall accelerate as it saw its ever so-slight advantage in the House become even less stable.\n\nGet used to it. There are no signs it\u2019s going to stop any time soon.\n\nTwo more Democratic incumbents announced they were leaving the state House; their best, albeit slim, hope of winning the state\u2019s open 1st Congressional district said he wasn\u2019t running; and a source says that several top recruits for open state house seats decided that now is not the right time for them.\n\nEven in Louisville, one of the few remaining Democratic strongholds, disarray and backbiting in the Louisville Metro Council\u2019s Democratic caucus may open to a Republican council president \u2013 or at the very least, allow the GOP to decide which Democrat wins.\n\nIn some ways, it\u2019s hard to imagine that has taken this long.\n\nThe southern United States has been solidly Republican for a long time and Kentucky\u2019s House is the only legislative body in what was once known as the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cSolid South\u201d to remain Democratic.\n\nThe state\u2019s not had a Democratic U.S. senator since 1998, has had a Republican majority in its congressional delegation for two decades and a GOP majority in the state Senate for 15 years.\n\nFor the second straight week, Bevin outfoxed the House Democrats by plucking one of their members from a swing district to give them a lucrative job opening up the possibility of flipping a seat during a special session later this legislative session.\n\nFirst it was state Rep. John Tilley, of Hopkinsville, who Bevin chose to appoint his new justice secretary. Last week, it was Tanya Pullin, of South Shore, who was appointed as an administrative law judge. (Those appointments, of course, followed state Rep. Denny Butler\u2019s decision to become a Republican.)\n\nJust a few weeks ago, the Democrats had a 54-46 advantage in the state House. When the General Assembly convenes on Jan. 5, their advantage will be down to 51-45 after Republicans Ryan Quarles and Mike Harmon resign to take state offices.\n\nIf the GOP can sweep all the special elections \u2013 which is a possibility especially since the Democrats no longer hold any of the powerful offices in the state that can serve as a platform from which to raise money \u2013 one has to wonder if the Democrats will hold a majority in the state House when the legislature ends in April.\n\nAre there more appointments to come? Can frightened Democrats in districts that voted Republican in last month\u2019s election be induced to switch parties?\n\nAnd even if the Democrats can stop the bleeding long enough to finish the legislative session with a majority they have held since 1921, next fall becomes even more perilous. Last week, Democratic state Rep. Mike Denham, of Maysville, announced that he will not seek another term in the Ohio River district that Democrats believe will be difficult to hold.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear if Butler will be able to hold his district, which voted for Barack Obama twice, in next year\u2019s election. But they\u2019ve got a good start on it, with Bevin headlining a fundraising for him on Dec. 18.\n\nBut with the fundraising advantage they should have, with U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell helping to raise funds for GOP candidates, Democrats might want to look away from the carnage that could come next November.\n\nAnd we didn\u2019t even get a chance to talk about Democratic state Sen. Dorsey Ridley\u2019s decision not to seek the seat of retiring U.S. Rep. Ed Whitfield. We\u2019ll have plenty of time to discuss that later.\n\nJoseph Gerth can be reached at 502-582-4702 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.
