He said he wanted to create an opportunity to do good and hoped to be able to do something even bigger in the future.\n\n\"When somebody gets a transfusion, they need that blood and it saves their life,\u201d Vickers said. \u201cWell when you donate to Goodwill or you purchase in our stores, you're changing someone's life. So the idea came to me that you could save a life and change a life, all in the same operation.\"\n\nEach person who donated also got a wellness check on their blood pressure, iron level and cholesterol. All of the blood collected on Saturday will go to local hospitals.\n\n\u201cI mean I wouldn't expect everybody to jump at the chance to be stuck with a needle,\u201d Eric Lewis, blood donation specialist on the bus, said. \u201cBut the benefits outweigh the risks.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very painless, easy and relaxing,\u201d David said. \u201cAnd it makes you feel really good.\u201d\n\nAccording to one of the donor specialists, all of the blood collected on Saturday is so valuable it will most likely be in a new patient by Tuesday or Wednesday of the following week.\n\nAnyone who would like more information on where to find a blood donation bus can visit: http://www.oneblood.org/\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Only about 5 percent of the general population donates blood, but good planning and Goodwill want to change that.
