Paul Ryan was remarkable for its civility while highlighting a clash of political philosophies.\n\nRyan called for \u201ccollaboration to make a better life, not a government-centered vision based on coercion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn't matter who you are or where you come from; you can make it in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nZerban argued that Ryan's budget proposals would cut spending so much that government would be less able to address problems such as Ebola and would push women, children and senior citizens \u201cout in the cold, hungry and without shelter.\u201d\n\nZerban said government debt can be conquered by ending billions of dollars of corporate handouts to industries such as oil and gas.\n\nRyan, the Republican incumbent from Janesville, and Zerban, the Democrat from Kenosha, debated before a nearly full house Monday night at UW-Rock County.\n\nTim Bremel of \u201cYour Talk Show\u201d on WCLO Radio moderated the debate and asked all the questions.\n\nThe crowd of more than 200 heeded Bremel's admonition to hold applause until the end. There were no interruptions.\n\n\u201cWe are living under the majority party's policies, and I think those policies are producing horrible results,\u201d Ryan said.\n\n\u201cYou can just think about Ebola, or you can think about the website crashing on Obamacare, or you can look at the fact that we have 92 and a half million Americans, able-bodied adults, who aren't working \u2026\n\n\u201cThe problem is when you make government so big, when you have no limiting principle, government does everything poorly,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nThe candidates were polite, if sometimes pointed, in their remarks.\n\nPeople are tired of government not getting the job done, of dysfunction and of partisanship, Zerban said.\n\n\u201cI would argue that Congressman Ryan has been very partisan in his time in D.C. and has been part of the problem,\u201d Zerban said.\n\n\u201cI think the Democrats have been better leaders in this respect,\u201d Zerban said, citing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) as \u201csome of the most groundbreaking legislation we've passed in the past four years, \u2026 comprehensively addressing the health-care crisis that's going on in this nation.\n\nZerban said he would prefer a single-payer system in which every American was covered by Medicare, much in the way many European countries handle health care, at half the price of the U.S. system.\n\nThe debate format the candidates agreed to did not allow for rebuttals, but Ryan took time from his response on international crises to challenge Zerban on health care: \u201cGovernment can't even run a website. Imagine what it would be like if we put them in charge of our health care.\u201d\n\nRyan said he has gotten better in his job of serving constituents since he was first elected in 1998 and pointed to his work in finding solutions\u2014not just criticizing\u2014when it comes to problems of government debt and the solvency of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nZerban called Ryan \u201ca career politician\u201d and pointed to his own record of creating two businesses that he said employed dozens of people and gave him the problem-solving approach that is needed in Washington, D.C.\n\nRyan repeated his stance on allowing people to invest part of their contributions to Social Security so they would have more for retirement, which federal employees have.\n\nZerban said that approach would mean people losing their money and sinking into poverty at times such as the Great Recession.\n\nThe candidates agreed that poverty is a big problem while the rich are raking in profits in the stock market.\n\nRyan called for lower tax rates to help manufacturers so they can hire more people, more sensible regulations and a tax code \u201cthat is fair and simple and stops picking winners and losers\u201d among other solutions.\n\n\u201cWe should be springing out of this recession. This is the worst economic recovery since World War II,\u201d Ryan said, adding he thinks government is to blame.\n\nZerban said the country should add jobs by investing in infrastructure with public and private funds and should raise the minimum wage.\n\nTrade deals should ensure that other countries have fair labor standards, good pay and measure up to environmental standards, Zerban said.\n\n\u201cI'm convinced that if you put the American worker on a level playing field, we'll win every time,\u201d he said.\n\nOn immigration, Zerban faulted Ryan and the other House Republicans for not supporting a bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate.\n\nIf the bill had included profits for somebody, the Republicans would have passed it, Zerban said.\n\n\u201cWe want an immigration system \u2026 in this 21st century in which we have a society in which we have viruses and heroin coming into our schools right here in Janesville\u2014drugs, crime\u2014we want to be able to control our borders\u2014ISIS,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nThe country needs a system in which the economy gets the workers it needs, Ryan added.\n\nAnswering a question about student debt, Zerban noted his wife got a free college education in her native country.\n\n'If a country that is a third the size of the United States' GDP (gross domestic product) can provide an education through college, we can do it here, too, and I think we need to,\u201d Zerban said.\n\nRyan blamed the federal government for \u201cfacilitating tuition inflation\u201d by doubling funding for higher education in the past 10 years.\n\nRyan called for consolidating myriad job-training programs and more transparency about the kinds of jobs students can get coming out of their college programs.\n\nThe event was the candidates' second and final debate before the Nov. 4 election. They previously faced off at Carthage College in Kenosha on Oct. 13.\n\nLast updated: 4:28 pm Monday, October 20, 2014", "article_metadata": {"Description": "1st Congressional District candidates Paul Ryan and Rob Zerban debated in their second and final meeting before the Nov. 4 elections.", "author": "Gazette staff", "og": {"image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.gazettextra.com/storyimage/JG/20141020/ARTICLES/141029974/EP/1/4/EP-141029974.jpg", "height": 756}, "type": "article", "description": "1st Congressional District candidates Paul Ryan and Rob Zerban debated in their second and final meeting before the Nov. 4 elections.", "title": "Ryan, Zerban deliver polite, pointed remarks in Janesville debate"}, "twitter": {"description": "1st Congressional District candidates Paul Ryan and Rob Zerban debated in their second and final meeting before the Nov. 4 elections.", "title": "Ryan, Zerban deliver polite, pointed remarks in Janesville debate", "url": "http://www.gazettextra.com/20141020/ryan_zerban_deliver_polite_pointed_remarks_in_janesville_debate", "image": "http://www.gazettextra.com/storyimage/JG/20141020/ARTICLES/141029974/EP/1/1/EP-141029974.jpg", "site": "@gazettextra", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 184800176}, "article": {"published_time": 201410200001}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "SPECIAL SECTION 2014 FALL ELECTIONRyan, Zerban deliver polite, pointed remarks in Janesville debateBill Olmsted Rep.
