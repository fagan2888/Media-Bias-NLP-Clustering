Under federal law that makes them independent contractors.\u201d\n\nUber has appealed the ruling, hoping to win against California as it has in five other states that attempted to reclassify the company\u2019s drivers as employees. But California state law explicitly states employers must reimburse employees for businesses-related expenses, setting it apart from previous lawsuits.\n\nIf Uber loses its appeal, the company would be required to pay its drivers minimum wage and overtime, along with mandated employee benefits. Uber would also be required to strictly control its drivers\u2019 schedules, upending the flexibility the company has used to attract employees.\n\n\u201cIt destroys Uber\u2019s business model,\u201d Sherk said. \u201cI would expect them to leave California rather than comply.\u201d\n\nHe said the reclassification would \u201cmassively\u201d increase the cost to Uber. It could also transform the entire sharing economy, which brings together freelance workers who provide a product, such as a ride, to customers through a digital platform. Airbnb, Lyft and GrubHub are all part of this growing sector.\n\nRegulation such as California\u2019s would affect an estimated 2 million to 3 million people who work for companies in the sharing economy, according to the LA Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since its inception, Uber, has baffled government agencies grappling with ways to regulate one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest startups.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Since its inception, Uber, has baffled government agencies grappling with ways to regulate one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest startups.", "title": "California Regulation Could \u2018Destroy\u2019 Uber\u2019s Business Model", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150619_Uber_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-19T18:22:10+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QH69Oq"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Since its inception, Uber, has baffled government agencies grappling with ways to regulate one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest startups.", "title": "California Regulation Could \u2018Destroy\u2019 Uber\u2019s Business Model", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150619_Uber_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "regulation", "published_time": "2015-06-19T17:21:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-19T18:22:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Uber, Lyft, California Labor Commissioner\u2019s Office, Airbnb"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0eef\"", "article_summary": "\u201cUber drivers use their own vehicles, set their own hours and are free to work for competitors like Lyft at the same time.\nThough the ruling applied to a single driver for the ride-sharing service, the reclassification lays the groundwork for greater regulation.\n\u201cThis ruling\u2014if it stands\u2014could force Uber out of California,\u201d said James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation.\nBut California state law explicitly states employers must reimburse employees for businesses-related expenses, setting it apart from previous lawsuits.\n\u201cI would expect them to leave California rather than comply.\u201dHe said the reclassification would \u201cmassively\u201d increase the cost to Uber."}
