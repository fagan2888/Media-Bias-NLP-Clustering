Would the Secret Service allow it?\n\nPerspective: kid visits White House, w/ that clock? OVER. Why's a school's safety less imp than Obama's? Cuz he liked the story. \u2014 GregGutfeld (@greggutfeld) September 19, 2015\n\nWell, we don\u2019t know the answer to that question, but check out what the Secret Service did have a problem with Saturday night: kids with cancer and their parents who were holding a candlelight vigil \u2014 with permits! \u2014 a little too close to the White House:\n\nSecret Service kicked cancer-stricken kids and their parents out of a park near the White House http://t.co/PS22q5qTe0 \u2014 Washington Post (@washingtonpost) September 20, 2015\n\nParents told the Washington Post that they were kicked out because the president used a different door to exit the White House earlier in the evening:\n\nPolice officers and agents on the scenes told some parents that the closure was necessary because President Obama had left the White House from an entrance near the square to address the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation\u2019s annual gala. \u201cAt first, we were patient. I mean we\u2019re a peaceful community; we\u2019re fighting for kids\u2019 lives,\u201d said Anthony Stoddard, a New Hampshire resident who, after the death of his 5-year-old son, launched an initiative to light public buildings in gold as a show of support for children who have cancer. \u201cBut after about an hour, or hour and a half, it started getting a little angry, some of the fathers.\u201d\n\nHow awful.\n\nExit question: If President Obama felt the need to offer a White House trip to a kid who caused a security scare with a badly made clock, what will he offer these kids?\n\n***\n\nRelated:\n\nMeet the 14-year-old kid in Texas arrested for bringing a homemade clock to school #IStandWithAhmed\n\nPeak #IStandWithAhmed?
