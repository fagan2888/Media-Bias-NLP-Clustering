He waved a tiny-syrup smeared arm in my direction.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a flirt,\u201d his mother said apologetically.\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d cooed my own mother, who can befriend anything that will stand still long enough. \u201cHiiiiii.\u201d She kicked me under the table.\n\n\u201cOh\u2014hi,\u201d I said. I waved back. But men are fickle creatures, and our neighbor only frowned, turned around and sat back down to his food.\n\nThe point of the story is not to say that a toddler was unimpressed by my flirtation skills, though I can\u2019t say I haven\u2019t considered the worrisome implications of this fact. No, the point of the story is that talking to small children is hard. In my younger years, I went through phases of shying away from adults who tried to engage me in conversation. Now, the feeling has inverted: As an adult, I am anxious and tongue-tied when speaking to little kids.\n\nThat could be bad news for my future offspring. Research has repeatedly touted the benefits of exposing children to language from an early age, but a new study published in the journal Infancy got more specific, finding that verbally engaging with babies\u2014listening to their gurgles and coos and then responding, conversation-style\u2014may speed up their language development more than simply talking at them or around them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research suggests it\u2019s how parents talk to their infants, not just how often, that makes a difference for language development.", "author": "Cari Romm", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "New research suggests it\u2019s how parents talk to their infants, not just how often, that makes a difference for language development.", "title": "Pretending to Understand What Babies Say Can Make Them Smarter", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/08/6013732659_815c09df6c_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/pretending-to-understand-what-babies-say-can-make-them-smarter/379324/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "No, the point of the story is that talking to small children is hard.\nThe point of the story is not to say that a toddler was unimpressed by my flirtation skills, though I can\u2019t say I haven\u2019t considered the worrisome implications of this fact.\nIn my younger years, I went through phases of shying away from adults who tried to engage me in conversation.\nBut men are fickle creatures, and our neighbor only frowned, turned around and sat back down to his food.\nSomewhere in the ballpark of a year old, the boy said something unintelligible\u2014maybe baby babbling, maybe real words muffled by pancake\u2014and gave a high-pitched giggle."}
