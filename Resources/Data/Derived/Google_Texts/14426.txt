Fort Thompson, SD

Residents of the Crow Creek Reservation say one man has died as a result of straight-line winds that tore through the region Friday night.



Family says 61-year-old Wilfred Wind Sr., was sleeping on his couch when strong winds toppled his trailer home.



Several other homes in the area were destroyed and power was knocked out for many.



Acting Lower Brule Chairman Kevin Wright says their community sustained considerable damage, too. Wright says the roof of the courthouse and several other buildings were severely damaged.



The Red Cross has set up an emergency shelter in Fort Thompson for residents from both the Crow Creek and Lower Brule reservations.
