(Photo: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Affordable Care Act promised to cut Medicare\u2019s costs by encouraging doctors to coordinate care \u2014 and thus eliminate waste and duplication. So far, it\u2019s backfiring.\n\nThe White House claimed that its first efforts to get doctors to coordinate care \u2014 the Shared Savings Program and Pioneer Accountable Care Organizations \u2014 saved Medicare $411 million in 2014. The administration ignored that it spent more than that on bonuses for the providers who participated. All told, the program actually recorded a net loss of $2.6 million.\n\nYet the administration is still pushing this scheme. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services just announced the participants of a \u201cnew and improved\u201d version \u2014 so-called Next Generation ACOs. But ACOs are an expensive failure, and it\u2019s naive to expect that result to change.\n\nAccountable Care Organizations are coordinated networks of hospitals, doctors and other health care providers that agree to take a fixed amount of money per patient they treat, rather than billing Medicare for each procedure they perform.\n\nThey\u2019re responsible for making sure that those funds go far enough to meet their patients\u2019 needs. ACOs receive bonuses if they stay under budget \u2014 and pay penalties if they go over.\n\nObama hoped this framework for Medicare would reduce costs and improve care. But ACOs failed immediately.\n\nThe Pioneer Program was supposed to include some of America\u2019s best health systems, like the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic and the Geisinger Health System. But these networks took one look at the program\u2019s nearly 700 pages of regulation and declined.\n\nThe White House cajoled 32 other provider organizations into signing up. The administration carefully screened them, deeming them the most likely to make the accountable-care model work.\n\nFour years later, about half have dropped out of the program. Among them was New Hampshire\u2019s Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, a nationally ranked hospital, which lost $3.7 million over two years trying to make the ACO model work.\n\nThe problem is not that Dartmouth-Hitchcock, or the other ACO dropouts, were providing poor care. In fact, Dartmouth-Hitchcock scored highly on the Pioneer Program\u2019s quality measures.\n\nUnder the ACO model, providing high quality care isn\u2019t what counts. What matters most is cutting costs.\n\nSo Dartmouth-Hitchcock can score above-average on patient care, but still have to pay government fines in the millions for exceeding its per-patient funding.\n\nAnother former Pioneer ACO, Franciscan Alliance in Indiana, scored above average in patient health and still got fined $2.5 million.\n\nBy contrast, other ACOs scored lower on patient care, but still won bonuses for meeting the program\u2019s financial benchmarks. Michigan Pioneer, for example, received a lower quality score than Dartmouth-Hitchcock in 2014 but still received $10 million from the government. That\u2019s the opposite of what it should be.\n\nWorse, Dartmouth-Hitchcock provided excellent care while saving money \u2014 the supposed goals of the ACO pilot. Its chief health management officer estimated that the hospital saved almost 4 percent from the previous year. But that wasn\u2019t enough to meet the government\u2019s ever-ratcheting demands for cost cutting.\n\nNext Generation ACOs are the government\u2019s response to the impossible situation it has foisted upon many of its pioneers.\n\nUnder the new program, financial targets will eventually transition away from being based on a health system\u2019s historic expenditures. In addition, ACOs will not be expected to cut costs as drastically year after year. The government will also take a hospital\u2019s efficiency relative to its patient population into account.\n\nThese tweaks are just that \u2014 tweaks. They fail to address the fundamental problem with the ACO model \u2014 that it puts cost-cutting above patient care.\n\nIndeed, Dartmouth-Hitchcock just declined to participate in the Next Generation program. As the health network\u2019s executive vice president explained, Dartmouth-Hitchcock could suffer \u201ca multi-million dollar loss next year\u201d under the new model.\n\nGiven the many failures of the ACO model over the past four years, the administration would be foolish to rerun this experiment. Unfortunately for patients, that\u2019s just what it\u2019s doing.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1X9HNfK", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Accountable Care Organizations were meant to reduce costs and improve care, but the experiment isn\u2019t working", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Accountable Care Organizations were meant to reduce costs and improve care, but the experiment isn\u2019t working", "title": "Health laws\u2019 cost-cutting and patient care priorities", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/2016/02/05/health-law-cost-cutting-patient-care-priorities/79913122/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Accountable Care Organizations were meant to reduce costs and improve care, but the experiment isn\u2019t working", "title": "Health laws\u2019 cost-cutting and patient care priorities", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e155c714d63fec3729af58d8f13e08fabe486239/c=748-0-3751-3003&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/05/DetroitNews/B99354708Z.1_20160205230207_000_GBEPT9GS.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "health care reform, affordable care act, Medicare"}, "article_summary": "They fail to address the fundamental problem with the ACO model \u2014 that it puts cost-cutting above patient care.\nAnother former Pioneer ACO, Franciscan Alliance in Indiana, scored above average in patient health and still got fined $2.5 million.\nBy contrast, other ACOs scored lower on patient care, but still won bonuses for meeting the program\u2019s financial benchmarks.\nSo Dartmouth-Hitchcock can score above-average on patient care, but still have to pay government fines in the millions for exceeding its per-patient funding.\nThe Pioneer Program was supposed to include some of America\u2019s best health systems, like the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic and the Geisinger Health System."}
