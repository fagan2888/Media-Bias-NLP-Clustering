CLEARFIELD - An area hospital announces plans to eliminate 41 jobs. On Thursday, Penn Highlands Clearfield, outlined plans to layoff 30 employees in clinical, support, and management positions. Eleven open positions will not be filled, and 50 other workers will have their hours cut.



Penn Highlands says the former Clearfield Hospital lost $4.7 million dollars and had a 21% drop in admissions in the last fiscal year. In addition, admissions have dropped by more than half since 2008. It blames the job reductions on the decrease in patients, shorter hospital stays, lower reimbursements, and the effects of the Affordable Care Act.
