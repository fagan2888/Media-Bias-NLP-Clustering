Health care analysts say PreferredOne\u2019s departure stands out as one of the biggest provider failures among state health insurance exchanges to date.\n\n\u201cThe thing that makes this more newsworthy than normal, I suppose, is that they were the lowest price in the country and they couldn\u2019t make it go,\u201d said Stephen Parente, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Medical Leadership Institute. \u201cThey made a bet probably, I think, to get market share. A lot of folks, myself included, thought that\u2019s pretty bold, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nAdministrative MNsure glitches that led to unwarranted coverage of enrollees in other states, along with higher than anticipated costs, drove what a spokesman told KSTP-TV was strictly a \u201cbusiness decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur MNsure individual product membership is only a small percentage of the entire PreferredOne enrollment but is taking a significant amount of our resources to support administratively,\u201d the company added in a statement. PreferredOne did not respond to repeated inquiries from Watchdog.org.\n\nAt a quickly assembled press conference Tuesday, state health exchange officials declined to address the reasons behind the loss of MNsure\u2019s biggest provider.\n\n\u201cYou ought to talk to PreferredOne to find out what was behind their decision, but certainly it\u2019s a business decision for them and encompasses more than just the administrative,\u201d said Brian Beutner, MNsure board chairman, at a press conference.\n\nAt the same time, MNsure executives sought to portray the development as evidence that competition between providers on the exchange works.\n\n\u201cThis indicates to us that the work we\u2019re continuing to do in terms of providing a competitive marketplace is working and that we\u2019re going to have a robust set of plan offerings in the fall and that we\u2019re going to continue to be collaborative partners with the health plans,\u201d said MNsure CEO Scott Leitz.\n\nThe decision to bow out marks a dramatic retreat from PreferredOne\u2019s upbeat posture of a year ago, heading into MNsure\u2019s October 2013 roll-out.\n\nA small company with only 3 percent of Minnesota\u2019s individual health insurance market in 2012, PreferredOne gambled big on the Affordable Care Act mandate.\n\n\u201cWe believe that our excellent networks, flexible coverage options and lowest-cost premiums will make PreferredOne a great choice for Minnesotans who are shopping for a new plan,\u201d a September 2013 news release stated.\n\nBy August, PreferredOne controlled more than twice as many customers as its closest competitor, Blue Cross Blue Shield. Kaiser Health News credited PreferredOne with offering some of the lowest-cost policies among state exchanges, leading to \u201ca noticeable effect on the competitive landscape in the state.\u201d\n\nBut with open enrollment for MNsure\u2019s second year looming in November, the Golden Valley company called it quits.\n\nMNsure aimed to reassure PreferredOne customers they will be eligible for coverage by another provider in 2015, hoping to avoid a repeat of an online backlog that hampered thousands attempting to sign up a year ago.\n\n\u201cBoth organizations understand that MNsure is still an evolving partnership,\u201d said MNsure\u2019s Leitz and PreferredOne\u2019s Merz in a statement. \u201c\u2026Consumers still have at least four, well-known, Minnesota based carriers who are committed to providing important health coverage to Minnesotans through MNsure, including people who qualify for tax credits and public programs.\u201d\n\nYet significant premium price hikes could be coming in October, just in time to become a front-burner issue in the waning weeks of the 2014 gubernatorial campaign.\n\n\u201cSix out of 10 people who\u2019ve purchased insurance through MNsure will now have to go through the nightmare process of purchasing another plan all over again-thanks to Mark Dayton,\u201d said GOP gubernatorial candidate Jeff Johnson in a statement.\n\nPolling shows Dayton may be most vulnerable over issues stemming from the $155 million online Obamacare state exchange, including bonuses to MNsure executives, the resignation of the former executive director following a trip to Costa Rica and technical glitches.\n\n\u201cThe question now is whether PreferredOne can afford to continue to offer such low rates. If not, its continued participation in MNsure would distort the Exchange\u2019s average rates, which last year were the lowest in the nation,\u201d said Dayton in a statement.\n\nAnother issue surfaced on Twitter, involving a discrepancy in the number of Minnesotans covered in MNsure private insurance plans. In an exchange with a reporter, MNsure officials appeared to lower the total by 15 percent, from 55,000 to 46,500 enrollees. It\u2019s not clear why 8,500 enrollees no longer participate in MNsure. Fewer enrollees could lead to higher administrative costs for taxpayers because fewer people will be paying into the system.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The prognosis for Minnesota\u2019s state health insurance exchange, MNsure, took a turn for the worse this week, as the provider offering some of the lowest premiums in the country opted out of the program, amid financial concerns.", "title": "Biggest MN provider ditches Obamacare state health exchange - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/MNsure-photo.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-07T15:23:50+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/171168/biggest-mn-provider-ditches-obamacare-state-health-exchange/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Jeff Johnson,Mark Dayton,MNsure,ObamaCare,PreferredOne,State Government", "published_time": "2014-09-17T10:17:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-07T15:23:50+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The prognosis for Minnesota\u2019s state health insurance exchange, MNsure, took a turn for the worse this week, as the provider offering some of the lowest premiums in the country opted out of the program, amid financial concerns.", "title": "Biggest MN provider ditches Obamacare state health exchange - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/MNsure-photo.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb64e\"", "article_summary": "Health care analysts say PreferredOne\u2019s departure stands out as one of the biggest provider failures among state health insurance exchanges to date.\nAt a quickly assembled press conference Tuesday, state health exchange officials declined to address the reasons behind the loss of MNsure\u2019s biggest provider.\nThe development leaves some 24,000 PreferredOne customers, 53 percent of MNsure\u2019s private insurance enrollees, scrambling to find another provider by Jan. 1.\nPreferredOne, the insurance company with MNsure\u2019s most private insurance enrollees and cheapest rates, pulled the plug on participation in the state exchange at the end of the year.\nA small company with only 3 percent of Minnesota\u2019s individual health insurance market in 2012, PreferredOne gambled big on the Affordable Care Act mandate."}
