This analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis helps to dissect why that may be happening.\n\nUsing recently-released disease-based health spending data compiled by the federal government, the analysis finds that the drivers of health spending growth shifted in the years following the Great Recession. The number of people treated for various diseases picked up, but that was offset early in the economic recovery by slower growth in the cost of treating those diseases (including prices).\n\nThree factors likely influenced the spending trends: the economic recovery, which led to more people seeking treatment; the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which expanded coverage of preventive care services, correlating with an uptick in the number of treated cases; and a phenomenon known as the \u201cpatent cliff,\u201d which held down drug prices, as patients substituted generics for brand-name versions of prescription drugs following the expiration of a large number of patents.\n\nThe analysis finds that use of preventive services increased sharply in 2011 and 2012, coinciding with the ACA requirement that most plans cover a variety of preventive services without cost-sharing.\n\nThe brief is part of the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker, an online information hub dedicated to monitoring and assessing the performance of the U.S. health system.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress.com", "application-name": "The Henry J.
