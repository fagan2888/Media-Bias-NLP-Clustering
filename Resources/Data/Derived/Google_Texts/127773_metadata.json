Andy Harris (R-Md.), a fierce critic of the exchange and the federal health-care law that led to it, said that federal auditors had issued subpoenas as part of their review.\n\n\u201cThe Office of Inspector General has moved this from an audit into a full-blown investigation,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNow we know that fraud may have occurred.\u201d\n\nDonald White, a spokesman for the HHS inspector general\u2019s office, would not discuss whether subpoenas had been issued or what such a move would mean, citing agency rules that prohibit public disclosure of investigations while they are underway.\n\nHarris spokesman Chris Meekins said members of the congressman\u2019s staff were told about the subpoenas by an official in the inspector general\u2019s office. He said he did not know the number of subpoenas, why they were issued or to whom.\n\nNoridian declined to say whether the request it received came in the form of a subpoena or give other details. Timothy J. Long, an attorney for subcontractor EngagePoint, said the firm could neither confirm nor deny receipt of a subpoena or other request for information from the inspector general\u2019s office. A spokesman for IBM, another subcontractor, did not respond to questions about possible subpoenas.\n\nHealth exchange spokesman Christopher Garrett said the agency has not received any subpoenas. State officials have been \u201cin close communication\u201d with the inspector general\u2019s office, Garrett said, and are \u201chelping in every way that we can.\u201d\n\nHarris called for a federal investigation of the exchange in February in response to significant problems that made it difficult for state residents to sign up for insurance under the new federal law. The state spent tens of millions of federal dollars on the system, which is being fixed at a cost of at least $40 million.\n\nIn March, Harris announced that the inspector general for Health and Human Services had agreed to perform an audit.\n\nHarris mentioned the subpoenas in a Tuesday morning interview on WBAL Radio\u2019s \u201cThe C4 Show\u201d after a question about how the audit was proceeding.\n\n\u201cWe understand that subpoenas have been issued,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there is the real possibility of legal proceedings and, you know, illegal activity having gone on.\u201d\n\nHarris, who represents Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore and is up for reelection in November, is the state\u2019s lone Republican in Congress. On the radio show, he said President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act was running up the cost of health insurance and not delivering as promised.\n\nLater in the day, Harris said the probe reflects poorly on Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown, who was tapped by Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley to oversee the implementation of health-care reform in the state and is the Democratic nominee to succeed O\u2019Malley.\n\n\u201cLt. Gov. Brown was in charge of the exchange,\u201d Harris said in the statement. \u201cThose who wasted and abused taxpayer money, including politicians, must be held accountable.\u201d\n\nA senior aide to Brown said the lieutenant governor\u2019s office was not subpoenaed. In the past, Brown has said that he was responsible for establishing a legislative framework for health-care reform but not for construction of the exchange Web site.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that Congressman Harris would mislead the people of Maryland and play political games with a federal investigation,\u201d Brown campaign manager Justin Schall said in a statement. \u201cNeither the Lt. Governor nor anyone in his office has received any communication or requests from the office of the Inspector General or any other federal agency.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "HHS inspector general\u2019s office will not say who was subpoenaed, or what it means for Maryland exchange.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "HHS inspector general\u2019s office will not say who was subpoenaed, or what it means for Maryland exchange.", "title": "Subpoenas issued in connection with federal probe of Maryland health insurance exchange, Harris says", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/us-rep-harris-subpoenas-issued-in-hhs-probe-of-maryland-health-exchange/2014/08/26/33651732-2d42-11e4-9b98-848790384093_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marypatflaherty"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "mdpolitics, Maryland poltics, md politics, martin omalley, Maryland health exchange, obamacare, affordable care act, aca, Maryland health insurance, andy harris, Joshua sharfstein, healthcare reform", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson"}, "eomportal-uuid": "33651732-2d42-11e4-9b98-848790384093", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "mdpolitics, Maryland poltics, md politics, martin omalley, Maryland health exchange, obamacare, affordable care act, aca, Maryland health insurance, andy harris, Joshua sharfstein, healthcare reform"}, "article_summary": "Long, an attorney for subcontractor EngagePoint, said the firm could neither confirm nor deny receipt of a subpoena or other request for information from the inspector general\u2019s office.\nHealth exchange spokesman Christopher Garrett said the agency has not received any subpoenas.\n), a fierce critic of the exchange and the federal health-care law that led to it, said that federal auditors had issued subpoenas as part of their review.\nHarris spokesman Chris Meekins said members of the congressman\u2019s staff were told about the subpoenas by an official in the inspector general\u2019s office.\n\u201cThe Office of Inspector General has moved this from an audit into a full-blown investigation,\u201d he said in a statement."}
