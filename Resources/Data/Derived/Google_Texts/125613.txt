LAS CRUCES - The state of the state's economy may be gloomy, but it's not doomed.

Forecasters, speaking at the annual economic outlook conference sponsored by Wells Fargo and New Mexico State University on Thursday, had little hope for New Mexico's sagging economy. New Mexico will continue to lag in recovery numbers compared to neighboring states, while the rate of recovery for the national economy holds steady.

NMSU economist Jim Peach said the state's employment and gross domestic product growth are lagging surrounding states. The labor market is suffering, oil and gas revenues have dropped, the state budget had to be severely trimmed due to lacking funds and the state is suffering from out-migration, a net loss of population needed to stimulate the economy.

The state is No. 1 in unemployment at 6.7 percent (nationally, the rate is 4.9 percent). And while the state managed to hold its own during early stages of recovery, that trend has dropped off.

"We've been trending in the wrong direction," Peach said. "New Mexico is still down 19,000 jobs from December '07."

However, despite a slowing recovery, Peach expects the state to fully recover by 2017 to 2018.

What's working?

Education and the health services industries are growing in New Mexico, due largely to the increase in Medicaid services and other benefits provided under the Affordable Care Act.

Leisure and hospitality, and tourism in general, continue to grow. The state's decreasing mineral production — oil and gas — is problematic. The state has gone from 101 active oil and gas drilling rigs in early 2015 to some 22 today, Peach said. The drop in rig numbers is significant because each rig takes 50 to 75 people to run plus the service industries (gas, restaurants, hotels) that serve the workers.

New Mexico's economy relies more on the federal government than most states. That gave the state a degree of stability during the Great Recession, but does not promise much increased spending to bolster regional growth.

Nationally, federal government spending accounts for roughly 15.4 percent of the economy. That number rises to roughly 23.2 percent in the state and 29.2 percent in Doña Ana County.

Slow and steady

The national economy is showing steady, if slow, signs of recovery from the Great Recession, said Eugenio J. Aleman, director and senor economist for Wells Fargo.

Strong growth in consumer spending and disposable income has led to to a "slow" growth rate of 0.7 percent in the last quarter of 2015. Aleman said he expects the rate to improve in the first quarter of 2016. Household disposable income has increased some 3.4 percent year over year, due largely to a decrease in gasoline prices, which frees up disposable income.

But the jobs gained nationally are not reflective of a fully engaged workforce, Aleman said.

"Baby Boomers are retiring in mass," Aleman said. "The most productive Americans are not ... coming in as productive" as previous generations in the workforce. "These kids have to be more productive."

Nationally, unemployment in January hit 4.9 percent, roughly what the government considers "full employment." However, the length of time those applying for unemployment benefits has grown longer, Aleman said.

Inflation has held relatively steady near 0 percent and is not expected to increase in coming months.

New home construction is slow, but existing home sales are increasing nationally, signaling a rebound. Home prices have stabilized and the median price in December nationally was roughly $226,000, Aleman said.

Manufacturing and construction, which comprise roughly 15 percent of of the U.S. economy, are holding their own, with the service sector expanding and credit card lending on the upswing.

Household debt has decreased to roughly 10 percent of household income as people try to pay down their debt with a cautionary eye toward the uncertain future.

"Confidence in the future is not good," Aleman said.

On the upside, household savings has increased to 5.5 percent of income in December 2015.

Aleman predicts a roughly 1.9 percent growth in the national economy this year. The silver lining, he said, is a 2.8 percent growth next year and no sign of a recession nationally.
