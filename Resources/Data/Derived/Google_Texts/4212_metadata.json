An IUD is a T-shaped plastic device inserted into the uterus that prevents pregnancy by releasing either copper or hormones.\n\nThe Shield\u2019s impact lingered for decades in the minds of physicians and the public alike \u2014 even as improved products hit the market \u2014 stunting the use of what countless doctors now say is the most effective reversible form of birth control out there.\n\nEven for Newman, medical director for women\u2019s services at St. Charles Health System, who now readily recommends IUDs to patients in their teens and older, it wasn\u2019t an easy shift to make. But as data accumulated showing newer models didn\u2019t carry the same risks as the old ones, she couldn\u2019t ignore it.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI came out with all this training, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it,\u2019 so yeah, it definitely took a shift to make that happen.\u201d\n\nNew data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention illustrate a sea change in the past decade toward more and more women choosing IUDs as their contraceptive method. They\u2019re now the third most popular form of birth control. Nearly 12 percent of women who used contraception in the U.S. between 2011 and 2013 chose long-acting, reversible contraceptives, a category comprised mostly of IUDs, but which also includes a form of contraceptive called implants, tiny, hormone-releasing rods inserted into the upper arm.\n\nIn 2002, only 2.4 percent of women used IUDs, according to an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to reproductive health issues.\n\nPills are still the most popular form of contraceptive, at 26 percent, according to the institute. Condoms are the second most popular, at 15 percent.\n\nAt first blush, it might seem as though the device\u2019s newfound affordability under the Affordable Care Act is behind its increased use. The Women\u2019s Preventive Services Guidelines require insurers to cover all forms of contraception without copays beginning Aug. 1, 2013. Now, a method that used to run roughly $1,000 for the device and insertion procedure (also included in the new law) is free for most women with insurance.\n\n\u201cIt really is a combination of good publicity, good research, the Affordable Care Act \u2014 I just think it\u2019s an interesting perfect storm at this point,\u201d said Dr. Alison Lynch-Miller, a Bend gynecologist, \u201cand I\u2019m thrilled, really, to see IUD use increasing.\u201d\n\nLingering concerns\n\nBut Megan Kavanaugh, senior research associate with the Guttmacher Institute, said the CDC data was only collected until spring 2013, which probably didn\u2019t allow much time for the ACA provision to effect IUD usage rates at that point. More recent research, however, has shown the provision has increased IUD use even more, she said.\n\nProvider awareness is the biggest factor Kavanaugh attributes to the nearly 10 percent increase in IUD use over a decade. Well-respected medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, are now recommending them for young women. That wasn\u2019t the case with IUDs in the past, she said.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t the first ones that came up, with the provider saying, \u2018These would be great methods for you,\u2019\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s gradually changing. We\u2019re seeing that in the clinical community, and I think that\u2019s trickled down into the patients themselves.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean everyone\u2019s convinced. A 2012 CDC survey found that 30 percent of providers perceived IUDs to be unsafe for women who had never given birth.\n\nThe fears about IUDs linger among physicians and patients alike, Lynch-Miller said.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s nothing like when I first started practice in \u201994,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could hardly talk to people about having IUDs.\u201d\n\nAll IUDs have strings that protrude from the cervix so they can be removed. The problem with older IUDs was their multifilament strings, which promoted pelvic infection, Lynch-Miller said. Today\u2019s monofilament models are less likely to do so, she said.\n\nThat said, today\u2019s IUDs still carry risks. In roughly one out of 1,000 cases, they\u2019ve been shown to perforate the uterus, a side effect that sometimes requires surgery.\n\nPerforation most commonly occurs while the IUD is being inserted, and the more experience a physician has, the less likely perforation will happen, said Dr. Lauren O\u2019Sullivan, a Bend gynecologist and surgeon who works in the same clinic as Lynch-Miller.\n\nPatients should \u201cabsolutely\u201d feel comfortable asking their physician how many IUDs he or she has inserted, as experience is critical, Newman said.\n\nMore commonly, IUDs can be pushed out of the uterus into the vagina. This doesn\u2019t typically cause injuries, but it does take away any protection against pregnancy. That happens in roughly 1 out of 100 cases.\n\nCopper IUDs also are known to increase menstrual bleeding, while the hormonal varieties decrease bleeding.\n\nA handful of Central Oregon gynecologists interviewed said those side effects are rare and are outweighed by the benefit of a highly effective form of birth control that women don\u2019t have to think about after it\u2019s inserted.\n\nMost research has found that less than 1 percent of women who use IUDs become pregnant. By comparison, roughly 9 percent of women who use pills become pregnant.\n\nAmong women who use the pills \u201cperfectly,\u201d meaning both consistently and correctly, the failure rate of birth control pills is 0.3 percent, according to a 2011 study in the journal Contraception. But \u201ctypical\u201d use results in 9 percent of women becoming pregnant, the study found.\n\n\u201cWomen have to be assiduously aware of what\u2019s going on with their pills and not to miss any,\u201d Newman said. \u201cThat is a big drawback.\u201d\n\nSome docs favor Mirena\n\nThere are three types of IUDs on the market today: Mirena, Skyla and ParaGard.\n\nThe former two work by releasing a low dose of levonorgestrel, a progestin hormone, into the uterus, which prevents pregnancy by inhibiting sperm movement, thinning the lining of the uterus and thickening cervical mucus.\n\nMirena, which protects against pregnancy for five years, was federally approved for use in 2000.\n\nSkyla, effective for three years, was approved in early 2013. It\u2019s marketed for younger women who haven\u2019t had children because it\u2019s smaller and releases a lower dose of levonorgestrel.\n\nParaGard\u2019s frame is wrapped in copper that continuously releases into the uterus, producing a reaction that\u2019s toxic to sperm. It\u2019s been on the market for about 30 years and is effective for up to a decade after it\u2019s inserted.\n\nDr. Susan Gorman, a gynecologist with the High Lakes Women\u2019s Center in Redmond, said Mirena is the ideal IUD because it reduces or eliminates periods, which is especially helpful for women who have heavy periods or spotting between cycles.\n\nHowever, some patients prefer to not have any hormones put into their bodies. For them, ParaGard is the preferred option, she said.\n\nO\u2019Sullivan said she uses Mirena 100 percent of the time because it reduces bleeding during periods, while ParaGard increases bleeding.\n\n\u201cI feel, from a woman\u2019s standpoint, that it\u2019s doing a disservice to increase their bleeding with their period,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no medical reason why they should have to have a heavier period.\u201d\n\nSkyla is designed for women with shorter uteruses, so whether it\u2019s the better choice isn\u2019t typically known until the day the IUD is placed, O\u2019Sullivan said.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute credits increased IUD use with fewer unintended pregnancies in the U.S., using data showing 13 percent fewer abortions between 2008 and 2011 and an even steeper decline in births.\n\nWomen today are typically becoming sexually active around age 18 and delaying birth until 25, Kavanaugh said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a long time frame within someone\u2019s life in which they need to prevent pregnancy,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s also the time frame in their life in which they\u2019re at highest risk for unintended pregnancy.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-383-0304, tbannow@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Dr. Barbara Newman attended medical school back in the late 1970s, her teachers trained her never to use a form of contraception called the intrauterine device, or IUD, on young women who had never had children.
