The police said she regularly slept in her car in between jobs, but this routine became fatal when she fell asleep with her car running. The carbon monoxide and gasoline fumes killed her.\n\nAt The Incidental Economist, Aaron Carroll highlighted similar sobering stories from a Time piece about men and women pleading with workers at an impound lot to cancel the fee to get their towed cars back. \u201cI\u2019m gonna lose my job if I\u2019m not there at 5,\u201d one woman said. Another said, \u201cI have to pick up my kids in less than an hour. What am I supposed to do?\u201d These impossible situations are a daily part of life for many Americans. Many more live in fear of them. As Carroll argues, the ability not to live in fear of them\u2014to easily afford to pay the fee to get your car back after it\u2019s been towed\u2014is what \u201cwealth\u201d really is. \u201cTo many Americans, a towed car is a nuisance,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA real one, yes, but in the scheme of things, no more than that. That\u2019s wealth. That\u2019s privilege.\u201d\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s New York Times, Abby Goodnough relays the story of Terri Hall, a woman from Kentucky whose addiction to alcohol and Xanax cost her a marriage. But thanks to the Medicaid expansion, she\u2019s finally receiving the mental health care she needs, albeit not frequently enough due to long waits for appointments. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt this way since I got my divorce,\u201d Hall said about her potential eviction. \u201cThen, I went back to Xanax, and I don\u2019t want to do that this time. I want to be able to handle this somehow.\u201d The mental health care available to her under Obamacare is helping her do so.\n\nIn Washington D.C., it\u2019s easy to forget these everyday Americans. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in wonky subjects, to pursue perfect solutions and to subjugate policy for politics. But Labor Day weekend is the perfect opportunity to think about those who sleep in their cars in between shifts or for whom a $25 co-pay is a back-breaking expense. For decades now, too many American workers have seen little, if any, improvement in their wages. Others lost their job after the financial crisis\u2014an event many had no part in creating\u2014and haven\u2019t recovered. We now know that the costs of unemployment extend far beyond just losing a job. For instance, a new Urban Institute paper released Thursday finds that unemployment creates family instability, particularly for single mothers without a high school degree.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A few dollars can make a big difference", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "A few dollars can make a big difference.", "title": "These Are the Stories of Daily Struggle in America", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/67ebd544f5047dffe44bad32458d2354ade60291.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/119266/over-labor-day-weekend-remember-many-americans-living-poverty", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/67ebd544f5047dffe44bad32458d2354ade60291.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "description": "A few dollars can make a big difference.", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "These Are the Stories of Daily Struggle in America"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/67ebd544f5047dffe44bad32458d2354ade60291.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"These Are the Stories of Daily Struggle in America\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/119266/over-labor-day-weekend-remember-many-americans-living-poverty\",\"section\":\"QEDaily\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-29T11:54:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":119266,\"author\":\"Danny Vinik\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"QEDaily\",\"QED\",\"Economics\",\"Poverty\",\"Wages\",\"Labor Day\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "QEDaily", "published_time": "2014-08-29"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe121f\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s wealth.\n\u201cTo many Americans, a towed car is a nuisance,\u201d he wrote.\nWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d These impossible situations are a daily part of life for many Americans.\nBut Labor Day weekend is the perfect opportunity to think about those who sleep in their cars in between shifts or for whom a $25 co-pay is a back-breaking expense.\nOthers lost their job after the financial crisis\u2014an event many had no part in creating\u2014and haven\u2019t recovered."}
