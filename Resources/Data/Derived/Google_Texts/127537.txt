(CNN) - Comedy Central's roasting of actor James Franco brought in over 3 million viewers for its inaugural broadcast. Franco's buddies Seth Rogen, Andy Samberg and Jonah Hill unleashed nasty and hilarious insults towards the thespian and each other.

But the real burns come from the "roastmaster general," comedian Jeffrey Ross.

"Franco comes from humble beginnings. Your first job was working at McDonald's. That's the last time someone ever said about your work, 'I'm loving it,'" Ross joked at Franco's roast.

Ross sat down with "The Lead" to talk about the art of roasting celebrities, his work with U.S. troops, and to roast – just a little – CNN's very own Jake Tapper.
