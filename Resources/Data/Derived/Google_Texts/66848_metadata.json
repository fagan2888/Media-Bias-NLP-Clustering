Can you help me edit it and then email it to Santa?\u201d\n\nSigh. The days of scrawled letters to Santa with crayons, smiley faces and Unabomber-like scribbles with serial numbers and price lists and naked greed mellowed by cute, backward s\u2019s are fading away.\n\nThe Christmas List has officially gone digital.\n\n\u201cMy son asked me to text Santa his list,\u201d one mom told me this week.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service, long flooded each Christmas with hundreds of thousands of grubby little letters addressed to \u201cSanta. North Pole\u201d is seeing fewer such letters every year. More popular are the email services with elves frantically clearing the inboxes and sending personalized responses.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau warned parents this month that many of those email services are actually run by the Grinch. Santa emails are the new Nigerian bank scam: The $19.99 will not get your kid a \u201cnice\u201d list certification and a personal letter from St. Nick. You may instead be scammed, have your identity stolen and fund some unsavory shopping spree by bad elves.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau tells parents to check out links, run web searches on company names and refuse deals that insist that the parents \u201cact now.\u201d Parents also should \u201cwatch for poor grammar and spelling. Scam emails and websites tend to have more typos.\u201d So, if it looks as if your kid could have written it, avoid it.\n\n\u201cThe directive would be for children to stand beside Santa, unless parents or children request to sit on his knee. Shopping centers have duty of care to protect children on premises,\u201d child protection activist Hetty Johnston told the Courier-Mail in Brisbane, Australia.\n\nWell, we\u2019ve banned teachers from hugging crying children and day-care workers from applying sunscreen. You knew personal contact with Santa was close behind.\n\nSo, back to Santa emails. Technology has come a long way in helping Santa \u2014 and parents \u2014 do their jobs better.\n\nI\u2019ve told my friends it\u2019s important to add phone numbers for Santa and the Easter Bunny to their mobile phone directories.\n\nWhen my kids happened upon those entries when they were playing Candy Crush at a friend\u2019s house last year, the other adults called that move \u201cnext-level, psy-ops parenting.\u201d\n\nBut isn\u2019t parenting one, big psy-ops game? Yeah.\n\nSo, is all this magic-making basically preparing America\u2019s children for a \u201cHunger Games\u201d life of constant surveillance?\n\nThat was the argument from Laura Pinto, an assistant professor at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology who said the Elf on the Shelf is a \u201csurveillance apparatus\u201d that teaches children to acquiesce \u201cto surveillance during waking hours under the elf\u2019s watchful eye.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Elf on the Shelf controls all parameters of play, who can do and touch what, and ultimately attempts to dictate the child\u2019s behavior outside of time used for play,\u201d Pinto wrote in a paper this month.\n\nBasically, the Elf on the Shelf is not so much a mother-daughter team\u2019s cute idea that turned into a sales juggernaut as it is a clever conditioning device from the National Security Agency that is in more than 6 million American homes.\n\nSo, do we worry that today\u2019s children will look at government lenses embedded everywhere in a Libertarian\u2019s nightmarish future and think \u201cPeaches the Elf\u201d rather than Big Brother? Nah, I think our kids are smarter than that.\n\nThe other day, I watched a social media exchange involving parents who\u2019ve done the Santa-in-your-phone trick. One parent said she dialed Santa in the middle of her kid\u2019s tantrum, but as soon as she whipped out the iPhone to report bad behavior, the child snatched the phone to try to argue his case directly to Santa. A Capitol Hill kid, no doubt.\n\nMaybe the Google Docs lists and texts aren\u2019t poignant as much as they are empowering kids to be facile in the digital age.\n\nI have no doubt that come birthday time this year, the fifth-grader will present me with a well-argued and graphically sophisticated SlideShare. Cool. As long as he doesn\u2019t ask for a Samsung Curve TV.\n\nPetula Dvorak is a writer for The Washington Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cI sent my Christmas list to you in Google Docs.
