The announcement confirms signs that have been around for weeks telegraphing that this El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as it is officially known, would be a particularly strong one.\n\n\"This definitely has the potential of being the Godzilla El Ni\u00f1o,\" Bill Patzert, a climatologist with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, says, adding that the signal from the Pacific Ocean \"right now is stronger than it was in 1997,\" the year of the most powerful El Ni\u00f1o on record.\n\nClimatologists say there's a greater than 90 percent chance that El Ni\u00f1o will continue through the Northern Hemisphere winter 2015-16 and around an 85 percent chance it will last into early spring 2016.\n\n\"If this lines up to its potential, this thing can bring a lot of floods, mudslides and mayhem,\" he said.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is marked by a 1.5 degree Celsius or greater temperature rise in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, which causes a stalling of trade winds and a shifting of a subtropical jet stream \"that normally pours rain over jungles of southern Mexico and Central America toward California and the southern United States,\" according to The Los Angeles Times.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o brings drier weather to the western Pacific. It also tends to suppress hurricane formation in the Atlantic and increase it in the eastern and central Pacific.\n\nAccording to Mike Halpert, deputy director of the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., peak anomalies in the Pacific could exceed 2 degrees Celsius this year.\n\n\"It looks like it will be one of the three or four strongest events on record. Whether it matters if it's 1, 2, 3 or 4 is debatable,\" he was quoted by The San Diego Union Tribune as saying.\n\nThe Tribune reports: \"Some climate models show that anomalies in the equatorial Pacific's surface temperatures will rise above 3 degrees Celsius during the coming winter. If that plays out, it would be an unprecedented phenomenon.\"\n\nThe L.A. Times writes:\n\n\n\n\"Already, El Ni\u00f1o is being blamed for drought conditions in parts of the Philippines, Indonesia and Australia, as occurred in 1997-98. \"Drought is also persistent in Central America. Water levels are now so low in the waterways that make up the Panama Canal that officials recently announced limits on traffic through the passageway that links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. \"El Ni\u00f1o also influenced the heavy rainstorms that effectively ended drought conditions in Colorado, Texas and Oklahoma.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "This year&#039;s El Ni\u00f1o is shaping up to be a whopper \u2014 potentially surpassing the one in 1997, which was the strongest on record, the National Wea", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/scientists-say-we-could-be-heading-godzilla-el-ni-o", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201508/432103247.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "This year&#039;s El Ni\u00f1o is shaping up to be a whopper \u2014 potentially surpassing the one in 1997, which was the strongest on record, the National Wea", "title": "Scientists Say We Could Be Heading Into 'Godzilla El Ni\u00f1o'"}, "story_id": 432099022, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "Scott Neuman", "org_id": 1, "dc": {"title": "Scientists Say We Could Be Heading Into &#039;Godzilla El Ni\u00f1o&#039;"}, "nid": 45186, "datePublished": "2015-08-13", "wordCount": 632, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\"El Ni\u00f1o also influenced the heavy rainstorms that effectively ended drought conditions in Colorado, Texas and Oklahoma.\"\nThe announcement confirms signs that have been around for weeks telegraphing that this El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as it is officially known, would be a particularly strong one.\nThis year's El Ni\u00f1o is shaping up to be a whopper \u2014 potentially surpassing the one in 1997, which was the strongest on record, the National Weather Service says.\nThe L.A.
