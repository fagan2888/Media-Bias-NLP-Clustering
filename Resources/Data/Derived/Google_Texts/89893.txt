To the editor: Columnist Doyle McManus asks, "Trump can't actually win, can he?" It would appear he can. Still, it is difficult to believe that the American public would vote for a candidate with policy positions like promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with “something terrific.”

What Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is really running against is a system in Washington that is completely dysfunctional. There seems to be no difference between the parties, and graft is pervasive.

Our representatives now have only three goals: Get reelected, protect the special interests that have made the former possible and, seemingly most important of all, see to their own self-interests.

Every Republican and Democrat in America allowed this country to sink to this point. So while Trump may or may not be the individual who can provide the catalyst we need to change a broken and corrupt system, he is, it seems, what we deserve.
