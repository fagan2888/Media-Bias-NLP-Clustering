Of the more than 440 homes tested, 180 came up with radon levels above what Health Canada now considers too high \u2013 200 becquerels per cubic meter (200 Bq/m\u00b3).\n\nThe findings did not surprise the First Nation leadership, based in Maniwak. Already, the community has been struggling with a \u201cradioactive\u201d problem with their water.\n\nIn 2000, almost 60 percent of the community\u2019s homes were determined to have dangerously high levels of natural uranium in their water supplies. The community would end up paying almost $170,000 every year since then to supply drinkable bottled water. Recently a safe local source of water has been found and residents are encourage to use that source, but many aspects of the uranium-in-the-water incident left a bad taste with community members. When tackling the issue of radon, the band leaders did not want to repeat that experience. They\u2019ve ended up making homes healthier while creating a radon expertise being tapped by other communities within and outside First Nations.\n\n\u201cWhen the water issue came up,\u201d recalled band Chief Gilbert Whiteduck, \u201cHealth Canada didn\u2019t have a very good communication strategy.\u201d The first word that came out was don\u2019t drink the water and don\u2019t let your pets drink the water. Then almost immediately came the announcement that it was ok for pets, since they have shorter lives anyway.\n\n\u201cIt was idiotic,\u201d said Whiteduck, not mincing words. \u201cEveryone was in a panic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no real technique to actually solve the problem,\u201d added Marcel Brascoupe, a band member who was assistant community service director at the time. \u201cThere was a lot of frustration in the community.\u201d\n\nThen came the questions about using bottled water and the safety with the plastic bottles and also delivering the five liter jugs of water which are hard for an elderly person to bring inside and can easily freeze if someone is not home.\n\nTrying to find systems to handle the uranium in the water left the community both wary and ready when it took on radon.\n\nModest radon testing done in about 85 homes in the 1990s already showed the likelihood the community would need mitigation for homes, explained Branscoupe. In the mid-90s, though, the radon \u201cactionable\u201d trigger level was much higher \u2013 800 Bq/m\u00b3. While many of the homes ranked above 200 Bq/m\u00b3, few hit that higher level.\n\nWhen Health Canada issued new guidelines with lower levels, Brascoupe and others recognized that their community homes would have a problem. Of those homes originally tested, 16 hit the new \u201cactionable\u201d levels.\n\nLong-term exposure to high levels of radon has been linked to lung cancer. In fact, other than smoking, it is the second highest cause of lung cancer in Canada and the United States and the highest cause \u2013 ahead of even second-hand smoke \u2013 for non-smokers.\n\nThe announcement of this environmental health concern had to be done with more finesse and planning than the water issue, the band council knew. Two decisions by the band became critical to dealing with radon in the community. One was that all homes needed to be tested \u2013 unless homeowners declined \u2013 and two was that there had to be a plan, with financing, in place to fix the problems when they were found.\n\nRELATED: Radon: The Invisible Killer In Native Homes Across Indian Country\n\nHealth Canada wanted to test only some of the homes, Whiteduck recalled. \u201cWe told them, \u2018No, we were testing them all.\u2019\u201d Initially, the band funded the tests through its Aboriginal Affairs money so all homes could be tested.\n\nThe timing, though, turned out to be right for the community to find federal funding. It was just after the 2008 recession hit that this issue came to light. By quickly creating a plan of action for training, testing and mitigation systems, the band was able to tap stimulus money. One of the investments was in training of Kitigan Zibi members to do the testing and to install the radon mitigation systems.\n\n\u201cThere was not a lot of expertise in Canada at the time,\u201d Brascoupe said. \u201cWe brought two experts from the U.S. to actually train our community members.\u201d\n\nTen people were trained. \u201cThat type of expertise became something that was exportable to other First Nations,\u201d Brascoupe added.\n\nBrascoupe himself has since become a certified trainer and is certified to do radon testing and mitigation. He retired from his job with the band in 2011 and has become a private general contractor specializing in radon issues. The trained band members are his staff. \u201cI\u2019m the only Canadian trainer who actually trains contractors both on-reserve and off- reserve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When it comes to Canada\u2019s National Radon Action Month in November, the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg First Nation has already more than done its part.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/11/28/canadas-first-nation-takes-proactive-approach-against-radon-158049", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/radon_mitigation_group_at_kitigan_zibi_anishinabeg_community_-_courtesy_marcel_brascoupe.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Canada\u2019s First Nation Takes Proactive Approach Against Radon"}, "abstract": "When it comes to Canada\u2019s National Radon Action Month in November, the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg First Nation has already more than done its part.", "keywords": "Canada\u2019s National Radon Action Month, Radon, Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg First Nation, Konnie LeMay, Chief Gilbert Whiteduck, Health Canada, Marcel Brascoupe, Canadian Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists", "dc": {"title": "Canada\u2019s First Nation Takes Proactive Approach Against Radon"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/11/28/canadas-first-nation-takes-proactive-approach-against-radon-158049", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-11-28T10:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Canada\u2019s First Nation Takes Proactive Approach Against Radon"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2544\"", "article_summary": "Brascoupe himself has since become a certified trainer and is certified to do radon testing and mitigation.\nOne of the investments was in training of Kitigan Zibi members to do the testing and to install the radon mitigation systems.\nWhen it comes to Canada\u2019s National Radon Action Month in November, the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg First Nation has already more than done its part.\nModest radon testing done in about 85 homes in the 1990s already showed the likelihood the community would need mitigation for homes, explained Branscoupe.\nWhen Health Canada issued new guidelines with lower levels, Brascoupe and others recognized that their community homes would have a problem."}
