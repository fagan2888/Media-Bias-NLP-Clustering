BuzzFeed's Benny Johnson biked around town earlier this week snapping photos of a few of the most hideous examples, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters, the U.S. Post Office Building, and the Department of Health and Human Services. You can see the results here.\n\nToday, in a follow-up article, Johnson explained that taking the photos was no easy task\u2014cops actually attempted to thwart him at every turn. Even though representatives for the various departments confirmed to Johnson by phone that it was perfectly fine to take pictures of the buildings, law enforcement agents contradicted that directive over and over again. From BuzzFeed [I took out the pictures and condensed the text\u2014you can see the full thing here if you're curious]:\n\nI asked, from across the street, why I could not come any closer to the building.\n\nBut when I tried to take photos there\u2026 The four officers surrounded me right here, directly in front of the building entrance. After taking the above photo of the public, ahem, Sponge Bob mailbox, an armed security guard approached. He told me the pictures I was taking were \u201csuspicious\u201d and said I was not allowed to take them. \u201cThis is a public sidewalk, why not?\u201d I asked. He then told me I was no longer allowed on the property and to go across the street immediately. He said, \u201cYou would not want people taking photos of your office, would you?\u201d Ultimately, he asked me to leave. On Thursday, a spokesperson for Department of Energy Security told BuzzFeed: \u201cThere is no problem or restrictions in taking photos of the building,\u201d and simply cautioned against photographing employees. After I took this photo of a public walkway in front of the building, four armed guards surrounded me and my bike. I was ordered off my bicycle and told to hand over my camera. \u201cWhere is your identification? Why are you taking photos of our building?\u201d an officer asked me. I explained my role as a reporter and asked what rules I had broken. \u201cYou are suspicious, and we are in a post-9/11 world,\u201d he said. The four armed guards prevented me from moving or getting on my bike. After calling my boss, and discussing with the guards, I was given my camera back. \u201cBe smarter next time,\u201d he said, \u201cand don\u2019t take any more photos here.\u201d\n\nDon't the cops have anything better to do than hang around outside government buildings, casually invoking national security when a reporter tries to snap some clearly innocent photos? Maybe they're self-conscious or something.\n\nFor more on this subject, check out Reason TV's \"The Government's War on Cameras.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Maybe they're self-conscious?
