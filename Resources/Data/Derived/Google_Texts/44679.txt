Hogan for Governor/Brown for Governor

A new Washington Post-University of Maryland poll reveals Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown is leading Republican Larry Hogan by 9 percentage points in the race for Maryland governor.

The poll shows that Brown, a Democrat, leads Hogan 47 percent to 38 percent among likely voters. As many as 11 percent are undecided.

The race for Maryland governor has tightened in recent months, and the poll suggests Brown is being hurt as support for Gov. Martin O'Malley has dropped due to economic concerns. Hogan has been campaigning on economic issues.

The poll was conducted Thursday through Sunday among a random sample of approximately 1,000 adults reached on conventional and cell phones. The margin of error for registered voters is plus or minus 4 percentage points and 5 percentage points for likely voters.
