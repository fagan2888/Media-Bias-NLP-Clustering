For example: If someone goes to an in-network hospital for an operation and sees an in-network surgeon, there still might be an out-of-network specialist who has to be consulted while the patient is under anesthesia. Depending on the insurer, that patient can be on the hook for a surprisingly large bill for the out-of-network treatment.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Tallahassee have introduced a bill that would end this practice in emergencies. But the federal proposal would also apply to non-emergency cases.\n\nFrom the CMS fact sheet on the proposed rule:\n\nWe propose that issuers must count the cost sharing charged to the enrollee for certain out-of-network services (provided at an in-network facility) towards the enrollee\u2019s annual limitation on cost sharing. The exception to this requirement would be if the issuer provides 10 days\u2019 notification to the enrollee that an out-of-network provider may be providing these services and that the enrollee may incur additional costs. This proposal aims to limit \u201csurprise bills\u201d to consumers.\n\n\u201cFor the institutions, it would require them to do a better job of advanced warning,\u201d says Linda Quick, president of the South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association. \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do away with is some of these retroactive surprise bills.\u201d\n\nThe CMS proposal would apply to plans sold through the Obamacare marketplaces. As Quick points out, it would not apply to Floridians who are insured other ways.\n\nThe CMS proposal is currently in the comment period. If it\u2019s adopted, the rule would go into effect in 2017.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "Florida legislators have been grappling with the problem of balance billing\u2014also known as \u201csurprise billing\u201d\u2014and now the Center for Medicare and Medicaid", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wlrn.org/post/feds-propose-fix-surprise-medical-bills", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wlrn/files/styles/medium/public/201511/ID-100231194.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Florida legislators have been grappling with the problem of balance billing\u2014also known as \u201csurprise billing\u201d\u2014and now the Center for Medicare and Medicaid", "title": "Feds Propose Fix For Surprise Medical Bills"}, "story_id": 457410029, "twitter": {"site": "@WLRN", "card": "summary", "creator": "@sammymack"}, "author": "Sammy Mack", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Feds Propose Fix For Surprise Medical Bills"}, "nid": 59999, "datePublished": "2015-11-25", "keywords": "health care, Health News Florida, news", "wordCount": 403, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do away with is some of these retroactive surprise bills.\u201dThe CMS proposal would apply to plans sold through the Obamacare marketplaces.\nThe CMS proposal is currently in the comment period.\nListen: Feds Propose A Fix For Surprise BillingFlorida legislators have been grappling with the problem of balance billing\u2014also known as \u201csurprise billing\u201d\u2014and now the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed a broader rule aimed at fixing the issue.\nDepending on the insurer, that patient can be on the hook for a surprisingly large bill for the out-of-network treatment.\nThis proposal aims to limit \u201csurprise bills\u201d to consumers."}
