(WKRN) \u2013 The hundreds of thousands of Tennesseans without health care were the focus late Tuesday of a task force set up by House Speaker Beth Harwell.\n\nIt has an ambitious schedule with a June deadline to come up with something.\n\n\u201cWe are going in with the best intentions. We obviously know there is a need for this, but June is going to be very early,\u201d said Rep. Roger Kane (R), who is a member of the task force.\n\nIn a cramped Capitol Hill conference room, it was the first meeting of Speaker Harwell\u2019s health care task force.\n\nMembers listened to top officials from Tennessee\u2019s Medicaid program TennCare outline the estimated two-to-four hundred low-income Tennesseans who fall into what\u2019s called the coverage gap, those who for a variety of reasons don\u2019t have medical insurance and those who would have been helped by Governor Bill Haslam\u2019s failed Insure Tennessee program last year.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of uninsured, and if you look at the overall Affordable Care Act, this was the other part that was supposed to make this seamless,\u201d said Rep. Karen Kamper (D).\n\nWhen suddenly announced two weeks ago, Speaker Harwell cited gradually fazed in pilot health care programs with triggers to stop if they cost too much.\n\nCost with too many people on such programs was often a concern of the four republicans on the five person task force.\n\n\u201cWhat can we do to insure that as we move forward that we don\u2019t run into those kind of issues,\u201d said Rep Matthew Hill (R).\n\nA state senator not on the committee who is also a physician spoke of another kind of cost\u2013federal money from Obamacare ready to be used for a program the task force might come up with that currently is left on the table.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s money that was taken from Tennesseans by the reduction in the Medicare payments, looking at ways to responsibly get that money back. It\u2019s about 1.1 to 1.3 billion a year,\u201d said Dr. Richard Briggs, a Republican State Senator.\n\nIt\u2019s a high stakes matter here. A lot of people without healthcare in Tennessee and this small group faces a very large task in doing something about it.\n\nThe task force is scheduled to meet again Wednesday morning with a target date of reporting back with plan by mid-June.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two weeks ago, House Speaker Beth Harwell suddenly announced the creation of a task force to look at alternatives of what could be done usin\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mediageneral.wkrn", "og": {"site_name": "WKRN.com", "description": "Two weeks ago, House Speaker Beth Harwell suddenly announced the creation of a task force to look at alternatives of what could be done using pilot programs set up using \u201cconservative\u201d \u2026", "title": "Speaker Harwell\u2019s health care task force begins with \u2018coverage gap\u2019", "url": "http://wkrn.com/2016/04/26/speaker-harwells-health-care-task-force-begins-with-coverage-gap/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://mgtvwkrn.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/still0426_00011.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two weeks ago, House Speaker Beth Harwell suddenly announced the creation of a task force to look at alternatives of what could be done using pilot programs set up using \u201cconservative\u201d \u2026", "creator": "@WKRN", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwkrn.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/still0426_00011.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Speaker Harwell\u2019s health care task force begins with \u2018coverage gap\u2019", "site": "wkrn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Nashville's News 2", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=523213092", "fb": {"pages": 121386074555790}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WKRN.com", "google-site-verification": "G2WXEm6QW1PkffhJXpGnD-Yn9z2aSfnZHNVXc1bnnRo", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wkrntv", "published_time": "2016-04-26T19:20:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:24:24+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wkrn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/90919f996ff323fc31b4cb1f4b7e825e?s=16"}, "article_summary": "In a cramped Capitol Hill conference room, it was the first meeting of Speaker Harwell\u2019s health care task force.\nThe task force is scheduled to meet again Wednesday morning with a target date of reporting back with plan by mid-June.\nCost with too many people on such programs was often a concern of the four republicans on the five person task force.\n(Photo: WKRN)NASHVILLE, Tenn.
