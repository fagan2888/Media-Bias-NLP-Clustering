The Mission Bay clinic is located on the 3rd floor of the William J. Rutter Community Center and the Parnassus clinic is located on the P8 Level of Millberry Union West.\n\nSHCS also provides wellness-related workshops and programs across campuses. These services are available to all registered UCSF students, regardless of whether they have waived the UC Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP). (Exception: A student who has applied for reduced fees as a \u2018Student Employee\u2019 does not have access to SHCS.)\n\nServices at Student Health\n\nStudent Health offers comprehensive primary care, urgent care, immunizations, physicals and preventive health examinations, mental health counseling, nursing advice and triage, alcohol and drug consultations, nutrition services, travel consultations and will assist in coordinating your specialty care.

To schedule an appointment at SHCS, call or visit Student Health and ask to speak to a nurse about mental health appointments.\n\nIf additional therapy or long-term therapy is required, enrollees will be referred to a therapist outside of SHCS. For those covered under the UC SHIP, outpatient behavioral visits with a UC provider is covered 100% after $5 co-payment, visits with an in-network provider are covered at 100% after a $15 co-pay, and out- of-network providers are covered at 70% after the $200 annual deductible.\n\nSHCS also offers an after-hours mental health crisis and counseling hotline. Contracted therapists provide telephone intake, assessment and crisis counseling services during non-working hours Monday through Friday and 24 hours on holidays and weekends.

As an integral part of this mission, we offer wellness programs and outreach services that include workshops, lectures, small group series discussions, health education, and consultation services to the larger campus community. These educational programs and resources include topics on general wellness, nutrition, prevention, student development, community building, and mental health and promote the development and well- being of UCSF students in meeting their academic and professional goals.\n\nThis fall, programming includes the annual Fall Hump Day Student Wellness Series, with topics ranging from Stress Management to The Perks of Being an Introvert; the Flavorful Fall Nutrition Series, with topics ranging from Cheap Eats to Nutrition for Women; Mental Health Awareness Week, focused on student self-care; and Success Series, with topics ranging from The Imposter Syndrome to Transitioning to Life as a UCSF Student.
