BJC officials said the move was necessary because the psychiatric hospital was financially unstable.\n\nThe St. Louis Regional Psychiatric Stabilization Center, or PSC, serves people experiencing a psychiatric emergency, such as an episode of schizophrenia or a suicide attempt. Many patients are transferred to PSC from nearby emergency rooms at Barnes Jewish Hospital and SSM St. Mary\u2019s Health Center. During an average, week-long stay, the PSC stabilizes patients and refers them to medical care.\n\n\u201cIf PSC had closed, then there would be no avenue for those emergency rooms to transfer those patients out, and they\u2019d have very long lengths of stay in the emergency room,\u201d said Rich Liekweg, an executive vice president of BJC HealthCare.\n\nPSC replaced the Metropolitan Psychiatric Center at 5351 Delmar Blvd. three years ago. The hospital is funded by about $500,000 in contributions from BJC and SSM Health Care annually, which is matched by the Missouri Department of Mental Health.\n\n\u201cEighteen months ago we realized that unless there was going to be Medicaid expansion in the state of Missouri, PSC as we know it was not going to be a viable entity,\u201d Liekweg said.\n\nCoupled with cuts to federal funding programs through the Affordable Care Act, he said PSC was caught in a perfect storm:\n\nFunding from a temporary Affordable Care Act program, the Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Demonstration, expires in July of 2015.\n\nA temporary pay bump for primary care doctors who serve Medicaid patients expired at the end of 2014.\n\nMost significantly, the lack of Medicaid expansion in Missouri meant PSC provided care for more uninsured patients than it could afford.\n\nInitially, the hospitals had expected fewer than 20 percent of PSC\u2019s patients to be uninsured, pending Medicaid expansion. But because Missouri\u2019s legislature voted not to expand Medicaid coverage to people making less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, the number of uninsured patients at PSC shot up to an average of 42 percent last year.\n\n\u201cThe difference between 20 percent of uninsured patients and 40 percent is the difference between being open or closed,\u201d said PSC\u2019s president Jon Eiler, who will now serve as its Administrative Director under BJC.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge need in the community, to stop this revolving door for folks with chronic mental illness,\u201d Eiler said.\n\nBJC will double the capacity of the facility by opening PSC\u2019s vacant third floor and closing the psychiatric emergency unit at Christian Hospital in north St. Louis County. Psychiatric beds at Christian will be converted to beds for trauma and surgical care. PSC will re-named the \u2018Barnes-Jewish Hospital Psychiatric Support Center.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health, Science, Environment", "description": "BJC HealthCare took over operations of a 25-bed, psychiatric acute-care hospital near the West End neighborhood in St. Louis on Wednesday.
