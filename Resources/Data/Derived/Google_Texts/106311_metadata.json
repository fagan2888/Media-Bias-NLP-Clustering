Instead, it has more to do with the gender's strength.\n\nResearchers at Duke University looked into the relationship between parents with sons and parents with daughters, and published their findings in the journal Demography. \u201cMany have suggested that girls have a negative effect on the stability of their parents\u2019 union,\u201d the study\u2019s co-author Amar Hamoudi, a Duke economist said in a press release. \u201cWe are saying: \u2018Not so fast.\u2019\u201d\n\nPreviously, research has shown fathers have a preference for sons over daughters and are more likely to stay in marriages that have yielded sons. However, it\u2019s not so much the child\u2019s gender that\u2019s the deal breaker for the parents, but it\u2019s really which embryo can resist a troubled marriage before they\u2019re even born. \u201cGirls may well be surviving stressful pregnancies that boys can\u2019t survive,\u201d Hamoudi said. \u201cThus girls are more likely than boys to be born into marriages that were already strained.\u201d\n\nModern day King Henry VIIIs aren\u2019t divorcing their wives because they gave birth to daughters. These are different times and King Henry VIII, who was notorious in English history for executing four of his wives when they didn\u2019t give birth to male heirs, didn\u2019t have access to the science and research we do today, which tells us women don\u2019t determine the gender, and gender doesn\u2019t determine divorce.\n\nThere are over two million marriages in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those marriages, most will end in divorce, considering the divorce rate is 59.7 percent.\n\nThe analysis was based on a sample of Americans from 1979 to 2010, and subsequently it was found daughters don\u2019t cause parents to divorce, but something deeper and more intrinsic is involved prior to giving birth. It\u2019s the level of conflict a relationship has endured that determines the likelihood of divorce, not the gender of their baby.\n\nFrom start to finish, girls and women are typically more resilient survivors than boys and men are. By examining females at every age from birth to 100, they survive in much greater proportions than men tend to, which suggests females\u2019 advantage helps them survive stressed pregnancies caused by poor parent relationships.\n\nResearch stops short of studying family dynamics during gestation and usually begin observations once the baby is born. Hamoudi and Nobles believe this does a disservice to understanding how family dynamics affect population, and research needs to look into what happens to the months and even years leading up to a child\u2019s birth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for population studies to shine a light on the period of pregnancy,\u201d Hamoudi said. \u201cThe clock does not start at birth.\u201d\n\nSource: Hamoudi A and Nobles J.
