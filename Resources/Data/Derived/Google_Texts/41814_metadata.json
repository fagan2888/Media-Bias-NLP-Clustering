The interior ministry said 30 police were hurt, including more than 10 admitted to hospital and four in serious condition.\n\nA spokeswoman for Klitschko tweeted that President Viktor Yanukovich had agreed to meet Klitschko immediately at the presidential residence outside Kiev, although there was no confirmation from Yanukovich's side.\n\nKlitschko later tweeted that the president had agreed to set up a committee on Monday to settle the political crisis.\n\nAs tensions continued into the night, police used water cannon against demonstrators gathered near the parliament building and the heavily protected government headquarters, eyewitnesses said.\n\nEarlier, some distance away from the clashes, up to 100,000 Ukrainians massed on Kiev's Independence Square in defiance of the sweeping new laws, which ban rallies and which Washington and other Western capitals have denounced as undemocratic.\n\nThe rally, the biggest of the new year, was the latest in a cycle of public protests in the former Soviet republic since Yanukovich made a policy U-turn in November away from the European Union towards Russia, Ukraine's former Soviet overlord.\n\nSeveral big protests in December attracted hundreds of thousands of people, while thousands maintained a vigil in a Kiev square demanding Yanukovich resign. Since the new year demonstrations have become smaller, but hundreds of people are still camping in the square and 50,000 turned out a week ago.\n\nCOURT BAN\n\nThe court ban on protests published on January 15, and last Thursday's legislation aimed at prohibiting all form of public protests, have inflamed tensions again.\n\nThe laws - denounced by the United States and other Western governments as anti-democratic - ban any unauthorized installation of tents, stages or use of loud-speakers in public.\n\nHeavy jail sentences were imposed for participation in \"mass disorder\" and the wearing of face-masks or protective helmets. Dissemination of \"extremist\" or libelous information about the country's leaders was outlawed.\n\nIn a gesture of scorn for the helmet ban, many protesters on Sunday wore saucepans and colanders on their heads.\n\nThe crisis has highlighted a divide in the country of 46 million people between those, particularly in Russian-speaking eastern areas, who identify more closely with a shared past with Russia and those, especially in the Ukrainian-speaking parts of western and central Ukraine, who look westwards.\n\nOpposition leaders announced an action plan to gather people's signatures expressing no confidence in the leadership of Yanukovich and parliament.\n\nDenouncing as unconstitutional last Thursday's hurried vote in parliament by Yanukovich loyalists, they called for moves to set up a parallel structure of power - including a people's assembly and a new constitution.\n\n\"Yanukovich and his henchmen want to steal our country. Ukraine is united as never before in its struggle against those in power today, in its determination not to allow a dictatorship,\" Klitschko, the strongest potential challenger for the presidency, told the crowds on Independence Square.\n\nCALLS FOR RESTRAINT\n\nOpposition leaders were at pains to urge protesters not to resort to action which would provide a pretext for a crackdown.\n\nWhen clashes broke out about 500 meters (yards) from Independence square, Klitschko went to the scene and sought to persuade protesters to refrain from attacking police.\n\n\"Stop your actions,\" he called through loud-hailer to groups of young people - some of them masked. \"We are a peaceful protest.\" Protesters sprayed a powder fire extinguisher at police, catching Klitschko whose face was covered in white.\n\nAs police later appeared to be readying to take a tougher line against protesters, he tweeted: \"Viktor Yanukovich, do not go down the same road as (late Romanian dictator Nicolae) Ceausescu and (late Libyan leader Muammar) Gaddafi. Stop conducting war on the citizens of Ukraine.\"\n\nArseny Yatsenyuk, another opposition leader, told the crowds on Independence Square: \"Our victory is not in using physical violence but in moral and spiritual strength.\"\n\nThough setting up an alternative power structure may not be realistic, Sunday's turn-out suggested it could also be difficult for the authorities to try to solve the crisis by use of force despite the court ban and the new laws.\n\nAnother opposition leader, far-right-nationalist Oleh Tyahnibok, dismissed the laws as unconstitutional as he spoke from the tribune on Kiev's main Independence Square.\n\n\"So we have a right not to carry them out and we will sabotage them,\" he said.\n\nYanukovich triggered the pro-Europe rallies when he did an about-turn last November and ditched a free trade deal with the European Union in favor of closer economic ties with Russia.\n\nRussia has since thrown Ukraine a $15 billion lifeline in credits as well as a softer deal for purchases of strategic supplies of natural gas.\n\n(Writing By Richard Balmforth; Editing by Peter Graff)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Richard Balmforth and Natalia Zinets",
