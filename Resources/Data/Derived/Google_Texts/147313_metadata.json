To that end, job one is giving visitors a quick idea how much they're likely to pay. Last year, one of the first questions that applicants faced was \u201cDo you intend to file taxes for 2014?\u201d Many low-income people who don\u2019t pay taxes clicked \u201cno\u201d on this, unaware that they were effectively disqualifying themselves for subsidized coverage. Kate Kozeniewski, who as a certified ACA \u201cnavigator\u201d and program coordinator at Resources for Human Development, a national agency based in Philadelphia, helped thousands of people sign up for insurance, said that \u201cIf I could ask anything in the world, it would be that they somehow indicate that if you click 'no' you're not going to get any subsidies.\u201d That's because the subsidies come through the tax system, and, as Kozeniewski explained, \u201cYou have to file taxes to get a tax credit.\u2033\n\nAnother, better publicized example of the old site\u2019s complexity was its lack at launch-time of a simple shop-around feature\u2014an option where a user could answer just a handful of questions, including annual household income, and quickly get a complete listing of available plans, priced with the subsidy incorporated. Not only did this absence confuse users; it also contributed to the traffic problems that crippled healthcare.gov in its early weeks. HHS eventually did add a shop-around feature, but the site didn't clearly steer visitors to it as a first step. \u201cPeople didn't get onto that on their own,\u201d Kozeniewski told me. \u201cIt wasn't in the most prominent place on website, and at first it wasn't available at all.\u201d\n\nThat many or most visitors to healthcare.gov never found the shop-around doesn't surprise Ning Liang, co-founder of e-broker HealthSherpa. HealthSherpa got a lot of attention in November 2013 when, with healthcare.gov still dysfunctional, it created a separate website that let people see the prices of ACA plans, estimated subsidy included. Within the course of a few months, HealthSherpa got certified as an online broker and worked with HHS to develop its own dedicated interface on healthcare.gov. Since February, it has been enrolling people in subsidized ACA plans.\n\nLiang notes that healthcare.gov has to be many things to many people. It's a portal to small business plans, private individual health plans, dental plans, Medicaid, and CHIP. The biggest challenge going forward is \u201cto integrate the site so it doesn't feel like four different companies' worth of projects\u2014so people can experience it as one website.\u201d\n\nHealthSherpa strives to provide that unity, and to put visitors on a fast track to signup. You can't spend a minute on the site without knowing how much you'll pay for available plans (if you report your income accurately). The home page is dominated by a prompt to enter your zip code. When you respond you see price quotes immediately\u2014which change before your eyes as you fill in your age, additional household members and income. The order in which the plans are listed changes when you estimate how heavy a user of medical services you're likely to be.\n\nWhen a user clicks \u201cbuy\u201d on any plan description she is transferred to HealthSherpa's dedicated interface on healthcare.gov\u2014and unlike on Healthcare.gov, the information she has entered so far comes with her. HealthSherpa keeps streamlining that interface, and claims to have reduced signup time to 3-5 minutes for solo buyers and 10-15 minutes for buyers of family plans.\n\nThe interface also helps users avoid the kind of errors that Kate Kozeniewski helped clients correct. If an applicant applies for a subsidy and says he does not intend to file a tax return, for example, he is prompted either to state an intent to file or uncheck the \u201capply for subsidy\u201d box.\n\nBut simplicity can\u2019t be the only goal for improving healthcare.gov. An ideal website would also help users to make an optimal choice. That\u2019s not easy to do. Buying insurance is an incredibly complex decision, even for experienced consumers. Somebody who wants to make the smartest choice has to take into account all kinds of information about the plan\u2014monthly premiums, out-of-pocket costs, provider networks, drug formularies, and so on. Many people aren\u2019t familiar with any of these terms. Most probably are not familiar with all of them.\n\nThe authors of recent University of Pennsylvania study, which tracked the experience of well-educated young adults on healthcare.gov, developed a set of recommendations in response to participants' complaints that key information was not spelled out up front or delivered in context.\n\nPop-up boxes could offer definitions of key terms, like premium or formulary, where they appear. The site could have clear warnings about key caveats consumers might miss\u2014like the fact that Cost Sharing Reductions, which lower out-of-pocket costs for lower income buyers, are available only with silver plans.\n\nThe problem\u2014as you may have guessed by now\u2014is that the imperative to provide more information is hard to reconcile with the imperative to simplify the process. Liang, who says he has spoken to thousands of users over the phone, is somewhat wary of providing too much information, at least at first glance. An alumnus of the product analytics team at Twitter, Liang said that Penn study findings evoke a creative tension \u201cbetween user interface researchers, who talk to users, and the analytics team, which just measures everything. We try to strike a balance: talking to thousands of people about their needs and incorporating what we learn that way, versus analytics, measuring what percentage of users drops off at every step in shopping process.\u201d\n\nI put the streamline-vs.-inform question to Charlene Wong, the lead researcher in the Penn study. She notes that HealthSherpa does meet one of the study's core recommendations, in that it \u201cuses the type of decision support tools that the young adults in our study were asking for\u201d\u2014chiefly by asking their expected level of medical use. Wong further notes that HealthSherpa's 'Total Annual Cost' quotes also meet a need highlighted by study participants. Still, HealthSherpa does not provide all of the information that the Penn study identified as essential. For example, it does not highlight the fact that free preventative services are included in all plans\u2014not just the more expensive ones.\n\nLiang acknowledges that the desire for in-context definitions and explanations is \u201cnatural for an educated person.\u201d Going forward, he'd like to \u201cprogressively offer more options to power users.\u201d He foresees inviting users to \u201center as much information as they have an appetite for\u201d\u2014and rewarding them with results more tailored to their needs, via algorithms not yet created.\n\nIn the end, there may be no perfect solution. But perhaps there doesn\u2019t have to be. As Tom Baker, a co-author of the Penn study, points out, the Netherlands today has a system that looks a lot like what Obamacare is supposed to be, with people shopping around for subsidized private insurance. There, however, the exchanges are private\u2014though \u201cthe government is involved on the back end.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., too, could healthcare.gov eventually fade into the background as private exchanges compete to offer the easiest experience, or the most information-rich, or algorithms that best base recommendations on a shopper's past medical usage patterns? The ACA's core premise is that competition among private insurers will control costs and improve healthcare delivery. Perhaps competition among brokers will prove as beneficial\u2014and the market will figure out how to get essential information to all comers.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "One year after the fiasco, here\u2019s what the federal government still needs to do", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "There are several ways the government can make healthcare.gov simpler and more accessible, and make up for last year's fiasco.", "title": "How to Reboot Healthcare.gov", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/37fd02a66cded9b2234d7a51ed01eb3f543a0685.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/119474/government-can-revive-obamacare-site-healthcaregov", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/37fd02a66cded9b2234d7a51ed01eb3f543a0685.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "How to Reboot Healthcare.gov", "description": "There are several ways the government can make healthcare.gov simpler and more accessible, and make up for last year's fiasco.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newrepublic"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/37fd02a66cded9b2234d7a51ed01eb3f543a0685.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"How to Reboot Healthcare.gov\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/119474/government-can-revive-obamacare-site-healthcaregov\",\"section\":\"Obamacare\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-18T03:30:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":119474,\"author\":\"Andrew Sprung\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Obamacare\",\"Politics\",\"Healthcare\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2014-09-18"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "Not only did this absence confuse users; it also contributed to the traffic problems that crippled healthcare.gov in its early weeks.\nIt's a portal to small business plans, private individual health plans, dental plans, Medicaid, and CHIP.\nHHS eventually did add a shop-around feature, but the site didn't clearly steer visitors to it as a first step.\nWithin the course of a few months, HealthSherpa got certified as an online broker and worked with HHS to develop its own dedicated interface on healthcare.gov.\nYou can't spend a minute on the site without knowing how much you'll pay for available plans (if you report your income accurately)."}
