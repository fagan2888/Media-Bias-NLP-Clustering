Twenty years later, the school tries to resurrect the production. The night before the play is to open, a few students break in to trash the set, but find themselves trapped inside the school. The movie is presented like footage recorded by one of the students.\n\nGifford said the film was largely improvised with the actors playing characters who share their first names.\n\n\"They wouldn't tell us what we were going to shoot until the morning we got there, sometimes the night before if we were lucky, but they would give us the outline and say, 'These are the points that we want to hit,'\" she said. \"There were a few things that needed to be said for plot (points) that would come out later in the movie, but ultimately it kind of came down to us kind of playing off one another.\"\n\nMade on a small budget, Gifford said getting studio backing and a summer opening makes the film \"an underdog story.\"\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://www.thegallowsmovie.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cassidy Gifford hopes to prove acting chops in 'The Gallows' - AP News: NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 From Johnny Depp in \"A Nightmare .05/26/2016 3:40:53AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 From Johnny Depp in \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" to Jamie", "title": "AP News - Cassidy Gifford hopes to prove acting chops in 'The Gallows'", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2015/07/09/cassidy-gifford-hopes-to-prove-acting-chops-in-the-gallows-n2023467", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\190\\554ef6ce-19e6-400e-9cb8-3e87ec6cae60.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 From Johnny Depp in \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" to Jamie", "title": "AP News - Cassidy Gifford hopes to prove acting chops in 'The Gallows'", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2015/07/09/cassidy-gifford-hopes-to-prove-acting-chops-in-the-gallows-n2023467", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/190/554ef6ce-19e6-400e-9cb8-3e87ec6cae60.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Cassidy Gifford hopes to prove acting chops in 'The Gallows', AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca74\"", "article_summary": "\"The Gallows\" is set at a high school where a student died in a horrific accident during a school play in 1993.\nGifford said the film was largely improvised with the actors playing characters who share their first names.\n\"The Gallows,\" opening Friday, features a cast of relatively unknown actors hoping to make their mark, including Cassidy Gifford, the 21-year-old daughter of TV personality Kathie Lee Gifford and former football player Frank Gifford.\nMade on a small budget, Gifford said getting studio backing and a summer opening makes the film \"an underdog story.\"\nGifford says she's known since she was a young child that she wanted to perform."}
