Rand Paul has returned to Kentucky, relatively unscathed, to run for re-election to his U.S. Senate seat.\n\nPaul has an easy path to securing the nomination in Tuesday\u2019s primary election. With no major challengers this year, he hasn\u2019t run TV ads or participated in public debates. Paul has appeared in a series of town hall meetings across the state, touting his platform, which is essentially the same as it was during his 2010 race.\n\nA vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act, environmental regulations and intervention in foreign wars, Paul voted against budget compromises that would have avoided a government shutdown in 2013. On the campaign trail in Kentucky this spring, he defended the move.\n\n\u201cMy point is that maybe it needs to shut down so we can fix it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to do something about it.\u201d\n\nRelated Story Rand Paul\u2019s Presidential Bid Altered Kentucky\u2019s Political Landscape\n\nThere are two Republicans running against Paul \u2014 Lexington financial analyst James Gould and Louisville engineer Stephen Slaughter. Both are political newcomers and haven\u2019t run high-profile campaigns.\n\nOn his website, Slaughter says he supports construction of the Keystone-XL pipeline and creating jobs by re-industrializing the country.\n\n\u201cThis will provide options for those that are currently or formerly working in the coal industry,\u201d he states.\n\nGould says on his website that he wants to lift economic sanctions against Russia and \u201cfreeze domestic national spending on programs to respond to the rate of inflation and population growth.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Morehead News, Gould\u2019s only other run for public office was for Morehead City Council when he was a 21-year-old student at Morehead State.\n\nDuring the 2010 primary, Paul summoned Tea Party support to defeat former Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson, who had been endorsed by Sen. Mitch McConnell. Paul\u2019s isolationist views on foreign policy and surveillance fell out of favor on the national level, though, after growing worries about terrorism at home and abroad.\n\nPaul mitigates his isolationist stance by saying he favors Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cPeace through Strength\u201d mantra \u2014 that force is a necessary means to achieve peace. And the main plank of his platform is the same as it was when he was first elected in 2010: reduce federal spending.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we have to do what you all do: Spend what comes in,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to balance our budget. I\u2019m afraid they\u2019re not listening to us, that maybe what we really need is an amendment to the Constitution that says \u2018enough is enough,\u2019 you can only spend what comes in.\u201d\n\nPaul won the influential Conservative Political Action Conference presidential straw poll three years in a row. He suspended his presidential bid earlier this year, after a poor showing in the Iowa Republican Caucus.\n\nThe primary is Tuesday, May 17.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With no major challengers, Paul hasn\u2019t had to run TV ads or participate in public debates.
