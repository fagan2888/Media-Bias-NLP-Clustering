Purchasing shares in a mutual fund enables you to diversify your portfolio for less money than it would cost to buy stocks or bonds individually.\n\nBut that kind of convenience can come at a price: Since many mutual funds are actively managed, they typically carry a set of fees to cover management, distribution and other costs.\n\n\u201c[The mutual fund has] to pay the salaries of the research analysts and portfolio managers who are trying to actively make decisions and changes in the portfolio to increase returns,\u201d explains Jorge Padilla, a CFP\u00ae with Lubitz Financial in Miami.\n\nFees can vary greatly from mutual fund to mutual fund, so it\u2019s worth doing some research before you commit to investing in one. You can find details on fees through a fund\u2019s prospectus. It may also be available on the fund\u2019s website, or through an independent investment research site.\n\nRelated: Millions of Boomers Are Making This Big Retirement Mistake\n\nHere are five key fees to investigate:\n\nExpense ratio: This is the percentage of your money that mutual funds (and index mutual funds and ETFs) charge each year to cover operating expenses.\n\nFor instance, an expense ratio of 1% means that you\u2019ll pay $1 each year for every $100 you\u2019ve invested. If the expense ratio is 0.75%, you\u2019ll owe 75 cents.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Your annual return is equivalent to the overall return of your investments (say a hypothetical 5%) minus your expense ratio fee (say 1%).\n\nFor actively managed mutual funds, an expense ratio of 1% or less is generally considered to be reasonable, according to Micah Hauptman, a financial services counsel for the Consumer Federation of America.\n\nFor comparison, the average expense ratio across all types of funds was 0.64% in 2014, based on a Morningstar study.\n\nAs you evaluate your options, also keep in mind that you\u2019ll want to compare funds with similar strategies.\n\nFor example, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be fair to look at the expense ratio for a taxable bond [fund] versus a U.S. equity [fund],\u201d Smith explains. \u201cYou\u2019d want to compare apples to apples, because some areas are just more expensive.\u201d\n\nRelated: 7 Common Myths that Can Ruin Your Retirement\n\n12b-1 fees: These are included in a fund\u2019s annual expense ratio and used to cover marketing and distribution costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another cost drag on the fund\u2019s performance,\u201d Smith says. \u201cSo I\u2019d suggest people look for funds that have low to no 12b-1 charges.\u201d\n\nThese 12b-1 fees have come under scrutiny recently by the Securities and Exchange Commission and consumer advocate organizations, which claim that some companies roll other fees\u2014like adviser commissions\u2014into their 12b-1 fees without informing investors.\n\nLoad fees: You may incur these costs when you buy or sell shares\u2014it depends on the type of mutual fund you choose.\n\nA front-end loaded fund charges you a fee (generally between 3% and 8.5%) when you buy shares of that fund, while a back-end loaded fund charges a fee when you sell shares (typically between 3% and 6%).\n\nLoaded funds fall into three possible share classes: A, B or C.\n\n\u201cA\u201d shares are front loaded, \u201cB\u201d shares have a deferred sales charge (the longer you hold onto it, the lower the back-end load fee) and \u201cC\u201d shares are back-end loaded.\n\nA no-load fund doesn\u2019t charge front-end or back-end fees, so if you want to try to save on costs, look for funds with such a designation.\n\nRedemption fees: If you don\u2019t hold on to your shares long enough before selling them, some mutual funds may charge this fee.\n\nFor example, you might have to pay a 2% fee for shares held for 90 days or less, or a $7.95 fee for online transactions in which you sell funds purchased within 30 days.\n\nThe intention with redemption fees is to discourage short-term trading. \u201cIt\u2019s helping the company manage the fund better\u2014to control inflows and outflows,\u201d Smith explains.\n\nRedemption fees are credited to a fund\u2019s assets, unlike back-end load fees, which are paid out to a broker or other financial intermediary.\n\nAccount service fees: Some mutual funds may charge this fee if your balance falls below a certain minimum.\n\nAccount service fees can range anywhere from $12 a year for a mutual fund account with a balance below $2,000 to $50 per quarter for investing less than $25,000.\n\nFund managers can also charge a service fee to close out your account.\n\nRELATED: Checklist: I Want to Set Up an Investment Account\n\nThe 101 on Index Mutual Fund Fees\n\nAs the name suggests, these funds track an index, like the S&P 500. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to replicate [its] investment performance and behavior,\u201d Padilla explains.\n\nMost of the time, he adds, index mutual funds have lower investment costs than actively managed funds. So while the fee structure for index mutual funds is akin to that of traditional mutual funds, the amounts charged are generally lower.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can typically expect to pay:\n\nExpense ratio: The 1%-or-less rule also applies to index mutual funds.\n\n12b-1 fees: Index mutual funds don\u2019t rely as much on marketing as traditional mutual funds do, so there tend to be fewer 12b-1 fees associated with them.\n\n\u201cIf you compare an actively-managed fund versus an index fund, the latter doesn\u2019t have marketing costs, since it\u2019s really just mirroring an index,\u201d explains Smith.\n\nLoad fees: Plenty of index mutual funds do not tack on load fees when shares are bought or sold, according to Smith, who says it\u2019s worth seeking out no-load funds.\n\nRedemption fees: If you don\u2019t hold on to a fund for long enough before selling it, you may still run the risk of paying this fee, depending on the specific policies of your index mutual fund.\n\nAccount service fees: If your account falls below the required minimum balance, you may be subject to account service fees that are similar to those of traditional mutual funds.\n\nThe 101 on ETF Fees\n\nLike index mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may seek to track an index or group of investments. ETFs can also be actively managed.\n\nIn general, passive ETFs tend to have lower expenses than actively managed mutual funds.\n\nAnd whereas mutual funds trade just once a day, after the close of trading, shares of an ETF are bought and sold throughout the day on a stock exchange\u2014much like the shares of an individual company\u2019s stock.\n\nAs a result, the price of an ETF fluctuates as its shares are bought and sold, which isn\u2019t the case for mutual funds.\n\nETFs also come with a few unique costs that should be on your radar:\n\nBid-ask spread: Since ETFs are traded over the course of the day, there\u2019s sometimes a difference between what a buyer is willing to pay and what a seller is asking\u2014and vice versa. This is known as the bid-ask spread, and it generally averages just a few pennies per share.\n\n\u201cFor most retail investors, you want to see spreads that are under about a nickel wide,\u201d Hougan says. \u201cThe most liquid ETFs have penny-wide spreads.\u201d\n\nWhile a bid-ask spread isn\u2019t a fee per se\u2014you won\u2019t see it as a separate line item\u2014it can impact your returns, since you may be selling for less than you\u2019d like, or buying for more than you\u2019d like, depending on the spread. (Larger spreads are more common with ETFs that have less trading volume.)\n\nExpense ratio: ETFs charge an annual percentage of your invested money to cover operating costs, but it\u2019s typically on the low end of the spectrum, generally between 0.4% and 0.6%. Some providers offer funds for the core of your portfolio for under 0.2%.\n\n12b-1 fees: As with index mutual funds, ETFs don\u2019t rely as much on marketing as actively managed mutual funds do, so they don\u2019t typically charge 12b-1 fees.\n\nLoad fees: One of the benefits of investing in ETFs is that load fees do not apply\u2014no matter how much intraday trading takes place. However, there may be a transaction cost to purchase or sell an ETF.\n\nRedemption fees: Like mutual funds, some ETFs may be subject to short-term trading fees, if they\u2019re held for less than a specified period, such as 30 days.\n\nCommission fees: ETFs generally come with a commission or trading fee, since you\u2019re buying and selling shares through a brokerage account.\n\nThis is typically not a concern if you make the occasional large purchase, but ETFs with trading fees generally aren\u2019t a great fit if you engage in dollar-cost averaging\u2014investing small amounts at regular intervals\u2014since these fees can add up over time.\n\n\u201cFortunately, most of the major brokerages have a series of ETFs you can trade commission-free,\u201d Hougan points out. \u201cThose can be an option for investors who are dollar-cost averaging, or not investing large sums.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re also further proof that it pays to understand your investment-fee fine print.\n\nRELATED: 6 Rookie Portfolio Mistakes Even Seasoned Investors Make\n\nThis piece originally appeared in LearnVest.
