The service sector now accounts for up to 80 percent of U.S. GDP, depending on how it is measured. On Wednesday, trade figures released by the Commerce Department found that the service sector played a major role in the decreasing U.S. trade deficit as the sale of U.S. services abroad hit a record $60.9 billion.\n\nRelated: WikiLeaks $100K \u2018Kickstarter\u2019 for TPP Whistleblowers\n\nWikiLeaks noted in a release that this was not the first time it has been able to shed light on the ongoing TISA discussions. \u201cThe TISA release today follows the WikiLeaks publication of the secret draft financial services annex of the TISA negotiations on 19 June 2014 showing the aim to further deregulate the financial sector, despite widespread consensus that lack of oversight and regulation was the main cause of the last global financial crisis of 2008,\u201d the group said. \u201cToday's release confirms the ongoing determination to deregulate. Furthermore, standstill clauses will tie the hands of future governments to implement changes in response to changing environment.\u201d\n\nOpponents of TPP and other trade deals cheered the release and said that some of the elements revealed in the documents, including proposals to further deregulate international financial services, are a strong argument against giving President Obama what\u2019s known as Trade Promotion Authority, or the authority to bring a completed agreement before Congress for a simple up-or-down vote, with no possibility of amendments.\n\n\u201cOnce again WikiLeaks reveals what we cannot learn from our own government, a government that defaults to prefer giant trade deals that affect generations of Americans shrouded in secrecy until they are virtually adopted,\u201d said Communications Workers of America President Larry Cohen.\n\nRelated: How to Make the Trans-Pacific Partnership Work for Workers\n\nHowever, one expert in international trade warned that it would be unwise to read too much into the draft language released by WikiLeaks Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThey look like working documents,\u201d said Scott Miller who holds the William M. Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cMost of them have plenty of text that is in brackets. Bracketed texts are simply proposals. They aren\u2019t agreed to by anybody.\u201d\n\nThe former director for global trade policy at Procter & Gamble, Miller said the drafts were essentially depicting a moment in time during negotiations that have been going on for years.\n\nRelated: Nike on TPP \u2013 Just Do It, and We\u2019ll create 10,000 U.S. Jobs\n\n\u201cAt some point in time this was the status of discussions between negotiators,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming, it\u2019s fairly slow moving, and I think a lot of that has to do with the complexity of services trade.\u201d\n\nMiller said that it would be difficult to look at the documents released Wednesday and draw anything other than general conclusions about the state of negotiations.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One day after it announced an effort to crowdsource a $100,000 bounty payable to anyone who will hand over the full text of the controversial draft Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, WikiLeaks released an apparently complete draft of another major trade deal.", "title": "The Big Hole in Wikileaks' Files About Major Trade Deal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/04/Big-Hole-Wikileaks-Revelations-About-Major-Trade-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-06-22T011150Z_1_CBRE85L03BV00_RTROPTP_2_WIKILEAKS-STRATFOR.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/04/Big-Hole-Wikileaks-Revelations-About-Major-Trade-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-06-22T011150Z_1_CBRE85L03BV00_RTROPTP_2_WIKILEAKS-STRATFOR.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "One day after it announced an effort to crowdsource a $100,000 bounty payable to anyone who will hand over the full text of the controversial draft Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, WikiLeaks released an apparently complete draft of another major trade deal.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "One day after it announced an effort to crowdsource a $100,000 bounty payable to anyone who hands over the full draft text of the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, WikiLeaks released an apparently complete draft of another major trade deal, the Trade In Services Agreement.\nThe deal is being negotiated by representatives of more than 50 countries that combine to produce two-thirds of the world\u2019s GDP, and, as its name indicates, it would cover trade in services \u2014 everything from telecommunications to air travel to financial services.\nRelated: How to Make the Trans-Pacific Partnership Work for WorkersHowever, one expert in international trade warned that it would be unwise to read too much into the draft language released by WikiLeaks Wednesday.\nOn Wednesday, trade figures released by the Commerce Department found that the service sector played a major role in the decreasing U.S. trade deficit as the sale of U.S. services abroad hit a record $60.9 billion.\nThe service sector now accounts for up to 80 percent of U.S. GDP, depending on how it is measured."}
