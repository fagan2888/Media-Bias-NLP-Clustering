They will work together on discovery and development of drugs for treatment of eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, among others.\n\nProfessor Andreas Busch, Head of Global Drug Discovery and member of the Executive Committee of Bayer HealthCare said,\n\nBayer is strongly committed to further expanding its research efforts in the area of retinal diseases. The Wilmer Eye Institute\u2019s deep understanding of eye disease biology and patient care and Bayer\u2019s expertise in drug discovery and development in ophthalmology complement each other perfectly. We are pleased to partner with this renowned institute which is amount the leading scientific and clinical institutions in ophthalmology worldwide.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline is investing $95 million in a research institute to figure out how a cell\u2019s operating system works. Altius Institute for Biomedical Sciences in Seattle will be led by John Stamatoyannopoulos, of the University of Washington School of Medicine\n\nForbes quoted Stamatoyannopoulos:\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the genome only encodes some upstream potentiality, and doesn\u2019t read out what the organism is actually doing,\u201d Stamatoyannopoulos said. \u201cIt\u2019s packaged in different ways in different cells\u2026we are reading how the cell is working, and using the genome as a scaffold for all the things it does.\u201d Looking at the downstream manifestation of the genome, in cells, he said, \u201cis going to be much more relevant to clinical medicine.\u201d\n\nLIFE SCIENCES\n\nResearchers developed a way to contain the spread of GMOs by keeping them under a molecular lock. The lock is a series of genetic mutations that inactivate the microbe unless a certain molecule is added to re-enable it.\n\nCyMedica Orthopedics earned $11.5 million in Series A funding from investors to help bring its pre- and post-surgery muscle strengthening brace to market.\n\nThe FDA finalized a new policy for how drug product manufacturers must label products that contain salts.\n\nPAYERS-PROVIDERS\n\nThe Children\u2019s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. agreed to pay $12.9 million to resolve violated allegations under the False Claims Act.\n\nThe University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics is thinking about installing barriers around parking ramps due to multiple suicides and suicide attempts by people jumping from the higher levels of the parking garages.\n\nUS poison control centers experienced a 229% increase in number of calls related to synthetic marijuana use this year compared to last year.

These oils are found primarily in junk foods like cookies and french fries. The regulator said the oils are the main source of artificially manufactured fats in processed foods and are linked to heart disease.\n\nA LITTLE EXTRA\n\nThe death of white blood cells was filmed for the first time. Check out the video.\n\nThe Morning Read provides a 24-hour wrap up of everything else healthcare\u2019s innovators need to know about the business of medicine (and beyond).
