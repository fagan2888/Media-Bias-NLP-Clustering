As the 6th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act approaches, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to analyze the effectiveness of President Obama’s healthcare program.

Senator Scott (R-SC) says if lawmakers really want to move forward, they need to replace Obamacare.

Senators questioned officials from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), asking how healthcare.gov, and the Affordable Care Act in general, can improve.

"At the end of the day, not only is Healthcare.gov still somewhat of a wreck, the fact of the matter is that the law is moving in the wrong direction, not the right direction,” said Senator Tim Scott (R-SC).

Healtchare.gov has transformed since its rocky start in 2013, but Senator Scott still see issues. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) says it’s time to move on.

"It needs improvements, but this going back and criticizing without actually trying to make the improvements…just trying to politicize it, they’ve politicized this for six years now,” said Brown.

One of the focuses of the hearing was fraud in the healthcare system. Some senators say it’s non-existent, others say the government isn’t trying hard enough to find it.

"The person who does not look for fraud did not find fraud because he was not looking for something,” said Scott.

Six years in, Senator Brown wants lawmakers to improve on the shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act, rather than constantly trying to repeal it.

"The public won’t stand for a repeal of it,” said Brown. "The President would veto it, republicans know that. Let’s do this right and move forward.”

Scott won’t budge on repealing the law.

"If we were going to move forward, we would find a way to replace Obamacare,” said Scott.

As of January of this year, HHS says almost 13 million people had signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
