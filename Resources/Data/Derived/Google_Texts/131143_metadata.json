Maryland led by as many as 18 points late, and Brene Moseley and Brionna Jones each finished with 10 points.\n\nTori Jankoska led Michigan State (24-8) with 12 points. The Spartans made just two of 19 3-point attempts.\n\nMichigan State led until the halfway point of the second quarter, when Maryland jumped ahead by two points on Chloe Pavlech\u2019s 3-pointer. The Spartans answered quickly with a 7-0 run that put them in front, 26-21, forcing Maryland to call a timeout.\n\nMichigan State went into halftime ahead, 26-24. Jankoska hit a 3-pointer with two seconds left in the half that would have given Michigan State a five-point lead, but she was called for traveling.\n\nThe back-and-forth scoring continued in the third. Maryland tied the score at 30-30 with about six minutes remaining in the period.\n\nThe Terrapins took advantage of a four-minute Michigan State scoring drought. Maryland\u2019s 38-30 lead forced a Michigan State timeout, and after that, it appeared the Spartans had an answer when Aerial Powers made back-to-back jump shots to pull the Spartans within four.\n\nThen came Maryland\u2019s 9-2 run to start the fourth. That put the Terrapins up 13 points, and Michigan State never pulled back within single digits.\n\nThe Terrapins have won the Big Ten regular-season title and tournament in each of their first two seasons since leaving the ACC.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shatori Walker-Kimbrough scored 19 points as top-seeded Maryland won its second Big Ten tournament title in its two years in the conference, defeating No. 3 seed Michigan State, 60-44.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Shatori Walker-Kimbrough scored 19 points as top-seeded Maryland won its second Big Ten tournament title in its two years in the conference, defeating No. 3 seed Michigan State, 60-44.", "title": "Maryland outlasts Michigan State, wins second Big Ten tournament title", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/6/maryland-outlasts-michigan-state-wins-second-big-t/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/06/AP_925676915889.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/06/AP_925676915889.jpg", "description": "Shatori Walker-Kimbrough scored 19 points as top-seeded Maryland won its second Big Ten tournament title in its two years in the conference, defeating No. 3 seed Michigan State, 60-44.", "card": "summary", "title": "Maryland outlasts Michigan State, wins second Big Ten tournament title"}, "Author": "Corey Elliot", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports"}, "article_summary": "19 Michigan State, 60-44, on Sunday night for its second consecutive Big Ten tournament title.\nMichigan State led until the halfway point of the second quarter, when Maryland jumped ahead by two points on Chloe Pavlech\u2019s 3-pointer.\nTori Jankoska led Michigan State (24-8) with 12 points.\nMaryland led by as many as 18 points late, and Brene Moseley and Brionna Jones each finished with 10 points.\nThat put the Terrapins up 13 points, and Michigan State never pulled back within single digits."}
