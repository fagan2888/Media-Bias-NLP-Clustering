Senate Votes To Repeal ObamaCare, Defund Planned Parenthood

In a 52-47 vote, the Senate passed a fast-track measure Thursday designed to unravel key ObamaCare provisions and defund Planned Parenthood for one year.

The budgetary tool known as reconciliation prevented the possibility of a filibuster and only required 51 votes to pass the upper chamber, but allowed for members of both parties to add an unlimited number of amendments.

A number amendments attached by Democrats, including a series of anti-gun measures and a provision allowing the controversial women’s health organization to keep its federal funding in place were tabled by a majority vote.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell struggled to gain the support needed to push the measure through, with conservatives arguing it didn’t go far enough to completely dismantle the Affordable Care Act and moderates expressing concern over the provision defunding Planned Parenthood.

Sens. Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Marco Rubio, who initial didn’t support the measure since it didn’t fully repeal the law,were swayed into supporting the measure.

“The vote we took today is a significant step towards repealing every word of Obamacare,” Cruz said in a statement following its passage. “This bill repeals as much of that failed law as we can under arcane Senate rules and the narrow guidelines of the budget.”
