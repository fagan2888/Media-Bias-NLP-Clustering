Holder decision in 2013, voters in North Carolina and Arizona, which both have a long history of voter suppression, are witnessing firsthand what elections in those states are like without the Act\u2019s protections.\n\n\u201cLeaders said if federal scrutiny had been required before making changes,\u201d as the Voting Rights Act once required, CNN reported, \u201cTuesday\u2019s situation would have never happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve waited my entire adult life, and I finally find somebody I want to vote for, and they deny me,\u201d Jennifer Robbins, a Bernie Sanders supporter in Arizona, told the Huffington Post. \u201cI left there crying. It\u2019s always been my dream to vote, but I hadn\u2019t found a politician I liked enough to vote for.\u201d\n\nDespite possessing a voter registration card that listed her as a registered Democrat, and after waiting for hours in line to vote, Robbins was told at the polling station that the computer system had her listed as an Independent. Robbins insisted the poll worker scan her registration card once again, and the second time the system had her registered to a party\u2014the Republican Party. She was told she could file a provisional ballot for the Democratic primary, but that it \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t count,\u201d according to the Huffington Post.\n\nIndeed, Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton told Salon that \u201cArizona has a history of rejecting large amounts of provisional ballots and mail-in ballots.\u201d\n\nStanton has written a letter (pdf) to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch requesting that the Department of Justice investigate the allegations of voter suppression in Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable anywhere in the United States, and I am angry that County elections officials allowed it to happen in my city,\u201d the Phoenix mayor said to Salon. Over 140,000 people have signed a White House petition asking for a federal investigation of Arizona\u2019s voting practices. The Maricopa County recorder, Helen Purcell, has taken responsibility for Tuesday\u2019s disastrous voting conditions but refuses to resign, and the state legislature plans to hold a special hearing on Monday about the debacle. And in North Carolina\u2019s primary earlier this month, \u201cmany low-income, minority, student, and elderly voters lost the right to have their voice heard in our democracy,\u201d the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights lamented. A lawsuit on behalf of North Carolina voters is currently challenging that state\u2019s new voter ID laws as unconstitutional and intentionally discriminatory. \u201cThe presidential election will be the first since the Supreme Court dismantled a crucial section of the Voting Rights Act in 2013,\u201d as the New York Times observed, \u201cfreeing nine states, including Arizona and parts of seven others, to change their election laws without advance federal approval.\u201d The newspaper drew a dire picture of the harsh voting restrictions enacted by states since 2013: Wisconsin, which holds its primary elections April 5, is one of nine states with strict photo ID requirements. Thirty-three states have some form of voter ID. Kansas has enacted proof-of-citizenship requirements for all voter registration, a move that has disproportionately affected young voters and those attempting to register for the first time. North Carolina allows a registered voter to challenge the identity and eligibility of any voter casting a ballot in the same county. On March 9, Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, signed a law that made it a felony to collect ballots for others in Arizona and bring them to the polls. Arizona also has \u201ca long history of discrimination against minorities, preventing American Indians from voting for much of its history because they were considered \u2018wards of the nation,\u2019 imposing English literacy tests on prospective voters and printing English-only election materials even as the state\u2019s Spanish-speaking population grew,\u201d the Times points out. Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has continued to speak out against the fiasco in Arizona, characterizing it as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d in a news conference afterward. The coalition of civil rights groups pleaded, \u201cfor the sake of the integrity of the upcoming general election, we urge Congress to act now.\u201d \u201cThe disenfranchisement taking place in these states since freed from Section 5 oversight is a canary in the coal mine, a sign of things to come, as we approach the first presidential election in 50 years without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act,\u201d the Leadership Conference argued, pointing out that two laws that would reinstate the former protections of the Voting Rights Act are currently languishing in Congress.
