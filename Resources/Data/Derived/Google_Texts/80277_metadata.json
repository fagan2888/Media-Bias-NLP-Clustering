Rittenhouse nightclub that Verdi's L&I position would benefit the club if it hired Fresta as a manager and purchased its alcohol from the distributor, Chappy's Beer, Butts, & Bets, federal prosecutors said. Even after Fresta stopped working at the club, prosecutors said, he asked its owners to continue paying him $400 a week and another $300 in kickbacks, allegedly for Verdi and other L&I officials. The nightclub paid more than $19,990, prosecutors said, which Fresta told its owners would save the nightclub from being shut down.\n\nFresta pleaded guilty in federal court in Philadelphia to one count of extortion. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His sentencing is scheduled for July 15. - Laura McCrystal", "article_metadata": {"contenttype": "Article", "publication": "Philadelphia Inquirer", "pubdate": 20160525, "title": "Fla. man admits role in Phila. extortion scheme", "og": {"site_name": "Philly.com", "description": "A Florida man pleaded guilty Thursday to playing a role in an extortion scheme involving a beer distributor and an official with Philadelphia's Department of Licenses and Inspections.", "title": "Fla. man admits role in Phila. extortion scheme", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20150424_Fla__man_admits_role_in_Phila__extortion_scheme.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/designimages/pcom-FB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentid": 301140461, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20150424_Fla__man_admits_role_in_Phila__extortion_scheme.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/designimages/Philly_Twitter_Generic_880x440.jpg", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fla. man admits role in Phila. extortion scheme"}, "cg": "news", "searchdate": "2015-04-23", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-23T14:57:33-04:00", "editdate": "20150423T14:57:33", "fb": {"app_id": 938226082960499}, "sourcepublication": "Inquirer", "google-site-verification": "db3T5L3C8_JvO-55gJ22lGGUnZLlNulgzTwX1NhCV3o", "verify-v1": "3x82DC93LZlv0I/hQEBoyVVjlGPtX7VxHFgv1upr+9I=", "y_key": "ccf0cd67e5f1e33c", "livedate": "20150423T14:57:33", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A Florida man pleaded guilty Thursday to playing a role in an extortion scheme involving a beer distributor and an official with Philadelphia's Department of Licenses and Inspections."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc7b\"", "article_summary": "A Florida man pleaded guilty Thursday to playing a role in an extortion scheme involving a beer distributor and an official with Philadelphia's Department of Licenses and Inspections.\nFresta told O.N.E.\nThe nightclub paid more than $19,990, prosecutors said, which Fresta told its owners would save the nightclub from being shut down.\nFresta pleaded guilty in federal court in Philadelphia to one count of extortion.\nRittenhouse nightclub that Verdi's L&I position would benefit the club if it hired Fresta as a manager and purchased its alcohol from the distributor, Chappy's Beer, Butts, & Bets, federal prosecutors said."}
