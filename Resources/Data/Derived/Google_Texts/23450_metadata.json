The shift could cost up to $200,000 per product, according to USA Today.\n\n\u201cFor some companies, it may not even be feasible to try and develop an alternative,\u201d Daren Bakst, a research fellow in agricultural policy for The Heritage Foundation said. \u201cProducts that exist today may not exist in the near future due to this de facto ban.\u201d\n\nHe predicts consumers will ultimately bear the cost of the shift.\n\nThe FDA announced the ban Tuesday, citing a threat to public health. All food manufacturers will have to phase artificial trans fats out of their products by 2018, a move they estimate could prevent 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths from heart disease each year.\n\nBut consumers have already drastically reduced trans fat consumption over the past decade.\n\nAccording to the FDA, \u201cconsumption of trans fat from products containing partially hydrogenated oils has declined dramatically from 4.6 grams per day in 2003 to about 1 gram per day in 2012.\u201d The decline marks a 78 percent drop.\n\n\u201cThe FDA\u2019s actions are about government arrogance, and its misguided belief that agency bureaucrats know what people should and shouldn\u2019t eat,\u201d Bakst said. \u201cPeople can make voluntary dietary choices on their own. Those choices, even if unwise in the eyes of some, should be respected.\u201d\n\nPrior to the FDA\u2019s announcement, products containing less than 0.5 grams of trans fats per serving could remain on shelves without including the ingredient on the label. Under new law, manufacturers cannot use the ingredient without explicit permission from regulators.\n\nBakst said the issue boils down to the government respecting individual freedom.\n\n\u201cThe dose makes the poison,\u201d Bakst said. \u201cNobody is going to die because they ate a bag of microwave popcorn or had a cupcake with frosting.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Food and Drug Administration estimates its newly announced ban on artificial trans fats could hit food manufacturers with $12-to-$14 billion in losses.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration estimates its newly announced ban on artificial trans fats could hit food manufacturers with $12-to-$14 billion in losses.", "title": "Trans Fat Ban Could Cost Food Manufacturers Billions", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150618_TransFat_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-18T13:43:02+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1fjQzY7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration estimates its newly announced ban on artificial trans fats could hit food manufacturers with $12-to-$14 billion in losses.", "title": "Trans Fat Ban Could Cost Food Manufacturers Billions", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150618_TransFat_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "individual freedom", "published_time": "2015-06-18T12:51:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-18T13:43:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Food and Drug Administration, FDA, trans fats"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae03\"", "article_summary": "The Food and Drug Administration estimates its newly announced ban on artificial trans fats could hit food manufacturers with $12-to-$14 billion in losses.\nAll food manufacturers will have to phase artificial trans fats out of their products by 2018, a move they estimate could prevent 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths from heart disease each year.\nBut consumers have already drastically reduced trans fat consumption over the past decade.\nUnder new law, manufacturers cannot use the ingredient without explicit permission from regulators.\nCompanies using trans fats in their products\u2014foods such as french fries and doughnuts\u2014will need to research and test new ingredients to maintain shelf life and flavor, relabeling and repackaging products to adhere to the new standards."}
