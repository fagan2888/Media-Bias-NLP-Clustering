Credit: Ed/Flickr\n\nWhen politicians, pundits and other know-it-alls tussle over whether to renovate, repeal or preserve Obamacare, they talk about Medicare expansion, the enrollment mandate and the ban on excluding pre-existing conditions. No one complains about one key provision: that insurers pay fully, with no copay or deductible required, for the most effective preventive procedures.\n\nYou might think that\u2019s because that requirement is so clear and noncontroversial that no one, not even a flinty-eyed insurance adjuster, could look askance at it. If so, you would be wrong.\n\nRegence BlueShield, the state\u2019s and region\u2019s largest insurer, doesn\u2019t dispute that provision openly. In fact, Regence doesn\u2019t seem to want to talk about it at all. But where it counts, in the processing of claims from thousands of member-customers, Regence, acting on behalf of the state of Washington, is brazenly defying the ACA\u2019s requirement, amplified by follow-up federal directives, to cover one preventive procedure with proven lifesaving value.\n\nThat procedure is colonoscopy, which uses a flexible probe to detect, at a harmless early stage, the polyps that may grow into colon and rectal cancers and remove them on the spot with a hot wire extended from the probe. The U.S. Cancer Society deems it the most \u201csensitive\u201d \u2013 i.e. effective \u2013 method for detecting colorectal cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the federal panel charged with evaluating preventive procedures, gives it a top \u201cA\u201d rating. You, too, may know or know of people who met a sad early end because they would not or did not have their innards probed.\n\nThree national gastroenterological societies claim that colonoscopies could prevent half the 50,000-plus deaths from colorectal cancer in the United States each year. A 2007 study published by the National Institutes of Health found that they could prevent 64 percent of all colorectal cancers. If everyone over 50 got scanned on schedule (typically every 10 years), they\u2019d also save our perversely incentivized medical system a ton of cash; the cost of colonoscopies pales before the $250,000-plus tab to treat advanced colorectal cancer.\n\nStill, that cost is a lot higher than the bill for other preventive measures such as immunizations, eye exams, pap smears and daily aspirin. One leading health blog found cash patients paying anywhere from $600 to $5,400 for colonoscopies that take as little as half an hour, depending on provider, region and whether any polyps got snipped in the process. Some gastrointestinal clinics pump up the bill by administering full anaesthesia, which isn\u2019t needed, and charging duplicate facilities charges if polyps are found. I know someone who paid cash for a colonoscopy at a top private hospital in Rio de Janeiro \u2013 and paid less than the insurance copay for one in Seattle.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act now dangling before the U.S. Supreme Court supposedly eliminated such concerns; it mandates that insurers fully cover colonoscopies along with other approved preventive procedures. But when I called a gastroenterology clinic to schedule a scoping, the payments adviser asked about my insurance \u2013 the Uniform Medical Plan for Washington state employees, administered by Regence BlueShield, about as good as insurance gets \u2013 and recited a warning she\u2019d clearly given many times before: Regence would cover the whole thing as long as nothing got snipped. But the cost of removing and testing any polyps found, even benign, would be subject to deductible and copayments.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound right, I said; snipping polyps is an integral part of colonoscopies. (Indeed, it\u2019s done in about a quarter of them.) She agreed, and lamented that Regence and other insurers didn\u2019t see it that way: \u201cUnfortunately, it prevents some people from getting screened. We have new guidelines saying it should be covered, but the insurance companies keep finding ways to get around them. Regence is one of the better plans, actually. Some of the others get really sticky about allowing colonoscopies at all \u2013 probably some of the smaller plans that got grandfathered in\u201d when the ACA arrived.\n\nI\u2019m calling Regence about this, I said. \u201cGood luck,\u201d she said.\n\nI called and discovered that Regence\u2019s policy was even stranger than the clinic had said: If even one measly might-be polyp was found, the entire colonoscopy would be deemed a treatment rather than preventive procedure, requiring copay and deductible payments. The Regence rep tried to shift the blame to the clinic: \u201cIt just depends how they code the procedure.\u201d But aren\u2019t they required to use certain codes if they snip, and won\u2019t you then charge it as a diagnostic procedure? I didn\u2019t get a straight answer, so I took a metaphysical tack: How can something like a colonoscopy be transformed midway in its course? If it starts out preventive, doesn\u2019t it remain preventive, whatever else it may become? That\u2019s just the way it is, she said.\n\nSo I looked for backup. I called the Washington Insurance Commissioner\u2019s Office and reached a helpful health-care compliance analyst named Robert Solano. He said Regence\u2019s policy was particularly dismaying since the U.S. Department of Labor, which which oversees implementation of the ACA, had explicitly declared otherwise in the FAQs about Affordable Care Act Implementation that it issued in February 2013. To wit: Because \u201cpolyp removal is an integral part of a colonoscopy \u2026 the plan or issuer may not impose cost-sharing with respect to a polyp removal during a colonoscopy performed as a screening procedure.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Solano added, because the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s Office had no authority over self-insured plans such as the state\u2019s, it couldn\u2019t tell Regence what to do. But he offered to send a letter, admittedly toothless, on my behalf. Maybe Regence would back down.\n\nRegence didn\u2019t. Its reply, auto-signed by \u201cWendie G., Correspondence Ambassador,\u201d is a masterpiece of evasion and obfuscation. It half-concedes that \u201cservices designated with an A or B rating by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) may be covered as preventive care.\u201d Emphasis added; note the substitution of \u201cmay\u201d for the actual mandatory language.\n\nWendie G. goes on to blame providers for billing colonoscopies \u201cas medical treatment instead of a preventive service.\u201d Once they do that, the insurer has no choice but to charge a cost-share for it.\n\nI called the gastroenterology clinic back and read that hair-splitting response to Angela, who affirmed that it was indeed horse pucky. We just report what we do, she explained. They decide how to define it.\n\nSolano at the Insurance\u2019s Commissioner\u2019s office suggested I try the feds next, and gave me a number to call at the U.S. Department of Labor. And so I marched into the bureaucratic labyrinth.\n\nA sympathetic claims analyst answered immediately at DOL. She affirmed that \u201cif the primary visit is for colonoscopy, they have to pay for that. If any surgery is involved they can charge cost share for that.\u201d I explained again what Regence contended \u2013 that if even one might-be polyp got snipped for testing, the entire colonoscopy became, in effect, surgery. \u201cOh my gosh, that\u2019s wrong!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong under the public health services rules and the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, she explained, DOL couldn\u2019t do anything about it either; thanks to another wrinkle in the law, it had jurisdiction only over private employers. Public-sector workers like me had to go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cI don\u2019t like to pass the buck, but you have three different entities involved, HHS, IRS, and DOL. HHS doesn\u2019t do much, doesn\u2019t answer the phones, so it may take a week or so for them to get back. The IRS is a little better. A lot of participants will contact us because they don\u2019t hear back from HHS or IRS.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t feel bad if your head is spinning, she added. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand. It\u2019s difficult for us to understand. It\u2019s a confusing piece of legislation.\u201d She also gave me a number to try at try the state Public Employee Benefits Board.\n\nNo help there. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot we can do about that,\u201d said the guy who answered at the Benefits Board. \u201cWe basically deal with retirees\u2019 health care, COBRA, that sort of thing. But I\u2019ll transfer you to Doug Sample, who\u2019s in charge of active employees.\u201d Doug Sample answered, but interrupted as I started to recite my plaint. \u201cWait \u2013 there are two Doug Samples here. I\u2019ll send you over to the right one.\u201d It must be tough being the wrong Doug Sample and getting the other Doug Sample\u2019s calls, I said. He laughed. \u201cIt happens all the time.\u201d\n\nTwo Doug Samples? I started expecting John Cleese to appear, walking funny and asking if I had a Form Z4763YH882.\n\n(Later, when I finally reached the right Doug Sample, he apologized and explained that he was also a wrong Doug Sample; he dealt only with payments, not coverage issues. But he offered to try to forward my questions to somebody who could speak to them.)\n\nBy now I realized there might be something here worth writing about here, and sought comment from Regence. I left messages for three media reps listed on its website and never heard back from any of them.\n\nI did however hear back from a concerned but apparently overwhelmed claims analyst at U.S. DHHS \u2013 sure enough, a week or so after leaving a message. \u201cI haven\u2019t dealt with this issue in several years,\u201d she said after I told my tale yet again. \u201cI heard it many, many times in 2010. But once that Frequently Asked Questions document was issued, it seemed to clear things up\u201d (See this 2011 Crosscut story by Harris Meyer on colonoscopy payment dodges then.)\n\n\u201cThis definitely sounds like something that shouldn\u2019t be happening, and we do have jurisdiction. So once I have your information I\u2019ll forward it to the appropriate team.\u201d\n\nThat was mid-January. I forwarded all the documents and letters I had but didn\u2019t hear back till March 30. She called, apologized for not following up sooner, took down my account again, and said she\u2019d forward it to her boss. \u201cHe\u2019ll confirm whether this is being done [by Regence] and then take steps to rectify the situation.\u201d\n\nBy then, however, I didn\u2019t have any skin in the game, or other tissue. I\u2019d performed the obligatory purging, gotten doped out on the gastroenterologist\u2019s gurney, and gotten an all-clear on my innards. No snip, no fault.\n\nBut I\u2019m sure thousands \u2013 millions? \u2013 of others who\u2019ve reached the age of colonoscopy aren\u2019t so lucky. They\u2019re getting reamed twice, the second time when they get their bills and discover how much an ounce of prevention costs when an insurance company decides not to call it prevention.\n\nI suppose it\u2019s no surprise Regence and, doubtless, other insurers (Regence is indeed one of the better ones) take advantage of this de facto loophole in a law that they helped write. In contrast to so many other criticisms of the ACA, however, the issue here isn\u2019t complexity; the prevention provision is pretty straightforward. It\u2019s the creakiness and Balkanization of the governmental systems that are supposed to enforce it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington state employees are caught in an insurance dodge about one of the key Obamacare provisions for prevention, coverage of colonoscopies.", "og": {"site_name": "Crosscut", "description": "Washington state employees are caught in an insurance dodge about one of the key Obamacare provisions for prevention, coverage of colonoscopies.", "title": "The big Washington dodge on Obamacare's prevention provision | Crosscut", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://crosscut.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colonscopy-preparation.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-18T16:50:30+00:00", "url": "http://crosscut.com/2015/05/the-big-washington-dodge-on-obamacares-prevention-provision/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Crosscut", "description": "Washington state employees are caught in an insurance dodge about one of the key Obamacare provisions for prevention, coverage of colonoscopies.", "title": "The big Washington dodge on Obamacare's prevention provision | Crosscut", "image": {"src": "http://crosscut.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colonscopy-preparation.jpg"}, "creator": "@seattleflotsam", "site": "@crosscut", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/crosscut", "section": "National", "tag": "Under the Dome", "published_time": "2015-05-19T05:00:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-18T16:50:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "igtS1t21nZf1dY_iVMxwDzsgOg2W7gG_PUdQ5pyq09k", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "But I\u2019ll transfer you to Doug Sample, who\u2019s in charge of active employees.\u201d Doug Sample answered, but interrupted as I started to recite my plaint.\n(Later, when I finally reached the right Doug Sample, he apologized and explained that he was also a wrong Doug Sample; he dealt only with payments, not coverage issues.\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the federal panel charged with evaluating preventive procedures, gives it a top \u201cA\u201d rating.\nIf it starts out preventive, doesn\u2019t it remain preventive, whatever else it may become?\nIn fact, Regence doesn\u2019t seem to want to talk about it at all."}
