The departure of Colbert\u2019s Colbeard in his debut \u201cLate Show\u201d video marked the first of many promotional clips blazoning his ascension as one of the greatest network talk show hosts in history. A bold declaration? Perhaps. I stand by it, though.\n\nWhen word broke last year that Colbert would succeed David Letterman as the host of \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d I was beyond ecstatic. \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d was revolutionary in its day, but it was time to shed what had slowly become a wan premise and reach the apogee of his comedic greatness. Right?\n\nMuch to my surprise, there were many naysayers. A few were simply angry that \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d would have to end. Some attributed his greatness to the character he created on the show, \u201cStephen Colbert\u201d (whenever his name appears in quotes from here on out, it refers to the character he portrayed). Others thought the key was his risibly staunch commitment to said character. Interestingly, each strand of pessimism had a unifying thread: The banality of the network talk show format would impede his brilliance at best and destroy it at worst.\n\nTo that I say, \u201cPshaw!\u201d Here are five reasons why Colbert\u2019s version of \u201cThe Late Show\u201d will catapult him to the heights of Carson and make you forget all about \u201cThe Report.\u201d\n\n1. He\u2019s smarter than almost anybody in comedy\n\nThere are few mainstream comedians sharper than Colbert. Offhand, Steve Martin and Conan O\u2019Brien are the only names that come to mind. Last year, Norm MacDonald reminisced about Colbert\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d audition, saying, \u201cThe material was almost scholarly. I don\u2019t want to say it was beyond Conan, but it was beyond any educated person. It was more almost like he was just an original thinker. I remember being shocked that he didn\u2019t get the job.\u201d\n\nThe best comedians combine three things in a seemingly effortless manner: wit, timing and intelligence. Wit and intelligence are closely related, but they\u2019re not always inextricably linked. A funnyman can get by with the first two items on the list, but adding a keen intellect dramatically intensifies everything. It\u2019s like comedy MSG, and Colbert has it in droves.\n\nLike Martin, Colbert studied philosophy in college (before transferring to Northwestern, ooh la la). His appreciation for the subject can be seen in the way he thoughtfully deconstructs ideas and then meticulously reconstructs them. That was the true genius of \u201cThe Colbert Report.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have to maintain a single character for a decade to showcase this.\n\n2. He not only embraces the absurd, but optimistically embodies it\n\nThe root of comedy is the subversion of expectations. The laughs come from the absurdity present in trying to reconcile what was expected with what was presented. For some comedians, the absurdity is doled out a spoonful at a time. For Colbert, it\u2019s measured in dump trucks. This is one of the biggest lessons to be learned from his 1,447-episode stint as \u201cStephen Colbert,\u201d oafish conservative pundit.\n\nOn the show, \u201cColbert\u201d saw the world around him with a certain amount of glee and wonder. It was a ridiculous approach to a character with an already ridiculous worldview and sense of self. If \u201cStephen Colbert\u201d were portrayed with a snide demeanor (i.e., as an actual conservative talking head), he would\u2019ve worn thin almost immediately. The choice to play him as a 6-year-old boy on his first trip to the toy store gave \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d longevity.\n\nIt also did something else \u2014 which was the secret to the character\u2019s success. It made him human. Humanizing a megalomaniacal narcissist is about as absurd as it gets. Colbert did it with aplomb. And while doing it, he not-so-subtly reminded us that even our ridiculous political enemies are human.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We've only scratched the surface of the man's genius \u2014 now that he's free from his character, the real fun begins", "title": "5 reasons why Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show\u201d will make you forget all about \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "We've only scratched the surface of the man's genius \u2014 now that he's free from his character, the real fun begins", "title": "5 reasons why Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show\u201d will make you forget all about \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/07/5_reasons_why_stephen_colberts_the_late_show_will_make_you_forget_all_about_the_colbert_report/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/stephen_colbert11.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We've only scratched the surface of the man's genius \u2014 now that he's free from his character, the real fun begins", "title": "5 reasons why Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show\u201d will make you forget all about \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/stephen_colbert11.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean Cannon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Comedy, Late Night, late night talk shows, Stephen Colbert, The Colbert Report, The Late Show, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1da2\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Comedy, Late Night, late night talk shows, Stephen Colbert, The Colbert Report, The Late Show, TV, Entertainment NewsStephen Colbert resurfaced this week, giving us the definitive rendition of \u201cCamptown Races\u201d in the process.\nThis is one of the biggest lessons to be learned from his 1,447-episode stint as \u201cStephen Colbert,\u201d oafish conservative pundit.\nThe choice to play him as a 6-year-old boy on his first trip to the toy store gave \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d longevity.\nIf \u201cStephen Colbert\u201d were portrayed with a snide demeanor (i.e., as an actual conservative talking head), he would\u2019ve worn thin almost immediately.\nA few were simply angry that \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d would have to end."}
