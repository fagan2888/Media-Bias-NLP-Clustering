WOONSOCKET, R.I., Jan. 2 (UPI) -- As Affordable Care Act coverage gets under way for millions of U.S. adults, CVS Caremark will work with patients to avoid medication disruption, officials say.

"CVS/pharmacy is committed to assisting our patients who may encounter disruptions in their prescription insurance coverage beginning Jan, 1," Helena B. Foulkes, president, CVS/pharmacy and executive vice president, CVS Caremark, said in a statement.

"Our pharmacy teams will provide information to help patients contact the appropriate health plan or insurance exchange, and we are actively communicating with insurance plans and government agencies to help minimize disruption to care whenever possible."

Foulkes said CVS Caremark is ready to help patients who might experience coverage issues or have questions as they access care and prescription medications under new plans for the first time.

"Our pharmacy teams will provide information to help patients contact the appropriate health plan or insurance exchange, and we are actively communicating with insurance plans and government agencies to help minimize disruption to care whenever possible," Foulkes said.

In some circumstances and based on clinical considerations, CVS/pharmacy will assist patients who are experiencing a temporary disruption in insurance coverage with a transitional or "bridge" supply of medication to support their continuity of care. A bridge supply is a prescription of 15 or 30 days.

For patients who express financial hardship, a bridge supply may be provided as a courtesy to help them remain adherent to their medication therapy while they resolve their coverage issues.

"We want to play our part in the medical community to support our patients' healthcare needs during this time because some plan details are still being determined," said Dr. Andrew Sussman, president of MinuteClinic and senior vice president/associate chief medical officer, CVS Caremark.
