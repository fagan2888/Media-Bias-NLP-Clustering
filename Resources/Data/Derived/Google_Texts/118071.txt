Kesha Rogers, a follower of the controversial Lyndon LaRouche movement, has lost the Democratic primary runoff in Texas' Senate race, the Associated Press reports .

Rogers was bested by Dallas dentist David Alameel, who was backed by the Texas Democratic Party.

On March 4, no candidate secured a majority of the vote in the election for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in Texas. Dallas dentist David Alameel received 47.1 percent of the vote, and political activist Kesha Rogers garnered 21.7 percent. Texas Democrats will choose between the two of them in a runoff contest Tuesday. The winner will face a long-shot bid against incumbent Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).

The results were somewhat embarrassing for the Texas Democratic Party. Rogers is a follower of Lyndon LaRouche, who heads a fringe political movement that has been compared to a cult. His supporters are often seen carrying signs depicting Obama with a Hitler mustache. One of Rogers' own campaign posters features that image, and reads, "Down with the Traitor! Impeach!"

Rogers has compared Obamacare to the policies of the Nazi regime.
