Basically, Obamacare isn\u2019t complicated because government social insurance programs have to be complicated: neither Social Security nor Medicare are complex in structure. It\u2019s complicated because political constraints made a straightforward single-payer system unachievable.\n\nIt\u2019s been clear all along that the Affordable Care Act sets up a sort of Rube Goldberg device, a complicated system that in the end is supposed to more or less simulate the results of single-payer, but keeping private insurance companies in the mix and holding down the headline amount of government outlays through means-testing. This doesn\u2019t make it unworkable: state exchanges are working, and healthcare.gov will probably get fixed before the whole thing kicks in. But it did make a botched rollout much more likely.\n\nSo Konczal is right to say that the implementation problems aren\u2019t revealing problems with the idea of social insurance; they\u2019re revealing the price we pay for insisting on keeping insurance companies in the mix, when they serve little useful purpose.\n\nSo does this mean that liberals should have insisted on single-payer or nothing? No. Single-payer wasn\u2019t going to happen \u2014 partly because of the insurance lobby\u2019s power, partly because voters wouldn\u2019t have gone for a system that took away their existing coverage and replaced it with the unknown. Yes, Obamacare is a somewhat awkward kludge, but if that\u2019s what it took to cover the uninsured, so be it.\n\nAnd although the botched rollout is infuriating \u2014 count me among those who believe that liberals best serve their own cause by admitting that, not trying to cover for the botch \u2014 the odds remain high that this will work, and make America a much better place.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131026095839, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 26, 2013", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Why Is Obamacare Complicated?
