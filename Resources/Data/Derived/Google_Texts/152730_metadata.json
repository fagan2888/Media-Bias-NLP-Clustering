(And that on top of the several million people whose health insurance subsidies were just saved by the previous Supreme Court decision, on Obamacare.)\n\nNot to rain on the weddings, but it\u2019s also likely that many employers\u2019 \u201cdomestic partner\u201d benefits will go away. The picture is complex, but a study just out in JAMA finds that legalizing gay marriage does indeed increase employer-based health insurance coverage for same-sex partners. It looked at New York after gay marriage was legalized there in 2011, and more than 12,000 same-sex couples wed. From the press release:\n\nCompared with men in opposite-sex relationships, same-sex marriage was associated with a 6.3 percentage point increase in ESI [employer-sponsored health insurance] and a 2.2 percentage point reduction in Medicaid coverage for men in same-sex relationships. Same-sex marriage was also associated with an 8.9 percentage point increase in ESI and a 3.9 percentage point reduction in Medicaid coverage for women in same-sex relationships vs women in opposite-sex relationships.\n\nI asked the study\u2019s author, Gilbert Gonzales of the University of Minnesota, whether anyone had done a similar study in Massachusetts after our own pioneering legalization of gay marriage more than a decade ago. He replied by email:\n\nThe only Massachusetts study I\u2019m familiar with is an American Journal of Public Health study that found potential improvements in gay and bisexual men\u2019s health after MA enacted same-sex marriage in 2003. There were significant reductions in mental health care visits and expenditures in the year after MA enacted same-sex marriage, which suggests broad public health benefits for LGBT people when states recognize same-sex marriage. Another related study on health insurance coverage looked at the 2005 domestic partnership law in California, and found the law increased health insurance coverage among lesbian women relative to heterosexual women. There was no similar finding for gay men. The JAMA study suggests that legal same-sex marriage\u2013rather than domestic partnerships\u2013may improve coverage options for both men and women in same-sex relationships.\n\nHow many people in all may gain employer health insurance thanks to the Supreme Court ruling? It\u2019s not totally clear, Gonzales says, \u201cpartly because the health insurance landscape has changed very quickly under the Affordable Care Act. The ACA now allows married same-sex couples to seek private health insurance together in the federal and state marketplaces.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cMeanwhile, after last week\u2019s same-sex marriage ruling, married LGBT workers will have more options to enroll a same-sex partner in employer health plans. This may help low-income same-sex couples in states not expanding Medicaid or where coverage options are more limited.\u201d\n\nI also checked in with M.V. Lee Badgett, author of \u201cWhen Gay People Get Married: What Happens When Societies Legalize Same-Sex Marriage.\u201d Her take: \u201cThe gap in health insurance coverage has been closing with the ACA, but marriage equality will help.\u201d\n\nShe, too, cites the Massachusetts study that linked legalizing same-sex marriage with health improvements. And on the new JAMA study she says it is \u201ca simple one but well-done and has sensible results.\u201d\n\nFurther Reading:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Studies suggest that same-sex couples who can now wed will gain more employer-sponsored health insurance coverage, and perhaps even more health.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Studies suggest that same-sex couples who can now wed will gain more employer-sponsored health insurance coverage, and perhaps even more health.", "title": "More Health Coverage, And Perhaps More Health, For Same-Sex Couples", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/06/health-coverage-same-sex-couples", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/06/gaypride-620x348.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/06/health-coverage-same-sex-couples", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/06/gaypride-620x348.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "More Health Coverage, And Perhaps More Health, For Same-Sex Couples"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-29", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Mon, 29 Jun 2015 15:06:27 -0400"}, "article_summary": "Another related study on health insurance coverage looked at the 2005 domestic partnership law in California, and found the law increased health insurance coverage among lesbian women relative to heterosexual women.\nThere were significant reductions in mental health care visits and expenditures in the year after MA enacted same-sex marriage, which suggests broad public health benefits for LGBT people when states recognize same-sex marriage.\nThe ACA now allows married same-sex couples to seek private health insurance together in the federal and state marketplaces.\u201dHe adds: \u201cMeanwhile, after last week\u2019s same-sex marriage ruling, married LGBT workers will have more options to enroll a same-sex partner in employer health plans.\nThe picture is complex, but a study just out in JAMA finds that legalizing gay marriage does indeed increase employer-based health insurance coverage for same-sex partners.\nSame-sex marriage was also associated with an 8.9 percentage point increase in ESI and a 3.9 percentage point reduction in Medicaid coverage for women in same-sex relationships vs women in opposite-sex relationships."}
