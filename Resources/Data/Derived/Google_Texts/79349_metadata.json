She says if you have insurance through the Marketplace, you will get a special form.\n\n\"They will by the end of the month get a 1095-A that they have to bring in when they do their taxes,\" said Bylkas.\n\nBylkas says if you get insurance through work, or have Medicare or Medicaid, you won't get a special form. However, it's important to tell that to the person preparing your taxes.\n\nBylkas says they are already getting calls about it.\n\n\"We're getting most of our calls from people asking about the Affordable Care Act. Most of them are calling saying they did not have insurance, how's it going to affect them,\" said Bylkas.\n\nIf you don't have insurance, you will face a penalty.\n\n\"When you file, they will tell you how much you're going to owe. And you should pay it before April 15th, but if you don't they will until your next year refund or they will start hounding you,\" said Bylkas.\n\nThe penalty is $95 dollars per person, or 1% of your household income, whichever is greater.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "You will be required to include health care information in order to file your tax return this year.", "language": "english", "author": "Sarah Schwabe", "og": {"description": "You will be required to include health care information in order to file your tax return this year.", "title": "New Changes In Tax Rules", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/New-Changes-in-Tax-Rules--288816551.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/783/245/7832457987114DA6A88E0786AC1DB875", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/F11/0C8/F110C88783BA442B8DAF12954C81AA15.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kktv.com", "description": "You will be required to include health care information in order to file your tax return this year.", "creator": "@kktv11news", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/New-Changes-in-Tax-Rules--288816551.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/60224C00-XSSZE.jpg", "title": "New Changes In Tax Rules", "site": "@kktv11news", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "New Changes In Tax Rules", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "gUw-UdhXT7u-BunNWfQWA_t3azu7BEGubOcNT6HddJQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "New Changes In Tax Rules"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb42\"", "article_summary": "There are some big changes you need to know about when you file taxes this year.\nYou will be required to include health care information in order to file your tax return, and it could affect how much money you get back.\nMost of them are calling saying they did not have insurance, how's it going to affect them,\" said Bylkas.\nBylkas says if you get insurance through work, or have Medicare or Medicaid, you won't get a special form.\nThe penalty is $95 dollars per person, or 1% of your household income, whichever is greater."}
