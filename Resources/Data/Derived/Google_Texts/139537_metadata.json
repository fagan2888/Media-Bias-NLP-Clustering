Ordering kiosks have also been placed within the establishments.\n\nThe improvements are aimed at providing customers with a superior dining experience, whether the customer is dining out or plans to stay and eat inside a cafe.\n\nQuestions have been raised as to whether digital kiosks will begin to replace human labor within the workplace.\n\n\u201cWe did our digital capabilities\u2013that\u2019s part of 2.0, to give a better guest experience,\u201d Schaich said in the same call. \u201cIt was never about labor. Having said that, it\u2019s a powerful beneficiary. Labor is going down\u2026and as digital utilization goes up, like the sun comes up in the morning, it is going to continue to go up.\u201d\n\nJames Sherk, a research fellow in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation, addressed fears that Americans may have regarding labor automation and technology in a recent report.\n\n\u201cMany Americans worry that automation will significantly reduce the need for human employees,\u201d Sherk wrote. \u201cThis is highly unlikely to happen. Automation reduces the need for humans in particular tasks, but employees have historically moved to different sectors of the economy as a result. Little evidence suggests this time is different.\u201d\n\nAccording to Panera, the company had suffered rising labor costs throughout their third quarter operating margin. Panera\u2019s profit and loss statement, according to Chief Financial Officer Mike Bufano, showed that \u201clabor cost was again the most significant driver of operating margin decline.\u201d\n\nStatutory increases in minimum wage along with inflation and benefit costs associated with the Affordable Care Act were noted by Bufano as two of three factors \u201ccontributing to the labor deleverage.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by analyst Sharon Zackfia of William Blair how the company would deliberate with pricing in regard to the structural labor dynamics in the industry, Shaich responded:\n\n\u201cI think we all understand public policy has evolved \u2026 there may not be a federal wage increase, but there is absolutely a national wage increase happening in patchwork fashion across the country \u2026 it\u2019s going up significantly.\u201d\n\nShaich noted that in Emeryville, Calif., Panera saw the effects of the $15 wage increase that was voted upon by City Council.\n\n\u201cWe saw the usual cast of characters that we usually compare ourselves to, Starbucks and Chipotle, take price immediately to cover that,\u201d he said, referring to the practice of raising menu prices to cover increased labor costs. \u201cWe did as well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Panera Bread, a popular American bakery and cafe, is undergoing a major renovation.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Panera Bread, a popular American bakery and cafe, is undergoing a major renovation.", "title": "Panera Bread CEO Says Digital Ordering May Replace Labor", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/panera-.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1OrsOwK"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Panera Bread, a popular American bakery and cafe, is undergoing a major renovation.", "title": "Panera Bread CEO Says Digital Ordering May Replace Labor", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/panera-.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "economy", "published_time": "2015-11-05T16:13:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "panera, panera bread, panera 2.0, digital ordering, labor, workforce, Ron Shaich"}, "article_summary": "Little evidence suggests this time is different.\u201dAccording to Panera, the company had suffered rising labor costs throughout their third quarter operating margin.\nQuestions have been raised as to whether digital kiosks will begin to replace human labor within the workplace.\nAccording to reports from Business Insider, Panera Founder and CEO Ron Shaich predicts a \u201ctech revolution\u201d is upon the restaurant industry, and says that Panera Bread is steadily joining the movement.\n\u201cWe saw the usual cast of characters that we usually compare ourselves to, Starbucks and Chipotle, take price immediately to cover that,\u201d he said, referring to the practice of raising menu prices to cover increased labor costs.\n\u201cWe did our digital capabilities\u2013that\u2019s part of 2.0, to give a better guest experience,\u201d Schaich said in the same call."}
