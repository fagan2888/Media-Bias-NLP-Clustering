In particular, Rieff disdains those who argue that liberal capitalism and technological progress are key to ameliorating hunger around the globe. Below are a couple of excerpts from the review:\n\nIn the late 18th century, Robert Thomas Malthus argued that human population growth would always outstrip food production, thus perpetually condemning some portion of humanity to famine. His disciples today are now pointing to recent steep increases in food prices as harbingers of a new age of scarcity. Global food prices have indeed been soaring, along with other commodity prices, since 2005. In real terms, the Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s price index crested in 2011 at 60% above its 2005 price levels. Farmers around the world predictably reacted to the higher prices by growing more food. World cereal production rose from 2,348 million tons in 2011 to 2,540 million tons today. Since the 2011 peak, food prices have been drifting downward, although they remain 18% higher than they were a decade or so ago.\n\nCue the prophets of doom. Richard Heinberg of the Post Carbon Institute has said that the world is now at \u201cpeak everything.\u201d He has further warned that humanity is \u201cwaking up to a century of declines.\u201d In 2013, Earth Policy Institute founder Lester Brown asserted: \u201cThe world is in transition from an era of food abundance to one of scarcity.\u201d Journalist Joel K. Bourne Jr. declared earlier this year, in his book \u201cThe End of Plenty,\u201d that \u201cthe world is running out of food.\u201d\n\nNow comes the neo-Malthusian journalist David Rieff. He argues in \u201cThe Reproach of Hunger: Food, Justice, and Money in the Twenty-First Century\u201d that \u201cif significant changes to the global food system are not made, a crisis of absolute global food supply could occur sometime between 2030 and 2050.\u201d Mr. Rieff\u2019s argument is halfhearted in comparison to Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich\u2019s bold 1968 pronouncement, in \u201cThe Population Bomb,\u201d that \u201cthe battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.\u201d\n\nThe chief question for Mr. Rieff is: Will it be possible to feed the nine billion people who will most likely be living on the planet by the middle of this century? He writes that, \u201cin the main,\u201d his \u201cown views are pessimistic.\u201d But he immediately acknowledges the possibility of predictive failure and declares: \u201cI insist that it is entirely possible that twenty years from now, it is the optimists who will be proven right.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Malthusians still wrong; David Rieff and The Reproach of Hunger", "title": "What Global Food Crisis?: Ronald Bailey's Wall Street Journal Review of The Reproach of Hunger", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/10/19/what-global-food-crisis-ronald-bailey-wa", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1445265880357.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1445265880357.jpg", "title": "What Global Food Crisis?: Ronald Bailey's <em>Wall Street Journal</em> Review of <em>The Reproach of Hunger</em>", "description": "Malthusians still wrong; David Rieff and The Reproach of Hunger", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reason"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "GMO", "published_time": "2015-10-19T15:19:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ronald-bailey"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Global food prices have indeed been soaring, along with other commodity prices, since 2005.\nToday, I have a review in the Wall Street Journal of journalist David Rieff's turgid new Neo-Malthusian tome, The Reproach of Hunger: Food, Justice, and Money in the Twenty-First Century.\nSince the 2011 peak, food prices have been drifting downward, although they remain 18% higher than they were a decade or so ago.\nHis disciples today are now pointing to recent steep increases in food prices as harbingers of a new age of scarcity.\nIn particular, Rieff disdains those who argue that liberal capitalism and technological progress are key to ameliorating hunger around the globe."}
