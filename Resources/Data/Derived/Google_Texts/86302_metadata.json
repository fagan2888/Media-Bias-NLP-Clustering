He felt a moral obligation to do everything in his power to fill these books with fewer pages.\n\nHis motivation to me seemed honest and earnest, and also frustrated. How to value the merits of the case against structural injustices, while still addressing on-the-ground, widespread carnage? How to honor the incredible coverage and movement around the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d mantra, where people feel black lives are affected, destroyed or completely taken by institutional forces, while also halting the impact on other black lives taken in less newsworthy ways?\n\nThis is a conundrum that many big cities face.\n\nWhile I was talking with Landrieu in New Orleans, Chicago was experiencing a particularly gruesome Fourth of July weekend, with 10 people killed and another 55 wounded, according to The Chicago Tribune. Remarkably, as The Tribune points out, that toll was actually \u201clower than last year.\u201d\n\nA closer look at violence like this reveals a complex web of connections between victims and perpetrators of such violence.\n\nA 2013 study by the Yale sociologist Andrew Papachristos examined \u201cpolice and gun homicide records from 2006 to 2011 for residents living within a six-square-mile area that had some of the highest rates for homicide in Chicago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe found that:\n\n\u201cSix percent of the population was involved in 70 percent of the murders, and that nearly all of those in the 6 percent already had some contact with the criminal justice or public health systems. In addition, those in the 6 percent had a 900 percent increased risk of becoming a victim of gun homicide \u2014 suggesting that being part of a risky network might offer more insight into one\u2019s chance of becoming a victim than other risk factors.\u201d\n\nBut this small ecosystem of violence sprawls out onto city streets \u2014 and into families \u2014 populated by innocent people who sometimes, also, become its casualties.\n\nOne of the people killed in Chicago was 7-year-old Amari Brown. As The Chicago Tribune put it, \u201cPolice Superintendent Garry McCarthy on Sunday said the bullet that killed Amari was likely meant for his father, describing Antonio Brown as a \u2018ranking gang member\u2019 who has been uncooperative in the investigation into his son\u2019s slaying.\u201d\n\nThis has fueled something of a debate about whether all black lives matter \u2014 including those taken by community violence \u2014 or whether that designation is reserved only for lives taken by state violence.\n\nBut this is a wedge in search of a crack. To me, there is no discontinuity between these lives because there is no way to separate structural violence from community violence.\n\nConcentrated poverty is a direct result of structural inequity, and that concentrated poverty is attended by hopelessness and desperation, all of which are a prime breeding ground for violence.\n\nPeople didn\u2019t simply wake up one day with a burning desire to live in the poorest, most violent parts of our cities. Generations of discriminatory housing, banking and employment practices created those powder kegs. And then we blame racial culture rather than racist culture for their constant explosions.\n\nWe say that community violence doesn\u2019t get the same attention as state violence, but we don\u2019t register that \u201cstop the violence\u201d rallies and pitches have been a staple of many of these communities for decades, so much so that news people rarely find them newsworthy. That is a corporate media issue more than a community commitment issue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn truth, these arguments are simply another iteration of the reductive either/or argument, with personal responsibility on one side and structural oppression on the other.\n\nActually, the more nuanced and sophisticated position is that personal choices are made within a social construct, and that construct is heavily influenced by oppressive forces \u2014 interpersonal biases, structural inequities, aversion to otherness.\n\nMore people are now opening their eyes to the totality of this image, realizing with supreme frustration that one can\u2019t simply earn one\u2019s way up out of oppression, that oppression must be dismantled from the top down.\n\nMore people are realizing that in a moment of greatest distress and danger, nothing else you have ever done will matter if all the person who poses the threat sees is a body not to be valued. When he pulls a gun, you can\u2019t pull a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nThe structure itself is robbing a people of what I would call \u201ctrickle down optimism,\u201d the ability of people who do all the right things and make all the right choices to say: \u201cSee, this works. This is the path to safety and happiness and freedom.\u201d\n\nInstead, they are developing a rage at the realization that no amount of acting right and doing right can completely protect them.\n\nThere is no disconnection between the people in Landrieu\u2019s binders of dead bodies and those who are alive but nonetheless feel bound by bias.\n\nAll of those lives matter, and they are all being affected by the same structural forces.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150709065500, "twitter": {"description": "People didn\u2019t simply wake up one day with a burning desire to live in the poorest, most violent parts of America\u2019s cities.", "title": "Black Lives and Books of the Dead", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/opinion/charles-m-blow-black-lives-and-books-of-the-dead.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003788812"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "CharlesMBlow", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/blow-circular/blow-circular-thumbLarge-v8.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/opinion/charles-m-blow-black-lives-and-books-of-the-dead.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003788812", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/opinion/charles-m-blow-black-lives-and-books-of-the-dead.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Black Lives, Books of the Dead", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 9, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Times-Picayune (New Orleans)", "keywords": "Landrieu  Mitch,Murders  Attempted Murders and Homicides,New Orleans (La),Chicago (Ill),Blacks,Discrimination,Social Conditions and Trends,Times-Picayune (New Orleans)", "news_keywords": "Blacks African-Americans,Discrimination", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Charles M.
