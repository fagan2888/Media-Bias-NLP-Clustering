President Barack Obama Friday called the Paris shootings "an attack on all of humanity" and pledged support to France and commended the nation for being "an extraordinary counterterrorism partner.""Once again, we've seen an outrageous attempt to terrorize innocent civilians," Obama told reporters at the White House. "This is an attack not just on Paris. It's an attack not just on the people of France."But this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values we share."At least 35 people were reported dead in various attacks in Paris, including shootings in a restaurant and explosions near the countryâ€™s main sports stadium.As many as 100 people werein the French capital, where the American rock group Eagles of Death Metal was performing."We stand prepared and ready to provide whatever assistance the government and people of France need to respond," Obama said. "France is our oldest ally. The French people have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States time and again."We want to be very clear that we stand together with them in the fight against terrorism and extremism. Paris itself represents the timeless values of human progress."Those who think that they can terrorize the people of France or the values that they stand for are wrong," Obama said.
