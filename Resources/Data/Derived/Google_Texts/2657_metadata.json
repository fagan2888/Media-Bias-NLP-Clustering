The proposed changes also could affect the financial planning strategies some advisors employ with their clients who are military veterans.\n\nAt issue is the way the VA uses asset transfers and penalty periods to deny or discontinue VA benefits if a VA beneficiary\u2019s net worth and annual income exceeds $119,220, according to the proposed rule changes affecting the Improved Pension with Aid and Attendance program.\n\nVictoria Collier, a licensed insurance agent and an elder law expert with the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys (NAELA), told InsuranceNewsNet that in the worst case scenario, a military veteran receiving the maximum of $25,440 a year in tax-free income from the VA could stand to lose it all.\n\n\u201cThe worst case is that all of it could go away; they wouldn\u2019t be eligible based on the new criteria,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big chunk.\u201d\n\nWith elder care and nursing home costs running as high as $80,000 a year in some parts of the country, removing $25,440 a year in income \u2014 even if it\u2019s a third of the cost of a nursing home \u2014 is a huge hole for veterans, she said.\n\nVeterans who served during wartime and have either a nonservice-connected disability or are over age 65 are eligible for a \u201cveterans pension\u201d to help pay for long-term care. But, in order to qualify, they need to meet income and asset requirements.\n\nVeterans most affected are World War II and Korean War veterans and their spouses and widows who have long-term care needs, who benefit from home health care and who live on \u201ca farm,\u201d or more than two acres of land.\n\nVietnam vets with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease also might also be affected, Collier added.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many veterans might be affected by these changes.\n\nCollier said 59 percent of war veterans living in the U.S. are over the age of 75. In addition, between 2015 and 2036, more than 9 million veterans will be 65 years old or older, a number which does not include spouses.\n\nIn publishing its proposed changes, the VA says it\u2019s necessary to \u201cpromote consistency in benefit decisions, reduce opportunities for attorneys and financial advisors to take advantage of pension claimants, and preserve the integrity of the pension program.\u201d\n\nOver five years, the savings would amount to tens of millions of dollars as tighter eligibility requirements ensure that only veterans who need the benefits are actually awarded them, according to VA estimates.\n\nVA officials seem to think the proposed changes align with the \u201cintent of Congress,\u201d and that they don\u2019t need Congressional legislation to implement the changes.\n\nBut in a letter to Stuart Weiner in the VA\u2019s Congressional Liaison Service, Sen. Patrick J. Toomey, R-Pa., is asking for the VA to reveal more information about how the proposed changes might affect veterans seeking care.\n\nToomey specifically cites the proposed implementation of a 36-month \u201clook-back\u201d period, and even the possibility that some veterans may become homeless because of the proposed changes.\n\n\u201cDoes the VA believe that it is the intent of Congress to make veteran pensions more restrictive than Medicaid by disallowing the use of trusts and annuities as legitimate long-term care needs planning tools? Medicaid allows such planning,\u201d Toomey wrote in a Feb. 16 letter to the VA.\n\nToomey also asks why the VA is proposing a three-year look-back period when Congress did not move the measure out of committee.\n\nCollier straight-up disagrees with the VA, saying veterans are going to bear the brunt of a proposed policy change that contradicts the long-term care planning that veterans were encouraged to do under the Pension Protection Act of 2006.\n\n\u201cThe proposed rule is 100 percent in conflict with Congress\u2019 intent to encourage people to use their own assets for their own care,\u201d Collier said.\n\nThe VA proposal imposes a three-year \u201clook-back\u201d period on gifts and other transfers, and creates a maximum 10-year penalty waiting period for people making those transfers, according to Collier\u2019s blog post NAELA\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cThe rule also imposes myriad other new restrictions that includes capping the amount of home health expenses the veteran can deduct to qualify,\u201d Collier writes.\n\nVeterans receiving the benefits are \u201cwartime\u201d veterans who served on active duty for no less than 90 days, with at least one day during a wartime period.\n\nFor more advice about the proposed VA changes and how they might affect clients, Collier suggests advisors contact Dale Krause at Krause Financial Services and Donald A. Quante, president at America\u2019s First Financial.\n\nInsuranceNewsNet Senior Writer Cyril Tuohy has covered the financial services industry for more than 15 years.
