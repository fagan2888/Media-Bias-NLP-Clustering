If we can think, talk and behave like law enforcement experts, we are likely to produce more practical results and less fingerpointing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSimply put, terrorist groups operate along the same lines as gangs and pedophiles.\n\nUrban gangs lure new members with promises of glory, power and a sense of belonging to a cause, something greater\u2013 terrorist organizations do the very same.\n\nISIS targets potential recruits online much the same way sexual predators troll for innocent victims on the Internet.\n\nThe measures used to fight murderous gangs in our inner cities and catch child predators on the Internet are the same tactics we should bring to the fight against homegrown, ISIS-inspired terrorists.\n\nThe centerpiece of this strategy is to interrupt and apprehend the recruiters who prey on weak, disaffected youths and then manipulate them into dangerous antagonists capable of horrific acts of violence.\n\nOf course, this approach is not a cure-all, the same way that it isn\u2019t a solution to all the problems caused by gangs and predators, but it is an important part of weakening the social and digital infrastructure of extremist groups. What we need are legal mechanisms that make it easier to prosecute and indict individuals who target people for extremist group recruitment. This creates the need for a careful balance between freedom of speech and public security.\n\nWe know there is such a thing as profanity and public indecency as well, and it\u2019s time we began treating the lies and propaganda of extremist groups like we do other threats to civilization and liberty that emanate from the realm of ideas. But, we also need to recognize that people always have, and always will, enjoy the right to hold repugnant beliefs. We need to determine the point at which belief becomes action, and base our law enforcement strategies on that. We also need to make sure that that point, that line, is clearly and sharply defined for all citizens.\n\nThe warning signs we have been teaching parents for years to recognize when their child is involved in gang activity are the same ones we should be teaching to parents to recognize if their child is being led into radicalization. Thirty years ago, our society did a great job of teaching children not to talk to strangers. Now, we are teaching our children not to chat online with strangers, and not to post personal information online. But we also need to push that conversation a step further and do a better job of teaching our children about what radicalism is, and how to avoid it, both online and in person. This sort of open dialogue and conversation is especially important for the Muslim-American community.\n\nImagine what kind of impact it would have if every child, parent, teacher, religious leader, and community official had a frank discussion about what these groups are claiming, why they\u2019re wrong, and why talking to them is dangerous? That could be the most significant step we take in building the resiliency of vulnerable communities.\n\nMany people seem to think that America\u2019s Muslim community already knows how to talk about this issue, but we\u2019re just as stumped as the country\u2019s non-Muslim majority. Just like they did in the 1980s and 1990s with Gang Resistance Education And Training (G.R.E.A.T.), Boys & Girls Clubs Gang Intervention Through Targeted Outreach and other efforts, law enforcement programming ought to reach out to parents, teachers, schools, and religious and civic institutions to help them talk to their children and each other about the dangers of radicalism.\n\nWhen it comes to neutralizing violent extremist thugs such as ISIS from recruiting the marginalized to inflict mass destruction on the homeland, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. Effective tools are already in place and should be used in this epic conflict.\n\nThe president\u2019s visit to the Islamic Center of Baltimore should be our starting point in changing the way we approach radicalization.\n\nTameez is a former consultant to the Department of Homeland Security under the Bush Administration.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Terrorist groups operate along the same lines as gangs and pedophiles.", "description": "Terrorist groups operate along the same lines as gangs and pedophiles.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Terrorist groups operate along the same lines as gangs and pedophiles.", "title": "Fighting ISIS recruiters with common sense", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/268657-fighting-isis-recruiters-with-common-sense", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-09T15:00:01-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-09T15:00-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/268657-fighting-isis-recruiters-with-common-sense", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-09T15:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Mustafa Tameez", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-09T15:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-09T15:00:01-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/268657-fighting-isis-recruiters-with-common-sense", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Terrorist groups operate along the same lines as gangs and pedophiles.", "card": "summary", "title": "Fighting ISIS recruiters with common sense"}, "dcterms.title": "Fighting ISIS recruiters with common sense"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde3e4\"", "article_summary": "If we can think, talk and behave like law enforcement experts, we are likely to produce more practical results and less fingerpointing.\nWe need to determine the point at which belief becomes action, and base our law enforcement strategies on that.\nISIS targets potential recruits online much the same way sexual predators troll for innocent victims on the Internet.\nInstead of talking about radicalism from a theological, sociological or even international point of view, we need to combat domestic extremists from a law enforcement perspective.\nUrban gangs lure new members with promises of glory, power and a sense of belonging to a cause, something greater\u2013 terrorist organizations do the very same."}
