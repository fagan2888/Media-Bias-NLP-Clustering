At 30, Chan is the youngest member on the team, connecting a new generation of viewers to the country\u2019s oldest Chinese-language nightly newscast.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou need a face you can identify with,\u201d said anchor and Digital News Executive Director Kwokshu Leung. \u201cWhen you see someone your own age you can relate more to what they are bringing to you.\u201d\n\n\n\nKTSF was the first station in the nation to provide Asian-language programming in efforts to reach an under-served community. In 1989, it launched the first nightly newscast in Chinese, and today the station provides news programming in 11 languages, including Mandarin, Cantonese and Taiwanese.\n\n\n\n\u201cRicky is very instrumental in this market,\u201d said Leung. \u201cOur only target audience in the past was first generation immigrants, but we need some new blood too.\u201d\n\n\n\nChan left studying telecommunication and networking in his native Hong Kong for the Bay Area at 22. \u201cMy parents said they don\u2019t care what I major in,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey said just finish the whole thing and bring a Bachelor\u2019s degree back.\u201d\n\n\n\nChan decided to pursue a degree in film and television. He graduated with honors in 2010 from San Jose State University, after interning with KTSF his last semester.\n\n\n\n\u201cRicky wears many hats here,\u201d said Rose Shirinian, KTSF director of news and public affairs. \u201cHis background provides a connection for many of our viewers coming from the same part of the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nSan Francisco was the first stop for Chinese immigrants into the U.S. and they have made a recent charge into public office here, most notably when the city voted in its first-ever Chinese mayor in 2011.\n\n\n\nThe recent arrest of State Senator Leland Yee has created waves, however, with fears the scandal could stall the community\u2019s growing political clout.\n\n\n\nChan said KTSF has focused its coverage on the figures in the case, including one-time gang leader Raymond \u201cShrimp Boy\u201d Chow. But he added, \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say\u201d how the case will unfold.\n\n\n\nYee was detained in March in an FBI operation targeting figures in the Chinatown community. He pled not guilty in a San Francisco courtroom on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nYee has long advocated for the city\u2019s Chinese residents, including in 2011 when he fought efforts to ban the sale of shark fin soup. It was a topic Chan covered extensively.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery Chinese restaurant serves shark fin for wedding banquets and important occasions. \u201cThis is a big business for them,\u201d said Chan, who admits he supported the ban, calling the practice of killing sharks for their fins \u201ccruel.\u201d\n\n\n\nToday housing and healthcare are the main concerns in the Chinese community, said Chan. With the run-up to the March 31st deadline to sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, he said a number of non-English speaking Chinese in the Bay Area still don\u2019t understand how it works, adding many do not receive health benefits from their employers. Others just generally prefer to avoid doctors, he said.\n\n\n\nChan shared a recent experience with his hairstylist, who admitted he did not know how to apply for insurance under the new law. Chan walked him through the process, but later learned he had received information packets from the insurer that were all in English. He couldn\u2019t read them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they are signing up for healthcare, they still don\u2019t know how to use it,\u201d said Chan. \u201cI think the insurance companies and the government should work together to help our community be more informed.\u201d\n\n\n\nChan spends a lot of time working to tailor stories to his audience, but said he also recognizes the need to connect the community more closely to mainstream issues, such as changes within the city, important events and pending legislation that could affect them.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome of our older audience may only get their news by watching us,\u201d said Chan. \u201cSo unless we report on something, those people won\u2019t be made aware.\u201d\n\n\n\nChan modestly declines the idea of him being a popular face in the Chinese community, but has had some moments of appreciated recognition.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I started doing a Saturday technology segment, a man noticed me on the street and thanked me for bringing the tech news to him,\u201d said Chan. \u201cWhen they recognize me and give me feedback, it does make me feel closer to the community.\u201d\n\n\n\nChantel Genest studies journalism at San Francisco State University.
