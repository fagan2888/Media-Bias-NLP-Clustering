It\u2019s a word that has been with us for years. And like it or not, it\u2019s indelibly printed in the pages of American history. A word that was originally intended as a derogatory term, meant to shame and divide and demean. The word was conceived of by a group of wealthy white men who needed a way to put themselves above and apart from a black man, to render him inferior and unequal and diminish his accomplishments.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has been labelled with this word by his opponents, and at first he rose above it, hoping that if he could just make a cause for what he\u2019d achieved, his opponents would fail in making their label stick. But no matter how many successes that he had as president, he realized there were still many people for whom he\u2019d never be anything more than that one disparaging word \u2014 a belief he knew was held not just by his political opponents, but also by a significant portion of the American electorate.\n\n\u201cAnd so he decided if you can\u2019t beat them, you\u2019ve got to join them. So he embraced the word and made it his own, sending his opposition a message they weren\u2019t expecting: \u2018If that\u2019s what you want me to be, I\u2019ll be that.\u2019\n\n\u201cY\u2019all know the word that I\u2019m talking about. Obamacare! That\u2019s right! I said it and I\u2019m not ashamed, and neither is President Obama!\u201d\n\nThe MSNBC host doubled down on the racially-charged segment as she ticked off the president\u2019s accomplishments and how they are apparently diminished by the \u201cObamacare\u201d slur.\n\n\u201cI mean, what do you call the president who rescues the U.S. auto industry?\u201d she said sarcastically. \u201cObamacare! What do you call the president who finally eliminates Osama bin Laden? Obamacare! What do you call the president who ends don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell? Say it with me: Obamacare!\u201d\n\nNo one knows for sure who first coined the term \u201cObamacare,\u201d or if they were truly the \u201cgroup of wealthy white men\u201d Harris-Perry claims. But the history of racist code words may be even more extensive than Harris-Perry realizes.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s push for universal healthcare was labelled \u201cHillarycare\u201d by bigoted opponents way back in 1993. Prior to that, the Ku Klux Klan coined the term \u201cReaganomics\u201d to describe Ronald Reagan\u2019s fiscal policy of tax cuts, deregulation and reduced rates of spending increases. In the 1970s, as part of their plan to create clones of Adolf Hitler, the American Nazi Party labeled the president\u2019s devious approach to politics \u201cNixonian.\u201d\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
