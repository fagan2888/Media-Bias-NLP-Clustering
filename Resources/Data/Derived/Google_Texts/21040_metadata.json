Not just any steakhouses, mind you: Black Angus Steakhouse.\n\nIn the bit, he described the aggression that Black Angus employs to draw in customers. His description of the artery-clogging concoctions served up at Black Angus are exaggerated for comedic effect, but one Redditor actually made a full menu of Patton's fake Black Angus menu.\n\nGodspeed, captstack. Obamacare couldn't have kicked in at a better time.\n\nCheck out the bit on YouTube (warning, some NSFW language), and check out the cuisine IRL below.\n\n\"At Black Angus, we'll start you off with our appetizer platter, featuring five jumbo deep-fried gulf shrimp, served on a disc of salted butter, with 15 of our potato bacon bombs, and a big bowl of pork cracklins with our cheese and butter dipping sauce.\"\n\n\"Then we'll take you to our mile-long bacon and salad bar, featuring bacon and cheese cream soup, and our five head of iceberg lettuce He-Man salad served in a punch bowl, with 18 pounds of ranch dressing, pork-stuffed deep-fried croutons and what the hell, a couple of corn dogs.\"\n\n\"Then we'll wheel out our bottomless trough of fried dough.\"\n\n\"Then, we'll bring out our 55-ounce Las Mesa He-Man Steak Slab, served with a deep-fried pumpkin, stuffed with buttered scallops and 52 of our potato bacon bombs.\"\n\n\"Bend over, Abigail May. Here comes the gravy pipe!\"\n\n\"At Black Angus, your name is Peaches.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patton Oswalt is known for his love of food, so it should come as no surprise that one of his most popular stand-up bits is about his love of steakhouses...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-10-11 16:08:26 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Patton Oswalt is known for his love of food, so it should come as no surprise that one of his most popular stand-up bits is about his love of steakhouses...", "title": "We Can't Believe Someone Actually Did This", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/10/patton-oswalt-black-angus-irl_n_4080334.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1400755/images/o-22-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Patton Oswalt is known for his love of food, so it should come as no surprise that one of his most popular stand-up bits is about his love of steakhouses...", "creator": "rossluippold", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1400755/images/o-22-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "We Can't Believe Someone Actually Did This", "site": "@HuffPostComedy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-10 16:08:26 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4080334", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "comedy", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "reddit,black angus steakhouse,steakhouse,black angus,patton oswalt reddit,Patton Oswalt,patton oswalt steak,steak,werewolves and lollipops", "article": {"section": "Comedy", "tag": "reddit,black angus steakhouse,steakhouse,black angus,patton oswalt reddit,Patton Oswalt,patton oswalt steak,steak,werewolves and lollipops", "published_time": "2013-10-10 16:08:26 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-10-10 16:08:26 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "His description of the artery-clogging concoctions served up at Black Angus are exaggerated for comedic effect, but one Redditor actually made a full menu of Patton's fake Black Angus menu.\nIn the bit, he described the aggression that Black Angus employs to draw in customers.\nNot just any steakhouses, mind you: Black Angus Steakhouse.\n\"At Black Angus, your name is Peaches.\"\n\"Then, we'll bring out our 55-ounce Las Mesa He-Man Steak Slab, served with a deep-fried pumpkin, stuffed with buttered scallops and 52 of our potato bacon bombs.\""}
