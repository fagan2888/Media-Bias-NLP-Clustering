CREDIT: Emily Atkin\n\n\u201cThe church is supposed to care for every part of you, not just your spiritual needs,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a person is starving, you give them food. If they\u2019re thirsty, you give them water.\u201d\n\nThere are thirsty people in Sebring. Back in January, the small town\u2019s population of 4,420 was informed of excessive levels of lead in their public water system. Similar to the much-publicized situation in Flint, Michigan, there\u2019s evidence that officials at the state\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency branch and the local public water system knew of Sebring\u2019s contamination months beforehand. And, just like in Flint, two EPA officials were fired over their failure to make sure residents were aware of the danger.\n\nBut Sebring\u2019s similarities to Flint don\u2019t extend much further. Unlike the large, heavily minority, and disproportionately poor population of Flint, Sebring is small, mostly white, and has a poverty rate proportionate to the state\u2019s average. And most importantly, its lead contamination seems much easier to fix. While both cities\u2019 water woes were caused by lead leeching from pipes, Sebring was able to mostly solve its problem by adding sodium hydroxide to the water supply.\n\nThey key word there, however, is mostly. In early March, the Ohio EPA found that 43 of 1,077 Sebring water samples had excessive lead levels. And in the community, there is still distrust over whether the water really is safe to drink, even if the EPA gives the all-clear.\n\nThat is why the Sebring Church of the Nazarene continues to give out bottled water, baby wipes, and cleaning supplies every evening from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. to anyone who asks for it, Pastor Mike Kimball told ThinkProgress. He does not require proof of contamination.\n\nThey\u2019re still afraid, and I don\u2019t blame them. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t ask. If you need it, come and get it.\n\n\u201cPeople want to give ID, proof that they need the water \u2014 we just give it to you,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cI hope they\u2019re being honest, but that\u2019s between them and God.\u201d\n\nThe Church of the Nazarene is one of the only places in Sebring where people can get free water without question, Kimball said. The Sebring Community Center gives out free bottled water only to households that can show their water has tested above the allowable limit for lead. Sebring residents who want water from the community center must show proof of residence and proof of contamination, and can only receive the equivalent of one gallon per person per day.\n\nBeth Harris, a volunteer at the Sebring Nazarene church, empathizes with people who who want water but may not have proof of contamination.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still afraid, and I don\u2019t blame them,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t ask. If you need it, come and get it.\u201d\n\nNow, Kimball estimates his church is giving water to about six to eight families per night. They usually give out about two cases of bottled water and a couple of individual gallons. And it\u2019s not costing the church a dime, he said \u2014 all of the water has come via donations from concerned residents and other Nazarene churches, like the one in Powhatan Point that Bill Coker traveled from that day.\n\nAt the Church of the Nazarene in Sebring, Ohio, a table with cleaning supplies and baby wipes for people in need. CREDIT: Emily Atkin\n\n\u201cI believe the Lord has given to us to give to others,\u201d Kimball said.\n\nIn Sebring, it seems help is in no short supply. At one point on Friday afternoon, three young girls walked in and asked if there was anything they could do to help with water distribution. Harris thanked them and told them to come back at 6 p.m.\n\nAnd at the local high school down the street, Sebring Local School District treasurer Thomas Morehouse told ThinkProgress that, since the crisis was announced in January, they\u2019ve been inundated with donations from people who want to make sure the the school\u2019s 645 kids don\u2019t come in contact with lead-contaminated water.\n\n\u201cWe have more water than we even know what to do with,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation is definitely not as bad as it could have been.\u201d\n\nInevitably, as Flint\u2019s lead contamination crisis dominates national headlines and as a presidential election is underway, Sebring\u2019s water contamination has raised broader questions. Is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is running for president, doing enough to make sure dangerous drinking water is addressed in his own state? Are Sebring\u2019s residents going to vote for him in the wake of their water woes? Or will they vote for the Democratic candidates, who have both been outspoken about the dangers of lead contamination?\n\nPastor Kimball, for his part, steered clear of the potential political implications.\n\n\u201cThe one thing I always make sure to do is that stay out of that,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"If you need it, come and get it.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"If you need it, come and get it.\"", "title": "The Church Giving Out Safe Drinking Water Amid Fears Of Lead Contamination", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/03/14/3759430/sebring-lead-contamination-visit/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/12110903/image4-4-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"If you need it, come and get it.\"", "creator": "@@emorwee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/12110903/image4-4-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Church Giving Out Safe Drinking Water Amid Fears Of Lead Contamination", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/12110903/image4-4-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/12110903/image4-4-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-14T08:42:21+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/emorweee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe171a\"", "article_summary": "Health The Church Giving Out Safe Drinking Water Amid Fears Of Lead Contamination CREDIT: Emily Atkin Pastor Mike Kimball, left, and church volunteer Beth Harris give bottled water and cleaning supplies to anyone who asks for them in Sebring, Ohio.\nOr will they vote for the Democratic candidates, who have both been outspoken about the dangers of lead contamination?\n\u201cThe situation is definitely not as bad as it could have been.\u201dInevitably, as Flint\u2019s lead contamination crisis dominates national headlines and as a presidential election is underway, Sebring\u2019s water contamination has raised broader questions.\nBeth Harris, a volunteer at the Sebring Nazarene church, empathizes with people who who want water but may not have proof of contamination.\nPart of the bottled water supply at Church of the Nazarene in Sebring, Ohio."}
