Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback is more stumbling than storming into the general election.

On Tuesday night, results from the GOP primary showed 37% of those voting cast their ballots for a Republican political newcomer over Mr. Brownback. Then Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services on Wednesday morning dropped Kansas’s credit rating by one notch, blaming the downgrade on a sharp slide in state revenues that followed deep tax cuts Mr. Brownback championed.

These developments continue to fuel what has become a surprisingly close gubernatorial race in a solidly red state. Recent publicly-available polling shows Mr. Brownback trailing his Democrat opponent Paul Davis.

Since Mr. Brownback took office in 2011, Kansas has dropped its top income-tax rate by one-fourth and plans further cuts. It also eliminated a tax on small-business income, all in a bid to foster a Texas-style economic boom in the Great Plains state.

The problem for S&P is government spending isn’t matching the lower tax revenues. While the state economy is largely in line with the U.S. economy, the ratings agency noted Kansas is on course to start running deficits in the year ahead. The downgrade is the second this year. Moody’s Investors Service dropped its rating of Kansas for similar reasons in April.

Still, Brownback supporters have a strategy that’s expected to be common for the GOP candidates across the country this fall. On Wednesday, the Republican Governors Association launched its first TV commercial in Kansas, casting Mr. Davis as an acolyte of President Barack Obama and a supporter of such policies as the Affordable Care Act.

The ad ends: “Don’t delegate Kansas to an Obama liberal.”
