Athenahealth Chairman and CEO Jonathan Bush, speaks to CNBC's Bertha Coombs, about the brand new medical coding format called ICD-10.

They've been working around the clock at Athenahealth since the Oct.1 launch of the nation's new medical coding billing system known as ICD-10.

In a makeshift nerve center at the medical billing company's offices outside Boston, a team of expert coders hunch over computers monitoring the flow of physician claims submitted over the Athena platform, ready to pounce on glitches.



"We can watch these claims go out, we can watch them hit the payer ... and we can zoom in on the goofs," said CEO Jonathan Bush, though he's quick to add the goofs have been rare.

In the first week since the transition to the new billing system, fewer than 500 were rejected for coding errors of more than a million claims submitted.

"ICD-10 has been delayed a couple of times, so we've had fire drills before to get ready for this," Bush said. "So, by the time it actually happened, it really went off smoothly."
