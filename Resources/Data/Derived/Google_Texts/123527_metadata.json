The two are once again hosting the show (Nov. 4, ABC). Their monologue has traditionally taken on the top (and often most sensitive) topics of the day.\n\nAdultery is a reoccurring theme in country music, so it\u2019s an easy fit. Paisley made his comments at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum benefit concert in New York City earlier this week. Billboard reports that Emmylou Harris also chimed in, adding \u201cWe built our careers on cheating songs.\u201d\n\nIn previous years Paisley and Underwood have riffed on sexting, phone hacking scandals and naked selfies, Obamacare and swine flu. It\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s referred to Ashley Madison while teasing his upcoming monologue. In September he told Access Hollywood that scandals like that make it a \u201cgood year to be a host.\u201d\n\nBlake Shelton, Taylor Swift, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill have been the targets of some of the hosting duo\u2019s best jokes over the years. Of course who can forget his famous (and short-lived) feud with Kenny Rogers? The late Little Jimmy Dickens was a frequent victim of Paisley\u2019s humor, willingly waddling to the stage in Scuba gear or rolling up in a Justin Bieber outfit. Year to year, it\u2019s difficult to predict where the two will go with their brand of humor and parody songs.\n\nThe 2015 CMA Awards air Nov. 4 at 8PM ET on ABC.\n\nSurprises and Snubs \u2026 the Best and Worst of the 2015 Nominations\n\nNext: See Brad and Carrie's Best CMA Jokes", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://tasteofcountry.com/files/2015/10/Brad-Paisley.jpg", "sailthru.author": "billydukesgmail-com", "description": "Brad Paisley says he and Carrie Underwood have plans to use the Ashley Madison hacking scandal for CMA Awards jokes.", "og": {"site_name": "Taste of Country", "description": "Brad Paisley says he and Carrie Underwood have plans to use the Ashley Madison hacking scandal for CMA Awards jokes.", "title": "Brad Paisley Grateful for Ashley Madison Hacking Scandal", "url": "http://tasteofcountry.com/brad-paisley-ashley-madison-hack-cma-awards/", "image": "http://tasteofcountry.com/files/2015/10/Brad-Paisley.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tasteofcountry", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-08 09:38:27", "sailthru.title": "Brad Paisley Grateful for Ashley Madison Hacking Scandal as He Preps for CMAs", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-tasteofcountry, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, brad-paisley, carrie-underwood, cma-awards, country-music-news", "fb": {"admins": 8802808, "app_id": 193351250697247, "pages": 173910492638623}, "keywords": "brad paisley cma awards, cma awards jokes, brad paisley carrie underwood, ashley madison, brad paisley cheating", "sailthru.description": "Brad Paisley says he and Carrie Underwood have plans to use the Ashley Madison hacking scandal for CMA Awards jokes.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://tasteofcountry.com/files/2015/10/Brad-Paisley.jpg", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2933\"", "article_summary": "Surprises and Snubs \u2026 the Best and Worst of the 2015 NominationsNext: See Brad and Carrie's Best CMA Jokes\nMike Coppola, Getty ImagesBrad Paisley says he and Carrie Underwood have plans to use the Ashley Madison hacking scandal for CMA Awards jokes.\nIt\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s referred to Ashley Madison while teasing his upcoming monologue.\nPaisley made his comments at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum benefit concert in New York City earlier this week.\nYear to year, it\u2019s difficult to predict where the two will go with their brand of humor and parody songs."}
