The Panelist talked about what they and their organizations are doing about health care. The panelists were: Kimberly Hughes, American Cancer Society, Tinecia Harris, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Kim Robinson, Children\u2019s Defense Fund, Walter Zinn Jr., Moderator, State Senator David Blount, Senate District 29 (Hinds), and State Representative Bryant Clark, State District 47 (Attala, Holmes, and Yazoo).\n\nThe event was managed by the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program led by Jarvis Dortch, Program Manager and Kristian Weatherspoon, Coalition Coordinator.\n\nJennifer Jackson, a nurse with Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center, checked the blood pressure and blood sugar reading for diabetes for all willing visitors to her table.\n\nOther popular stops for mall visitors included tables for Jackson Medical Mall, Mississippi State Conference NAACP, Humana, Magnolia Health, Jackson State University, American Cancer Society, Planned Parenthood Southeast, and Mississippi Primary Health Care Association.\n\nMagnolia Health, one of the two health insurance companies serving as a market exchange in Mississippi, featured their obamacare product called \u201cambetter\u201d. Independent certified agent, Cheryl Smith explained the eligibility rules for anyone seeking a discount off of their health insurance premium through subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. She said that she could not completely enroll a candidate on site, but she was gathering information and would follow up with anyone who signed up with her.\n\nThe other market exchange company, health insurance provider, Humana had a \u201cdouble presence\u201d at the event. Humana had a table in the mall manned by two Humana employees. The company also located one of its two new buses with three independent certified agents (Phyllis Rhodes, Valerie German, and Virgina Bailey) at the mall entrance. The buses are touring select locations throughout the state of Mississippi where Humana agents help people understand how the changes in healthcare affects them, and to find a health insurance plan that works for them and fits their budget.\n\nVieanna Nichols who visited the bus said that she was a strong advocate for the Affordable Care Act. The X-ray Tech who has worked mostly part-time over the years has been one of those uninsured working people that Obamacare is targeting.\n\n\u201cI am so excited to get affordable health coverage\u201d, she said. \u201cI came on the bus to signup. I have no problem with not being able to sign up all the way. I\u2019m just glad to get started today.\u201d\n\nHumana\u2019s second bus was located in Ridgeland in the Walmart parking lot, on the same day. Independent certified agents, Ruby Parks, Tim Bell and Ricardo Willis manned that bus.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Mississippi Link", "description": "By Lonnie Ross Online Editor Obamacare got a boost in Mississippi when Cover Mississippi held an enrollment kickoff event in Jackson last Friday.
