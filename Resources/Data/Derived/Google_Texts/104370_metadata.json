He said so explicitly in the new original Netflix documentary \u201cMitt,\u201d and continues to do so. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Republican primary voters and even some grassroots activists want him to retire from public life. In fact, many don\u2019t.\n\nThe Boston Globe has the scoop:\n\nBut in recent weeks, a strange thing has happened: Some supporters and donors, pollsters and pundits are starting to suggest \u2014 without irony \u2014 that the former Massachusetts governor run for president in 2016. \u201cOnce a month, someone would e-mail or call and say he should run again,\u201d said Ron Kaufman, a longtime Romney adviser. \u201cNow I get it every day \u2014 from the grass roots, and from donors. I get it every day.\u201d Kaufman made clear that there was no behind-the-scenes maneuvering to persuade Romney to run again. A second Romney adviser said he was also approached frequently by former supporters and donors, asking him to persuade Romney to run again in 2016. Those close to Romney say he is giving the talk little thought, and party operatives in key states and some of his former advisers say they cannot imagine a scenario in which he would run.\n\nIs Mittmentum real? Remember, as the Globe notes, Richard Nixon lost the presidential contest after securing his party\u2019s nomination in 1960. Eight years later, however, he won the Republican nomination and the presidency. Thus, who\u2019s to say Mitt Romney can\u2019t mount a heroic comeback, too? It\u2019s not exactly unprecedented.\n\nNevertheless, grassroots activists are actively splashing cold water on that idea:\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles would be convincing party officials and donors that he deserves yet another chance. \u201cHe could not win the nomination. There\u2019s no way,\u201d said Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committee member from Mississippi. \u201cLook, he had his shot. But the party has to move on. I can\u2019t imagine that we would renominate Governor Romney when he lost in the general election last time.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m inclined to agree, and most people probably would too. Yes, as the Globe reminds us, Ronald Reagan ran for president three times before he won the nation\u2019s most coveted political office; but he was only at the top of the ticket the third and final time he ran as a non-incumbent. Mitt Romney wouldn't have that luxury: he's already a failed presidential nominee.\n\nStill, the presumed field is overcrowded with Tea Party types and conservative office seekers. Which begs the question: where are all the establishment candidates? Paul Ryan is reportedly focused on his job in Congress, Jeb Bush is still testing the waters, and Chris Christie is just trying to survive at this point, the Globe reports. So that leaves us with\u2026Mitt Romney?\n\nThe buzz around Romney running was sufficient enough that Purple Strategies, a Virginia-based firm, included Romney in a poll of New Hampshire voters three weeks ago. He came out on top, with 25 percent, among Republican primary voters. Yet Republican activists in early primary states say they have a hard time imagining a Romney run. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is taking the prospect of him running again seriously at all,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of animosity toward Romney,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of respect and fondness for him. There\u2019s a lot of gratitude for the investment he made in trying to become president. But, you know, it didn\u2019t work out. It\u2019s pretty rare in politics that someone takes three shots at something.\u201d\n\nThere sure is -- but that won\u2019t necessarily translate into a third presidential bid. And while he may still crave the presidency, is it really worth putting his family through another grueling national campaign only to find himself, in the end, disappointed and heartbroken again? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nDo you?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why not?.05/24/2016 3:15:40AM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Why not?", "title": "Daniel Doherty - 2016 Whispers: Time to Take a Third Look at Mitt Romney?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/02/17/second-look-at-mitt-romney-2016-n1796141", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/5/4b7e8b53-5bd7-4338-bfcc-fe5ace184c92.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Why not?", "title": "Daniel Doherty - 2016 Whispers: Time to Take a Third Look at Mitt Romney?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/02/17/second-look-at-mitt-romney-2016-n1796141", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/5/4b7e8b53-5bd7-4338-bfcc-fe5ace184c92.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "2016 Whispers: Time to Take a Third Look at Mitt Romney?, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe082d\"", "article_summary": "Time and again, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney has vowed he would never run for president in 2016.\nThus, who\u2019s to say Mitt Romney can\u2019t mount a heroic comeback, too?\nMitt Romney wouldn't have that luxury: he's already a failed presidential nominee.\nA second Romney adviser said he was also approached frequently by former supporters and donors, asking him to persuade Romney to run again in 2016.\nYet Republican activists in early primary states say they have a hard time imagining a Romney run."}
