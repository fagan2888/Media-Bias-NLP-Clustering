There\u2019s something in this law for everyone, just not exactly the way they said.\n\nBut take heart, America. Brian Williams of the NBC Nightly News is on it, sending investigative reporters to look into the \u201cfine print\u201d of Obamacare. Isn\u2019t that something that would have been more useful four years ago?\n\nNow NBC\u2019s found out that large companies\u2014 add \u2019em to the small companies and individual market plans\u2014are also reducing benefits, raising co-pays and deductibles to cope with Obamacare\u2019s new costs. So, if you have a catastrophic plan in the individual market, you\u2019re losing the plan you may have liked for the privilege of paying more. If you had a middle-of-the-road individual market plan you liked, you\u2019re losing that plan for the privilege of paying more often for fewer benefits. If you had a decent plan at a small employer, you\u2019re likely to get dumped into the exchanges as mandate-heavy health care plans get too expensive for small businesses to afford. If you have a plan you like at a medium-sized employer, you\u2019re likely to get dumped into the exchanges next year when the employer mandate kicks in, and your costs are already rising or benefits are going down. If you\u2019re at a large employer with a very nice health insurance plan, sorry, you\u2019re now going to have reduced benefits to avoid the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax.\n\nFor 75 million Americans who get their insurance through large companies, the Affordable Care Act is a mixed bag. Experts tell NBC News the new healthcare law is only slightly increasing premiums next year, but causing some companies with the most generous plans to reduce their employees\u2019 benefits. Aaron Baker, 36, his wife Billie and their two young children are covered under a generous health insurance plan offered by the private Midwestern university where he\u2019s worked for 10 years. When they opened their benefits notice this year, they were pleased to see their $385 premium is only up by four dollars next year. However, they were shocked to discover that instead of covering the first dollar they spend with no deductible, the Baker\u2019s plan now includes a $1,000 deductible and a $2,500 out of pocket maximum. They also will still have small co-pays for services. According to the enrollment notice, the changes are \u201cto relieve future health plan trend pressure and to put the university in a position to avoid the excise tax that becomes effective in 2018.\u201d The 40 percent excise tax\u2014often called the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d\u2014 is part of Obamacare and is levied on the most generous health plans. It\u2019s designed to bring down overall health costs by making companies and workers more cost-conscious. The thinking is that if consumers have to pay more expenses themselves, through higher deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses, they\u2019ll avoid unnecessary or overly costly procedures. And that is supposed to make care more affordable for everyone. Billie Baker doesn\u2019t think much of that concept. \u201cI think that saying that your insurance is too good so we\u2019re going to give you a penalty,\u201d she said, \u201cis sort of outrageous to me.\u201d\n\nFor the record, the idea that consumers paying more expenses themselves might help overall health costs by encouraging fewer unnecessary procedures is perfectly reasonable. The problem is we\u2019re only encouraging it in people who already pay for their own plans without taxpayer help. When the taxpayer foots the bill, as with Medicare, there\u2019s little to no incentive to reduce spending. And, of course, in Obamacare as pitched, there were no losers. The Bakers were supposed to have what they liked and be able to keep it.\n\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy\n\nNote the Obama administration\u2019s defense. This is, once again, a \u201csmall percentage\u201d of people and \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in the law that tells you you need to raise copays or deductibles.\u201d Those damn insurance companies, following the law and trying to stay in business again.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Fine print.", "title": "Large employers cite upcoming Obamacare Cadillac tax for reduced benefits", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/25/large-employers-cite-upcoming-obamacare-cadillac-tax-for-reduced-benefits/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-26T02:31:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-26T02:38:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca910\"", "article_summary": "Large employers cite upcoming Obamacare Cadillac tax for reduced benefitsposted at 9:31 pm on November 25, 2013 by Mary Katharine HamSee?\nIf you\u2019re at a large employer with a very nice health insurance plan, sorry, you\u2019re now going to have reduced benefits to avoid the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax.\nAaron Baker, 36, his wife Billie and their two young children are covered under a generous health insurance plan offered by the private Midwestern university where he\u2019s worked for 10 years.\nNow NBC\u2019s found out that large companies\u2014 add \u2019em to the small companies and individual market plans\u2014are also reducing benefits, raising co-pays and deductibles to cope with Obamacare\u2019s new costs.\nIf you had a middle-of-the-road individual market plan you liked, you\u2019re losing that plan for the privilege of paying more often for fewer benefits."}
