Duke LifePoint Healthcare on Monday took over Central Carolina Hospital and the Frye Regional Medical Center, two North Carolina hospitals previously owned by Tenet Healthcare Corp.

Duke also took over 19 regional physician practices under the deal.

William Fulkerson Jr., executive vice president of Duke University Health System, said the move is just the latest in the partnership's ongoing expansion

"With the addition of these providers to our network, we've expanded Duke LifePoint's strong presence in North Carolina to include nine hospitals across the state," he said. "We have opportunities to collaborate with Central Carolina and Frye Regional to provide enhanced services that will help make people in Sanford, Hickory and surrounding communities healthier and advance the delivery of quality healthcare throughout this region."

Employees at the two hospitals have all kept their jobs in the transition, Duke said, adding that the hospitals will not cut any services offered.

Duke LifePoint was created in 2011 as a joint venture between the university health systems and LifePoint to focus on creating a network of community hosptials in the state.

Monetary terms of the sale have not yet been disclosed but will likely come out when for-profit Tenet files its next quarterly report.

In addition to owning a number of facilities in North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia, Duke LifePoint owns DLP Cardiac Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina, which offers hospital-based catheterization labs and mobile catheterization services.

Central Carolina is a 137-bed facility while the larger Frye offers 355 beds.
