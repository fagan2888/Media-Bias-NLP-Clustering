Craig Cobb, a 61-year-old avowed white supremacist, learned he was partially black while taping a nationally syndicated TV talk show.

Not yet knowing the results, Cobb agreed to a live on-air analysis of his personal DNA test. Much to his consternation, the test proved he was 14% sub-Saharan African. While the studio audience howled and jeered, Cobb protested, “Wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on, just wait a minute.” He persisted, “This is called ‘statistical noise.'”

Trisha Goddard, the eponymous star of the show who also happens to be black, teased Cobb by saying, “Sweetheart, you have a little black in you.” She goaded Cobb further by calling him “bro” and offering him a congratulatory fist pump. Cobb did not return the gesture.

Mr. Cobb received notoriety back in May 2012 for his campaign to create a “White Nationalist intentional community in North Dakota.” One of the not-so-inspired ideas for his xenophobic village would be to “always (24 hours a day) fly at least one racialist banner,” offering the Nazi flag as one example.

In 2010, while residing in Canada, Cobb allegedly promoted inappropriate online hate materials, prompting him to be wanted by authorities at this time for “willful promotion of hatred.”
