The Treasury inspector general for tax administration in 2011 said such undocumented immigrants claimed more than $4 billion, four times the $1 billion they claimed in 2005.\n\nThe report fueled criticism from Republicans, who would go on to introduce legislation barring undocumented workers from claiming those tax benefits.\n\nSome of the 5 million in theory would also qualify for the EITC, which gives more to poor working adults who have children. A single mother of three earning $17,000 could get back as much as $6,000 to help her take care of her children, for example, according to a Tax Policy Center chart.\n\nThese are some of the expenditures that have skeptics concerned about the cost of immigration reform over the long haul.\n\n\u201cI fear the long-run impact on overall fiscal policy will be negative,\u201d said Dan Mitchell, of the conservative Cato institute, who questions the \u201cnet effect when you look at the impact of amnesty on tax revenues and the burden of government spending.\u201d\n\nHe said he does not \u201cparticularly view additional tax receipts as a desirable goal\u201d and is \u201cunimpressed by the argument that there will be more taxable business income because of lower wages.\u201d\n\nSome critics worry a flood of new workers will lower wages.\n\nZavodny is expecting the opposite, as are a number of experts \u2014 at least for the immigrants themselves.\n\nShe said immigrants\u2019 earnings \u201cusually increase when they move from illegal to legal status\u201d and that would also mean more taxes.\n\nShe was one expert who is expecting a big fight on the EITC in Congress, should immigrants be allowed to claim them: \u201cI would guess Congress will fight that tooth and nail.\u201d\n\nOverall, experts were unsure of how much revenue state coffers and the Treasury can expect from the new program.\n\nThe left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in 2013 released a report showing a $2 billion gain in state revenue from immigration reform \u2014 even after tax credits were taken into consideration.\n\nMatt Gardner, ITEP executive director, said the new program\u2019s effects won\u2019t be quite as big, but it will still be a net gain. That\u2019s because immigrants already pay a bunch of state and local tax.\n\n\u201cWhen you go to the store and buy something, no one asks if you\u2019re a citizen \u2026 they\u2019re collecting just because you\u2019re in the store,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the property tax front, your landlord \u2026 passes [the property tax] to you in the form of higher rent.\u201d\n\nIn that regard, states with income taxes may see a bigger gain than states solely relying on sales tax that are already being paid by this subgroup.\n\nThe federal government, which depends mostly on income and payroll taxes, would see the bigger increase in revenue, Gardner says.\n\nBut even there it is tough to gauge.\n\nThe CBO\u2019s Senate bill immigration score showed full comprehensive immigration reform reducing the deficit because the cost of discretionary spending and tax credits for immigrants was offset by the $459 billion in new tax revenue.\n\nThe gains from the new changes would be probably less than half of that, Kallick speculated, not just because it doesn\u2019t address all undocumented worked but also because there\u2019s another big difference between the Senate bill and the White House action: The Senate bill allowed for more worker permits for educated foreigners with presumably higher-paying skills to come to the U.S. to work, meaning they\u2019d pay even more in taxes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "But anyone expecting a windfall \u2014 or big drain \u2014 on the Treasury should think again.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "But anyone expecting a windfall \u2014 or big drain \u2014 on the Treasury should think again.", "title": "Undocumented workers, meet the IRS", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/undocumented-workers-irs-taxes-113078.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/20/141120_immigration_papers_ap_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Taxes,Immigration,IRS,Congressional Budget Office", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/rachael.bade.9"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro Undocumented workers, meet the IRSUndocumented workers aspiring to be part of the new White House immigration program are about to meet the Internal Revenue Service under President Barack Obama\u2019s sweeping plan unveiled Thursday night.\nThe report fueled criticism from Republicans, who would go on to introduce legislation barring undocumented workers from claiming those tax benefits.\nObama\u2019s action will mean that even more undocumented workers will \u201cstart paying their fair share in taxes,\u201d as a White House outline on the program reads.\nBecause claiming it doesn\u2019t require a Social Security number, some undocumented workers are already claiming the child tax credit, a benefit of up to $1,000 per child, if their child is an American citizen.\nThe Treasury inspector general for tax administration in 2011 said such undocumented immigrants claimed more than $4 billion, four times the $1 billion they claimed in 2005."}
