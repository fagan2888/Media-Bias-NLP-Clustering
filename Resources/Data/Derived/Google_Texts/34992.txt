Saturday was the very first Northwest Florida Renaissance and Fantasy Fair.

The event featured several local vendors, historical reenactments and a performance from the Panama City Pipes and Drums.

Even though the event was supposed to be in the parking lot ,

everyone easily moved inside the breeze way of the shopping center to enjoy the festivities.

"We really wanted to do a community event that people could afford and that's children friendly, family friendly," explained Suzanne Larue, one of the organizers of the fair. "People can have another opportunity to dress up and it's just a lot of fun."

Event organizers are already planning for next year's event , if you want to find out more we have a link to the fair's Facebook page attached to this article.
