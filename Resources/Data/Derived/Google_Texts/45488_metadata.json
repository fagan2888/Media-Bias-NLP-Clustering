Bush was attacked harshly by Democrats throughout his eight year presidency for taking vacations on the family ranch. Even now, Bush\u2019s 381 vacation days are given as a reason that conservatives should not discuss the bad optics of President Barack Obama vacationing on the luxe Martha\u2019s Vineyard while global crises continue to erupt.\n\nObama has taken 20 vacations lasting 2 to 15 days since taking office, totaling up to 129 days on vacation. Obama has also played 192 rounds of golf during his presidency.\n\nDavid Axelrod, one of the men behind Obama\u2019s two presidential campaigns, told the New York Daily News News that his fellow Democrats were in the wrong for their past criticisms and should possibly even demand presidential vacations.\n\n\u201cWe used to pillory George Bush for going to his ranch and we were wrong,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe demands and pressures of the presidency are relentless, and we ought to want our presidents to get small breaks to relax, even in-and maybe especially in \u2014 the midst of crisis. I guarantee you, that wherever he goes, the President is accompanied by the memory of Jim Foley and every American who has died on his watch.
