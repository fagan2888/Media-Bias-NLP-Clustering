The statute expressly restricted insurance subsidies to those individuals purchasing coverage through an \u201cExchange established by the state.\u201d But just as Chief Justice Roberts three years ago decreed that the individual mandate functioned as a tax, even though both Congress and President Barack Obama stated that it wasn\u2019t, the Court decided that \u201cExchange established by the state\u201d meant any type of Exchange, whether established by states or by Washington.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad outcome for the rule of law \u2014 and the English language. But when it comes to the political debate surrounding Obamacare, the Court\u2019s ruling ultimately decides little. Of course, Obama, who took an entirely predictable victory lap yesterday, would have you believe otherwise. But we\u2019ve seen his triumphalism before \u2014 and have seen it come crashing back to reality.\n\nThree years ago, Obama stated he wouldn\u2019t \u201crefight old battles,\u201d mere hours after seven Supreme Court justices \u2014 including his own former solicitor general \u2014 struck down the law\u2019s mandatory Medicaid expansion as unconstitutional \u201ceconomic dragooning\u201d of the states. On election night 2012, the president promised to \u201cmove forward\u201d \u2014 months before at least 4.7 million Americans received insurance cancellation notices thanks to Obamacare. And this April, the president arrogantly declared that \u201cthe repeal debate is and should be over\u201d \u2014 mere weeks before his native state of Hawaii shut its failed insurance exchange, an effort the federal government spent more than $200 million funding.\n\nSo, much as the President would like the debate on Obamacare to be over, it isn\u2019t. The debate persists in large part because the law has singularly failed in its prime objective: Containing health care costs. Consider why this Supreme Court case mattered so much to the administration in the first place. The law spends over $1.7 trillion on subsidized coverage to make insurance more \u201caffordable,\u201d largely to offset the new mandates and regulations that have raised the price of insurance.\n\nAnd with myriad insurers proposing double-digit premium increases for next year \u2014 some as high as 50% \u2014 candidate Obama\u2019s 2008 promise to lower insurance premiums by $2,500 per family is further away then ever. No wonder the law remains singularly unpopular. When it comes to winning the debate on Obamacare, there is still all to play for.\n\nBut in order to win, we conservatives first have to play. That means outlining our alternative vision for health care: How we would restore freedom and choice to a health care sector currently lacking for both \u2014 and most importantly, how we would slow, and hopefully reverse, the trend of skyrocketing health care costs.\n\nAs I write this, I stand as the sole major declared presidential candidate (with the possible exception of Bernie Sanders) to put forward my vision on health care, and an alternative to Obamacare. As proud as I am of my plan, that is a boast I wish I were not able to make. Because Republicans, from the top down, must outline a clear and coherent vision for health care to win the trust of the American people to repeal this President\u2019s health law.\n\nWhile we should be shouting our vision from the rooftops, many of my fellow candidates have managed barely a whisper about how exactly they would repeal Obamacare, or what they would do to tackle the main issue plaguing our health care system: rising costs. Sen. Mike Lee recently stated that lack of an Obamacare replacement plan should be a disqualifier for any conservative presidential candidate. He\u2019s absolutely right. We owe it to the American people to release our plans well before November 2016, and to have a robust debate within our party about what should come after Obamacare.\n\nBecause, contrary to this President\u2019s self-proclaimed edicts, yesterday\u2019s Supreme Court decision is not the end of the debate on Obamacare.\n\nNow that the Supreme Court has ruled, the debate shifts back to the elected branches of government \u2014 the ones that caused our health care mess in the first place. It is there that conservatives can complete our work to repeal Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "In order to win, we conservatives first have to play.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "In order to win, we conservatives first have to play.", "title": "Bobby Jindal: Supreme Court Decision Is Not the End of the Obamacare Debate", "url": "http://time.com/3937809/bobby-jindal-supreme-court-decision-is-not-the-end-of-the-obamacare-debate/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/bobby-jindal2.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/bobby-jindal2.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Bobby Jindal: Supreme Court Decision Is Not the End of the Obamacare Debate", "description": "In order to win, we conservatives first have to play.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "health, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "obamacare, supreme court, us supreme court, scotus, affordable care act, supreme court ruling, health care"}, "article_summary": "Because, contrary to this President\u2019s self-proclaimed edicts, yesterday\u2019s Supreme Court decision is not the end of the debate on Obamacare.\nThursday, the Supreme Court had its say on Obamacare; soon, the American people will have theirs.\nAs a matter of law, the Court\u2019s decision upholding subsidies for states participating in the federally run insurance exchange, healthcare.gov, violates the plain text of Obamacare.\nBut when it comes to the political debate surrounding Obamacare, the Court\u2019s ruling ultimately decides little.\nThe debate persists in large part because the law has singularly failed in its prime objective: Containing health care costs."}
