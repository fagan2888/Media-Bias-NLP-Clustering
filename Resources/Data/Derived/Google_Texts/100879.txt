I don't agree with what Karl Rove, a Republican strategist, said about Hillary Clinton ("Anatomy of a smear," May 15). But what the Democrats did to Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney was just as bad. (The suggestion that Mr. Romney single-handedly caused a women who worked for him to die of cancer is one example.)

How about some equal opportunity editorializing on the lying by the current administration about the Affordable Care Act, Benghazi, "Fast and Furious," the IRS scandal, etc.? If President Barack Obama had a lie detector attached to him when Bill O'Reilly interviewed him on Super Bowl Sunday, the White House fuse box would have blown up.

But I know that it is politically correct to pummel an old white guy and politically incorrect to take issue with a lying African-American. Such is life in the United States today.
