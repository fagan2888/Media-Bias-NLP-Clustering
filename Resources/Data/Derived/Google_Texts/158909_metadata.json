He is a student at UW-Madison, according to the police.\n\nThe case dates back to Oct. 25, when the victim, a 22-year-old UW-Madison student, was taken to the campus police station by someone who had been out delivering food. Officers gave her medical attention and began investigating her claim she was sexually assaulted outdoors.\n\nThe campus police announcement does not indicate where the assault may have occurred or where the delivery driver met the victim.\n\nUW officers worked with the victim, the delivery driver, Madison police \"and other community members\" to re-create the evening's events and identify a suspect. Ultimately, DNA evidence linked the student from Cedarburg to the assault, according to UW police.\n\nThe suspect was in the Dane County Jail on Sunday. No bail amount had been set, pending his first court appearance.\n\nOnline court records show he previously was cited in Dane County for underage drinking, in November 2012 and October 2013, but each case was later dismissed by prosecutors.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Student from Cedarburg arrested as suspect in UW-Madison sexual assault", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/student-from-cedarburg-arrested-as-suspect-in-uw-madison-sexual-assault-b99441181z1-291208961.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "The case dates back to Oct. 25, when the victim, a 22-year-old UW-Madison student, was taken to the campus police station by someone who had been out delivering food.", "title": "Student from Cedarburg suspected in UW sexual assault"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "The case dates back to Oct. 25, when the victim, a 22-year-old UW-Madison student, was taken to the campus police station by someone who had been out delivering food.", "card": "summary", "title": "Student from Cedarburg arrested as suspect in UW-Madison sexual assault"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "By of theA college student from Cedarburg has been arrested as a suspect in an October sexual assault in Madison.\nUltimately, DNA evidence linked the student from Cedarburg to the assault, according to UW police.\nHe is a student at UW-Madison, according to the police.\nThe campus police announcement does not indicate where the assault may have occurred or where the delivery driver met the victim.\nThe case dates back to Oct. 25, when the victim, a 22-year-old UW-Madison student, was taken to the campus police station by someone who had been out delivering food."}
