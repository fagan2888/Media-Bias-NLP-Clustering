Total Health has 10 locations. It merged with Tuerk House, the west-side addiction treatment center, last July.\n\nTotal Health Care is a Federally Qualified Health Center, a medical provider that receives federal grants to care for the uninsured. In 2013, those grants totaled $5.8 million of its $43 million in revenue, according to the company's publicly available IRS filing.\n\n\"A lot of expansion was occurring in the past two years and now basic supplies like paper can't be ordered,\" the anonymous employee says. \"The medical director just announced she is leaving, along with numerous other staff.\" The employee says services are being cut back, hours of the sites have reduced, and two dental departments closed down in the last few months.\n\nCity Paper asked Total Health CEO Faye Royale-Larkins to comment for two days. She returned the call at noon today but declined to answer City Paper's questions. \"I want to tell you . . . in terms of people leaving, like Dr. Kirk [the medical director] I want to be specific,\" she said, promising to email a statement later that would answer them all.\n\nTwo hours later she emailed this statement:\n\n\"Due to changes in the health care marketplace, like many health care companies, Total Health Care Inc. is making changes to its operations and services offerings.\n\n\"That said, Total Health Care Inc. is committed to taking the necessary action needed to meet the current realities.\n\n\"Moving forward, we are confident that we will be able to address these challenges and continue our mission of providing quality medical care to the patients we serve throughout Baltimore City and Anne Arundel County.\"\n\nCity Paper reiterated its specific questions, and Larkins promised to respond. We will update this story when she does.\n\n(Update: True to her word, Larkins sent more detailed answers to City Paper's questions just before 6 p.m. on February 12. \"As I mentioned in order to meet our current realities, Total Health Care is making changes to its operations and service offerings,\" she wrote.
