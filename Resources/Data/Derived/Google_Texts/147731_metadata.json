Advocates say medical homes have the potential to improve quality, cut costs and reduce health inequities among all patients.\n\nMore than 9,000 primary care practices and 43,000 clinicians (doctors and nurse practitioners) across the country have earned the PCMH designation from the National Committee for Quality Assurance, the nation\u2019s largest credentialing organization.\n\n\u201cMedical homes focus on patients even when they\u2019re not present at the office. The team takes a proactive approach to health rather than waiting for patients to show up at the practice when they\u2019re sick,\u201d says Patricia Barrett, NCQA vice president of product delivery and PCMH.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about being there when patients are sick and reaching out to them to find out how they\u2019re doing when they\u2019re not sick,\u201d says Salvatore Volpe, a primary care physician with a solo practice in Staten Island, New York, who operates a medical home.\n\nWhat Is a Medical Home?\n\nMedical homes refer to a way of delivering primary care that helps people stay healthy by keeping up with preventive care and managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, hypertension and heart disease. In a medical home, a team of health care professionals partners with patients to coordinate every aspect of care. Providers use electronic tools to remind patients about screenings and track outcomes. Some insurers offer medical homes financial incentives for meeting quality and other standards.\n\nExperts expect interest in medical homes to increase as health reform shifts the nation\u2019s focus from illness to wellness. The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover preventive care at no out-of-pocket cost to patients and institutes payment reforms that financially reward health care providers who coordinate care.\n\nEngaging Patients\n\nVolpe, who has been at the forefront of the medical home movement for years, can\u2019t fathom running his 25-year practice any other way.\n\nHis team spends significant time coordinating care, including contacting patients by email, text, phone or mail to make sure they follow-up with preventive care appointments and are successfully managing their chronic conditions. The team also works with specialists, nursing homes, hospitals, subacute care facilities, visiting nurse associations, nutritionists, therapists and other caregivers involved in a patient\u2019s care.\n\nThe goal is to keep people healthy and manage disease when it\u2019s easier and less costly to treat. For example, people with diabetes who get regular eye and foot exams can avoid the emotional and costly consequences of diabetes-related complications such as blindness and lower-leg amputations.\n\n\u201cThe amount of money needed to take care of an illness can be 1,000 times greater than just helping people to stay well,\u201d Volpe says.\n\nAt Volpe\u2019s practice, patients have direct access to the health care team and their medical records via a patient portal that can be viewed on their smartphones, tablets or computers.\n\nTechnology also allows Volpe to identify health trends and monitor groups of patients, like individuals who are due for mammograms, colonoscopies, flu shots and more.\n\n\u201cWith the technology, you can start slicing the patient population and looking at gaps in health care,\u201d says Volpe, who is chairman of the NYS Medical Society health information technology committee and a consultant with the NYC Primary Care Information Project.\n\nPayment Reforms\n\nSome of the obstacles facing practices wanting to become certified medical homes \u2013 such as the cost of implementing an electronic medical record and hiring additional staff to help coordinate care \u2013 are beginning to wane.\n\nIn January, Medicare began paying primary care doctors a monthly management fee to coordinate care for older adults who have multiple chronic conditions even if they don\u2019t have an exam at the doctor\u2019s office. Some experts believe Medicare\u2019s move to reimburse chronic care management paves the way for more commercial insurers to begin paying primary care practices for coordinating patient care.\n\nHealthyCT, a nonprofit insurer in Wallingford, Connecticut, is already offering financial incentives to a pilot group of primary care practices that provide coordinated care.\n\n\u201cOur model rewards those practices that improve quality and the health of their patients while lowering health care costs,\u201d says Ken Lalime, HealthyCT\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nLalime said the decision to support medial home practices seemed natural given that HealthyCT was founded by a group of Connecticut physicians. As a \u201cConsumer Operated and Oriented Plan\u201d created by the federal health law, all of HealthyCT\u2019s profits are used to enhance benefits and stabilize or lower premiums.\n\n\u201cWe understand the value of providing preventive and coordinated care,\u201d he says. \u201cA $15,000 visit to the emergency department can pay for a lot of doctor visits.\u201d\n\nPatients are recognizing the value of medical homes, too.\n\n\u201cConsumers are getting more engaged in the process,\u201d Lalime says. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in models that help keep their costs down and allow them to better use their benefits. They\u2019re receiving coordinated care at time in history when health care is very complex.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"About 5.8 percent of all white women, 7.6 percent of black women and 5.6 percent of Mexican American women have coronary heart disease.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "This team of health care professionals is dedicated to keeping you healthy year-round.", "zone": "patientadvice/articles", "author": "Magaly Olivero", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "This team of health care professionals is dedicated to keeping you healthy year-round.", "title": "Is a 'Medical Home' in Your Future?", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2015/03/09/is-a-medical-home-in-your-future", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/15/73/8b1557d44dfdbd8d3ba2973d109f/150309-medicalteam-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This team of health care professionals is dedicated to keeping you healthy year-round.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Is a 'Medical Home' in Your Future? - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2015-03-09", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/b40f39e/2147483647/crop/329x329%2B55%2B0/resize/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F15%2F73%2F8b1557d44dfdbd8d3ba2973d109f%2Fresizes%2F500%2F150309-medicalteam-stock.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],patient advice,patient-advice-include [Consumer Advice],patients,doctors,health care,healthandwellness [Consumer Advice],caregiving,Medicare-Bucket-Costs [Consumer Advice],Magaly Olivero", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-03-09"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z7ehvk", "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb008\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA $15,000 visit to the emergency department can pay for a lot of doctor visits.\u201dPatients are recognizing the value of medical homes, too.\nThat\u2019s the mission of thousands of primary care practices nationwide that have embraced the \u201cpatient centered medical home\u201d model that emphasizes prevention and disease management.\nIn a medical home, a team of health care professionals partners with patients to coordinate every aspect of care.\nSome insurers offer medical homes financial incentives for meeting quality and other standards.\nExperts expect interest in medical homes to increase as health reform shifts the nation\u2019s focus from illness to wellness."}
