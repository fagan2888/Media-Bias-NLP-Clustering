Kelly O\n\nIn response to Seattle\u2019s new minimum-wage law, restaurateurs have begun to make various changes to accommodate higher compensation for their employees: Ivar\u2019s raised prices and eliminated tips, while Tom Douglas added (and then deleted) a surcharge. Last week, chef Renee Erickson announced that, effective May 4, tipping will be eliminated at her restaurants the Whale Wins, the Walrus and the Carpenter, and Barnacle. Instead, customers will pay an 18.5 percent service charge that will be distributed to employees.\n\nAlso beginning May 4, all of the front-of-house and back-of-house workers\u2014servers, cooks, and dishwashers\u2014will make a base pay of at least $15 an hour. In addition, employees will receive a bonus based on daily sales and hours worked.\n\nFor Erickson, the move has less to do with the city\u2019s new minimum wage and more to do with addressing the income disparity that exists between back-of-house and front-of-house workers, the latter of whom commonly make two to three times as much as their colleagues.\n\n\u201cThe industry needs to evolve,\u201d says Erickson. \u201cThe system we\u2019ve adopted in America favors the front of the house in financial value, and that\u2019s really not fair\u2014at least we don\u2019t believe it to be. We\u2019re taking that 18.5 percent [service charge] and redistributing it to everyone in a system that we\u2019ve come up with. Back of house is still not making as much, but it\u2019s better. It\u2019s moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nAccording to Erickson\u2019s business partner Jeremy Price, the new system will affect workers in essentially the same way as the current tip-pooling system that their company, Sea Creatures, uses in all of its restaurants. Day-to-day sales numbers are \u201copen and everyone sees them, with some percentage going to front-of-house workers and some to back-of-house workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve done our jobs, everyone\u2019s pay stays the same,\u201d says Price, with the exception of dishwashers and entry-level cooks, who are the only workers in the company who weren\u2019t already making at least $15 an hour.\n\nFor the last year, Erickson and her partners (also including Chad Dale) were looking into changing the system through which they offered employees health-care benefits. Because Sea Creatures employs close to 60 people, it falls under the large employer mandate to provide health insurance for full-time employees. \u201cWe started out thinking about the Affordable Care Act and minimum wage but realized it was a much bigger conversation than that,\u201d says Price.\n\n\u201cThe conversation we always defaulted to,\u201d says Erickson, \u201cwas the legitimizing of the [restaurant] industry that we felt wasn\u2019t there. There\u2019s this idea that being in a restaurant is a stepping-stone to whatever you\u2019re going to do when you grow up. I definitely chose a career that I\u2019m super-proud of, and it feels hurtful when people are not treating you as equal to a cabinet builder or some other person in a craft.\n\n\u201cWe wondered what other changes we could facilitate,\u201d Erickson continues. \u201cWe knew $15 an hour was coming, and it meant we could consider bigger changes.\u201d\n\nThroughout the minimum-wage debate, the restaurant-industry norm was to advocate for the inclusion of a tip credit, which allows employers to account for tips and health care in an employee\u2019s wage increase. Many business owners claimed the tip credit was essential to their ability to survive an increase in labor costs, citing the industry\u2019s slim profit margins.\n\n\u201cRestaurant owners talk about margins being small, and they are,\u201d says Price. \u201cBut if you\u2019re doing well, that small margin comes from a pretty big pool of revenue. So it might be a small margin in terms of percentages, but you can effectively have enough money [to do more for staff]. And we feel that it\u2019s incumbent on us to do so.\u201d\n\nErickson herself wasn\u2019t initially keen on a service charge, preferring an across-the-board menu price increase. According to Erickson and Price, the decision to implement a service charge came not from them, but from their employees.\n\n\u201cIt was really our staff that pushed for it,\u201d says Price. \u201cThey worried about having to explain the price increase to every guest, every night.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe concerns from staff,\u201d recalls Erickson, \u201cwere \u2018What will people do if they don\u2019t know anything about what we\u2019re doing with this extra money, if they don\u2019t know it\u2019s going to help employees?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nerve-racking,\u201d she continues, \u201cwondering if we\u2019re going to alienate ourselves because our chicken is $35, while everyone else\u2019s is $26. Without a service charge, we don\u2019t get to explain why. This is a business: We want to compete.\u201d\n\nBoth Erickson and Price see the service charge as an intermediate step: \u201cEventually we just want to charge what has to be charged to pay people what they deserve,\u201d says Erickson. \u201cThat\u2019s where our hearts are.\u201d\n\nKristen Roewer, a server at the Whale Wins, says she believes Erickson and Price have the staff\u2019s best interests in mind. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of the conversation that is being brought up, especially as it relates to tipping culture and equity between front of house and back of house,\u201d she says.\n\nPrice acknowledges that there is \u201ccynicism around whether or not we, as owners, are trying to keep this service charge for the house. We\u2019re not. It\u2019s all going back to the employees\u2014and more. By the time we\u2019ve paid everyone $15, we\u2019ve run through that 18.5 percent and into our own pockets as owners.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In response to Seattle\u2019s new minimum-wage law, restaurateurs have begun to make various changes to accommodate higher compensation for their employees: Ivar\u2019s raised prices and eliminated tips, while Tom Douglas added (and then deleted) a surcharge.
