Among the 11 candidates on the ballot, I have the most public policy experience and the most extensive record of enacting common sense, pro-taxpayer and public safety reforms. I have 32 years of public service as a Naval Officer, mayor, Governor Wilson\u2019s Insurance Advisor, Legislative Health and Insurance Policy Advisor and as CEO of a local, small business chamber of commerce.\n\nSailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS Midway called me \u201cHurricane Hanley\u201d because I got the mission done. I take action. I have enacted 12 balanced budgets, cost-saving pension reforms, defeated tax increases, banned the corrupt use of eminent domain, reduced the fire threat and wrote HMO, mental health and workers\u2019 compensation reforms. I\u2019m the only candidate who has written legislation and gotten bad bills vetoed. I\u2019m endorsed by prominent conservatives and job creators.\n\nIf elected, what will be your top priorities and why?\n\nAmong the 11 candidates on the ballot, I provide on my website, KevinHanley.org, the most extensive list of reform ideas to ignite the California Comeback. I have posted videos and over 100 of my published articles on how I will fight to balance the budget; reduce crime; prevent catastrophic fire; preserve Proposition 13; cut California\u2019s high taxes; create abundant water and energy supplies and private sector jobs; reduce traffic congestion; repeal laws that encourage illegal immigration; replace onerous Obamacare provisions with reforms to guarantee patient choice of physicians, hospitals and treatments; and end the \u201cTrain to Nowhere\u201d and the Twin Tunnels.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, local news, auburn journal,auburn news,national news, state news, crime, accident, breaking news, crime log, local sports,national sports, ski report, sports score, living, arts, entertainment, obituaries, classifieds, auburn photos, auburn videos, multimedia, auburn, health, fitness, dinning guide", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local auburn news.
