Now, fully-insured Rothbauer is facing a $50,000 bill and possible bankruptcy.\n\nWhile at work last year, Rothbauer\u2019s heart stopped beating and started \u201cshaking.\u201d She was taken by ambulance to the closest hospital\u2013St. Mary\u2019s\u2013where it took doctors 45 minutes to get her heart beating again. She spent ten days in the hospital in a medically-induced coma, and another week in the cardiac ward.\n\nUnfortunately for Rothbauer, even though she is fully insured by Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, they do not have a contract with St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, so she was not covered there. When she left the hospital, Rothbauer was facing a $254,000 bill.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield agreed to cover the $156,000 that her hospitalization cost, leaving her with a $98,000 bill that she worked with St. Mary\u2019s to reduce to $9,800. However, that didn\u2019t cover the costs of the doctors and nurses, the ambulance, or the physical therapist, among other things. When all was said and done, Rothbauer was left with a bill for $52,531.92.\n\nWhat is most frustrating is that Meriter Hospital, only three-tenths of a mile down the road from St. Mary\u2019s, does have a contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield. If paramedics had taken Rothbauer there instead, she would have had a maximum copay of only $1,500.\n\nRothbauer doesn\u2019t fault the paramedics with taking her to the wrong hospital.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cIt was the closest hospital to where I had my event,\u201d she said, \u201cso naturally the ambulance took me there.\u201d \u201cI was in a coma. I couldn\u2019t very well wake up and say, \u2018Hey! Take me to the next hospital.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe knows she owes her life to the doctors and nurses at St. Mary\u2019s, and there is the possibility that three blocks could have made the difference between life and death. Still, it is frustrating.\n\nRothbauer\u2019s situation isn\u2019t an isolated one. Meg Gaines, who runs the Center for Patient Partnership at the University of Wisconsin, said, \u201dMy strong suspicion is that this happens more frequently than you might think.\u201d She said it is the paramedics, not the patients, who often control healthcare decisions. \u201cIt is totally random, and it is the problem with [the insurance companies] saying, \u2018Well, you know, consumers have to go to the right hospital,\u2019 and you say, \u2018Well, what if you\u2019re unconscious?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield says they have done their part in this case by paying 100 percent of its in-network rate. They blame Rothbauer\u2019s situation on the hospital. Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield spokesman Scott Larrivee said, \u201cSince we have no contract with this hospital, we have very little influence over what the hospital is charging in this situation.\u201d The insurance company also points to the high prices at St. Mary\u2019s; but the hospital says that, while they empathize with Rothbauer\u2019s situation, they have already written off tens of thousands of dollars in costs and don\u2019t plan to negotiate any further.\n\nSadly, there is not a lot Rothbauer can do. While the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, stipulates that emergency rooms must provide services to out-of-network patients, it also says that patients are responsible for the difference between the bill and the amount the insurance company will cover. It\u2019s called \u201cbalance billing.\u201d\n\nNow Rothbauer and her boyfriend, Ben Johnson, are looking at their options, trying to figure out if they will be able to negotiate further, or if they need to get second jobs, cash out retirement accounts, take a loan from the hospital, or file for bankruptcy. They want to get engaged, but don\u2019t want to do so until they are more certain of what Rothbauer\u2019s financial situation will be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating for people who plan, who get insurance, get coverage, do everything they can and then, at 29, have a heart attack and get taken to the wrong hospital, and can\u2019t get married, can\u2019t do anything because they have to declare bankruptcy because they can\u2019t afford to have gone to the hospital,\u201d Rothbauer said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not enough to worry about having a heart attack at 29, you end up with a secondary one or a stroke because of your medical bills. I mean, it\u2019s just ridiculous. The level of frustration is astronomical.\u201d \u201cMy hardest issue is I had no control and I still have no control over what is my future. I don\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else. I don\u2019t know if this can be fixed for me at this point, but I think it\u2019s unfortunate that it can happen to anyone.\u201d\n\nh/t Daily Mail\n\nPhoto Credit: YouTube", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I don't want this to happen to anyone else...\"", "author": "Heather Laskin", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "\"I don't want this to happen to anyone else...\"", "title": "See How 0.3 Miles Made A $48,500 Difference That Could Bankrupt This Wisconsin Woman", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 803, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/meganrothbauer.png", "height": 463}, "updated_time": "2014-11-14T10:55:35-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/three-tenths-mile-made-48500-difference-wisconsin-woman/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I don't want this to happen to anyone else...\"", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/meganrothbauer.png", "title": "Three-Tenths Of A Mile Made A $48,500 Difference For This Wisconsin Woman", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-13T18:10:40-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Featured Stories", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2014-11-13T18:10:40-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-14T10:55:35-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "megan rothbauer, anthem blue cross blue shield, , health, obamacare, politics, nation, religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda363\"", "article_summary": "What is most frustrating is that Meriter Hospital, only three-tenths of a mile down the road from St. Mary\u2019s, does have a contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield.\nIf paramedics had taken Rothbauer there instead, she would have had a maximum copay of only $1,500.\nWhen she left the hospital, Rothbauer was facing a $254,000 bill.\nUnfortunately for Rothbauer, even though she is fully insured by Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, they do not have a contract with St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, so she was not covered there.\nRothbauer\u2019s situation isn\u2019t an isolated one."}
