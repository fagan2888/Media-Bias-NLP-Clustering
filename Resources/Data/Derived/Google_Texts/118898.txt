Darren Ghanayem, CIO of WellCare Health Plans Inc. WellCare Health Plans Inc.

Darren Ghanayem joined WellCare Health Plans Inc. as CIO, effective Monday, filling a position that has been vacant since March 2015.

Mr. Ghanayem comes from rival health insurer Anthem Inc., where he served most recently as vice president of business transformation. He helped integrate several acquisitions and worked on talent management issues there. WellCare is actively pursuing acquisitions in a plan to double revenue by 2021, as Chief Executive Ken Burdick said in an earnings call in February. The company reported $13.9 billion in revenue for 2015.

The health insurance industry has seen a wave of consolidation in recent years as companies look for cost efficiency because of effects of the Affordable Care Act and other factors. Anthem has proposed a $48 billion merger with Cigna Corp. and Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc. are in the midst of a $37 billion merger.

WellCare’s previous CIO, Rose Hauser, left the company in March 2015, after 13 months in the position. “Ms. Hauser’s departure was part of a decision to expand our technology capabilities to help us drive business results and better serve our provider partners and members,” a WellCare spokeswoman said in an email. Ms. Hauser did not respond to an email requesting comment.
