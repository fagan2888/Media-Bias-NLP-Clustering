On paper, the race should have been a prime chance for the GOP to solidify its hold on the state. The two-term Democratic governor, Steve Beshear, wouldn\u2019t be on the ballot, and Republicans had already beaten his would-be successor, Attorney General Jack Conway, in the 2010 Senate race that elected Rand Paul. Last year, the state\u2019s most powerful Republican, Mitch McConnell, won a hard-fought reelection race by a wider margin than anyone expected, in a victory that guaranteed his elevation to Senate majority leader. Things were looking rosy for Republicans in Kentucky. And then came Matt Bevin. Again. The Tea Party outsider had tried to oust McConnell in a primary challenge, and had been routed. But a year later, he squeaked out a victory (by 83 votes!) in the GOP gubernatorial primary over the party\u2019s preferred candidate, James Comer. Republicans\u2014McConnell included\u2014reluctantly embraced their unlikely standard-bearer, but Bevin\u2019s path to the governor\u2019s office has not been smooth.\n\nConway has vastly outspent Bevin on television, and the Democrat has maintained a small but sturdy lead in the polls. Republicans have been frustrated both by Bevin\u2019s frequent missteps and by the manufacturing executive\u2019s hesitance to put much of his own money into his campaign. Late last month, the Republican Governors Association pulled its TV ads for Bevin, sending a signal it believed the race was lost. Bevin responded by putting up a million dollars worth of commercials on his own, and on Tuesday morning, the RGA announced it was going back on the air for the last two weeks of the race. \u201cWe decided to go back in because we\u2019ve been doing the polling, and the polling shows the race very winnable,\u201d RGA spokesman Jon Thompson told me. Related Story A Kentucky Election That's Too Close to Call? Republican and Democratic operatives agree on two points: The race between Bevin and Conway has been overwhelmingly negative, and turnout will be low. \u201cNobody has momentum,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a GOP consultant in Kentucky. Democrats have tried to seize on Bevin\u2019s shaky standing among Republicans and hammered him for inconsistent and erratic statements. He\u2019s wavered, for example, on whether he would cancel Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid expansion, and in a recent debate, he appeared to confuse Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans, meanwhile, were annoyed when Bevin suggested he would support Ben Carson in the GOP presidential race over Kentucky\u2019s own Rand Paul. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to an awful lot of Republicans who are either scared of him as governor or are mad at him,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth, the only Democrat remaining in Kentucky\u2019s congressional delegation. Conway has run a steadier race than did Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic challenger to McConnell in 2014 who famously refused to say whether she had voted for Barack Obama. Republicans have tried to replicate their winning formula of tying Conway to Obama policies on health care and coal that are particularly unpopular in Kentucky. But that\u2019s more difficult to do in a gubernatorial race than it has been in recent campaigns for Senate. While Republicans now control all but one of Kentucky\u2019s federal elected positions, Democrats retain most state offices, and the electorate this November \u201ccould be slightly more favorable\u201d to them, Jennings said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to an awful lot of Republicans who are either scared of [Bevin] as governor or are mad at him.\u201d Health care has been a big issue in recent elections in Kentucky, and it remains so this year. While \u201cObamacare\u201d has been deeply unpopular there, it has helped about 500,000 Kentuckians gain insurance either through Medicaid or the state-run exchange, Kynect, which had been held up as a model of success for the nation. But earlier this month, the state\u2019s largest nonprofit insurer, the Kentucky Health Cooperative, announced it was going under, jeopardizing health coverage for some 51,000 residents. Bevin has seized on the failure to press his argument that the federal health law has placed an unsustainable financial burden on the state. \u201cThe fact that it happened in October was extremely inconvenient timing for [Conway],\u201d Jennings said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Tea Party nominee and one-time challenger to Mitch McConnell is struggling to deliver a winnable governor\u2019s race for Republicans.", "author": "Russell Berman", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The Tea Party nominee is struggling to deliver a winnable governor\u2019s race for Republicans.", "title": "Will Matt Bevin Spoil the GOP's Shot in Kentucky?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/10/AP_694818563004/facebook.jpg?1445432447", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/will-matt-bevin-spoil-the-gops-shot-in-kentucky/411592/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc0d5\"", "article_summary": "But earlier this month, the state\u2019s largest nonprofit insurer, the Kentucky Health Cooperative, announced it was going under, jeopardizing health coverage for some 51,000 residents.\nRepublicans, meanwhile, were annoyed when Bevin suggested he would support Ben Carson in the GOP presidential race over Kentucky\u2019s own Rand Paul.\nLate last month, the Republican Governors Association pulled its TV ads for Bevin, sending a signal it believed the race was lost.\nRepublican and Democratic operatives agree on two points: The race between Bevin and Conway has been overwhelmingly negative, and turnout will be low.\nOn paper, the race should have been a prime chance for the GOP to solidify its hold on the state."}
