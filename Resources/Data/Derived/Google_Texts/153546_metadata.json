Rick Scott, including more than $400 million in tax cuts and higher education funding.\n\n\u201cI think there is a lot in this budget for everybody and I think the governor will find favor to it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Gardiner also acknowledged that lawmakers have sidestepped the issue of dealing with a huge group of uninsured Floridians, after the House rejected the Senate plan to expand health care coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act. Instead, the House and Senate used $400 million in state funding to boost a complicated funding formula that helps hospitals offset some of the cost of caring for the uninsured.\n\n\u201cUntil we come up with a long-term health care solution for the uninsured, that\u2019s just going to be where we are,\u201d Gardiner said.\n\nThe rejection of the Medicaid expansion plan was a theme taken up by a number of House Democrats as they debated the budget bill on the House floor on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThere is no health care expansion,\u201d said House Democratic leader Mark Pafford of West Palm Beach, arguing the state lost out on federal funding that could have helped the budget do more. \u201cWe left a ton of those dollars, billions of dollars, out of this budget scenario.\u201d\n\nBut House Majority Leader Dana Young, R-Tampa, urged members to vote for the budget bill because of what it will provide to the state in addition to the tax cuts and higher education funding.\n\nShe cited major funding boosts for child welfare programs and mental health and substance abuse initiatives. Young said the budget included money to take 2,000 disabled Floridians off a waiting list for services in the Agency for Persons with Disabilities.\n\nYoung said the budget will provide nearly $82 million for Everglades restoration as well as $50 million for the protection of Florida\u2019s natural springs.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the people back home know what we are doing for them,\u201d Young said. \u201cIf you vote no you are snubbing your constituents on these helpful, useful programs.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats criticized how the budget handled spending under the new Amendment 1, which required some $742 million be spent on environmental initiatives. Environmental groups say lawmakers should have devoted more funding than $55 million, including $17.5 million for the Florida Forever program, to land-buying initiatives.\n\nRep. Evan Jenne, D-Dania Beach, said the environmental budget \u201cviolates the intent of the amendment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have grave concerns that we are going to be sued as a body again,\u201d said Jenne, referring to the threat of a lawsuit by environmental groups and the fact that the House was found in violation of the state constitution by ending its regular session three days early in April.\n\nThe new budget also contains hundreds of local economic development, education, historic, social service and environmental projects, including more some $300 million in spending that was added on the final night of budget negotiations on Monday.\n\nThe projects range from $2 million for the IMG Academy in Bradenton to $250,000 to buy a Marion County home that was once owned by Ma Barker, the mother of members of the Depression-era Barker-Karpis gang.\n\nBudget highlights\n\nFlorida lawmakers will vote on a $78.7 billion state budget today:\n\n\u2022It is nearly $2 billion higher than the current $77 billion budget.\n\n\u2022K-12 spending will reach $19.7 billion, representing a $207 or 3 percent increase in per-student spending.\n\n\u2022$742 million is being spent on environmental initiatives as the result of Amendment 1.\n\n\u2022The environmental spending includes $55 million in land-buying programs, $82 million for Everglades restoration and $50 million for springs protection.\n\n\u2022It provides for more than $400 million in tax cuts, including a $20 a year reduction in cell phone and cable TV taxes and a 10-day sales tax holiday in August.\n\n\u2022There are no general pay raises for state employees but a few groups will see a boost, including a $2,000 increase for state firefighters.\n\n\u2022There are no tuition increases for university or state college students and they will be able to buy their textbooks tax-free in the coming year.\n\n\u2022$400 million in state money was provided for a funding formula to help hospitals with care for the uninsured. Combined with federal funds and local tax dollars, it will provide more than $2 billion to the hospitals in the coming year.\n\n\u2022It includes more than $300 million in \u201csupplemental spending\u201d added by lawmakers on the final night of budget negotiations.\n\n\u2022It has reserve funds in the range of $3 billion, which is important in helping the state maintain its top-level credit rating.\n\n\u2022The budget faces review and approval by Gov. Rick Scott, who vetoed more than $69 million in spending last year.\n\n\u2022The new budget takes effect July 1.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "TALLAHASSEE -- Florida lawmakers are poised to end their special session today by passing a $78.7 billion state budget that will boost public education fun", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "article_summary": "Budget highlightsFlorida lawmakers will vote on a $78.7 billion state budget today:\u2022It is nearly $2 billion higher than the current $77 billion budget.\n\u2022The environmental spending includes $55 million in land-buying programs, $82 million for Everglades restoration and $50 million for springs protection.\n\u2022It includes more than $300 million in \u201csupplemental spending\u201d added by lawmakers on the final night of budget negotiations.\nHouse Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, said the budget met the top priorities for the House and Gov.\nRick Scott, including more than $400 million in tax cuts and higher education funding."}
