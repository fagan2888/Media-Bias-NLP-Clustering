The current target is 2 percent, the midpoint of a 1 percent to 3 percent range.\n\nPoloz reiterated during testimony to a parliamentary finance committee that while the threshold for change is high because the inflation target framework is seen to have worked well, it is still a \"live issue\".\n\nThe bank is also looking at what is the right measure of inflation and how to integrate issues of financial stability, he said.\n\nPoloz said the question of the level was \"perhaps the most prominent issue\", given that many central banks were forced to reduce rates towards zero after the financial crisis, and a higher inflation target would have left them more room to maneuver.\n\nThe possibility of negative interest rates, which also gives more room to act than was previously available, also has to be taken into consideration, Poloz said.\n\n\"It's that two sides of the coin which need to be assessed,\" he said.\n\nPoloz said concrete discussions with the finance department should begin in the next month or two.\n\nIt was Poloz's first comments since last week's interest rate decision, which left rates at 0.5 percent, though it flagged the downside risks the economy faces.\n\nPoloz said recent data have been encouraging but quite variable, with no concrete evidence of higher investment and strong creation of firms.\n\nThe oil price plunge drove Canada into a brief recession last year, but the economy started 2016 on a better footing. The bank expects to see annualized growth of 2.8 percent in the first quarter before cooling to 1.0 percent in the second.\n\nAsked whether the bank had been too bearish in its forecasts that second-quarter growth will decelerate, Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said the bank sees volatility in inventories and exports potentially contributing to the slowdown.\n\nThe recent strength in exports was more than what you would expect given U.S. and foreign demand, Wilkins said.\n\n\"So we've taken a cautious approach to that outlook and think that there will be some give back in subsequent quarters.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by David Ljunggren; editing by Franklin Paul and Andrew Hay)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada is looking closely at what level of inflation it", "title": "Bank of Canada head says inflation target still 'live issue'", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Bank-Canadas-Poloz-recent-economic-data-encouraging-variable", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/canada-cenbank_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Bank-Canadas-Poloz-recent-economic-data-encouraging-variable", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/canada-cenbank_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada is looking closely at what level of inflation it", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Poloz reiterated during testimony to a parliamentary finance committee that while the threshold for change is high because the inflation target framework is seen to have worked well, it is still a \"live issue\".\nThe central bank reviews its inflation targets, which are set jointly with the Canadian government, every five years.\nThe bank is also looking at what is the right measure of inflation and how to integrate issues of financial stability, he said.\nThe current target is 2 percent, the midpoint of a 1 percent to 3 percent range.\nPoloz said recent data have been encouraging but quite variable, with no concrete evidence of higher investment and strong creation of firms."}
