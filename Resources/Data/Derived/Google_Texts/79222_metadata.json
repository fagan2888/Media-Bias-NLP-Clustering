The judge also is being asked to declare more than 100 licenses already issued invalid.\n\nThe law firm of Killmer, Lane & Newman, which filed the counterclaim, released a statement saying the attorney general\u2019s office is attempting to invalidate \u201clegal same sex marriages\u201d without giving any notice that Colorado is attempting to \u201cdestroy their families.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the position of intervening Defendants that their marriage is legal despite Colorado\u2019s unconstitutional Amendment 43 defining a valid marriage as being \u2018between one man and one woman,\u2019 \u201d said the motion filed Tuesday by David Lane, a Denver attorney.\n\nTrying to invalidate marriages in court without notifying the families involved is \u201cantithetical to family values and the sanctity of marriage under any standards,\u201d the statement by the law firm says.\n\nLopez and Maestas were married June 30, the day after the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Utah\u2019s ban against gay marriage. On the same day, Denver District Judge Elizabeth Starrs solemnized their wedding vows in her chambers.\n\nLopez, who is an attorney, and Maestas, who works for a nonprofit company, are foster parents of 4-year-old twin boys. They have been in a relationship for eight years, according to the motion.\n\nThe couple\u2019s motion says their marriage is legal, is valid and must be recognized under the due process clause under the Fifth Amendment and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gay couple asks judge to stop Suthers from enforcing marriage ban", "title": "Gay couple asks judge to stop Suthers from enforcing marriage ban", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/08/gay-couple-asks-judge-to-stop-suthers-from-enforcing-marriage-ban/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140701__boulder-same-sex-marriages-continuep1-1.jpg", "height": 448}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140701__boulder-same-sex-marriages-continuep1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-08T16:14:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:13:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb1b\"", "article_summary": "A gay couple who recently married in the Boulder County clerk\u2019s office filed a counterclaim seeking an injunction to prevent Attorney General John Suthers from enforcing Colorado\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional\u201d ban on gay marriage.\nCircuit Court of Appeals struck down Utah\u2019s ban against gay marriage.\nAlex Lopez and Michael Maestas filed the counterclaim to intervene Tuesday in Boulder County District Court.\nSuthers\u2019 office has filed a lawsuit in the court seeking to prevent the Boulder clerk from performing marriages.\nLopez, who is an attorney, and Maestas, who works for a nonprofit company, are foster parents of 4-year-old twin boys."}
