Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA), a long-time advocate for the poor, said in a statement that \"compared to the draconian cuts\" sought by House Republicans, the negotiated compromise is \"a dramatic improvement.\"\n\nRelated: Fight Over Food Stamps in a Nearly $1 Trillion Farm Bill\n\nThere are still differences to be ironed out over price controls on the nation\u2019s dairy industry. But in the end, Congress finally appears on the verge of major new farm and food stamp legislation that would cost well in excess of $900 billion over the next ten years.\n\nIn May 2013, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the current farm bill programs, if they were to continue beyond the 2008, would cost $973 billion over a decade. About $764 billion of this amount would go for nutrition programs and the other $208 billion would be divided among various agriculture-related support programs.\n\nRelated: \u2018King Coal\u2019 Politics Could Derail Spending Bill\n\nMeanwhile, top House and Senate Republican and Democratic appropriations committee leaders have been working round the clock to convert a bipartisan budget deal negotiated by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), into the spending measures essential to operating government agencies and programs. Congress has until Jan. 15 to pass the Omnibus bill -- with a dozen separate appropriations bills jammed into one -- or suffer spending cuts required under the sequester.\n\nAs usual, the current talks between Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) and House Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers (R-KY) are going down to the wire. Congress may have to consider a brief continuing resolution to buy lawmakers an additional two days or so to complete the work, according to a Democratic aide.\n\nHeritage Foundation budgetary analyst Romina Boccia wrote this week that lawmakers involved in the bill are expected \"to try to ram it through Congress quickly to avoid as many objections as possible.\"\n\n\"Few (if any) lawmakers will read the entire bill,\" Boccia said in her blog post. \"No lawmaker in Congress will reasonably have the time to read the entire omnibus bill.\"\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After a year of pent up federal spending decisions, we're about to witness a deluge of nearly $2 trillion of budget actions in a matter of weeks, including an omnibus spending bill to keep the government operating throughout 2014, a new farm and food stamp bill and possibly an extension of the emergency unemployment insurance program.", "title": "Congress Likely to Pass $1 Trillion Spending Bill Without Reading It", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/09/Congress-Likely-Pass-1-Trillion-Spending-Bill-Without-Reading-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04142011_Capitol_Cash_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/09/Congress-Likely-Pass-1-Trillion-Spending-Bill-Without-Reading-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04142011_Capitol_Cash_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "After a year of pent up federal spending decisions, we're about to witness a deluge of nearly $2 trillion of budget actions in a matter of weeks, including an omnibus spending bill to keep the government operating throughout 2014, a new farm and food stamp bill and possibly an extension of the emergency unemployment insurance program.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0804\"", "article_summary": "As usual, the current talks between Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) and House Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers (R-KY) are going down to the wire.\nCongress has until Jan. 15 to pass the Omnibus bill -- with a dozen separate appropriations bills jammed into one -- or suffer spending cuts required under the sequester.\nRelated: Fight Over Food Stamps in a Nearly $1 Trillion Farm BillThere are still differences to be ironed out over price controls on the nation\u2019s dairy industry.\n\"No lawmaker in Congress will reasonably have the time to read the entire omnibus bill.\"\nThe high profile battle over food stamp spending delayed completion of compromise farm legislation by months."}
