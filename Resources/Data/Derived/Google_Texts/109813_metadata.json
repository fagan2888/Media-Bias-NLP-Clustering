Scott Brown of Massachusetts ruined their filibuster-proof majority.\n\nToday\u2019s GOP leaders want to turn the tables by using Congress\u2018 first unified budget in six years to show they are serious about scrapping the health law.\n\nCommittee chairmen from both chambers must report their ideas by July 24, leaving a three-to-four-week window for them to address the potential fallout from a Supreme Court\u2019s decision in King v. Burwell, which is due this month.\n\nJustices are deciding whether the IRS has unlawfully paid Obamacare\u2019s subsidies to customers in 34 states that declined to set up their own health exchanges.\n\nRepublicans hope to use the ruling as a bridge to 2017, when a GOP president and majorities in Congress would let them repeal and replace the health overhaul.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all going to have to look at where we are in the wake of the decision, and we\u2019ll have a plan for the American people if in fact the plaintiff is successful,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.\n\nCongressional Republicans say their use of reconciliation will largely be dictated by whether the justices strike down the subsidies.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s unclear whether the Senate parliamentarian will permit the GOP\u2019s attempt at full Obamacare repeal, as reconciliation provisions must fit into strict budget rules. Most notably, a rule named for former Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd prohibits senators from including extraneous measures that distract from reconciliation\u2019s goal of deficit reduction.\n\nGOP aides said they haven\u2019t given up on full repeal, although they\u2019ve acknowledged that the Byrd rule does place limits on what they can do.\n\nCongressional Democrats have blasted the GOP\u2019s plans as weak and unnecessary, pointing to 16 million Americans who\u2019ve gained coverage under Obamacare. They also say there is no need to forge a back-up plan for the King decision, arguing Congress never intended to treat the states differently and that the justices will see it the same way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Senate Budget Committee sent formal instructions Friday to committees tasked with leveraging a fast-track budget tool to chalk up a major, if symbolic, GOP victory: the repeal of Obamacare.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Senate Budget Committee sent formal instructions Friday to committees tasked with leveraging a fast-track budget tool to chalk up a major, if symbolic, GOP victory: the repeal of Obamacare.", "title": "Senate formally begins process to repeal Obamacare", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/5/senate-formally-begins-process-repeal-obamacare/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/05/AP100610032169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/05/AP100610032169.jpg", "description": "The Senate Budget Committee sent formal instructions Friday to committees tasked with leveraging a fast-track budget tool to chalk up a major, if symbolic, GOP victory: the repeal of Obamacare.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Senate formally begins process to repeal Obamacare"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Republican Party, Congress, Senate"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe11af\"", "article_summary": "Either way, it\u2019s unclear whether the Senate parliamentarian will permit the GOP\u2019s attempt at full Obamacare repeal, as reconciliation provisions must fit into strict budget rules.\nThe Senate Budget Committee sent formal instructions Friday to committees tasked with leveraging a fast-track budget tool to chalk up a major, if symbolic, GOP victory: the repeal of Obamacare.\nThe congressional budget for fiscal 2016 instructs chairmen of the Finance and Health committees to each find ways to reduce the deficit by $1 billion over the next decade.\nCongressional Democrats have blasted the GOP\u2019s plans as weak and unnecessary, pointing to 16 million Americans who\u2019ve gained coverage under Obamacare.\nDemocratic majorities used reconciliation to polish off Obamacare in 2010, after the election of Republican Sen.
