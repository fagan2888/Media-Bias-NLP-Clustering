Are they worth dropping everything and joining this time?\n\nThe answer is a resounding \u201cOui!\u201d Bring your flag.\n\nThe well-traveled \u201cLes Miserables\u201d has rolled into town for its third bite at the Broadway apple \u2014 not to mention fresh off a celebrated 2012 film \u2014 but there\u2019s nothing tiresome about its gloomy, aching heartbeat.\n\nDirected this time by Laurence Connor and James Powell, with new orchestrations, stagecraft and costumes, this terrific \u201cLes Miserables\u201d opened Sunday at the Imperial Theatre, capping a national tour that began in 2010.\n\nIt\u2019s beautifully sung and acted \u2014 Ramin Karimloo, Will Swenson, Caissie Levy and Nikki M. James as leads can do no wrong \u2014 and the clever sets, superb lighting and moving projections highlight a creative team fully embracing Victor Hugo\u2019s epic novel about good and evil, revolution and romance, in 19th-century France.\n\nIt boasts music by Claude-Michel Schonberg, lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer and original French text by Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel. Producer Cameron Mackintosh was sold on reviving the show after learning that set designer Matt Kinley was inspired by the paintings of Hugo, which are often brooding, eerie and romantic.\n\nHis images of Paris infuse the production \u2014 augmented by enough fog to host a heavy metal festival \u2014 and, together with golden beams of lighting by Paule Constable, leave the actors looking at bit like they\u2019re in paintings themselves.\n\nProjections by Fifty-Nine Productions are subtle until brilliant, especially the plunge into the sewers in Act 2. There is no massive spinning turntable on the stage, as in previous incarnations, but it isn\u2019t missed.\n\nKarimloo stars as Jean Valjean, the former prisoner No. 24601 who is the moral center of Hugo\u2019s historical tale. Karimloo, a Mackintosh favorite in London, makes a tremendous Broadway debut, starting out as a feral, muscular animal out of chains and leaving an unsteady old man in grace. His falsetto sung prayer \u201cBring Him Home\u201d is sublime.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Review: Gloomy, glorious \u2018Les Miz\u2019 hits Broadway", "title": "Review: Gloomy, glorious \u2018Les Miz\u2019 hits Broadway", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Review: Gloomy, glorious \u2018Les Miz\u2019 hits Broadway", "title": "Review: Gloomy, glorious \u2018Les Miz\u2019 hits Broadway", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/23/review_gloomy_glorious_les_miz_hits_broadway/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/theater-review-les-miserables.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Review: Gloomy, glorious \u2018Les Miz\u2019 hits Broadway", "title": "Review: Gloomy, glorious \u2018Les Miz\u2019 hits Broadway", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/theater-review-les-miserables.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mark Kennedy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The well-traveled \u201cLes Miserables\u201d has rolled into town for its third bite at the Broadway apple \u2014 not to mention fresh off a celebrated 2012 film \u2014 but there\u2019s nothing tiresome about its gloomy, aching heartbeat.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The barricades have once again gone up on Broadway.\nDirected this time by Laurence Connor and James Powell, with new orchestrations, stagecraft and costumes, this terrific \u201cLes Miserables\u201d opened Sunday at the Imperial Theatre, capping a national tour that began in 2010.\nKarimloo, a Mackintosh favorite in London, makes a tremendous Broadway debut, starting out as a feral, muscular animal out of chains and leaving an unsteady old man in grace.\nIt boasts music by Claude-Michel Schonberg, lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer and original French text by Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel."}
