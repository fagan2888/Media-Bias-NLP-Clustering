Only 30 percent of respondents in Allianz\u2019s survey chose financial fitness as a top goal for 2015.\n\nBoth companies surmise that Americans are more confident about their financial situations, so they aren\u2019t feeling the pressure to focus on finances. The economy is healthier. Interest rates are still super low. The percentage of people saying now is a good time to find a quality job jumped to 36 percent in December, a long way up from the 8 percent level of confidence that Americans had in the job market in November 2011, according to Gallup. And the stock market has been roaring, boosting investment portfolios and in many cases erasing the losses of the recession.\n\nWhile certainly one\u2019s health is important \u2014 I know I\u2019m promising myself to get more sleep and exercise \u2014 your financial well-being is equally vital. But we can\u2019t forget the past. The recession and its trials and tribulations should be a constant reminder of how low things can go. Don\u2019t get cocky by letting your confidence lead you right back to mistakes that left you more vulnerable than you should have been.\n\nOne exercise that can humble you is to take a key financial assessment. After you do this checkup, you\u2019ll know what, if anything, you\u2019ll need to do to improve your financial situation.\n\nSo when was the last time you calculated your net worth?\n\nIt is different from your income. There are a lot of pretenders, people who appear rich but really are paupers because they have a negative net worth. Net worth is the difference between your total assets and liabilities or, simply put, what you own minus what you owe. The more you own, the larger your net worth.\n\nThere is a huge gap between the net worth of upper-income Americans and families who are either middle-income or lower-income, according to findings by the Pew Research Center. It\u2019s the widest wealth gap in 30 years, Pew notes.\n\nIn 2013, upper-income families had $639,400 in net worth, compared with $96,500 for middle-income families and $9,300 for lower-income families.\n\nNet worth \u201cis an important dimension of household well-being because it\u2019s a measure of a family\u2019s \u2018nest egg\u2019 and can be used to sustain consumption during emergencies [for example, job layoffs] as well as provide income during retirement,\u201d wrote Pew researchers Richard Fry and Rakesh Kochhar.\n\nAlthough the recession pushed down the net worth of upper-middle-income families, they\u2019ve seen their wealth double since 2003, according to Pew. The same can\u2019t be said of so many other families.\n\nBankrate.com has an online net-worth calculator that\u2019s nicely organized and does the math for you. There are a lot of things I like about the calculator. It explains the various items that go on the asset and liabilities side of your net-worth statement. It can estimate how much your assets might change in value over 10 years by allowing you to select an average annual rate of increase \u2014 or decrease, if you know you\u2019ll be taking on some debt in the near future.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to estimate the value of household assets. For your major assets, such as your automobiles and home, you\u2019ll have to find out the current market value. For your home, try Zillow.com or Realtor.com. For your car, there are a number of online resources \u2014 Consumer Reports, Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, AutoTrader and CarGurus \u2014 to help determine how much you could get for your vehicle.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve calculated your net worth, you have a starting point to see how you\u2019re doing. If you want a comparison with others at your age or income level, use CNNMoney\u2019s calculator at cnnmon.ie/1B5JYW6.\n\nAlthough you shouldn\u2019t be in competition with others, if you don\u2019t like your net worth figure, make some changes. And those changes can start with making some financial resolutions for the new year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you don\u2019t like your net-worth figure, make some changes.
