Dive Brief:

Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R), fresh to the office after winning the November election, announced his intention last week to transform the state's Medicaid expansion that took place under outgoing governor Steve Beshear (D).

In early 2015, as Bevin began his campaign, he had said he would "reverse" Medicaid expansion but has since changed his strategy.

By accepting and adapting Medicaid expansion under the ACA, Bevin is the latest in a string of Republican governors to ultimately change course on the issue.

Dive Insight:

Bevin is following the GOP trend of tailoring Medicaid expansion to the state and thereby avoiding the appearance of supporting Obamacare.

Bevin plans to seek a 1332 federal waiver, which will allow states to design tailored healthcare programs as long as they cover the same amount or more people than before, Modern Healthcare notes, adding states will be able to apply for those waivers beginning Jan. 1, 2017.

Bevin's announcement did not detail the specific changes he would seek, but he said he's been in extensive talks with HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell, and there has been discussion of the state looking at elements of Indiana's cost-sharing system.
