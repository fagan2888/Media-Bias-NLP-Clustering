Chicago had died at age 80, as reported by his hometown paper the Chicago Tribune.\n\nMcDonald saw his Chicago neighborhood plummeting in quality of life, the very safety of himself and his neighbors sometimes threatened by people who showed little respect for other people's life or safety.\n\nHe thought it was unjust that his city essentially barred him and his neighbors from owning the most common tool of self-protection, the handgun.\n\nIn the wake of the 2008 Heller decision (which I wrote a book about, Gun Control on Trial), which prohibited the federal government from violating our Second Amendment right to own commonly used weapons for self-defense in the home, Mr. McDonald became lead plaintiff in a case that went to the Supreme Court in 2010, challenging the city of Chicago's ban on handgun ownership.\n\nMcDonald won and the right to self-defense in the home via the Second Amendment was applied to the states and localities via the 14th Amendment.\n\nI wrote about McDonald and his case for Reason back in our October 2010 issue in a cover story called \"You've Come a Long Way, Baby\":\n\nFrom that story, summing up McDonald's struggle, and his character:\n\nThe lead plaintiff, Otis McDonald, is a 76-year-old father of eight and grandfather of more than he can count; he rose from a maintenance engineer at the University of Chicago to head of his union local. McDonald had been embattled by drug dealers, suffering five break-ins in the Chicago home he shares with his wife. \u201cI had a troubled neighborhood,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cI was pissed off about the way these kids that had grown up playing basketball in my backyard\u201d had become a threatening gang. When you drive down his street, he says, \u201cyou don\u2019t get by unless they let you get by.\u201d He would see kids he\u2019d known since they were 3 running down his alley, shooting at cars. \u201cI helped as much as I could help with their parents,\u201d McDonald says, \u201cuntil they told me they didn\u2019t want to hear from me anymore in regards to them. I was just fed up. I had to find somebody, some organization, something with the resources and power, and then I knew that I could couple that with myself, with guts and the nerve to do what needed to be done.\u201d McDonald started attending gun rights rallies down in Springfield. \u201cI learned a lot about this Washington, D.C., case,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s what made me know the Lord was guiding me. I just felt so sure they were going to win the case.\u201d A friend McDonald met at a gun rally told Gura about him. When Gura needed clients, the two met and took to each other instantly.....McDonald recalls telling Gura: \u201cAre you willing to go all the way? Then I\u2019m your man, with the name and all. Furthermore, we are going to win.\u201d....\n\nAnd as I wrote about my first occasion interviewing McDonald, the day his case was heard before the Court in March 2010:\n\nLet me tell you something else about Otis McDonald: If you are lucky enough to meet the guy, you\u2019re going to love him. Really. In about a half hour of conversation, both one-on-one and in a small group, the guy was devastatingly charming, in a completely unstudied way. He\u2019s compelling and convincing and real, telling quotidian stories about being late for planes and late-night fishing; and equally so when getting historical and cosmic about the arc of his life and the role he knows he\u2019s playing in his country\u2019s history. One minute laughing and light, the other giving a sincerely tear-jerking account of the pride and gratitude he feels toward everyone else, especially the younger generation, advancing the scholarship and advocacy of his and his fellow Americans\u2019 rights. After that half hour, I was on this guy\u2019s side, just as a fellow human being. And a dream client for a civil rights case like this to boot, as the lawyers present agreed enthusiastically. That the city of Chicago prevents this man from making the best choice available to him to protect himself and his family from the very real threats that surround him is, simply and with no constitutional history or theory required, wrong.....McDonald, his fellow plaintiffs, and the rest of Chicago will because of his efforts be able to exercise a core human right unmolested. That is great news...\n\nIt remains great news, and a great accomplishment from a great American, alas now passed.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Otis McDonald, the American hero who showed physical, emotional, and political braveness in his role as lead plaintiff in the groundbreaking 2010 Supreme", "title": "Otis McDonald, R.I.P.
