Too busy and important to watch the State of the Union, but she did catch it on her \u201ctruck radio\u201d and she\u2019s very concerned about that man in the White House. He\u2019s arrogant and dangerously full of hubris. He dared to act like a President and use presidential powers. Something must be done!\n\nShe warned her flock on Facebook today, \u201cWe the People\u201d don\u2019t have to be \u201cWe the Sheeple\u201d and just get shepherded towards a fundamental transformation that\u2019s against America\u2019s will.\u201d To remedy this horrible, big government intrusion, she says we can elect more Republicans this November. Because if anyone knows how to do nothing while getting paid a lot of money for it and using taxpayer funded health insurance, it\u2019s the GOP.\n\nYes, Ms. Palin did not watch \u201cthe fantasy declaration of \u2018utopia\u2019s-on-its-way'\u201d, which is good, because I\u2019m beginning to suspect that she allergic to hope and optimism, so certainly utopia is out.\n\nListening on her truck radio, she heard what she \u201cforebodingly anticipated.\u201d She was alarmed by the President\u2019s hubris, \u201cBut the extreme hubris and na\u00efvet\u00e9 that emanated from that speech was something new and alarming.\u201d It\u2019s as if he is President or something. Uppity Obama.\n\nPalin cited Ronald Reagan and claimed that Obama\u2019s speech \u201cconfirms we need rescuing from government like never before.\u201d Who\u2019s gonna rescue us from the \u201cgovernment\u201d? Governmental employees like Republicans. Don\u2019t try to work this out in your head. It works on a bumper sticker and that\u2019s all that matters.\n\nApparently, Ms. Palin, who had health insurance via her husband\u2019s union at one point and certainly as a governor, even if she did quit, lost her health insurance because of affordable health insurance being made available to everyone else. I think you know who wins in this case, and it\u2019s not you. \u201cIn an attempt to \u201cfix\u201d our health care system, government has taken away our health insurance and forced us to buy worse plans we don\u2019t want and can\u2019t afford.\u201d\n\nShe worried about the deficit but never mentioned the 24 billion dollars her tea party doppelg\u00e4nger Republican Senator Ted Cruz cost the country with his shutdown over nothing. And while she hates green energy (she was the most socialist governor in America by the way \u2013 she pushed for oil companies to pay citizens for the privilege of using their land), nothing gets her down like amnesty. Obama amnesty.\n\nSpeaking of which, while claiming to be concerned with job creation for American workers, our government is trying to ram through amnesty, which will result in a flood of foreign workers competing with Americans for the few jobs there are.\n\nFear! I tell you fear! They\u2019re coming for your stuff! VOTE GOP in 2014 because they already have your stuff and they want to keep it. They don\u2019t want you getting a piece of the pie before some \u201cforeign worker\u201d comes in to snatch it from you, so it\u2019s best if you just don\u2019t have health insurance at all, and it\u2019s best if Republicans keep obstructing job bills.\n\nPalin is very hot under the collar about Obama\u2019s \u201carrogance\u201d and \u201chubris\u201d, which she mentioned yet again in her clearly not over her 2008 defeat tome, \u201cBetween the hubris of an executive branch governing by fiat, to the arrogance of believing it can spy on citizens\u2019 communications and unleash the IRS to harass people who happen to disagree with the President, it\u2019s now more important than ever for us to press in and pay attention.\u201d\n\nYes, pay attention! The IRS investigated liberals and conservatives, but if we ignore the facts, we can feel really scared and sorry for ourselves, which is always a bonus in Palin world. This is leading up to an implied request for money. Are you scared enough yet? (Please don\u2019t ask about Republicans wanting the IRS to investigate rape victims, because we are on a one-way ticket to utopia here and reality does not apply.)\n\nWhy? Because we\u2019re obviously on a dangerous path, but \u201cWe the People\u201d don\u2019t have to be \u201cWe the Sheeple\u201d and just get shepherded towards a fundamental transformation that\u2019s against America\u2019s will.\n\nYou are being manipulated by evil, \u201calarmingly\u201d \u201cdangerous\u201d Obama. Glenn Beck, is that you?\n\nUnderstand the way words are manipulated by politicians who practice to deceive, so that we can DO something about it. For instance, proving he\u2019s immune to irony, the President used the phrase \u201cfairness and equality under the law\u201d at the end of last night\u2019s address. This is the same President who has been arbitrarily amending his signature legislation, Obamacare, practically every other day to give breaks to his cronies and leave the rest of us without \u201cconnections\u201d out in the cold. I guess some of us are less fair and equal under Obama\u2019s laws.\n\nOh, God yes, if anyone is without connections, it\u2019s Sarah Palin and her new TV show, her Fox gig, her PAC, and her standing as a person of importance in the Republican Party in spite of having quit on Alaska mid term in order to pursue reality TV appearances and make some cold hard cash. Sparkly flags and God, please donate.\n\nThe last thing we need is \u201cbig government\u201d, so send Republicans to DC:\n\nThe last thing we need right now is more \u201chelp\u201d from big government. In this mid-term year, we need to send new leadership to D.C. to get government back on our side and off our aching backs. Thankfully, November is just around the corner.\n\nNow you know what to do. There\u2019s a nice little button going to SarahPAC at the top of the page. Donate to her so she can keep the cash in her PAC, which allows her to send Republicans to DC because it frees her up to write things like this on Facebook.\n\nArrogant Obama needs to stop acting like he was elected, stop using that executive power, which he uses much less than Bush, but Bush was President so\u2026 Obama needs to stop being so \u201carrogant\u201d by acting like a president. It burns. The jealousy is palpable.\n\nMany say Sarah Palin is a has-been and irrelevant, but she perfectly embodies the problems of the modern day GOP. She is all hot rage and vague fear tactics, lots of accusations steeped in not so veiled southern strategy and no solutions, and most troubling of all, there is zero consistency in the policy positions. You can\u2019t fear monger about big government while you try to use the IRS to harass rape victims. Sarah Palin is all bitter Obama hate and nothing else. Just like the entire modern day Republican Party.\n\nGo ahead, laugh, because ultimately, this is what is behind every Republican politician right now. They are all Sarah Palin, some of them just manage to hide it better. They are the party of spoiled children who do nothing but point fingers at others and call names. That is their only contribution, and for that, they expect to be paid by you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sarah Palin embodies the entire GOP in an epic Facebook rant accusing Obama of being arrogant, full of hubris, and naive.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Sarah Palin embodies the entire GOP in an epic Facebook rant accusing Obama of being arrogant, full of hubris, and naive.", "title": "Sarah Palin Disrespects President Obama with Jealous, Racist SOTU Rant", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/01/29/sarah-palin-jealous-rant-sotu.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/sarah-palin-rant.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-29T12:38:10+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-01-29T12:37:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-29T12:38:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0dc\"", "article_summary": "Many say Sarah Palin is a has-been and irrelevant, but she perfectly embodies the problems of the modern day GOP.\nThey are all Sarah Palin, some of them just manage to hide it better.\nApparently, Ms. Palin, who had health insurance via her husband\u2019s union at one point and certainly as a governor, even if she did quit, lost her health insurance because of affordable health insurance being made available to everyone else.\nSarah Palin is all bitter Obama hate and nothing else.\nSarah Palin was very busy last night."}
