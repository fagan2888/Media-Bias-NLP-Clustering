TOWAOC, Colo. (AP) — Ute Mountain Ute officials are building 10 housing units for the homeless as part of a long-term plan for up to 200 new homes for tribal members.

Ute Housing Authority development director Benny Cordova says it’s the tribe’s first housing project in eight years, and there are more than 100 people on a waiting list.

According to the Cortez Journal (http://tinyurl.com/q9wrlh5 ), the 200 units are expected to be completed in 2030.

A $900,000 U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant awarded in February and a $300,000 match from the tribe is paying for the first phase.
