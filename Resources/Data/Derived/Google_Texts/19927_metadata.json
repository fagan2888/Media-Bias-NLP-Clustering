She renewed her criticism of the Affordable Care Act on Friday, but found that Arkansas\u2019 \u201cprivate option\u201d Medicaid plan, which uses federal dollars to buy health insurance for poorer Arkansans, was acceptable because state lawmakers were able to put their own thumbprint on it.\n\n\u201cI like that Arkansas was able to decide for ourselves,\u201d though it took a court decision to make it happen, she said.\n\nWhile Obama leaves office in two years, Rutledge said oppressive federal intervention will remain.\n\n\u201cThe policies, those programs that have been put in place during this administration ... will still be there,\u201d she said. \u201cThe role of the attorney general has been to push back if necessary.\u201d\n\nDIFFERENT BOSSES\n\nRutledge was a lawyer for former Gov. Mike Huckabee and will serve as the state\u2019s official lawyer to Gov.-elect Asa Hutchinson. She wouldn\u2019t directly compare the two but noted their different backgrounds \u2014 Huckabee\u2019s as a Southern Baptist minister and Hutchinson as a former congressman, prosecutor and Homeland Security administrator.\n\n\u201cI think each person who comes into office brings their own experiences and brings their own perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cMy experience makes me different in that sort of perspective, and being the first woman elected and the first Republican elected.\u201d Democrats controlled Arkansas state government from Reconstruction until the GOP took control of the Legislature in 2012 and all seven statewide offices in 2014.\n\nHUMAN TRAFFICKING\n\nRutledge praised outgoing Attorney General Dustin McDaniel for boosting a cybercrimes division and said she would like to teach the public and law enforcement officials about human trafficking.\n\n\u201cThey have this misconception of what human trafficking is, as if it is a semi-trailer full of children or women,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be someone who has communicated with a predator on the Internet and they have run away from home.\u201d\n\nABORTION, GAY MARRIAGE\n\nRutledge said the state would continue appeals of court decisions overturning a law banning abortion at 12 weeks and a voter-approved gay marriage ban.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 When Leslie Rutledge takes office next week, she\u2019ll be the first woman to serve as Arkansas\u2019 attorney general, the first Republican in the modern era and, to hear her tell it, an elected official not wondering what political job she\u2019ll pursue next.Arkansas\u2019 previous 11 attorneys general have all sought another major office: three became governor, five launched bids for governor and three ran for the U.S. Senate, one successfully.
