At the time of her death, she was a global household name, both for her artistry and as a tabloid fixture.\n\nRead More: \u2018Amy\u2019 Director Asif Kapadia on Finding Amy Winehouse\u2019s Voice\n\nThis week, Winehouse\u2019s rise to pop stardom is chronicled in the new movie \u201cAmy,\u201d which opens nationwide after hitting theaters in New York City and Los Angeles last Friday. The movie comes from director Asif Kapadia (\u201cSenna\u201d), who chronicles Winehouse\u2019s life through a multitude of home videos and archival footage, dating back to her teen years and all the way up through her final days.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a longtime or casual fan, \u201cAmy\u201d will alter your perception about her life and work. Here are five things to expect.\n\n1. There are no talking heads\n\nMost documentaries use a standard formula of showing clips of the subject, with cutaways to experts or people close to the subject weighing in. \u201cAmy\u201d doesn\u2019t do that. Instead, Kapadia tells the story through Winehouse and her friends, family, the media, and her record-business associates interacting with her on camera. And it\u2019s not hard to find a narrative. Key moments captured on film show how she went from rising singer to drug-addicted celebrity and the emotional toll it took on her.\n\n2. Amy\u2019s humanized\n\nPart of Kapadia\u2019s mission is to give Winehouse a voice before she was famous. In doing so, it\u2019s easy to see she was outgoing, bubbly, and from the looks of it, a fun person to be around; someone who loved singing and took a shot at it. She tells jokes, bites back at bad interviewer questions, and spend most of her waking hours honing her voice.\n\n3. Fame sucks\n\nThe end of Winehouse\u2019s life was heavily covered by the tabloids, making her a punchline for late-night TV hosts and a cautionary tale for other up-and-coming musicians. Have you ever wondered what it\u2019s like to be truly famous to a point where you can\u2019t walk out the door without thousands of flashlight bulbs going off in your face or go to a remote island for a vacation without a random fan wanting a picture? \u201cAmy\u201d gives insight into how she lived day-to-day with this and why it was a part of her downfall.\n\n4. Addiction sucks\n\nEveryone knew that Winehouse had a hard time staying sober and \u201cAmy\u201d paints a picture of exactly just how hard her struggle was. It was very hard. She tried rehab facilities (which of course became a punchline, after her hit song \u201cRehab\u201d) and tried avoiding the public eye. For those who have little experience with someone struggling with addiction, \u201cAmy\u201d gives insight into this world in a way we typically don\u2019t see.\n\n5. In the end, music was still her first love\n\nWith all her struggles with substances and fame, in the end Winehouse still loved music. One of the most interesting and endearing scenes involves a session she did with Tony Bennett, just a few months before she died. She was just as nervous as someone entering a recording booth for the first time, doing take after take until she felt it was right. Bennett was a class-act through the whole thing.\n\nRead More: \u2018Amy,\u2019 an Artist at War With Herself", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The new documentary about the late pop star is in theaters nationwide starting this weekend.", "title": "5 Things to Know About \u2018Amy,\u2019 the Amy Winehouse Documentary", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/07/10/5-things-to-know-about-amy-the-amy-winehouse-documentary/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JH287_0708am_P_20150708132340.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "5 Things to Know About \u2018Amy,\u2019 the Amy Winehouse Documentary", "description": "The new documentary about the late pop star is in theaters nationwide starting this weekend.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Mike Ayers", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "The new documentary about the late pop star is in theaters nationwide starting this weekend.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-07-10T16:00:17-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/07/10/5-things-to-know-about-amy-the-amy-winehouse-documentary/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-89838", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The new documentary about the late pop star is in theaters nationwide starting this weekend.", "title": "5 Things to Know About \u2018Amy,\u2019 the Amy Winehouse Documentary", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/07/10/5-things-to-know-about-amy-the-amy-winehouse-documentary/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JH287_0708am_P_20150708132340.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-89838", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-07-10T15:19:30-04:00"}, "article_summary": "In the end, music was still her first loveWith all her struggles with substances and fame, in the end Winehouse still loved music.\nRead More: \u2018Amy\u2019 Director Asif Kapadia on Finding Amy Winehouse\u2019s VoiceThis week, Winehouse\u2019s rise to pop stardom is chronicled in the new movie \u201cAmy,\u201d which opens nationwide after hitting theaters in New York City and Los Angeles last Friday.\nAddiction sucksEveryone knew that Winehouse had a hard time staying sober and \u201cAmy\u201d paints a picture of exactly just how hard her struggle was.\nWhether you\u2019re a longtime or casual fan, \u201cAmy\u201d will alter your perception about her life and work.\nFame sucksThe end of Winehouse\u2019s life was heavily covered by the tabloids, making her a punchline for late-night TV hosts and a cautionary tale for other up-and-coming musicians."}
