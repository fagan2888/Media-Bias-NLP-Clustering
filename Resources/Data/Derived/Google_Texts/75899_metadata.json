As I was about to turn 65, I followed conventional wisdom and signed up for Medicare Part A. A few months later my employer pushed us toward a high deductible health plan with a health savings account. So I had to un-enroll from Medicare so I could take advantage of the HSA, which included a company contribution. That took six months and multiple calls and visits to the Social Security office. Sigh.\n\nMORE FROM THE MEDICARE MAVEN The Social Security and Medicare gotcha that makes contributing to your HSA illegal\n\nBy the time I had successfully un-enrolled from Medicare, I had agreed to take an early separation package from my company and this summer signed up for Medicare Parts A and B. My separation package includes 12 months of paid COBRA coverage [COBRA stands for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act under which it was created]. It has creditable drug coverage, so I don\u2019t need Medicare Part D drug coverage just yet. Also, my COBRA provides dental and vision insurance. Otherwise the COBRA-funded coverage is secondary to Medicare and is sort of superfluous. So that\u2019s the set up. Here\u2019s the question (or questions):\n\nI\u2019m not sure at this time if I will go with traditional Medicare or an Advantage plan. I\u2019ve read that when my paid COBRA ends (July 2015), I should be able to sign up for a Medigap policy, and that I\u2019ll be guaranteed coverage because going off COBRA counts as a life change event. I\u2019m dreading getting to next summer and learning that everything I heard was wrong, so I wonder if I should make a decision now and sign up for something sooner during one of Medicare\u2019s open enrollment periods. I would essentially be double paying for another health insurance policy for half a year but I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry. Can you help me figure this out?\n\nPhil Moeller: Gerry has done a really good job of understanding her health insurance. So, it\u2019s a sad tribute to Medicare\u2019s complexity that she is still considering double-paying for health insurance rather than risk running afoul of some arcane sign-up rule that requires top-secret clearance and a Hippocratic handshake.\n\nThe good news here is that Gerry needn\u2019t worry about getting guaranteed access to a Medigap policy (also called Medicare supplement insurance). She has the right to buy such a policy if she has basic Medicare (sometimes called original Medicare) or an employer group health plan (including retiree or COBRA coverage) or union coverage that pays after Medicare pays, and that plan coverage ends. She will have 63 days after the formal end of her COBRA coverage to preserve her guaranteed access to Medigap. The clock will start ticking on the latest of these three events:\n\nThe date the coverage ends\n\nThe date on the notice you get telling you that coverage is ending (if you receive one)\n\nThe date on a claim denial, if this is the only way you know that the coverage ended\n\nAlso, in terms of finding new drug coverage, she\u2019ll have the same time frame \u2014 63 days \u2013 to get a prescription drug plan.\n\nWe\u2019ve explained Medigap plans before. While they do, as their name implies, cover a lot of gaps in basic Medicare, they do not cover non-surgical vision and dental needs. The same insurers that offer Medigap policies likely offer dental and vision plans as well. Lastly, of course, Gerry will need a Part D plan.\n\nGOT MEDICARE QUESTIONS? Ask the Medicare Maven\n\nAlternatively, she could look at Medicare Advantage plans offered where she lives. Many of these plans also come with Part D options, and their insurers offer supplemental dental and vision plans as well. Depending on her health needs, Gerry may find Medicare Advantage a cheaper choice than Medigap. She can\u2019t combine Medicare Advantage with Medigap. It\u2019s one or the other.\n\nGerry\u2019s choices reflect a logic that only a bureaucrat could love. After decades receiving employer-provided health insurance, few people are prepared for the range and complexity of health insurance choices once they turn 65. Add this to the list of compelling reasons to never retire.\n\nRobert \u2013 Wash., D.C.: When I left my employer (and its health care plan), I went onto COBRA. I did not notice that I had to join Medicare (Part B) within eight months. So, after missing the 2013 window to get Medicare, I had to join an Affordable Care Act plan, in order to comply with the requirement to have coverage. Then, late last year, I learned that I cannot apply to join Medicare Part B until Jan. 1, 2015, and that coverage will not become effective until July 1. Why not?\n\nMeanwhile, I have to continue my Obamacare plan, which is five times more expensive than Medicare Part B. This makes no sense. Why is the law written this way \u2014 assuming that this is the law? The choices I was given, by the way, were only explained to me after many unsuccessful attempts to find out on the Internet and on the phone (including from the government\u2019s Medicare site and its Social Security site) and a personal visit to the Social Security office here in Washington, D.C.\n\nPhil Moeller: Oh, joy, another COBRA question. Robert appears to have descended into an even more punishing circle of regulatory hell than Gerry. According to the experts at SHIP who provide advice to me for this column, problems understanding when to sign up for Medicare are an unchecked epidemic. \u201cUnfortunately, we see this every year,\u201d one SHIP counselor told me. \u201cI tell people Medicare is a \u2018voluntary mandatory program.\u2019 A person is not forced to sign up for Medicare during their enrollment periods. But if the person needs to get Medicare coverage there are rules in place for enrollment which include specific dates to apply and when coverage starts.\u201d\n\nMORE FROM THE MEDICARE MAVEN Don\u2019t be fooled by Medicare drug plans with low premiums\n\nI am not sure where Robert got the notion that he needed to sign up for Medicare within eight months. That is roughly the sign-up window for people who turn 65 without any health insurance. But Robert had COBRA coverage and, as we explained to Gerry, he had 63 days to get Medicare after his COBRA coverage ended, not after he turned 65.\n\n\u201cRobert, I am sorry you missed your opportunity to enroll in Medicare Part B,\u201d another counselor said, continuing:\n\nThe enrollment period you missed was in effect before the Affordable Care Act was made possible. Individuals, like yourself, who found themselves without sufficient coverage were unable to even purchase insurance before the affordable care act was implemented. . . . I would advise you to seek assistance from a SHIP counselor by calling 202-994-6656 to help you through your transition to Medicare.\n\n(If I\u2019ve not properly understood your question \u2013 an all-too frequent occurrence as I try to navigate Medicare topics \u2013 please try me again and I\u2019ll give it another try.)\n\nArlyne \u2013 Calif.: I take Cymbalta for fibromyalgia. The generic option for this drug made me very, very dizzy. I\u2019m told no company is covering it except Blue Cross. Their monthly fee is $119. The cost of Cymbalta through the Costco pharmacy is listed at $85 for 30 pills, and Costco may raise the price. Do you have any suggestions to help me lower this unaffordable cost?\n\nPhil Moeller: I\u2019m so sorry to hear about your problems. Medicare Advantage plans and Part D prescription plans are allowed to choose which drugs to include in their plans. Currently, there are only a few plans in your town that cover Cymbalta. Most cover the generic that does not work in your situation. One option is to see if you qualify for the Extra Help subsidy for prescription drug costs. You also can contact your local California HICAP office (Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program) at (800) 824-0780 or (800) 434-0222 for assistance or you can go to the Social Security website and apply for help online.\n\nYou also might consider contacting your health plan to see if there is another pharmacy that it is willing to work with that can provide you a better cost for this drug. It is possible to file an exception request with your Part D drug insurer to get a brand name drug covered if the plan only covers the generic. You\u2019ll need your doctor\u2019s help with this and there is no guarantee the plan will approve the exception request, or that its price will be any better than those you\u2019ve found.\n\nMany drug manufacturers and non-profits have assistance programs to help individuals who have challenges affording their medications. Your drug is made by Ely Lilly. I looked at its assistance program, but it does not appear to be open to people who already have drug insurance. Needy Meds, a website helping consumers find lower drug prices, listed several possibilities for Cymbalta. The National Council on Aging sponsors BenefitsCheckUp, providing a range of help programs for drugs and other senior expenses.\n\nPlease let me know if you find help.
