Woofstock 2014 had an estimated 10,000 people walking through the grounds at the Sedgwick County Park.

Woofstock is a fundraiser by the Kansas Humane Societies, bringing in on average $200,000. According to Melissa Houston of the Kansas Humane Society, all the money from this fundraiser goes back into the humane society, helping with the cost of medical needs and food for pets in their shelter.

The humane society brings out around 20 dogs that need to be adopted, all in hopes that people in attendance might find a new pet to take home.

The Dobe and Dog Rescue organization was at Woofstock and had a Doberman in need of adoption.

The dog was found in Ashland by their the local sheriffs department according to Carlene Hinton of Dobe and Dog Rescue. "She was abandoned and tied up in the yard," Hinton said. One of the sheriff officers took care of her until a veterinarian stepped in. That veterinarian paid for this Doberman to be taken to Woofstock hoping that she would find a new home.

Roxie, that Doberman, did find a new home, one where her new owners says she will be very spoiled and be able to live a great life.
