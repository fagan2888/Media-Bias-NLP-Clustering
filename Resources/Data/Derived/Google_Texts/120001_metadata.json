Frank LoBiondo, R-2 of Ventnor, stopped by the high school for more than an hour of interaction with the students, who ranged from freshmen to seniors in the government class, as well as American History classes.\n\nHe discussed his past and his job and took questions from the students on topics that ranged from his opinions on Gov. Chris Christie and the Affordable Care Act to Syria and homeland security.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very motivational and inspirational for me to see the level of intelligence and questions from this age group,\u201d he said. \u201cThe message I try to leave is there\u2019s nothing they can\u2019t do or no one they can\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nLoBiondo was invited by two senior students, Ryan Sharp and Austin Schober, who participate on the congressman\u2019s Youth Advisory Council. They spend one day a month meeting with him and other students from throughout the congressman\u2019s district and wanted to bring that experience to their fellow classmates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for this age group to understand how our country works and how it\u2019s going to affect them,\u201d Sharp said.\n\n\u201cI just want them to be interested and listen as much as they can,\u201d Schober added.\n\nFor the past week, the students in Kristian Ward\u2019s class have been preparing for LoBiondo\u2019s visit, discussing what members of the House of Representatives do, researching the congressman himself and preparing questions for the visit.\n\n\u201cThe congressman has a great story and it\u2019s important for them to see the people in Washington are just like us,\u201d Ward said.\n\n---\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "kingsway-regional, woolwich, news", "title": "Rep.
