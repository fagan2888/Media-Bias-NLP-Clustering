So rail is a key, is like the spine or the backbone of the system,\u201d said Harrison Rue, Community Builder and Transit-Oriented Development Administrator.\n\nIt\u2019s no doubt that many residents rely on their cars to get around. So how do you get them to change their habits? Experts say public transportation needs to become the better option.\n\n\u201cIt has to be either faster or cheaper or more convenient, or all of the above. And a combination of making walking, cycling, and transit best friends, then we\u2019re going to be able to solve issues of mobility,\u201d said Guillermo Penalosa, executive director at 8-80 Cities in Toronto.\n\nOfficials say in order for people to understand transit-oriented development (TOD), they need to see it in action first.\n\n\u201cAs we start seeing projects coming in, I think people will see it. Once rail is up and going, people will try to ride and see this kind of makes sense. But don\u2019t take our word for it. Try it. See if you like it,\u201d said Rue.\n\n\u201cI think people in the long-run are gonna live better. We\u2019re building a city for all ages and we\u2019re building a city that\u2019s really is taking us into the 21st century,\u201d said Mayor Caldwell.\n\nBike paths are part of the overall plan. On Dec. 6, the city will open the new bike lane on King Street. It runs from Downtown to University Avenue.\n\nFor more information on Transit-Oriented Development, visit this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Saturday, the city held a Transit-Oriented Development Symposium.
