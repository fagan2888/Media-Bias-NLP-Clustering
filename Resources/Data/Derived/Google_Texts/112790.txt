Out2Enroll Celebrates Open Enrollment with Parody Video ‘Obamacare Hallelujah’

The LGBT organization parodies 'Uptown Funk' to encourage health care enrollment

Out2Enroll, a national organization aiming to encourage LGBT people to access health care under the Affordable Care Act, is trying to promote open enrollment with a brand-new parody video ‘Obamacare Hallelujah’.

Mashing up the new Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars single ‘Uptown Funk’ with some choice lyrics about Obamacare (“‘Cause healthcare gov gon’ give it to you” etc.) the video serves as a reminder that open enrollment is now in its final two weeks, ending on February 15th.

Katie Keith, a health policy expert and member of Out2Enroll’s steering committee, explained the video’s aims:

“We all love music videos, and this parody is part of our broad strategy to reach LGBT people wherever they are, whether at home, church, community centers, or online. We wanted to create a fun video that speaks to the diversity of our community, especially younger LGBT Americans, and raises awareness ahead of the February 15th deadline to enroll.”

Kellan Baker, another steering committee member and fellow at the Center for American Progress, emphasised the importance of the Affordable Care Act for LGBT Americans in particular, as one in four low- and middle-income LGBT people were uninsured in 2014:

“The Affordable Care Act is a critical opportunity for our community to access the health care we need. The law includes extensive new nondiscrimination provisions that protect LGBT people in every state. This is a big moment for our community – and we hope that videos like ‘Obamacare Hallelujah’ can help raise awareness and celebrate the law and what it means for our community.”
