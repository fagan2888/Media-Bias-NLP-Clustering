Researchers with the UK Center for Tobacco Control Studies were tasked with finding information regarding transnational tobacco companies\u2019 interests in smokeless tobacco from the 1970s to the present, to better inform policymakers in their decision, according to a statement.\n\nIt's All For The Profits\n\nBy comparing the tobacco industry\u2019s internal documents to its campaigns to help reduce public harm with smokeless tobacco, the researchers found that \u201cthere is clear evidence that [British American Tobacco\u2019s] early interest in introducing [smokeless tobacco] in Europe was based on the potential for creating an alternative form of tobacco use in light of declining cigarette sales and social restrictions on smoking, with young people a key target,\u201d they wrote.\n\nBAT\u2019s internal documents note cigarettes\u2019 declining popularity, saying, \u201cWe have no wish to aid or hasten any decline in cigarette smoking. Deeper involvement in smokeless is strategically defensible. There are fewer people in sophisticated markets starting to smoke. There are increasing numbers of people giving up. There are increasing restrictions on smoking, particularly in public, whether by law or by society.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 10 million people currently smoke cigarettes in the UK, and 29 percent of all citizens of the EU smoke. Numerous campaigns to help people quit \u2014 31 percent of EU smokers have tried to quit in the last year \u2014 have been implemented, even including an iPhone app that analyzes smoking habits and provides daily, customized advice. With such campaigns, smoking rates have gone down across the continent.\n\nAlthough there may be lower levels of the carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines in smokeless tobacco, the National Cancer Institute says that there are still at least 28 chemicals that have been found to cause cancer. Smokeless tobacco has been found to cause oral, esophageal, and pancreatic cancers.\n\nSmokeless Tobacco, Cigarettes, and the Youth\n\nBAT and other tobacco companies specifically target young people in their smokeless tobacco campaigns, the authors said. Portioning snus made it easier to use for young people, and the companies chose which markets to test throughout Europe based on youth and student populations. When certain brands of snus were launched in the UK, \u201cstudents were both the target and the means of promotion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that smokeless tobacco investments in Europe coincided with the implementation of smoke-free policies, combined with evidence of the industry\u2019s promotion of dual cigarette and snus use in the U.S., add weight to the concern that transnational tobacco companies may hope to exploit snus as a way to reduce the impact of regulations aimed at reducing smoking rates,\u201d the authors wrote. Last month, a study from the Harvard School of Public Health found that rather than replacing cigarettes with smokeless tobacco, one in 20 middle and high school students were using both.\n\nThe authors concluded that the \u201cSwedish experience\u201d with snus could not be generalized to other countries in which snus is not as popular. They say that evidence pointed directly to the industry\u2019s interest in snus \u201cbecause it could be used in smoke-free environments and could be promoted to young, non-tobacco users to create a new form of tobacco use. This last finding lends support to concerns that smokeless tobacco may lead to, rather than from, smoking.\"\n\nSource: Peeters S, Gilmore A.
