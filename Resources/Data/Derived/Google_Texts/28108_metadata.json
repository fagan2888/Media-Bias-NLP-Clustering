Begaye was born an artist.\n\nFrom early doodles in the margins of his Tuba City School yearbooks to the master strokes of his paintings in his later life, it was apparent that he was gifted.\n\nThe versatility of his talent showed itself in many ways, from his early careers in the beauty business, quickly segueing into the fashion business, ghost designing for top fashion designers in the 1980s and traveling around the country training professionals and developing new techniques in hair and studio makeup.\n\nHis love for the visual arts drew him back to painting. Although the world called to him he was always close to home in his heart and carried the stories that his grandfather and elders had told him growing up. These served as his biggest inspiration when it came to his paintings, especially the creation stories of the Din\u00e9.\n\nA prolific artist, Rex created over 600 pieces of original art throughout his career. His sense of color, balance, harmony and dimension was extraordinary bringing to life each piece he created. He inspired and shared his culture with the world for close to 30 years. Through his art he shared a sense of truth, knowledge and beauty to all people he connected with.\n\nIn 2007 he created the Sarasota Native American Indian festival, a gathering of all native artisans to celebrate and appreciate the quality, creativity and authenticity of Native American artisans and craftspeople during a time when cultural appropriation is running rampant. His great appreciation and respect for Native cultures and traditions, extended out to all tribes and it was his desire to teach and share all the great beauty that they contain with all people Native and non-Native alike.\n\nRex A. Begaye was known for his sense of humor and his joy for laughter, fun and beauty he shared with us through his paintings and spirit. He will be deeply missed by his family, friends, loved ones and art collectors.\n\nIn his own words and language he shares his message with the world...\n\n\u201cEarth Vision\u201d\n\nVideo of Earth Visions\n\n\u201cThe Consciousness of Art\u201d\n\nVideo of The Consciousness of Art\n\nRex A.
