After all, no matter how much technology changes, as long as there are humans using it, the Internet will be full of people; and many of them will be wrong. So unless you figure out a way to log-off \u2014 and, more important, stay logged off \u2014 you\u2019re just going to have to find a way to deal.\n\nIn terms of usefulness, however, there is a close second to xkcd\u2019s masterpiece: the \u201cBullshit Asymmetry Principle.\u201d Coined by Italian software developer Alberto Brandolini, the BAP is a newer member of the canon, first appearing in a January 2013 tweet. But if you\u2019ve already come across the BAP, it was probably through the now-iconic picture taken during the \u201clightning talk\u201d Brandolini delivered last year in Rome:\n\nThe Bullshit Asymmetry Principle\n\n\n\nBrandolini\u2019s Law:http://t.co/WHi3NI3NRq via @ziobrando pic.twitter.com/8wFboEQAZU \u2014 Brian John Spencer (@brianjohnspencr) November 23, 2014\n\nFor those of you who can\u2019t see embedded tweets and aren\u2019t familiar with the BAP already, it goes like this: \u201cThe amount of energy necessary to refute bullshit is an order of a magnitude bigger than to produce it.\u201d And if you\u2019ve ever been on the Internet before \u2014 or had a conversation with a 9/11 Truther \u2014 it\u2019s likely that you don\u2019t need me to explain the BAP to you, because its truth is utterly (and painfully) self-evident.\n\nBut if you want a more specific example, look no further than the grotesque and meaningless postmodern spectacle broadcast by CNN and the Republican Party earlier this week. Because with three hours and 11 candidates at its disposal, the former \u201cmost trusted name in news\u201d unleashed a Pacific Ocean-size amount of bullshit. It was so voluminous, in fact, that even those in the media who wanted to refute it couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWe could literally spend the entire show fact-checking the debate,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes said on Thursday, explaining why he was going to focus instead on the night\u2019s \u201cthree biggest lies.\u201d (Note: Without commercials, \u201cAll In\u201d runs about 45 minutes.) And while that sounds hyperbolic, it\u2019s not. In perfect honesty, I could easily spend this whole column doing the same. But I\u2019ll follow Hayes\u2019 lead and limit myself to three examples.\n\nI\u2019ll concentrate on (in ascending order of awfulness): Carly Fiorina\u2019s bullshit about Planned Parenthood, Jeb Bush\u2019s bullshit about his older brother\u2019s national security record, and Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s bullshit about climate change. In each case, the candidates made statements that were either blatant lies or grossly misleading; and in each case, mainstream media held its nose, kept walking, and left others to clean up the mess.\n\nOf the three, Fiorina\u2019s bullshit was the least harmful; but it was possibly the most shameless. Speaking of the deceptively edited anti-Planned Parenthood video that the deceptively named Center for Medical Progress recorded through deception, Fiorina described \u201ca fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.\u201d\n\nClearly, viewers were supposed to infer that this grisly scene was recorded by the CMP\u2019s moles. It was not. As best as Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff \u2014 who watched all 12 hours of the CMP\u2019s footage, and described Fiorina\u2019s claim as \u201cpure fiction\u201d \u2014 can tell, Fiorina is describing a mix of stock footage, which was not shot inside a Planned Parenthood, and the unsubstantiated claims of a former fetal tissue procurement. Both come from other CMP releases.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans are spending so much of their time misleading and lying to the public.
