They are gathering information at conferences, many have joined together for advocacy as the Coalition for Community Choice, and are sharing solutions at the new Autism Housing Network.\n\nThis collective energy and collaboration is in direct response to efforts by some government officials and even advocacy organizations to limit and eliminate certain options based solely on residence or workplace size and location, without assessing the smiles, laughter, sustainability, job security and true empowering sense of community and belonging that is alive and well in these residential and vocational opportunities.\n\nWhat does policy have to do with housing, employment and service choices?\n\nFederal and state policy and laws are largely responsible for how long term support services (LTSS)\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad are regulated and funded.\n\nIn one recent, significant example, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 required that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) modify their regulations. On January 10, 2014, CMS released the long-awaited final version of the regulations, CMS 2249-F and CMS 2296-F. The new rule defines what CMS considers to be characteristics of \u201chome and community\u201d settings and the new person-centered planning requirements.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/04/coalition-for-community-choice-home-is-where-the-heart-is.html", "image": "http://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e201a3fce87a25970b-220si", "description": "Managing Editor's Note: Please support our sponsor VOR and consider attending their conference in June in Washington DC., to ensure appropriate care and housing choices for YOUR child in the future.", "title": "Coalition for Community Choice: Home is Where the Heart Is - AGE OF AUTISM"}, "description": "Managing Editor's Note: Please support our sponsor VOR and consider attending their conference in June in Washington DC., to ensure appropriate care and housing choices for YOUR child in the future. \"Making it Happen: Reforming Policy and Law in Support...", "generator": "http://www.typepad.com/"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb8c6\"", "article_summary": "They are gathering information at conferences, many have joined together for advocacy as the Coalition for Community Choice, and are sharing solutions at the new Autism Housing Network.\n\u00fc Almost all states have waitlists for accessing adult support services, yet the average growth of funding nationally is only 3.2%.\nIn one recent, significant example, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 required that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) modify their regulations.\nVOR is the ONLY national, nonprofit advocacy organization supporting residential choice from small to large housing options.\nFederal and state policy and laws are largely responsible for how long term support services (LTSS)\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad are regulated and funded."}
