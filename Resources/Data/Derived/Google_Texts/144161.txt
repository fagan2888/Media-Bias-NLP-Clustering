How much income does a retiree need to live a happy and healthy life? That’s a key question for financial advisors and their clients, and for many years, the answer has been between 80% and 85% of pre-retirement income.

Some experts like Michael Finke, coordinator of the doctoral program in personal financial planning at Texas Tech University, say that an 80% to 85% income replacement ratio, as it is known, is too high because, among other things, retirees spend less on transportation and no longer pay a 7.5% FICA tax for Social Security – if they were employees – or a 15% FICA tax, if they were self-employed. But Ron Mastrogiovanni, the co-founder and CEO of HealthView Services, which provides health care cost projections for financial services companies, says that ratio may be too low.
