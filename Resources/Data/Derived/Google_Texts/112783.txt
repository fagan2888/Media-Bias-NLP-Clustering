Does everyone remember what Trump said at the beginning of the race?

When I am president, I will get rid of Social Security, Medicare and definitely Obamacare. Oh, and don’t forget the minimum wage — now Trump thinks it’s too high. That is a true Republican talking.

Remember they work for the wealthy. Oh, and are you ready for the Keystone Pipeline? That would be a part of the Trump prize, too.

Remember the good things Trump wants to do? Um … um … um, I can’t think of anything, either.
