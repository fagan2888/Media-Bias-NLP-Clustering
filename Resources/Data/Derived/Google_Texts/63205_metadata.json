In a series of 8-hour operations, the surgeons first removed a piece of blood vessel from Jianmei\u2019s thigh, which they implanted into her chest. Then then stretched the skin on her chest by inserting a water-filled device beneath the subcutaneous layer.\n\nIn that manner, they \u201cgrew\u201d enough flesh to surgically cover the girl\u2019s face. \"With her new face she'll be able to express herself in a more precise way,\" Jiang Chenhong told reporters. \"She will even be able to blush as her emotions change \u2014 but it will take time.\"\n\nSurgeons in France performed the world\u2019s first successful facial transplant in May 2005, repairing the countenance of Isabelle Dinoir, now in her mid-forties, who\u2019d been mauled by her Labrador retriever after losing consciousness in what she later said was a suicide attempt via sleeping pills. In that procedure, doctors grafted a triangular piece of facial tissue, including the nose and mouth, taken from a brain-dead donor.\n\nTo date, Chinese teams have performed at least 10 face transplant operations, believed to be entirely successful. In July of 2008, Li Guoxing, 32, died in southwestern China from immune complications less than two years after his face transplant surgery. However, doctors said the rural farmer had stopped taking his regimen of immune-suppressing drugs in favor of traditional herbal medicines. The man\u2019s surgeon, Guo Shuzhong, told Agence-France Presse that his death had nothing to do with the surgery.\n\n\"His death was not caused by the surgery. Our operation was a success,\" Guo said. \"But we cannot rule out a connection with the immune system drugs.\u201d\n\nAfter Guoxing\u2019s face had been mauled by a bear during a hunting trip, surgeons grafted pieces of flesh to his face using tissue from a donor.\n\nNow, Chinese medical teams have been performing such transplant operations by growing flesh directly on the patient, rather than grafting skin and other tissue from donors on life support. In a procedure similar to Jianmei\u2019s, surgeons grew flesh on the forehead of a car accident victim, which they used to create a new nose.\n\nBelow is a video presentation of the operations by the surgical team in China, uploaded to YouTube:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "face transplant, face transplant surgery, chinese facial transplant, skin graft, growing new face", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Surgeons in China successfully performed a face transplant for a Chinese teenage girl, after \"growing\" the tissue on her chest.", "title": "Surgeons Grow New Face For Chinese Burn Victim...
