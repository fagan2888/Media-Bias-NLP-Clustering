Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Well, we turn now to the race for the White House. On Tuesday, Bernie Sanders won the Democratic caucuses in Utah and Idaho by a wide margin with about 80 percent support in each state. But Hillary Clinton expanded her delegate lead with a victory in the Arizona primary. Meanwhile, in the Republican race, Ted Cruz won the Utah Republican caucus, while Donald Trump took Arizona.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: We\u2019re joined now by two guests. Dolores Huerta, legendary civil rights activist, co-founder of the United Farm Workers of America with Cesar Chavez, she has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And Rocky Anderson, the former Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, who has endorsed Bernie Sanders, in 2012 he ran for president on the Justice Party ticket.\n\nWelcome, both, to Democracy Now! So, last night, Hillary Clinton had a big win in Arizona, and Bernie Sanders had big wins both in Utah and in Idaho. So let\u2019s start in Salt Lake City, in Utah. The significance of the win in Utah, though he certainly still remains behind, hundreds of delegates behind Hillary Clinton, Rocky Anderson?\n\nROCKY ANDERSON: Yes, Bernie Sanders won about 79 percent of the vote. And the reason we see these enormous wins\u2014it was about the same in Idaho\u2014is because the Democratic parties in Utah and Idaho allowed the independents to also vote in the caucuses, whereas in Arizona it was closed. It was far less democratic and far less reflective of what\u2019s going to happen in the general election, because the independents overwhelmingly will support Bernie Sanders if he is the candidate. And that\u2019s just simply not true if Hillary Clinton is the candidate. Amazingly enough, Amy, in Utah\u2014and it\u2019s the most Republican state in the country; George Bush won by the widest margin in the country in both of his elections in Utah\u2014the polls now show that if Bernie Sanders is the Democratic candidate, he will beat Trump by 48 to 37 percent, 11 percent margin, whereas Hillary Clinton is barely shown as prevailing over Trump. He is far more electable, Bernie Sanders, against Trump than Hillary Clinton. And I think that what we are seeing now is the independents, who don\u2019t trust Hillary Clinton. Her honesty and trustworthiness numbers are in the toilet among independents, and her favorability ratings, the same. We\u2019ve got to get the message out that Bernie Sanders is the candidate who can beat Trump, if he is the Republican nominee.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And, Rocky Anderson, why do you think there is such a mistrust on the part of independents for Hillary Clinton?\n\nROCKY ANDERSON: Well, actually, there\u2019s a huge mistrust among all voters, but it\u2019s much greater among independents. And I think it\u2019s because, first of all, she voted for the Iraq War, and she helped George Bush make his phony claims in support of the Iraq War. She supported that vote when she ran against Obama last time around, and now she\u2019s saying, \"Oh, it was a mistake.\" She supports fracking. She\u2019s trying to back off that a little bit. She said the Trans-Pacific Partnership was the gold standard, until she had to face Bernie Sanders and she saw her base of voters disagreed with her on that. She opposed marriage equality until the polls changed. There\u2019s no reason to trust this woman. And that\u2019s showing in all of the polls.\n\nSo, I hope that those in the states that are going to be voting will recognize that a vote for Bernie Sanders is going to help the Democrats prevail against Trump, whereas Hillary Clinton is not doing well. And what we\u2019re seeing in Utah, by the way, all these Republicans saying they would support Bernie Sanders over Trump, 48 to 37 percent. And most of the people\u2014well, some 16 percent\u2014are saying they won\u2019t even vote if it\u2019s Hillary Clinton versus Trump. We\u2019re seeing the same thing nationally: huge leads for Bernie Sanders and a 1 percent lead by Hillary. And the trajectory is certainly against Hillary, because her numbers keep getting worse and worse in terms of her favorability ratings and voters\u2019 perception of her honesty and trustworthiness.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Though the\u2014though Bernie Sanders won in Utah and Idaho, I mean, the lines in Idaho\u2014I think they said they were like a mile long to get into the caucuses.\n\nROCKY ANDERSON: They were last night. Yeah, I waited two-and-a-half hours, Amy, and it was cold. People were wondering, like, is this\u2014\n\nAMY GOODMAN: But Hillary Clinton swept in the primary in Arizona. Dolores Huerta, you\u2019re a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, a surrogate. You\u2019re traveling the country supporting her. Why?\n\nDOLORES HUERTA: Well, first of all, because I do believe that she is the best candidate. I think she\u2019s competent, she\u2019s intelligent. She\u2019s got incredible amounts of experience. She\u2019s got the skills, the knowledge, everything that we need to have a president of the United States that can get things done. And I think that\u2019s very, very important to really focus on that. Hillary is a doer. She will make things happen.\n\nAnd I know I just heard the gentleman speaking about how Republicans love Hillary. Well, I know that the Republican Party is doing a lot to make sure that Bernie, you know, gets their support, and they\u2019re spending tons of money supporting Bernie Sanders, because they know that when it comes to November in the general elections, that they know that Bernie Sanders will be a lot easier to beat in the general election than Hillary. And so, I can understand their motivation and their support for Hillary, but I do believe that Hillary is the best candidate.\n\nAnd it\u2019s interesting when you talk about Arizona, because here you had Ra\u00fal Grijalva, who\u2019s a very progressive Latino, and people really loved Ra\u00fal Grijalva, but even with Ra\u00fal Grijalva\u2019s support and with all the\u2014Bernie had a very strong base in Arizona. I was in Arizona. They did a lot of door-to-door work. They did a lot of mail work, a lot of stuff on the media. And Hillary still won very, very handily in the state of Arizona.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And, Dolores, what about these criticisms of the flip-flops in Hillary Clinton\u2019s position on a variety of issues, like marriage equality and also about\u2014and also in terms of the TPP?\n\nDOLORES HUERTA: Well, I think that we want a president that can be\u2014can evolve in their thinking\u2014I mean, the same thing that we said about Bernie Sanders with his support of the gun lobby, you know? And Bernie has also in the past made some mistakes, as we know. And I think in our last interview, I mentioned his big mistake that he made on immigration reform when he came out against the Ted Kennedy bill in 2007, when we thought we were very, very close to be able to get immigration reform because we had the support of all of the public at that case, after all the immigration rights marches that we had in 2006. So, yes, I think we want a president that is going to evolve in their thinking, and we don\u2019t want anybody that\u2019s stuck in the past. So I have great confidence that Hillary Clinton will be there, and she will react to what the public needs. And she\u2019s always had a lot of compassion.\n\nAnd I think\u2014the one thing I do want to say, I think, at the end of the day, the person that we want to beat is Donald Trump. And I know that many of the values that Bernie Sanders has and that Hillary has are the same. The big difference between the two candidates is that Hillary is a person that can make things happen. She made things happen even before she was in office, when she was the first lady. She had the first convening\u2014the first convening of a healthcare convention for Latino youth and children. You know, she was able to get\u2014working with Republicans and Democrats, to pass a healthcare bill for children, that we got 8 million children covered under healthcare, even before we had the Affordable Care Act. And then she went forward with that one and passed the CHIP bill, so that we could get even migrant farmworker children and immigrant children covered under healthcare. And so\u2014\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go to an interesting poll. Compared to front-runners in previous presidential primary races, Trump and Clinton\u2019s unfavorable ratings, 57 percent and 52 percent, respectively\u2014that\u2019s 57 percent unfavorable for Trump, 52 percent for Clinton\u2014are the highest in CBS News/New York Times polls going back to 1984, when CBS first asked the question\u2014both of their unfavorabilities. But I want to ask Mayor Rocky Anderson, former Mayor Anderson of Salt Lake City, the point that Dolores Huerta makes that you want a politician and a leader who\u2019s evolving, who\u2019s willing to change her mind?\n\nROCKY ANDERSON: Well, yeah, she does it right when she\u2019s running for election. Bernie Sanders has been there his entire career to help promote the interests of the public. He\u2019s against fracking. Hillary Clinton is not. Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, leaned toward approving the XL pipeline. And the corruption issues\u2014we know that her brother received hundreds of thousands of dollars to get a pardon for a couple of his clients. You know, this whole Clinton dynasty dynamic is so anathema to most people, and certainly among independents. And by the way, independents are going to control the outcome of this election. And they don\u2019t trust Hillary Clinton. Her unfavorability ratings are horrible among them. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate running for president right now that has a positive net favorability rating. That\u2019s just amazing to me that people don\u2019t realize this. And when you say we want somebody who can beat Trump, the only person, according to the polls, that has a good lead over Trump in poll after poll after poll is Bernie Sanders. And Hillary Clinton could easily lose this race, especially given the trajectory that we\u2019re seeing in terms of people\u2019s lack of trust for her. And it\u2019s on so many issues.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: I\u2019d like to ask\u2014\n\nROCKY ANDERSON: She was on Wall Street, pocketing $400,000\u2014\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Rocky Anderson, if I could just interrupt for a second\u2014\n\nROCKY ANDERSON: \u2014speaking to Goldman Sachs.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: \u2014because we only have about a minute left. I wanted to ask Dolores Huerta\u2014Dolores, you\u2019ve been associated with Democratic Socialists of America. Bernie Sanders is a democratic socialist. Your response to the fact that an independent and avowed socialist is running for president and racking up so many votes, but you\u2019re supporting his opponent?\n\nDOLORES HUERTA: Well, first, I want to respond to the issue that the gentleman just mentioned. I want to say this. I think when you assign to Hillary Clinton what her brother did, that is so sexist. And it\u2019s so typical of that always to blame women for something that somebody else did. You know, women have to clean up the mess the way Obama had to clean up George Bush\u2019s mess.\n\nROCKY ANDERSON: No, no, no.\n\nDOLORES HUERTA: And so, I just want\u2014I just want to\u2014I just want to point that out.\n\nROCKY ANDERSON: It was her brother getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for Bill Clinton to grant a pardon to his clients. This is\u2014you know, it\u2019s like Chelsea Clinton.\n\nDOLORES HUERTA: Bill Clinton\u2014wait a minute. I want to stick by what I said.\n\nROCKY ANDERSON: She gets a fake job with NBC, $600,000 a year.\n\nDOLORES HUERTA: I want to stick by what I said.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Unfortunately, we have 10 seconds to go, Dolores.\n\nDOLORES HUERTA: Well, again, I think Bernie has a strong message. I think that Hillary can get it\u2014can make it happen. When it comes to being able to have affordable college for students, I think Hillary can make it happen. To improve the Affordable Care Act, Hillary can make it happen. That is the big difference between the two candidates.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And we\u2019ll have to leave it there. I thank you both for being with us, Dolores Huerta, civil rights activist, co-founder of the United Farm Workers of America, and former Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Democracy Now!", "description": "On Tuesday, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders won the Democratic caucuses in Utah and Idaho by a wide margin with about 80 percent support in each state.
