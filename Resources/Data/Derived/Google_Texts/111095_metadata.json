That is what Mahatma Gandhi achieved. This has been brought out vividly in an English radio documentary titled \u201cTitusji Bapu\u2019s Foot Soldier\u201d, written, devised and produced by Dominic Thomas, Programme Executive, External Services Division, All India Radio.\n\nThe 26-minute-long programme has won the Gandhian Philosophy Award-2014 \u2013\u2013 instituted from November 12, 2001 to commemorate Gandhiji\u2019s only visit to the AIR on same date in 1947. \u201cGandhian philosophy is confined to seminars, symposiums and conferences or limited to celebration of national days, like his birth and death anniversary and Republic and Independence days. But he lives in the hearts of the people,\u201d says Dominic.\n\nAn article in Reader\u2019s Digest about Thevarthundiyil Titus or Titusji (born in 1905, Maramon village of Kerala), who was part of the historic Dandi or Salt march (1930) intrigued Dominic who then located his younger son, Thomas Titus. The latter reveals in the documentary, \u201cMy father was the only selected Christian member of the historic Dandi March 1930.\u201d Comments Dominic, \u201cI used the original recording of Thomas (about eight to nine minutes) toauthenticate the content.\u201d Titusji's comments are in Kaushik Roy\u2019s voice and narration is by Abhishek Mukhopadhyaya. The programme includes audio of the first ever television interview of Gandhiji in 1930s and the original audio of slogans raised during the march, courtesy Gandhi Museum, Rajghat,\n\nThough Titusji maintained a diary during his stay in Sabarmati Ashram (1929-1934) \u2013\u2013 which is mandatory for all the inmates \u2013\u2013 he surrendered it as per the compulsory custom. When called upon AIR Bhopal to talk about his association with Mahatma in Hindi, due to his inability to read and speak the language, Titusji narrated the experience to his son, who till then was ignorant, transliterated it in Hindi but in Roman script.\n\nDominic traces how Titusji, a diploma holder in dairy management, became an associate of the leader. He was intimated to attend a job interview with Mahatma for the post of manager of Satyagraha Ashram\u2019s gaushala. Ironically, his elder brother had applied on his behalf. He remarks, \u201cI decided to attend the interview not for the job but for availing the opportunity of having a personal talk with the Mahatma.\u201d Employment conditions specified no salary with all expenses taken care of and two hours daily to be devoted to kitchen and house work. Interestingly, Titusji\u2019s request for some money for remitting to his old father was agreed by Gandhiji.\n\nUnable to decide, Titusji asked for time. \u201cOn the way back to Gorakhpur inner voice urged me to accept the offer,\u201d he says. He eventually joins on October 29, 1929 (Diwali day). He abided with all the rules of the hermitage, including spinning which Titusji admits, got on his nerves initially. \u201cI got used to it and it turned out to be a pleasure,\u201d he reveals and adds, \u201cFrom the yarn I spun I could get more clothes I needed for the whole year.\u201d\n\nThe producer highlights several facets of Gandhiji\u2019s pesonality through the inmate\u2019s writing. For example, aware that Titusji\u2019s father was worried about his son, Gandhiji during his visit to Parthasarathy temple at Aranmula, located in the princely State of Travancore, met him to assure that his son was in safe hands.\n\nThe 79 inmates of the ashram chosen for the march were briefed by Gandhiji about the hardships it entailed. Besides he instructed them to maintain discipline, observe diet restriction, complete their daily quota of spinning and praying every evening.\n\nBesides they had to teach villagers about clean drains, toilet, environment andaccepting whatever food is offered. The offer of a consignment by a biscuit manufacturer was turned down by Mahatma terming it \u201ca luxury\u201d.\n\nThe radio show exhibits how Mahatma\u2019s followers passed on his message to others, like the way Titusji did to his wife. Though initially reluctant she gave away her jewellery for the country's cause. The ashram life made her industrious, disciplined, humble and simple and helped her develop respect for manual and hard labour.\n\nThe radio show highlights Titusji\u2019s complete devotion to the leader by showing how he challenged a bishop about reaching heaven through Christ and remarked, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go a heaven which does not have Gandhiji. If such a good person does not have a place in heaven, how can I have a place.\u201d\n\nSumming up his documentary on Gandhiji, Dominic comments, \u201cHis teachings and philosophy is not merely a theory or ideology but a pragmatic idea that can be practised in our daily life making percept and practice possible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Great people ensure others listen to them when they talk and think and act on what they say after they leave.
