Our results show the opposite.\u201d\n\nDoes this mean that eating nuts lets me live forever? No. Death beckons to us all as the final void of our wretched, mortal lives, and all our triumphs of medicine and diet are futile attempts to stave off the inevitable.\n\nAdditionally, diet studies are notoriously difficult to extract meaningful clinical information from, and can only suggest a correlation rather than cause-or-effect. For example, people who eat nuts on a regular basis may have eaten them on salads, or be more likely to be vegetarian or vegan (another study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that vegetarians had a 12% lower death risk and 19% lower death rate from heart disease than meat-eaters).", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research suggests that nut eaters are less prone to heart disease and cancer -- and are thinner to boot", "title": "Go nuts: The more you eat, the longer you\u2019ll live", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/24/science_finds_an_unlikely_may_to_prolong_life_eating_nuts_partner/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "New research suggests that nut eaters are less prone to heart disease and cancer -- and are thinner to boot", "title": "Go nuts: The more you eat, the longer you\u2019ll live"}, "twitter": {"description": "New research suggests that nut eaters are less prone to heart disease and cancer -- and are thinner to boot", "title": "Go nuts: The more you eat, the longer you\u2019ll live", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@salon"}, "author": "Tom McKay", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Food, Health, Longevity, nuts, PolicyMic", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A 30-year Harvard study which tracked 119,000 men and women have found that those who ate nuts on a daily basis were 20% less likely to die than those who never ate nuts.\nHeart disease death risk dropped by 29% and the risk of dying of cancer dropped by 11% among people who ate nuts seven or more times a week.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a general perception that if you eat more nuts you\u2019re going to get fat.\nOur results show the opposite.\u201dDoes this mean that eating nuts lets me live forever?\nTopics: Food, Health, Longevity, nuts, PolicyMic, NewsThis article originally appeared on PolicyMic."}
