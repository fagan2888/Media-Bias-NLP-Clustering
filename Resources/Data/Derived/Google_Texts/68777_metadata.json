The program started just more than three years ago to develop positive relationships between police officers and kids in the community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about fighting,\u201d Police Chief Steve Dye told KXAS-TV (NBC5). \u201cIt\u2019s about teaching leadership skills and teaching accountability.\u201d\n\nAt a recent tournament in Dallas, Perez watched as 9-year-old Xavier Rodriguez came up short in a match.\n\n\u201cI felt like he listened [to the coaches] and did what he was supposed to do,\u201d Perez said. \u201cHe fought his heart out.\u201d\n\nPerez went on to win the tournament and thought he could help improve the 9-year-old\u2019s day.
