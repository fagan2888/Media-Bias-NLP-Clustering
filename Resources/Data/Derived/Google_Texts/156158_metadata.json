And whether Oct. 1 has been circled on your calendar for months, or whether you\u2019re just starting to pay attention, there are certain things about the law that everybody over 50 could benefit from understanding better.\n\nLearn these 6 things about Obamacare (1:25) Open enrollment for the health-insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act is set to begin on Oct. 1. MarketWatch's Thomas Bemis discusses six things about the law that people over 50 should know.

Among those reforms is guaranteed coverage for everyone, regardless of health status\u2014a huge boon to the many boomers with pre-existing conditions.\n\nNot only will insurance become more accessible, it will also be cheaper than comparable coverage today for those who qualify for government subsidies. That\u2019s a combination of benefits that some experts have called a \u201cgame changer\u201d for early retirees and self-employed boomers.\n\nBut most people of any age who don\u2019t have employer-sponsored or government health insurance must buy insurance or pay a penalty if they don\u2019t enroll by the end of open enrollment on March 31, 2014.\n\nWith all this in mind, we\u2019ve rounded up six things that boomers need to know about Obamacare.\n\n1. The health exchanges aren\u2019t for everyone\n\nYou needn\u2019t take any action if, like many Americans, you get health coverage through your job. The marketplaces are for those purchasing \u201cnon-group\u201d individual and family coverage, and for small businesses with 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees.\n\nGetty Images Political opposition and other factors have slowed the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but some key provisions will kick in on Oct. 1.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, people 65 and over who are on Medicare needn\u2019t act to continue getting their government benefits. There are scammers asserting otherwise in an effort to obtain sensitive personal information. But you can ignore them, because Medicare fulfills your insurance requirement: You won\u2019t be subject to any penalties and you don\u2019t need to obtain a new health-care card.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act did include some changes to Medicare that are already in effect, including expanded preventative screenings that are free to recipients. (Those with private insurance get a similar benefit.)\n\nIf you don\u2019t get coverage through your job and you\u2019re not on Medicare, Medicaid, or certain military or veterans\u2019 plans, you will be required to buy health insurance or pay a penalty at tax time. The fee in 2014 is 1% of your yearly income or $95 per person for the year, whichever is higher. The fee escalates and in 2016 will be 2.5% of income or $695 per person, whichever is higher (up to a relatively high cap). You may not owe the penalty if you qualify for an exemption on grounds including being uninsured for less than 3 months, being unable to afford coverage due to very low income, or being a member of a recognized religious group with objections to health insurance.\n\n2. You\u2019re guaranteed coverage\n\nThis is a biggie, especially for boomers: Starting in January, insurance companies will no longer be able to deny individuals coverage based on pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure. What\u2019s more, people with pre-existing conditions can\u2019t be charged more based on their health status or issued a policy that excludes coverage for their particular condition, practices that remain common today.\n\nGetty Images Uninsured people, and boomers in particular, are expected to get a boost from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTwenty percent of the 50-to-64 demographic went without health insurance for at least part of 2012, up from 15% in 2005, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based private foundation.\n\n3. Your rates can rise, but not because of your health\n\nStarting Jan. 1, insurers can no longer raise prices for a policyholder after he\u2019s gotten sick. Today, it would be common for a person with individual coverage who was diagnosed with, say, cancer, to see big premium increases at policy renewal time. Since his cancer would seriously limit his other insurance options, he\u2019d have little choice but to pay the increase in order to keep his coverage.\n\nPolicyholders won\u2019t face this predicament any more, but that doesn\u2019t mean their rates won\u2019t rise. Premium prices for marketplace plans will remain stable throughout each calendar year, but can be raised from year to year for everyone in your policy group\u2014that is, everyone who bought the same kind of plan from the same insurer.\n\nThe first coverage period is Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, 2014. Insurers face many uncertainties with this new market, and they will likely adjust their prices once they have more information, experts say. For example, if a disproportionate number of older and sicker people sign up for marketplace coverage, it will increase insurers\u2019 costs, and companies may pass along some of this increase to policyholders. Consumers will be informed of 2015 premium prices during open enrollment next fall, which will run Oct. 15 through Dec. 7, 2014, when they will have the option of switching plans.\n\n4. You need to enroll in the \u2018right\u2019 state\n\nEach state will have a health-insurance marketplace, and people must sign up for insurance in the state of their primary residence. Plans will include coverage for any emergencies that happen when you\u2019re traveling out-of-state.\n\nSnowbirds who split their time between states will likely have multistate plans to choose from on the marketplaces. Details for these plans will become available later this month, when the Office of Personnel Management announces the contracts, according to a spokesperson. Some may be regional plans that cover a large metropolitan area that crosses state boundaries. But it\u2019s possible that a given multistate plan may not meet the needs of someone who spends, say, half the year in New York and the other half in Florida.\n\nCurrently, some snowbirds are served by what\u2019s known as a \u201cwraparound network,\u201d whereby a claims-management company contracts with the primary insurer to lease a provider network that the insurer\u2019s members can access when they travel outside the primary network area, said Terri Welter, principal at ECG Management Consultants, a Seattle-based consulting firm to the health-care industry. While it\u2019s not clear yet, it\u2019s possible this type of system may continue with some plans on the exchanges, she said.\n\nIf you move out of state, you\u2019ll need to re-enroll for coverage in your new place of residence. A move will be considered a \u201cqualifying life event\u201d that will allow you to sign up for coverage outside of the open enrollment period..\n\n5. You may have more mobility, in work and life\n\n.\n\nThese new marketplaces will bring increased mobility to early retirees and self-employed boomers, according to Gary Claxton, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization that does health-policy analysis, health journalism and communication. Some people today find themselves stuck in a given place because they\u2019re wedded to their current insurance policy until they become eligible for Medicare at age 65. This can happen if they developed a medical condition while on the policy that would prevent them from passing underwriting elsewhere.\n\nIn addition to geographic mobility, the Affordable Care Act will also increase job mobility for boomers, experts predict. Many people are expected to retiree early or set out their own shingle, since they\u2019ll no longer be tethered to their job for the health benefits, a phenomenon known as \u201cjob lock.\u201d\n\n6. Your taxes could get more complicated\n\nThose whose incomes fluctuate may see their eligibility for subsidized coverage wax and wane alongside their income. If this happens, they will need to reconcile any overpayments or underpayments at tax time.\n\nHouseholds qualify for subsidies if members earn up to 400% of the federal poverty level, or $94,200 for a family of four, $62,040 for a family of two, and $45,960 for a single person. The Kaiser Family Foundation has an online subsidy calculator that will give you an estimate of your subsidy amount. For example, a 60-year-old nonsmoking couple making a combined $60,000 per year could receive a government tax credit of $10,682 for a silver plan on the exchange, leaving them to pay the remaining $5,700 in annual premium payments. (The subsidy declines as income rises, up to the threshold.)\n\nPeople who initially qualify for subsidies on the exchanges will have a choice of how to take them: They could have the subsidy applied directly to their premium, a method that lowers monthly costs and is called an advanced tax credit; they could have a partial subsidy applied to the premium; or they could opt to take the full subsidy in the form of a credit at tax time. Those whose incomes rose above the subsidy-eligibility threshold during the year and who chose the first option will have to pay back any excess advanced payments when they file their federal taxes. Conversely, those who received less in advance payments than they\u2019re due will receive the difference as a refundable credit at tax time.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"page.site": "marketwatch", "parsely-section": "MW_Retirement", "author": "Elizabeth O'Brien", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/6-things-boomers-need-to-know-about-obamacare-2013-09-18", "type": "article", "image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "title": "6 things boomers need to know about Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "creator": "@elizobrien", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_mark.svg", "height": 630}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-title": "6 things boomers need to know about Obamacare", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-09-18T19:14:00-04:00", "ob": {"image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}, "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "parsely-author": "Elizabeth O'Brien", "position": 1, "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "article.section": "Retirement", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/6-things-boomers-need-to-know-about-obamacare-2013-09-18", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.id": "608DCE04-1FCC-11E3-8AF0-002128040CF6"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1993\"", "article_summary": "With all this in mind, we\u2019ve rounded up six things that boomers need to know about Obamacare.\nThe health exchanges aren\u2019t for everyoneYou needn\u2019t take any action if, like many Americans, you get health coverage through your job.\nAmong those reforms is guaranteed coverage for everyone, regardless of health status\u2014a huge boon to the many boomers with pre-existing conditions.\nLearn these 6 things about Obamacare (1:25) Open enrollment for the health-insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act is set to begin on Oct. 1.\nThat\u2019s a combination of benefits that some experts have called a \u201cgame changer\u201d for early retirees and self-employed boomers."}
