None of us wanted to just address, \u2018How do we take care of more people?\u2019 The challenge is how do we take care of the people who are coming (to the ER) who maybe shouldn\u2019t be coming (and address their needs) in a better or a different way.\u201d\n\nNorth Ottawa Community Health estimates that about 4,800 or one-quarter of the more than 19,000 visits to its ER in 2014 were unnecessary. The health system expects that number will grow significantly in the next few years as ER visits increase to a projected 24,000 by 2018 as a result of population growth and the expansion of Medicaid in Michigan under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe problem of inappropriate ER use is pervasive at hospitals across the country and is only getting worse, said Sam Watson, senior vice president at the Michigan Health and Hospital Association.\n\nMisuse of ERs drives up the cost to treat someone whose condition is better suited in a lower-cost setting such as an urgent care center or a primary care physician office, Watson said. Many times, those patients lack a primary care doctor, or may have behavioral health issues such as depression or substance abuse that complicate their condition or get in the way of them taking better care of their health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity and it\u2019s an area that\u2019s getting a good amount of attention, and I think we can certainly do more,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThat is something that\u2019s on everybody\u2019s mind: How do you reduce the inappropriate use of the emergency department and make sure that patients get their primary care visits and their care in the right place?\u201d\n\nNorth Ottawa seeks to address the issue by partnering with organizations such as the Greater Ottawa County United Way that can serve patients who need care beyond the medical treatment they receive at the hospital. By partnering with existing organizations, the health system can avoid duplicating services outside agencies now provide and competing with them for funding, Yaklin said.\n\nOnce the ER project is complete, North Ottawa plans to add a second floor to an existing hospital wing to house mental health care that it will provide through partnerships.\n\n\u201cFor an increasing number of people, the emergency room experience needs to be something more, something different,\u201d Yaklin said. \u201cWe treat the medical need, but it\u2019s the other needs that go unaddressed that keep them coming back.\u201d\n\nThe new ER care model also will follow new protocols for chronic disease management that were designed with primary care physicians. The idea is to reduce unnecessary tests and medication variations and assure that patients get the care they need after they are discharged from the ER.\n\nNorth Ottawa expects to break ground on the project in the fall of this year, pending state certificate-of-need approval, and open the new ER in the spring of 2016.\n\nThe ER project marks the start of reengineering care provided by the health system to make \u201cthe community healthier,\u201d Yaklin said. If it works, the health systems can apply what\u2019s learned in the ER to other clinical services to improve the coordination of care across medical disciplines, she said.\n\n\u201cIf we can figure out how to do that well in that setting, we can use the same type of philosophy in (other areas),\u201d Yaklin said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we\u2019re trying to coordinate the service lines.\u201d\n\nNorth Ottawa has worked with Grand Rapids-based health care architectural firm Enviah PC on the project\u2019s design. The Christman Co. of Lansing is serving as the general contractor and Holland-based Elzinga & Volkers Inc. is the construction manager.\n\nThe health system this month launched a public capital campaign that seeks to raise $2.5 million to help finance the project and, as of early this month, surpassed 70 percent of the goal.\n\nOver the last several years, many hospitals have renovated or built new ERs, altered care protocols, and launched efforts to keep up with growing patient volumes, better triage emergency and non-emergency cases, and reduce inappropriate ER use.\n\nWatson of the MHA cites a 2013 pilot program at Spectrum Health, Mercy Health Saint Mary\u2019s and Metro Health in the Grand Rapids area that sought to ease unnecessary ER use by getting human service and behavioral health agencies involved.\n\nOne outcome of the pilot was improved communications and a standardized approach to patient clearance so a behavioral health professional who\u2019s called into the case already knows how the patient had been handled, accelerating their own assessment, Watson said.\n\nSpectrum Health in late 2011 formed a medical clinic to divert nearly 1,000 so-called \u201cfrequent fliers\u201d who use ERs at Butterworth Hospital and Blodgett Hospital in East Grand Rapids more than 10 times a year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Ottawa Community Health System\u2019s plan to implement a new model for emergency care along with development of a $9.7 million facility follows a br...", "generator": "runengine.com", "rights": "www.MiBiz.com", "og": {"url": "https://mibiz.com/item/22305-north-ottawa%E2%80%99s-proposed-", "image": "http://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/9dc8c8fcb216c6fbe3965b2835f99105_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "North Ottawa Community Health System\u2019s plan to implement a new model for emergency care along with development of a $9.7 million facility follows a br...", "title": "North Ottawa\u2019s proposed $9.7M ER project seeks to transform care delivery"}, "image": "https://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/9dc8c8fcb216c6fbe3965b2835f99105_S.jpg", "title": "North Ottawa\u2019s proposed $9.7M ER project seeks to transform care delivery", "author": "Mark Sanchez", "keywords": "north ottawa community health system,Michigan Health and Hospital Association,Greater Ottawa County United Way,Enviah PC,The Christman Co,Elzinga & Volkers Inc,Spectrum Health,Mercy Health Saint Mary\u2019s,metro health", "original-source": "https://mibiz.com/item/22305-north-ottawa%E2%80%99s-proposed-"}, "article_summary": "The ER project marks the start of reengineering care provided by the health system to make \u201cthe community healthier,\u201d Yaklin said.\nNorth Ottawa Community Health System\u2019s plan to implement a new model for emergency care along with development of a $9.7 million facility follows a broader movement in health care to prevent unnecessary and costly ER visits.\nThe health system this month launched a public capital campaign that seeks to raise $2.5 million to help finance the project and, as of early this month, surpassed 70 percent of the goal.\nOnce the ER project is complete, North Ottawa plans to add a second floor to an existing hospital wing to house mental health care that it will provide through partnerships.\n\u201cWe treat the medical need, but it\u2019s the other needs that go unaddressed that keep them coming back.\u201dThe new ER care model also will follow new protocols for chronic disease management that were designed with primary care physicians."}
