(Gregory Bull/AP)\n\nWhen you strip away all the layers of cockiness, preachiness and delusion in President Obama\u2019s 2015 State of the Union address, you find more cockiness, preachiness and delusion underneath.\n\nThis was most obvious in the brief and buried foreign policy section. Obama declared that \u201cthe shadow of crisis has passed\u201d fewer than two weeks after hundreds were killed by al-Qaeda and Boko Haram. He praised his own \u201csmarter kind of American leadership\u201d after being caught flat-footed by the rise of the most powerful terrorist quasi-state in history. He talked of respecting \u201chuman dignity\u201d without mentioning the 200,000 dead (including more than 10,000 children) in Syria \u2014 which will be remembered as Obama\u2019s Rwanda. He claimed that the Iranian nuclear program was \u201cfrozen\u201d \u2014 a description that Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) compared to \u201ctalking points that come straight out of Tehran\u201d \u2014 as the centrifuges spin and new Iranian nuclear facilities are being constructed.\n\nPresidential leadership on defense and foreign policy usually consists of preparing Americans for the unsought but necessary struggles of a dangerous world. Obama provides assurances of global progress and order at a minimal cost, so Americans can turn their attention within. If John F. Kennedy\u2019s rhetoric was a trumpet, Obama\u2019s is a lullaby.\n\nOn domestic policy, Obama\u2019s State of the Union narrative was similar, at least on the surface. In the president\u2019s version of recent history, he inherited a mess. He delivered new jobs, a roaring stock market, lower gasoline prices, improved shows on HBO and the best iPhone ever. Republicans opposed every useful policy advance and now want to kill the ones they didn\u2019t manage to strangle at birth.\n\nThis is not a message crafted for outreach. But the programmatic portion of the State of the Union has been widely misunderstood. Perhaps because of Obama\u2019s confrontational tone, many (both supporters and critics) found the speech\u2019s agenda to be \u201cboldly progressive\u201d or \u201cunabashedly liberal.\u201d It was different and smarter than that.\n\nObama\u2019s \u201cmiddle-class economics\u201d is not the ideological love child of Elizabeth Warren and Thomas Piketty. Rather than occupying Wall Street, Obama claimed credit for Wall Street\u2019s success. Instead of focusing on economic inequality, he emphasized economic mobility.\n\nThe tax portion of Obama\u2019s approach is typically redistributive. Contrary to popular belief, many Republicans are open to raising additional revenue from the wealthy \u2014 if it comes in the form of loophole-closing. Put another way, GOP leaders might accept taxes on consumption by the wealthy (say, by limiting the mortgage deduction for second homes), but they won\u2019t support additional taxes on savings and investment. Obama knows this. His proposal \u2014 which includes an increase in the capital gains tax rate \u2014 seems designed to make Republican support impossible.\n\nYet the new ideas found in the State of the Union speech \u2014 increasing the child-care tax credit, providing additional help to make community college affordable, paid maternity leave \u2014 are anything but boldly progressive. They are middle-sized proposals addressed to middle-class needs. They can be faulted for poor design or the manner in which they are funded. But they have none of the ideological ambition of the Affordable Care Act, or even Obama\u2019s plan for universal preschool education.\n\nI recently faulted Obama for abandoning Bill Clinton\u2019s New Democrat ideology. But the policy approach taken in this year\u2019s State of the Union was distinctly Clintonian. Or at least Schumerian. Last year at the National Press Club, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) argued, \u201cWhen Democrats focused on health care, the average middle-class person thought, \u2018The Democrats aren\u2019t paying enough attention to me.\u2019 \u201d Obama\u2019s \u00ad\u201cmiddle-class economics\u201d seems responsive to that critique.\n\nRepublicans have no choice but to contest this ground. Some have already begun. Read Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s book \u201cAmerican Dreams,\u201d or listen to Mitt Romney\u2019s recent speech at the Republican National Committee\u2019s winter meeting, or look at the Web site for Jeb Bush\u2019s Right to Rise PAC. All of these prospective nominees argue that economic growth, while necessary, is not sufficient; that the cultivation of human capital is essential to individual and national success in a globalized economy; and that government has an important role in promoting equal opportunity. They are also (accurately) pointing out that the condition of middle-class families during the Obama years \u2014 measured by net worth, real wages, business ownership, homeownership \u2014 has grown worse.\n\nRepublicans have a case to make for their own version of middle-class economics. And, for the first time in a long time, they seem to want to.\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Michael Gerson, obama state of the union, republicans", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "After Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech, Republicans have their own case to make.", "title": "The fight for the middle class", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-the-fight-for-the-middle-class/2015/01/22/f559807e-a26a-11e4-9f89-561284a573f8_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/01/22/Editorial-Opinion/Images/APTOPIX_State_of_Union_Reaction-0b64d-3017.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mjgerson"}, "description": "After Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech, Republicans have their own case to make.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-the-fight-for-the-middle-class/2015/01/22/f559807e-a26a-11e4-9f89-561284a573f8_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Michael Gerson, obama state of the union, republicans", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "f559807e-a26a-11e4-9f89-561284a573f8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf4c\"", "article_summary": "Obama\u2019s \u201cmiddle-class economics\u201d is not the ideological love child of Elizabeth Warren and Thomas Piketty.\nOn domestic policy, Obama\u2019s State of the Union narrative was similar, at least on the surface.\nRepublicans have a case to make for their own version of middle-class economics.\nPresidential leadership on defense and foreign policy usually consists of preparing Americans for the unsought but necessary struggles of a dangerous world.\nObama provides assurances of global progress and order at a minimal cost, so Americans can turn their attention within."}
