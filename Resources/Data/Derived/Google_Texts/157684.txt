TRENTON — A one-time New Jersey state corrections officer was sentenced Wednesday to 15 years in prison for his role in an interstate cocaine trafficking network.

Eugene Braswell won’t be eligible for parole for five years under the sentence imposed in state Superior Court in Warren County.

Braswell worked at Northern State Prison in Newark and was one of six people arrested in 2008. Acting Attorney General John Hoffman says the 35-year-old Newark resident admitted that he and 40-year-old Delrese Hardy of East Orange arranged to have 22 kilograms of cocaine transported from Houston to New Jersey.

Hoffman called Braswell and his co-defendants major interstate suppliers of cocaine that was distributed in northern New Jersey.

The investigation into the drug ring began after a 2007 shooting outside Braswell’s house in Newark in which he killed another man.

“Braswell and his co-defendants were major interstate suppliers of cocaine, and their activities fueled the type of gun violence that inevitably attends drug dealing, as evidenced by Braswell’s own involvement in a fatal shooting in Newark,” said Elie Honig director of the Division of Criminal Justice.

Braswell’s five co-defendants were sentenced in 2011 to between seven and 15 years in prison.
