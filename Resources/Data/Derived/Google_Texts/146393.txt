Former Democratic Party Communications Director Brad Woodhouse can really bring the ridiculousness, as evidenced by the above tweet.

Is Woodhouse trying to say that Kathleen Sebelius is a GOP plant and Republicans are single-handedly convincing private insurers to drop policy holders in order to turn “if you like your plan you can keep it” into a lie?

Sorry Brad, but it looks like the ironically titled “Affordable Care Act” arrived pre-sabotaged, which is one of the drawbacks of “passing it to find out what’s in it.”

Funny stuff, except not really.
