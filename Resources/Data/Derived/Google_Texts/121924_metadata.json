How can a woman be opposed to the fight to help women achieve equality? The sad fact of the matter is, as long as there has been feminism, there have been women who find it personally advantageous to reject feminism and instead argue for continuing social systems that perpetuate women\u2019s inequality, male dominance, and even violence against women. (There were even plenty of women who were willing to argue against women\u2019s suffrage back in the day.) Here is a list of nine women who have made a career out of opposing women\u2019s struggle for social, political and economic equality.\n\n1. Christina Hoff Sommers. Sommers is a pioneer in the art of arguing that it\u2019s men who are actually the oppressed class in modern society. Her 2000 book The War Against Boys tried to argue, falsely, that feminists are ruining young men\u2019s lives by oppressing them through the educational system. (Somehow those distressed young men continue to graduate and go on to have better job opportunities and make more money than their female peers.) She was most recently spotted offering her support to an organized online campaign to harass a young video game developer over her sex life.\n\n2. Cathy Young. While Christina Hoff Sommers specializes in facetious claims about imaginary feminist oppressors, Young focuses on minimizing the problems of sexual abuse and harassment of women. Recently, she made a shoddy and dishonest claim that men get harassed more than women online, a claim that necessarily leads to the conclusion that women\u2019s greater stress over harassment must be the result of their inferior constitution. Young also objects to the new movement to pass laws requiring men only to have sex with women who want the sex, on the grounds that men can\u2019t be expected to handle something as simple as reciprocity.\n\n3. Jill Stanek. Many women have found their calling in attacking contraception and abortion access, but Stanek, an ardent blogger, brings a hatefulness and obsessiveness that helps her stand out from an already unpleasant crowd. After getting old enough that unwanted pregnancy stopped being a personal concern, Stanek \u201cdiscovered\u201d that contraception has been evil all along, dedicating much of her blog to arguing that pregnancy prevention is a uniquely modern evil. Stanek also notoriously celebrated domestic violence, arguing that men should hit women who have abortions. \u201cThat spontaneous slap was the reaction of a real man who a woman had just told she aborted his baby,\u201d she said of a notorious scene in Godfather II in which a gangster hits his wife. \u201cCompare that to the modern-day cowardly male response, \u2018It\u2019s your choice. Whatever you decide, I\u2019ll support you.\u2019\u201d\n\n4. The Politichicks. Ann-Marie Murrell, Morgan Brittany and Dr. Gina Loudon are Internet video hosts who run a show called Politichicks and have a new book out arguing that women don\u2019t actually want the equality feminists are fighting for. They laid out their philosophy recently on Fox & Friends. \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s argument,\u201d complained the host, \u201cis that it\u2019s okay for women to be sexual beings just like men are sexual beings.\u201d The Politichicks agreed that this was absolutely outrageous, arguing that feminists are actually \u201csexualists\u201d and that feminist insistence that women like sex just like men do encourages violence against women.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sadly, these women find it personally advantageous to reject feminism and continue perpetuating sexist social norms", "title": "7 women working tirelessly to attack equal rights for women", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sadly, these women find it personally advantageous to reject feminism and continue perpetuating sexist social norms", "title": "7 women working tirelessly to attack equal rights for women", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/13/7_women_working_tirelessly_to_attack_equal_rights_for_women_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/schlafly-460x307.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sadly, these women find it personally advantageous to reject feminism and continue perpetuating sexist social norms", "title": "7 women working tirelessly to attack equal rights for women", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/schlafly-460x307.jpg", "creator": "@AmandaMarcotte", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Marcotte", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, EQUAL RIGHTS, Feminism, Women's Rights", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd920d\"", "article_summary": "(Somehow those distressed young men continue to graduate and go on to have better job opportunities and make more money than their female peers.)\nStanek also notoriously celebrated domestic violence, arguing that men should hit women who have abortions.\nTopics: AlterNet, EQUAL RIGHTS, Feminism, Women's Rights, News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetA lot of people assume the term \u201cfemale misogynist\u201d is an oxymoron.\n(There were even plenty of women who were willing to argue against women\u2019s suffrage back in the day.)\nHere is a list of nine women who have made a career out of opposing women\u2019s struggle for social, political and economic equality."}
