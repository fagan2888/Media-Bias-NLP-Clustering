He talks with employees before heading to an open training table in the back of the room. Sanchez begins his preworkout routine, sticking four small circular pads across his right shoulder while attaching the cables of a Compex muscle stimulator. As the electrotherapy runs through his body, making him look like a science experiment, Sanchez provides a bolt of lightning.\n\n\u201cComing to the Denver Broncos, this is a gift-wrapped opportunity. I believe in fate and destiny,\u201d he said, his conversational tone turning serious. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse. I need to take full advantage. There\u2019s nothing more important in my life than this.\u201d\n\nWATCH: What you need to know about new Broncos quarterback Mark Sanchez\n\n\u201cThis\u201d is the Broncos\u2019 starting quarterback job. It remains the most high-profile occupation in Colorado, a position responsible for creating joy and anxiety for millions of fans. More than two months after winning Super Bowl 50, the Broncos don\u2019t know who will be under center when they open their title defense Sept. 8 against the Carolina Panthers. Peyton Manning retired. Free agent Brock Osweiler defected to the Houston Texans.\n\nIn what general manager John Elway categorized as the first step in a process, he acquired Sanchez from the Philadelphia Eagles on March 11 for a conditional seventh-round draft pick. How Sanchez learned of the trade hints, in part, why the Broncos wanted him.\n\n\u201cMark doesn\u2019t have people around him who tell him how good he is. He\u2019s a pro\u2019s pro. Every little detail matters. He puts in the time, and that\u2019s what he was doing on that day,\u201d said longtime trainer Rick Stassi. \u201cTo see the expression on his face after he took that phone call \u2014 I will always remember how happy he was.\u201d\n\nSanchez, 29, has been studying film at Broncos headquarters, working on pass routes with his teammates at Mission Viejo (Calif.) High School and building relationships. He isn\u2019t trying to act like a starting quarterback but wants to be the starting quarterback, unfazed by talk of Denver potentially trading for San Francisco\u2019s Colin Kaepernick, Houston\u2019s Brian Hoyer or Cleveland\u2019s Josh McCown, or drafting a quarterback such as Paxton Lynch or Connor Cook.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s there. They are going to give me a fair shake. And if it\u2019s a fair shot, I will bet on myself,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI will compete my butt off and be friendly and professional with whoever\u2019s there. But I want this so bad. Since I was a little kid, I have been dreaming about a chance to win a Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nIf Mark Sanchez the NFL quarterback elicits a note of caution \u2014 37-35 record as a starter, and 84 interceptions \u2014 Mark Sanchez the person does not. This Southern California kid is rooted in family and grounded by his faith.\n\n\u201cYou need to do it all out\u201d\n\nGrowing up, Sanchez followed in the athletic footsteps of older brothers Brandon and Nick. Father Nick, a fire captain for three decades at Station No. 6 in Irvine, Calif., maintained a simple philosophy, telling his sons, \u201cWhatever you are doing, school or sports, you need to do it all out.\u201d Mark\u2019s passion revealed itself when he was only 4. He worked as the ball boy as Nick, 14 years older, starred for Whittier Christian High.\n\n\u201cHe was always around, carrying Nick\u2019s helmet, running around the field. He would do wind sprints after the game,\u201d said former Whittier Christian and longtime Monarch High coach Phil Bravo. \u201cHis dad would be out there throwing the ball with him. He loved to work. You could see that in Mark right away.\u201d\n\nNick Sr. took a hands-on, unconventional approach to train his sons. Before Google provided templates for training sessions, he created elaborate drills with obstacles to develop mental and physical skills. The boys would practice until dark at a Pop Warner field \u2014 Mark began playing tackle football in second grade \u2014 then drive around and find a local park with lights to finish the sessions. These grooves so ingrained, Sanchez has performed versions of these drills while vacationing on a beach in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, as well as on hunting trips.\n\n\u201cYou never have to tell Mark he needs to work harder or work more,\u201d said Joe Donohue, the owner of ProSports Physical Therapy & ProSport Stack Sports.\n\nBasketball was Sanchez\u2019s first love. He relished leading his youth teams in rebounds and fouls. His dad bought gadget glasses from a garage sale to help Mark with his dribbling.\n\n\u201cOh, my God. I hated those glasses. Luckily, we only wore them in our backyard,\u201d Sanchez said, laughing. \u201cI had big hands and a good feel for the ball, but I wasn\u2019t like a point guard, some baller dribbler. With these glasses, if you looked down, it hurt your neck. It was almost as bad as a dog with one of those cones on their head after coming from the vet. We would be dribbling and have to recite multiplication tables or spelling words.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sherry Ballantyne, Sanchez\u2019s fifth-grade teacher at Trabuco Mesa Elementary in Rancho Santa Margarita, his dedication manifested itself in the classroom. Sanchez was in the gifted program, a straight-A student. His personality stood out. Kids gravitated toward him. He participated in student government. He was \u201cgenuine and authentic,\u201d recalled Ballantyne, terms often used to describe Sanchez by those who know him.\n\n\u201cMark was smart. But he cared about others,\u201d Ballantyne said. \u201cI remember when a student was bullied, Mark was the first one to step in and put an end to it.\u201d\n\nSanchez maintains a friendship with Ballantyne and her husband, Mike. Sanchez bought athletic equipment for the elementary school, she said, and he frequently returned to talk to her students even as his football career blossomed at the University of Southern California.\n\n\u201cOne time he came on a day they were taking a test,\u201d Ballan- tyne said. \u201cHe grabbed the text book and said, \u2018I remember this.\u2019 And he went aisle by aisle giving the kids the answers. There were 34 kids who scored 100 percent. That\u2019s never happened before or since. I was fine with it because that was just Mark\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nCompassion, competition\n\nFrom his mother, Olga, Sanchez inherited compassion. His parents divorced when he was young, but they remained active in his upbringing. Sanchez grew up hearing stories about the need to roll up his sleeves, seek out advice and reciprocate goodwill.\n\nTo know Sanchez is to know his family. When the New York Jets selected him with the No. 5 pick in the 2009 NFL draft, he had his draft party at the ESPN Zone in Anaheim so everyone, including his grandmother, Ellen Marmolejo, could celebrate together. At a recent Thanksgiving dinner, Sanchez gathered family members for a feast, which featured the tradition of guests bringing side dishes. No pretense. No entourage.\n\nIn the days leading up to the draft, Sanchez met his college professor, Susan Evans, and her mother, Madie, in New York and attended a Broadway play with his girlfriend at the time. (Sanchez loves musicals and can belt out show tunes.) A few years later, when Evans treated her mother to a trip to Seattle for her 80th birthday, Sanchez sent flowers to the hotel room as a surprise.\n\n\u201cMy mom got there before me,\u201d Evans said, \u201cand she called and said, \u2018You are not going to believe this. It\u2019s the largest bouquet I have ever seen.\u2019 \u201c\n\nSanchez first met Evans in her course titled Communicating Health Messages and Medical Issues. He never identified himself as a USC football player, only as a student who needed a \u201cMonday and Wednesday class from 10 to noon.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone in the room knew who he was but me,\u201d Evans said of Sanchez, who enrolled in an independent study class on leadership to complete his undergraduate degree at USC. \u201cHe\u2019s naturally curious, generous and thoughtful. There\u2019s a decency and honesty about him that is remarkable.\u201d\n\nWhile playing for the Jets, Sanchez experienced breathtaking highs (two AFC championship games and a 4-2 postseason record) and staggering lows (a torn right shoulder labrum during a preseason game and the infamous \u201cbutt fumble\u201d). The Eagles offered a chance for him to start over, but not as a starter. He equipped his apartment with a white board to draw and memorize plays. But he was viewed by the Eagles only as insurance when Nick Foles and Sam Bradford were injured.\n\nSanchez believes he has grown with experience and will fit in just fine with the Broncos, who have a stable coaching staff, a quarterback-friendly head coach in Gary Kubiak and an offense that mirrors the concepts Sanchez was involved with at USC.\n\nOn this morning at a Southern California strip mall, Sanchez has gathered a few voices from his inner circle to push him through a grueling workout of chin-ups, lat pulls and boxing drills in a 40-pound vest. His friends and family remind him of who he is, where he came from and where he wants to be.\n\n\u201cIt started when I was just a little guy,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWhether it was throwing the ball after practice, hitting extra in the batting cage, taking extra groundballs, it was always about working when somebody is sleeping. I love to compete, and I love football. Sunday, man, you win \u2014 oh, my God. You win and everything is better. And, man, I hate losing. Food tastes terrible; you are in bad mood. It\u2019s a sickness. It\u2019s disgusting. Everything I have been through has made me appreciate this more and made me ready for this. I just kept hoping the last few years I would get another shot. It\u2019s here. It\u2019s all I can ask for. So let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nMark this down\n\nWhen the defending NFL champion Broncos open voluntary offseason workouts Monday, Mark Sanchez will be at the top of the depth chart at quarterback.
