(AP) - \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand my silence, how would you understand me & my words.\u201d\n\nVisually pleading with the world, those white-chalked words stood in stark relief on the blackboard in front of the young man who wrote them.\n\nBehind him, in an art classroom at Cedar Shoals High School on Tuesday afternoon, a young woman worked to fill the foot-or-so-square blackboard in front of her with her own words, eventually writing, \u201cI fear telling people about my past. I don\u2019t want to be judged for the things I can\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nAnd in a back corner of the classroom, another Cedar Shoals student struggled with the classic grammatical conundrum of when to use the verbs \u201clie\u201d and \u201clay.\u201d She eventually decided on \u201clie,\u201d for the double meaning it contains, and finished writing, \u201cThey see my smile, but not the pain that lies behind it.\u201d\n\nThe two dozen students in Hunter Wright\u2019s art class were among the people participating in this week\u2019s \u201cChalk Talks,\u201d a public art project being led by Wing Young Huie, a Minnesota-born photographer who is in town this week as part of the community\u2019s ongoing development of a public art master plan.\n\nBriefly, the \u201cChalk Talks\u201d require participants to think through a question, answer it on a chalkboard, and then have a photograph taken featuring them and their chalkboard.\n\nAt Cedar Shoals, Wing asked students to pair up for the exercise, and after suggesting some questions to them on Monday - things like \u201cWhat are you?\u201d or \u201cWhat advice would you give someone?\u201d he said - gave the young people a night to think things over. On Tuesday, the partners wrote separately on their individual blackboards, and then headed out of the classroom to compose photographs of each other.\n\nFor one set of partners, Cedar Shoals seniors Wendy Hare and Diamonique James, composing their photographs was relatively easy. James said she was surprised to find out that, as the two worked in front of a window near the art classroom, she just knew what Hare was going to do to compose her photo.\n\nWhile both young women have had classes together during their years at Cedar Shoals, Hare said the exercise led by Wing left her \u201cable to deeply find out more information\u201d about James.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s a very open person,\u201d Hare said.\n\nAsked whether the Chalk Talk had changed her perception of James, Hare said, \u201cIf it changed, it\u2019s in a way that makes her seem stronger.\u201d\n\nHare called the exercise \u201ca great experience\u201d and said she \u201cwould love to do a lot more things like this.\u201d On a broader scale, Hare suggested the exercise could help the entire school, given the hard times that students have experienced in recent weeks, in the wake of learning that a fellow student had been raped on campus by three male students.\n\nJames said she felt the Chalk Talk helped to break down racial barriers, prompting students to \u201copen up to each other, be in another person\u2019s shoes.\u201d\n\nWright, a substitute art teacher who inherited the Chalk Talk from the regular teacher of the art class, said the exercise forced students to move well beyond the regular scope of the class, which is focused on principles and craftsmanship, and to move into thinking more critically about themselves and the world around them.\n\nWright was surprised that the class dived so deeply into Wing\u2019s Chalk Talk.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re one of the more shy classes I\u2019ve had,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd, he added, \u201cCedar is a place where student voices haven\u2019t been heard.\u201d\n\nBolstering Wright\u2019s point, Wing closed out the Chalk Talk at Cedar Shoals by asking the class, \u201cHow often do you have conversations like this?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d came back a soft, barely audible reply from a young woman in the class.\n\nIf the students in the class choose to post their photographs online, they\u2019ll be available for viewing on Instagram under the hashtag #athenspublicart.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Athens Banner-Herald, http://www.onlineathens.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"If you don't understand my silence, how would you understand me & my words.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/23/artists-chalk-talk-prompts-students-to-think-about/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand my silence, how would you understand me & my words.\u201d", "title": "Artist\u2019s \u2018Chalk Talk\u2019 prompts students to think about life"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "\"If you don't understand my silence, how would you understand me & my words.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Artist\u2019s \u2018Chalk Talk\u2019 prompts students to think abou"}, "Author": "JIM THOMPSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3068\"", "article_summary": "For one set of partners, Cedar Shoals seniors Wendy Hare and Diamonique James, composing their photographs was relatively easy.\nIf the students in the class choose to post their photographs online, they\u2019ll be available for viewing on Instagram under the hashtag #athenspublicart.\nWright was surprised that the class dived so deeply into Wing\u2019s Chalk Talk.\nBriefly, the \u201cChalk Talks\u201d require participants to think through a question, answer it on a chalkboard, and then have a photograph taken featuring them and their chalkboard.\nWhile both young women have had classes together during their years at Cedar Shoals, Hare said the exercise led by Wing left her \u201cable to deeply find out more information\u201d about James."}
