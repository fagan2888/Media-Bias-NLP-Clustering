I just get a faraway look in my eyes and try to remain calm,\u201d Gleeson said. \u201cYou sign a massive, big, long contract thing\u2026 and then they send you a one-page thing that says, \u2018Here is what you\u2019re allowed to talk about.\u2019 And then there\u2019s just a big empty page. It says you\u2019re allowed to say you\u2019re excited to be in the movie. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there is no information about Star Wars: Episode VII. To drum up interest, Disney CEO Bob Iger has released some teasers about the movie and what he\u2019s seen in the footage so far.\n\n\u201cI can only tell you that production is underway. We have a very brief hiatus, which is due in part to the fact that Harrison Ford broke his ankle (leg),\u201d Iger said. \u201cThe footage we\u2019ve seen is very, very exciting to us. I think there\u2019s about 500 days left between now and December 18th, 2015 when the movie comes out. That doesn\u2019t seem like very long.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pent up demand. We\u2019re just as excited as the fans are about it.\u201d\n\nIt seems that those who want to find out about the Star Wars: Episode VII spoilers will have to wait until it hits theaters on December 18, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Star Wars: Episode VII spoilers are likely going to stay buried on the internet, one of the upcoming movie's stars says.
