Mary Landrieu, D-La., and her Republican challenger, Rep. Bill Cassidy, a video emerged showing a Democratic mayor encouraging Landrieu supporters to commit voter fraud.\n\nThe Black Conservative Fund, a political action committee, released the video shot at a private event where Opelousas, La., Mayor Donald Cravins Sr. tells attendees who voted early to go to the polls again to cast a ballot for Landrieu.\n\n\u201cOne more time\u2019s not going to hurt,\u201d Cravins says.\n\nCravins goes on to reassure supporters that Earl Taylor, district attorney of St. Landry Parish, would be elected to a fourth term Nov. 4 and would not prosecute them. (Taylor did win re-election.)\n\nCravins\u2019 son, Donald Cravins Jr., is Landrieu\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nActing as narrator for the video, state Sen. Elbert Guillory, a Republican, says the younger Cravins attended the event where his father made the remarks.\n\nIn a statement, the Opelousas mayor said his comments were taken out of context.\n\n\u201cAs usual, Senator Guillory has misconstrued my message and humor as something unethical,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very unfortunate that Senator Guillory has time to spend following me and critiquing my campaign itinerary and speeches.\u201d\n\n>>> How a Bill Approving the Keystone XL Pipeline Could Be on Obama\u2019s Desk by Year\u2019s End\n\nLandrieu\u2019s campaign did not respond to The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment. However, Landrieu did address Cravins\u2019 remarks in an interview with Louisiana\u2019s NBC 33 News.\n\n\u201cI looked at the video,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was in a barroom, you know, on a stage. People were having a good time. It seemed to me to be a joke.\u201d\n\nHans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation and a former member of the Federal Election Commission, said such behavior should not be tolerated.\n\n\u201cGiven Louisiana\u2019s infamous history of voter fraud, Mayor Don Cravins\u2019 urging voters to commit fraud by voting twice is appalling, as is his assurance that they would not face criminal prosecution if they re-elected the local Democratic district attorney,\u201d von Spakovsky told The Daily Signal. He added:\n\nThe solicitation of felonies by public officials cannot be tolerated. Cravins should resign, as should [District Attorney] Earl Taylor if he does not forcibly and publicly reject Cravins\u2019 behavior. Sen. Mary Landrieu must be asked if Cravins\u2019 son, her chief of staff, shares such reprehensible views.\n\nThe Louisiana Democrat faces Cassidy in a runoff election Saturday. Neither won more than 50 percent of the vote in the Nov. 4 primary, where they were joined by six other Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Senate race.\n\nA representative from Cassidy\u2019s campaign did not reply to The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment.\n\n>>> A Voter\u2019s Guide to Untangling the \u2018Jungle\u2019 Election That Could Keep America Waiting", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Democratic mayor says he didn't really mean voters should vote more than once for Sen.
