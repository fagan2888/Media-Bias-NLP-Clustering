One that made you cry? One where you got smacked sideways by a setback you never saw coming?\n\nJohn Boehner has some advice for you: change the subject.\n\nThat\u2019s the option the speaker of the House chose this week when he walked into the media lion den -\u2013 his weekly press briefing -\u2013 to answer questions after House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was handed his walking papers by the voters of Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District.\n\nWhen reporters pressed him on Cantor\u2019s downfall and the leadership chasm it opened within the House majority, Boehner insisted the real problem was not to be found on Capitol Hill, but at the White House.\n\n\u201cThis is a time for unity,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cThis is a time to focus on what we all know is true, that the president\u2019s policies have failed the American people.\u201d\n\nThe news conference included questions about Cantor and the House leadership race -\u2013 which he mostly blew off \u2014 and the Bergdahl affair. He said it was a mistake to swap the U.S. soldier for five Guantanamo detainees.\n\nBut it was the final question -\u2013 about the sudden deterioration in Iraq -\u2013 that the speaker seemed to be waiting for.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t seen this problem coming for over a year, and \u2026 it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t seen, over the last five or six months, these terrorists moving in, taking control of Western Iraq,\u201d he said animatedly.\n\n\u201cNow they\u2019ve taken control of Mosul. They\u2019re 100 miles from Baghdad. And what\u2019s the president doing?\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cTaking a nap!\u201d\n\nPerhaps knowing he would not utter a better soundbite that day, Boehner then picked up his notes and strode from the room. Minutes later, his \u201ctaking a nap\u201d quote overshadowed all talk of Republican disunity.\n\nThe White House tries this too. Earlier this week, in the middle of an event on student loan forgiveness, the president interrupted himself -\u2013 alerting the press that he was straying from his prepared script \u2014 to launch a shot across the bow at congressional Republicans who would not endorse his plan.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a big oil company, they\u2019ll go to bat for you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a student, tough luck.\u201d\n\nBut changing the subject only takes you so far. The student loan bill the president endorsed still fell. And on the day Boehner accused him of napping, he still had to explain why Iraq seems to be collapsing as the U.S. appears to watch from the sidelines.\n\nPresident Obama said he wants to help but is not interested in sending \u201cU.S. troops to play whack-a-mole\u201d around the world to put down insurgencies.\n\nThat\u2019s the White House\u2019s reality. Boehner\u2019s reality is that he has to form a new Capitol Hill leadership team at a time when voters are sending a series of clear messages that Washington is not their favorite flavor.\n\nIt can safely be said neither man had the best of weeks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced Wednesday that he was stepping down from his leadership position after a surprising defeat in Tuesday's GOP pri", "pubdate": 20140613, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced Wednesday that he was stepping down from his leadership position after a surprising defeat in Tuesday's GOP pri", "title": "Playing whack-a-mole: Hit or miss on politics and policy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/photos-2013-02-26-162657282.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/gwens-take-playing-whack-mole-hit-miss-politics-policy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced Wednesday that he was stepping down from his leadership position after a surprising defeat in Tuesday's GOP pri", "title": "Playing whack-a-mole: Hit or miss on politics and policy", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/photos-2013-02-26-162657282.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "virginia"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Election 2014, eric cantor, GWEN'S TAKE, iraq, virginia"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfdf\"", "article_summary": "The White House tries this too.\nBut it was the final question -\u2013 about the sudden deterioration in Iraq -\u2013 that the speaker seemed to be waiting for.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a student, tough luck.\u201dBut changing the subject only takes you so far.\nWhen reporters pressed him on Cantor\u2019s downfall and the leadership chasm it opened within the House majority, Boehner insisted the real problem was not to be found on Capitol Hill, but at the White House.\n\u201cThis is a time to focus on what we all know is true, that the president\u2019s policies have failed the American people.\u201dThe news conference included questions about Cantor and the House leadership race -\u2013 which he mostly blew off \u2014 and the Bergdahl affair."}
