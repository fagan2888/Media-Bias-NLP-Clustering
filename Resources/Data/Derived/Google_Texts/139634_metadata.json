After missing the first seven games of the season because of an injury, Harris got to put on a show in his home state (he\u2019s from Fishers, about 20 miles northeast of Indianapolis), and his mom was in the stands to see it all.\n\nWell, most of it anyway.\n\nWith about 10:20 to go in the fourth quarter, he drove to the bucket and completely posterized 6-foot-11 Ian Mahinmi. NBA cameras caught every angle, but his mother, Joy Harris, a former WNBA player for the Detroit Shock, didn\u2019t catch one.\n\nThank goodness for YouTube.\n\nOk yes I missed the dunk live but I've watched the replay 100 times now. \u2014 Joy Harris (@jharris40) November 15, 2014\n\n(via Deadspin)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Gary Harris,NBA,Nuggets,pacers", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Joy Harris, the mother of Nuggets rookie Gary Harris, was in Indianapolis to watch his NBA debut against the Pacers, but she missed a highlight moment.", "title": "Gary Harris' mom misses his dunk in NBA debut vs. Pacers", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/11/15/watch-gary-harris-mom-misses-highlight-reel-dunk-vs-pacers/12060/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/11/harris-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Joy Harris, the mother of Nuggets rookie Gary Harris, was in Indianapolis to watch his NBA debut against the Pacers, but she missed a highlight moment.", "title": "WATCH: Gary Harris\u2019 mom misses his highlight dunk vs. Pacers", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/11/15/watch-gary-harris-mom-misses-highlight-reel-dunk-vs-pacers/12060/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/11/harris-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Joy Harris, the mother of Nuggets rookie Gary Harris, was in Indianapolis to watch his NBA debut against the Pacers, but she missed a highlight moment."}, "article_summary": "NBA cameras caught every angle, but his mother, Joy Harris, a former WNBA player for the Detroit Shock, didn\u2019t catch one.\n\u2014 Joy Harris (@jharris40) November 15, 2014(via Deadspin)\nNuggets guard Gary Harris played his first NBA game Friday, against the Pacers, scoring 13 points on 6-of-10 shooting in about 18:30 minutes in the Denver victory.\nOk yes I missed the dunk live but I've watched the replay 100 times now.\nWith about 10:20 to go in the fourth quarter, he drove to the bucket and completely posterized 6-foot-11 Ian Mahinmi."}
