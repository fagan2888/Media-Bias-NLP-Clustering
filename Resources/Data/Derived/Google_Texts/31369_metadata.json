One kind of conversation is a well-meaning attempt to think about the limits of civility and of free speech. The other, which I\u2019ve warned about, is an attempt to use \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d as an epithet against those who oppose bigotry and violence. Donald Trump\u2019s escalating rhetoric of violence\u2014his vocal support for beating and roughly handling protesters at his campaign rallies\u2014is telling, not just because of its brazenness, but because it\u2019s so often accompanied by invocations of what\u2019s \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d\n\nConsider, for example, what Trump has said recently at his rallies about roughing up protesters and outsiders: \u201cIn the good old days, they\u2019d rip him out of that seat so fast, but today everybody\u2019s politically correct\u201d; or \u201cWe had four guys, they jumped at him, they were swingin\u2019 and swingin, the next day we got killed in the press, and we were too rough\u2026give me a break\u2026we don\u2019t wanna be too politically correct anymore, right folks?\u201d\n\nTo be clear, when Trump invokes political correctness in these moments, he\u2019s obliterating the meaning of political correctness that even its most strident opponents have given it. The reason political correctness is so damaging, according to its opponents, is it\u2019s an attempt to regulate words in the absence of physical harm. For the conventional anti-p.c. crowd, it\u2019s a sticks-and-stones argument: Those who favor political correctness lack toughness because, in asking for \u201csafe spaces\u201d or speech codes, they\u2019re asking for protection from words, not actual assault.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is using \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d as a scapegoat for adverse reactions to his encouragement of violence. In simple terms, for Trump, \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d means \u201cwe\u2019re not allowed to beat up protesters anymore.\u201d To be \u201ctoo politically correct,\u201d then, is to think that someone exercising their First Amendment rights at a political rally should be able to do so without being physically assaulted. By that standard, millions of reasonable Americans who favor the right to protest without getting sucker punched just became \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve claimed for a while now that free-speech concerns about political correctness have been unfortunately entangled in larger and darker culture war battles, to the extent that opposition to political correctness quite often says a lot more than \u201cI\u2019m concerned about free speech.\u201d By making it clear that political correctness is, as he sees it, not just a barrier to offensive speech, but to violent actions, Trump has brought this point all the way home.\n\nAt the Trump rally, political correctness becomes the force that would support the speech rights of protesters and the dissenting minority at Trump rallies, and opposition to political correctness becomes the hard shove and the swinging fist. The man who took a swing at an unsuspecting protester being escorted out of a Trump rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, claimed he enjoyed hitting the protester because the protester was \u201cnot acting like an American,\u201d suggesting further \u201cthe next time we see him, we might have to kill him.\u201d In this new anti-p.c. scenario, speaking in protest safely is \u201cpolitically correct,\u201d and \u201cacting like an American\u201d means punching and threatening to kill people who disagree with you. The traditional understanding of political correctness as a gesture of politeness or consideration gives way to the opposing extreme, not just a lack of respect but a prerogative to physically attack.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The madness at Trump rallies focuses an important debate about speech, protest and political correctness", "author": "Aaron Hanlon", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The madness at Trump rallies focuses an important debate about speech, protest and political correctness", "title": "Trump\u2019s jackbooted thugs against political correctness: Violence, fascism and the real assault on free speech", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/20/trumps_jackbooted_thugs_against_political_correctness_violence_fascism_and_the_real_assault_on_free_speech/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/trump_rally1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The madness at Trump rallies focuses an important debate about speech, protest and political correctness", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/trump_rally1.jpg", "title": "Trump\u2019s jackbooted thugs against political correctness: Violence, fascism and the real assault on free speech", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Trump\u2019s jackbooted thugs against political correctness: Violence, fascism and the real assault on free speech", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Donald Trump, Elections 2016, political correctness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The other, which I\u2019ve warned about, is an attempt to use \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d as an epithet against those who oppose bigotry and violence.\nTrump, on the other hand, is using \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d as a scapegoat for adverse reactions to his encouragement of violence.\nThe reason political correctness is so damaging, according to its opponents, is it\u2019s an attempt to regulate words in the absence of physical harm.\nTopics: Donald Trump, Elections 2016, political correctness, Life News, News, Politics NewsAmerica is having two kinds of conversations about political correctness, one of which Donald Trump\u2019s violent campaign rallies bring more clearly into view.\nAt the Trump rally, political correctness becomes the force that would support the speech rights of protesters and the dissenting minority at Trump rallies, and opposition to political correctness becomes the hard shove and the swinging fist."}
