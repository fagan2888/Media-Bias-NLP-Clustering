The Robert Half Technology survey is out and here in Denver and local tech executives are more optimistic about hiring for the rest of the year, compared to last year. The top skills tech companies are looking for are (drum roll please):

• Windows administration

• Wireless network management

• Desktop support

The report tallies up results of 100 Denver-area technology executives response to Robert Half about hiring expectations for the rest of 2015.

In speaking to Dan McMahon, branch manager for the Denver office, he said that the hot industries are software development (full stack and mobile), big data and IT security.

“The hottest hiring right now is in software development — your full stack, .NET development and mobile,” McMahon said. “We’re also seeing anything with Big Data, anyone who is doing anything with business intelligence. And third, IT security.”

Some more Denver factoids:

• 91 percent of CIOs plan to hire in the next 6 months to fill vacated positions or expand.

• 50 percent report that it’s a challenge to find skilled IT workers.

• 21 percent plan to expand their IT teams.

Security companies have thrived. Just this week, Broomfield’s Webroot reported strong third quarter growth thanks to small and medium-sized businesses.

McMahon said that all companies are becoming proactive about security, especially with the spate of security breaches at retailers.

“Companies are being a little more proactive and making sure there is intrusion and penetration detection. Instead of spending money on this after something happens and there is data loss, they are finding it costs less to be proactive,” McMahon said.
