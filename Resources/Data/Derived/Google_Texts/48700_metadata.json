The media tell us we need to worry about \u201cextremism,\u201d especially the kind that emanates from right-of-center. Electability, they tell the gullible public and their equally gullible political candidates, requires a level-headed disposition.\n\nForget all that, says iconoclast and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. In that sense, Trump resembles screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky\u2019s fictional newsman Howard Beale from the 1976 film \u201cNetwork\u201d:\n\nI want you to get mad! I don\u2019t want you to protest. I don\u2019t want you to riot. I don\u2019t want you to write to your congressman, because I wouldn\u2019t know what to tell you to write.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you\u2019ve got to get mad. You\u2019ve got to say, \u201cI\u2019m a human being, Goddamit! My life has value!\u201d\n\nSo, I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, stick your head out and yell, \u201cI\u2019m as mad as hell, and I\u2019m not going to take it anymore!\u201d\n\nIf anything, Donald Trump is America\u2019s angry, rage-filled, cathartic moment.\n\nRead Also: Trump and Illegal Immigration may dominate in 2016\n\nHis less-than-delicate denunciation of the ills Illegal immigration is having on America was his ticket into the nation\u2019s wheelhouse. The mainstream media called Trump an insensitive racist. The organized left demanded that his business partners immediately sever all financial ties with him.\n\nAnd if the Washington Post is to be believed, the Republican National Committee Chairman, Reince Priebus, spent an hour on the phone telling Trump to tone down his rhetoric; it is making GOP \u201cdonors and consultants,\u201d not to mention \u201cRepublicans in Washington,\u201d nervous.\n\nThat explains why recent polls show Trump in a dead heat with the GOP\u2019s presidential frontrunner, and mild-mannered milquetoast, Jeb Bush.\n\nRepublicans don\u2019t know it yet, but their party is dying. That\u2019s why they keep nominating flat-liners like John McCain, Mitt Romney and, most likely, Jeb Bush. That\u2019s because a tea party/conservative/libertarian coalition within the party of Lincoln has yet to coalesce and oust the empty suits of the GOP hierarchy.\n\nAnd so, while most presidential candidates in both parties mouth empty platitudes about positive campaigning, the majesty of mindless American mobs, and assure a dwindling and frightened middle class that a dazzling future awaits them, Trump instead zeroes in on the negative.\n\nRead Also: Trump, immigration, and a RINO\u2019s nightmare\n\nYou can\u2019t grapple with problems by pretending they don\u2019t exist. Worse yet, the media pretend that flooding the nation with illegal immigrants \u2014 people crony-capitalist GOP donors can exploit for their cheap labor and Democrats for their votes \u2014 is worth the crime, disease and the strain on our nation\u2019s social safety net.\n\nAmerica yearns for a new breed of brash, articulate conservative that says, \u201cI\u2019m as mad as hell, and I\u2019m not going to take it anymore!\u201d\n\nUntil that day, rage on Donald Trump.
