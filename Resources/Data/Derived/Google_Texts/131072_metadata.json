Some opponents of the ACA argue that it is too costly to cover all people too poor to buy insurance. But proponents say that leaving some people out not only leaves working people without health care, but also has hidden costs.\n\nThese may show up in higher insurance premiums or even the government having to step in to cover unpaid health care expenses.\n\n\u201cThese people are still accessing health care at community health centers, (which) are seeing these patients at a loss,\u201d said Goller. \u201cSomeone is bearing that cost of that care.\u201d\n\nBRCHS and The Free Clinics regularly see patients who fall in the Medicaid gap.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a misconception that since we have ACA we don\u2019t need a safety net,\u201d said Judy Long, executive director of TFC. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019ve seen zero change in the amount of people qualified to receive service here, and an increase of 25 percent in demand over the last two years.\u201d\n\nOf the 20,000 residents who qualify for TFC\u2019s services, about 7,800 fall into the Medicaid gap.\n\nLong said TFC has completed an analysis to create local statistics from a national study on the effects of the Medicaid gap. They found that in the course of one year, five to 13 Henderson County residents will die of a preventable disease as a result of non-expansion of Medicaid in the state.\n\n\u201cThe upside of this, if there is an upside, is that because the safety net recognizes the gap, we have a system that can get people care,\u201d said Long.\n\nAt BRCHS, caregivers see only about 40-50 percent of the county\u2019s residents living at the poverty level \u2014 others often resort to visiting emergency rooms for care, an expensive option that does not produce long-term health outcomes.\n\nA single person making less than $11,770 annually can fall in the Medicaid gap, like one grandmother in her 60s who came to BRCHS for help. People like her have the choice of surviving and paying their entire month\u2019s income for health insurance and having no money for anything else, or not paying and not getting care; it\u2019s really an impossible choice, said Goller.\n\nHe added that legislators perhaps don\u2019t realize that in states where the law is being implemented as it was designed, prices are going down, like in California, where Goller recently worked as director of outreach and enrollment for a regional consortium for community health centers.\n\n\u201cPreventing people from accessing health care is not a zero sum goal; you\u2019re going to see that cost somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re all in, it helps to create a good pool of people that are being taken care of ... it would be a much better use of our health care dollars, and you have much better outcomes.\u201d\n\nGoller also finds it puzzling that working parents are often the ones left out of the coverage picture. \u201cIt\u2019s popular to give kids access to health insurance, but they need someone to take care of them,\u201d he said.\n\nNot expanding Medicaid has a role in driving up costs, he added, because people with health issues who really need insurance will figure out ways to qualify for health care, creating an \u201cadverse selection\u201d of insured individuals, which in turn causes premiums to rise.\n\n\u201cThat drives a \u2018death spiral\u2019 in health insurance because as prices go up, healthier people increasingly choose to not to get health insurance, and feel that paying the penalty will be cheaper, whereas if you\u2019re sick, you\u2019re going to bend over backwards to pay for insurance,\u201d Goller said of the \u201csicker pool\u201d that is adverse selection.\n\nThe open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act was designed to negate adverse selection, mitigating a rush of those wanting insurance only as their health situation changes, yet the gap in coverage actually creates a scenario with a similar outcome.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that people in that income bracket have little political power because frequently those people don\u2019t vote,\u201d Goller said. \u201cMy message to people would be: vote. If you\u2019re in the Medicaid gap, your voice matters.\u201d\n\nSome states are reversing their decisions to expand Medicaid. In Louisiana, after taking office in January, Gov. John Bel Edwards signed an executive order to expand Medicaid coverage; Edwards ran on the platform of Medicaid expansion.\n\nBeyond the politics of the issue, Goller cited the possibility of those not receiving adequate care infecting others, as in the recent outbreak of tuberculosis in a poor area of Alabama, a state that did not expand Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThis really shouldn\u2019t happen in our advanced society,\u201d Goller said. \u201cTB doesn\u2019t discriminate against rich or poor \u2014 it can affect everybody.\u201d\n\nFor more information about Blue Ridge Community Health Services, visit brchs.com.
