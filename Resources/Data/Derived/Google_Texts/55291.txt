Meridian High boys basketball coach Randy Bolden will be back on the court when the fourth ranked Wildcats open up the Class 6A playoffs next Tuesday. However, he wont be coaching the Cats Friday in the 6-5A division championship game against Brandon in Petal.

The Meridian Public School District announced Friday that the investigation involving Bolden has concluded. Bolden was placed on leave earlier this week following an incident with a parent.

Bolden will resume his duties Saturday while MHS assistant Tony Tadlock will again lead the team Friday.

If Meridian wins, they will host a first round state playoff game next Tuesday. A loss would likely mean a trip to Jackson Provine.

If the Cats win their first round state playoff game, they will then host the Class 6A Boys South State Tournament.
