TGIF, the 114th day of 2015 and the 13th year since the CIA conducted the first Predator drone strike, near the city of Khost in Afghanistan. The intended target was Osama bin Laden himself; several men died in the attack but reporters on the ground determined they were Afghan locals gathering scrap metal. The error, however, barely slowed a new era in warfare, which quickly accelerated under former President George W. Bush but reached an all-time high under President Barack Obama, who swept into office in 2008 in part on an anti-war platform. Here’s your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in 180 seconds or less:

Fog of War, No GPS: Obama’s getting some blowback after his stunning revelation Thursday that a drone strike against suspected terrorists along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border ended up killing two Western hostages, including an American aid worker. Some White House allies want the president to rethink the drone campaign, while critics suggest that, despite Obama’s 2013 assertion, the Pentagon uses such strikes to kill suspects and not to stop imminent threats, even though it sometimes doesn’t know exactly who it’s put in the crosshairs.

Do-Something (Sort of) Congress: At the end of 2014, the 113th Congress took the phrase “do-nothing Congress” to a new level, coming close to enacting the fewest number of bills in modern history and redefining the phrase “partisan gridlock.” With Thursday’s confirmation of Attorney General-designate Loretta Lynch, however, the 114th Congress continued its move toward comparative bipartisan nirvana, and is already on track for a productivity level that blows by its predecessor – even though it’s only been in session for four months and only passed a few major pieces of legislation.
