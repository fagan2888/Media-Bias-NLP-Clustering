We had some games we were in and could have won if we had taken advantage of the opportunities. I felt we ended up record-wise about where we should have when we started, but the disappointment was that we could have probably won three more games.\u201d\n\nKarcher, a former NFL quarterback in his 25th year of coaching, said the disappointment of not winning more games in 2014 brings enthusiasm and optimism for the 2015 squad.\n\n\u201cThe disappointment of not finishing some games last year has given us great encouragement that we are ahead in our foundation building,\u201d he said. \u201cHeading into this year we are very optimistic. Our coaches have done a great job recruiting, and I look for us to be more competitive with more teams. What that will mean on the scoreboard, I don\u2019t know, but I think we\u2019ll be in a position to win more games this year.\u201d\n\nKarcher welcomed 72 players competing for 55 roster and 10 practice squad spots when the team reported for fall practice. After three days of no-contact practices, the Warriors began alternating two-a-day practices with single practice days leading up to an Aug. 15 scrimmage before beginning preparation on the season opener. The Warriors begin the 2015 campaign hosting Mississippi Delta in Bailey Stadium at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday, Aug. 27.\n\nThe strength of the Warriors again this season will be on the defensive side of the football, which Karcher believes has improved the most since his first season. East Central allowed an average of 22 points a game last season, after giving up more than 40 points per game in 2013.\n\nExpectations are high for the secondary, where three starters return, including safety Austin Balthazor of Seminary High School in Collins, and cornerbacks Jaylon Lofton of Forest High School and Trey Sloan out of Oak Grove High School in Hattiesburg. Balthazor led the team in tackles with 65, while Lofton picked off two passes last season. Also returning is Devontae Wilson, a product of Warren Central High School in Vicksburg, who logged a considerable amount of playing time in the defensive backfield in 2014.\n\nAnchoring the defensive front will be Jadarius Ceasar, a 6-5, 225-pound defensive end from Paul W. Bryant High School in Tuscaloosa, Ala. Ceasar was second on the team in 2014 with 61 tackles, including four sacks. Freshmen Rosheem Collins, a 6-1, 320-pound defensive tackle out of Ware County High School in Waycross, Ga., and Courtney Stamper, a 6-5, 262-pound defensive end from Red Bank High School in Chattanooga, Tenn., will be counted on to contribute early.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll be very good up front and we\u2019ll have a strong secondary,\u201d said Karcher. \u201cThose are the strengths of our defense, which we expect to be the core of the team.\u201d\n\nOffensively, the key will be getting consistent and productive play out of the quarterback position.\n\n\u201cWe struggled our first two years with inconsistent play at quarterback,\u201d said Karcher, who also serves as East Central\u2019s offensive coordinator. \u201cThat position is going to have to be very consistent and very productive for us. I\u2019m encouraged by what I\u2019m seeing, but that is critical for our football team.\u201d\n\nWhile Karcher is not ready to name a starter, Jesse Hosket, a product of French Camp High School and transfer from Itawamba Community College, was the leader going into fall practice. The 6-4, 215-pound signal caller is being challenged for the starting slot by Trey Willis of Forest Hill High School in Jackson, who played in eight games for the Warriors last season, and Vonnie Howard, who transferred from Pearl River Community College after playing high school football at Murrah High School in Jackson.\n\n\u201cJesse Hosket is leading this group at the moment, but I\u2019m still not ready to name a starter,\u201d said Karcher. \u201cHe has taken charge and said, \u2018I want to be the leader of this offense.\u2019 Trey continues to improve as well.\u201d\n\nSophomore running back SaVon Robinson of Raymond High School in Crystal Springs will try to fill the gap left by the departing Lamarcus Franks, who led the Warriors in rushing last fall.\n\n\u201cI feel good about our running backs,\u201d said Karcher. \u201cSavon Robinson is a young man who has ability, and we signed three other players who we think can really play, so we are excited to see what they can do.\u201d\n\nKabion Ento returns to lead the Warrior receiving corp. The product of Dollarway High School in Pine Bluff, Ark., caught 21 passes last year for 278 yards and two touchdowns. Several newcomers also are expected to contribute.\n\n\u201cWide receiver will probably be our most skilled area this fall,\u201d noted Karcher.\n\nWith three starters returning on the offensive line and two other returning linemen with extensive playing time, East Central is looking to be much improved on the offensive side of the ball entering the 2015 season.\n\n\u201cOffensively, we have an experienced group and our skill level has increased,\u201d Karcher explained. \u201cIf we can get the production we want and need at quarterback, I think we can be very good on offense.\u201d\n\nKarcher also expects marked improvement in the kicking game this year. Sophomore Aaron Garrett from Meridian High School and freshman Zach Claycomb from Hartfield Academy in Flowood are competing for the kicking and punting duties.\n\n\u201cBoth young men have real strong legs and I\u2019m very pleased with both of them,\u201d said Karcher. \u201cI feel like we have two kickers who are going to strengthen us in two areas where we struggled last year.\u201d\n\nThe kick return game also should be solid and improved over a year ago, Karcher noted.\n\n\u201cWe are growing into what we want to be as a football program,\u201d Karcher said. \u201cI\u2019m excited and optimistic that we will improve. How much? We just won\u2019t know until we get into pads and into the games. We have enough talent to compete with everyone on our schedule.\n\n\u201cOur coaches have done a very good and thorough job of evaluating talent. Some young men who may have been overlooked by others, our coaches are finding. Our goal each year is to find a player that\u2019s better than what we currently have. Time will tell, but I feel like that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nThere is one addition to Karcher\u2019s coaching staff this season. Taylorsville native Derek Welch is serving as assistant defensive backs coach after joining the staff in February. He previously served in the same position at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, La. Welch played his college football at Jones County Junior College and the University of Tennessee-Martin.\n\nReturning coaches include Scott Brock, defensive coordinator and linebackers coach; Mickey Mays, defensive line coach and special teams coordinator; Charles Jones, defensive backs coach and head strength coach; Dennis Alexander, offensive line coach; Ben Cooper, tight ends and running backs coach; and Tylan Martin, wide receivers coach.\n\nEast Central\u2019s schedule features five home games on the synthetic turf of Bailey Stadium in Decatur, including the opening game Aug. 27. The Warriors also play at home Thursday, Sept. 3, against Coahoma at 6:30 p.m., Thursday, Sept. 24, vs. Copiah-Lincoln at 6:30 p.m., Thursday, Oct. 1, vs. Hinds at 6:30 p.m., and Saturday, Oct. 17, against Southwest at 2:30 p.m. in the annual Homecoming game.\n\nThe Warriors will travel to Gulf Coast on Sept. 10, Holmes on Sept. 17, Jones on Oct. 10 and Pearl River on Oct. 22.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Head Coach Ken Karcher starting his third year with the Warriors", "language": "english", "author": "ECCC Media Relations", "og": {"url": "http://www.wtok.com/sports/headlines/East-Central-Community-College-Football-Ready-for-Breakout-Season-in-2015-321199141.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/1417*315/NC11_WTOK_350x100+banner+copy.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Head Coach Ken Karcher starting his third year with the Warriors", "title": "East Central Community College Football Ready for Breakout Season in 2015"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Head Coach Ken Karcher starting his third year with the Warriors", "title": "East Central Community College Football Ready for Breakout Season in 2015", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/sports/headlines/East-Central-Community-College-Football-Ready-for-Breakout-Season-in-2015-321199141.html", "image": "$cms.content.Thumbnail.url", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "East Central Community College Football Ready for Breakout Season in 2015", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "East Central Community College Football, Ready for Breakout Season in"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf251\"", "article_summary": "Expectations are high for the secondary, where three starters return, including safety Austin Balthazor of Seminary High School in Collins, and cornerbacks Jaylon Lofton of Forest High School and Trey Sloan out of Oak Grove High School in Hattiesburg.\nThe product of Dollarway High School in Pine Bluff, Ark., caught 21 passes last year for 278 yards and two touchdowns.\nEast Central allowed an average of 22 points a game last season, after giving up more than 40 points per game in 2013.\nSophomore Aaron Garrett from Meridian High School and freshman Zach Claycomb from Hartfield Academy in Flowood are competing for the kicking and punting duties.\n\u201cThat first year we were not in a position to be competitive with most teams and we weren\u2019t sure we could win a game,\u201d Karcher said."}
