And no partisan GOP answers about the 2010 election, either.\n\nPut yourself in the position of a future historian and think about what you would put in a book to describe Obama\u2019s biggest accomplishment.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone, regardless of ideology, would pick the so-called stimulus. Advocates of small government say it was a waste of money based ondeeply flawed Keynesian theory.\n\nProponents of big government, by contrast, also aren\u2019t big fans of the stimulus, though they\u2019re dissatisfied because they think Obama should have wasted even more money.\n\nAnother potential answer is Obamacare. Libertarians and conservatives, needless to say, would say it was a significant accomplishment in the same sense that the Titanic had a significant maiden voyage.\n\nLeftists, by contrast, obviously can\u2019t be pleased by the way Obamacare is imploding in the short run, but they nonetheless may think that it will be worth it in the medium run because more people will be dependent on government (though they may regret their choice in the long run).\n\nKilling Osama bin Laden is probably a good answer, but if terrorism and conflict with the Islamic world are still big issues in the future, then I suspect the achievements of Seal Team Six won\u2019t be seen as making that much of a difference.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I think the change in public opinion may be the President\u2019s most long-lasting and significant accomplishment. Take a look at these remarkable results just published by Gallup. A record share of the population now say that big government is the biggest threat to the nation\u2019s future.\n\nWow. I\u2019m tempted to say that this is strong evidence of the effectiveness of the Cato Institute (and there is independent data to support that position), but I feel compelled to admit that Obama also deserves a good bit of the credit.\n\nEven more amazing, President Obama has done something that is probably beyond even the ability of Cato. He\u2019s convinced partisan Democrats that big government is a serious threat. Look at how the numbers have dramatically changed since 2008.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly amazing about the shift among Democrats isn\u2019t that 56 percent now view big government as the major threat today, compared to 32 percent about five years ago. What\u2019s shocking is that this change happened with a Democrat in the White House.\n\nThis is newsworthy because partisan Republicans and Democrats have a tendency to say things are good or bad depending on whether \u201ctheir team\u201d is in charge.\n\nWhile these numbers are remarkable, I suppose it\u2019s too early to say the growing concern about big government is the most significant accomplishment of the Obama presidency.\n\nThat being said, anxiety about big government may lead to big political changes in 2014 and 2016, and those political changes may then lead to big policy changes such as entitlement reform and tax reform.\n\nAnd if that happens, then the shift in public opinion during the Obama years may turn out to be profoundly important. In other words, Obama may turn out to be another Herbert Hoover \u2013 a politician whose statist policies set the stage for dramatic changes in public policy.\n\nAnd if that happens, Obama truly will deserve to be named \u201clibertarian of the year.\u201d\n\nP.S. While big government is the biggest threat to the country\u2019s future, big business and big labor can be very dangerous to liberty when they get in bed with big government.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The fact that a record share of the population now say that big government is the biggest threat to the nation\u2019s future could be President Obama\u2019s biggest accomplishment.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "The fact that a record share of the population now say that big government is the biggest threat to the nation\u2019s future could be President Obama's biggest accomplishment.", "title": "President Obama\u2019s Most Amazing Accomplishment", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/president-obamas-most-amazing-accomplishment", "image": "http://danieljmitchell.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/hoover-spending1.jpg?w=237&h=165", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/president-obamas-most-amazing-accomplishment", "title": "President Obama\u2019s Most Amazing Accomplishment", "description": "The fact that a record share of the population now say that big government is the biggest threat to the nation\u2019s future could be President Obama's biggest accomplishment.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2013/12/19", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-19T13:24:41-05:00"}, "publication_date": "2013/12/19", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29a4\"", "article_summary": "After nearly five years in office, what\u2019s President Obama\u2019s most significant accomplishment?\nPut yourself in the position of a future historian and think about what you would put in a book to describe Obama\u2019s biggest accomplishment.\nEven more amazing, President Obama has done something that is probably beyond even the ability of Cato.\nLibertarians and conservatives, needless to say, would say it was a significant accomplishment in the same sense that the Titanic had a significant maiden voyage.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I think the change in public opinion may be the President\u2019s most long-lasting and significant accomplishment."}
