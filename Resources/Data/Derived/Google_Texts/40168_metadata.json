But the idea that the rule would be bad for most people is \u201crubbish,\u201d Moisand states.\n\nComparing the rule\u2019s opponents to protestors of a ban on golf carts on high-speed Florida roadways, Moisand argues that only those whose self-interest is at stake would argue against something that would make investors safer. Moreover, the rule will not even have a negative effect on financial-service firms, most of which already have programs that adhere to the higher standard anyway, he points out.\n\nAside from the convoluted logic, Moisand says there\u2019s inflammatory and false information coming from his opponents\u2019 camp.\n\nOne group has taken to calling the DOL rule \u201cObamacare for your retirement plan,\u201d Moisand notes. Their claim is that the rule is the beginning of a federal government takeover of 401(k)s and IRAs. He cites another source opposed to the rule that contends it would require potential clients to pay a fee prior to meeting with an advisor \u2014 even though the rule has no such stipulation. He also singles out as misleading the ads by the Secure Family Coalition \u2014 an umbrella organization of insurance-related industry groups \u2014 that claim, among other things, that investors won\u2019t be able to continue working with their advisors under the new rule.\n\nTo make the DOL rule a reality, in the face of such opposition, Moisand suggests that the initiative needs people who lead by example and that one way would be for more brokers and insurance agents who are fiduciaries to start speaking out against the industry groups and their paid lobbyists.", "article_metadata": {"WT.z_pageid": 2, "WT.co_d": "not set not set", "mm": {"media_code": "faiq"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1097851332, app-argument=mm-financialadvisoriq://c/1212513/133613/anti_fiduciary_arguments_illogical_worse_says_supporter?referrer_module=smartBanner", "DCSext.user_email": "not set", "site_id": 13, "DCS.dcsaut": "User ID: not set not set not set", "server": "ec2web-2", "DCSext.user_dept": "not set", "og": {"site_name": "Financial Advisor IQ", "description": "The DOL standard is feasible, but grassroots leaders are needed to show the way.", "title": "Anti-Fiduciary Arguments Illogical or Worse, Says Supporter", "url": {"email_verification": "https://financialadvisoriq.com/user/trial/send-verification-email/:memberId", "home": "https://financialadvisoriq.com", "signup": "https://financialadvisoriq.com/user/trial", "pwreset": "https://financialadvisoriq.com/user/password"}, "image": "http://financialadvisoriq.com/images/linkedin-logo.gif", "singup_text": "Sign Up", "logo": "https://financialadvisoriq.com/images/sso-logo.png", "type": "article"}, "version": "34.832.4", "DCSext.user_name": "not set not set", "DCSext.serv_type": "Unregistered", "WT.site": "FinancialAdvisorIQ", "DCSext.user_id": "not set", "DCSext.user_role": "not set", "DCSext.user_title": "not set", "DCSext.cn": "not set", "viewport": "width=990, user-scalable=yes", "WT.sv": "not set"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6be\"", "article_summary": "Aside from the convoluted logic, Moisand says there\u2019s inflammatory and false information coming from his opponents\u2019 camp.\nOne group has taken to calling the DOL rule \u201cObamacare for your retirement plan,\u201d Moisand notes.\nOctober 7, 2015Opponents of the Department of Labor\u2019s fiduciary rule use convoluted logic or downright falsities to make their case, advisor Dan Moisand writes in Financial Advisor magazine.\nBut the idea that the rule would be bad for most people is \u201crubbish,\u201d Moisand states.\nTheir claim is that the rule is the beginning of a federal government takeover of 401(k)s and IRAs."}
