And there seemed to be no end to his desperate, expensive pattern.\n\nSo the region\u2019s medical, social services and law-enforcement experts decided to take extraordinary measures.\n\nAfter a series of dangerous, drunken collapses on sidewalks throughout the city, the homeless senior was arrested in September on charges of disorderly conduct and public intoxication. The unique condition for his release on New Year\u2019s Eve: He will have to stay in a live-in facility or risk getting arrested again.\n\nThe man\u2019s case illustrates the depth and breadth of efforts to help chronic users of the medical emergency system \u2014 as well as save taxpayer dollars spent on their care.\n\nFor three years, the California HealthCare Foundation Center for Health Reporting and The San Diego Union-Tribune have produced reports chronicling the city\u2019s innovative push to reduce certain people\u2019s frequent 911 use.\n\nA team of community paramedics was established in the wake of the first series in 2012, and titled \u201cHealth Care 911.\u201d\n\nAnother package of stories this fall showed that reduction efforts had begun to pay off, with an almost 6 percentage-point drop in the number of 911 calls made by frequent users. That reduction translates to thousands upon thousands of taxpayer dollars saved in emergency services.\n\nThe biggest challenge remains convincing frequent users to agree to receiving intensive case management in a system they rarely trust, and one that sometimes releases them too early from detox programs due to a shortage of beds.\n\nFor the alpha user of them all, it took a court order.\n\nTrue to the elusive nature of the 70-year-old homeless man whose professed goal was to \u201cdie on the street,\u201d a video shot of an empty podium stood in his place during his Dec. 11 hearing.\n\nCounty Superior Court Judge Peter L. Gallagher said even though the proceeding was via video conference from jail, the man had waived his right to appear, as some misdemeanor defendants are allowed to do.\n\nGallagher sentenced the man, who had declined an interview request for this story, to three years probation under the housing restriction.\n\n\u201cEverybody, great job here,\u201d Gallagher told the man\u2019s public defender, San Diego police and representatives for the city\u2019s emergency medical services who were in the courtroom.\n\n\u201cI hate to use the term \u2018holistic approach,\u2019 but that\u2019s the term I will use,\u201d Gallagher said later in his chambers, citing judicial ethics and speaking generally of the substance-abuse cases he handles.\n\n\u201cYou can get people off the streets and into housing,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, if they\u2019re still drinking and they are still using illicit narcotics, the housing is just a place to flop.\u201d\n\nNew Year\u2019s Eve release\n\nThe city\u2019s top 911 user is scheduled to leave jail on Dec. 31. His new year will include access to mental-health and substance-abuse services, as well as treatment for serious medical problems that brought him very close to his goal of drinking himself to death.\n\nThe day after journalists chronicled a Gaslamp Quarter odyssey for the man that ended with his 243rd call to 911, Dr. Jim Dunford, director of San Diego Emergency Medical Services, vowed to come up with a new plan for this patient.\n\nDunford is a nationally recognized expert on intervention efforts for 911 frequent users, and he\u2019s the chief architect of San Diego\u2019s efforts toward that goal.\n\nFor the city\u2019s No. 1 frequent user, he and other city officials gathered to discuss more-effective strategies than the standard approach that had been tried repeatedly: taking him to the ER so he could be stabilized. Each time, he would eventually ask to be discharged back onto the streets.\n\nThe brainstorming process brought up the ongoing challenge of communications among the various teams striving to help frequent users. Medical privacy laws bar health providers from sharing key information with law enforcement, social services agencies and others unless a patient grants the access.\n\nUltimately, the coalition chose the strategy of incarceration and rehabilitation.\n\nOn Sept. 30, the city\u2019s top frequent user of 911 services was booked on multiple charges of disorderly conduct.\n\nHis use of the ER didn\u2019t stop once he was behind bars. On Oct. 4, a 911 call reported him as a Level 1 \u201cSick Person\u201d at the Central Jail suffering from nausea, weakness, dizziness and low blood pressure.\n\nHe was transported to UC San Diego Medical Center\u2019s emergency room in Hillcrest, then eventually taken back to the jail.\n\nWhenever the man needed subsequent hospital care, a county sheriff\u2019s deputy was asked to accompany him in the ER \u2014 so there would be no danger of him talking the health providers into mistakenly releasing him back out in public.\n\nDunford\u2019s point paramedic for the man, Anne Jensen, was tasked with finding a live-in facility willing to work with his resistant nature.\n\nThough the man\u2019s case was heard in open court, attorneys and officials declined to name the live-in facility designated for him and what treatment he would receive there. They cited patient privacy, but law enforcement and the courts aren\u2019t subject to such regulations like medical providers are.\n\nState legislation\n\nRep. Doris Matsui, D-Sacramento, has proposed legislation to clarify when the federal patient privacy law known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act should be invoked, and by whom. She reviewed the San Diego case through her staff and expressed concern.\n\n\u201cIt is common for people to inappropriately use HIPAA law as a blanket justification for not exchanging patient information that could be important in administering proper care,\u201d Matsui said.\n\nPeople who have tried to work with San Diego\u2019s top 911 user have found him to be uncooperative, even combative.\n\nBut when he could still walk, he was known to frequent the Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center, which at its downtown location offers health and supportive services to seniors.\n\nA medical professional conducting research there, who cited patient privacy laws and requested anonymity, said the man would at times warm up to the center\u2019s staff.\n\nApparently, he stopped visiting because he didn\u2019t want to abide by certain behavioral rules there.\n\nGonzales is a senior writer for the California HealthCare Foundation Center for Health Reporting.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "On Sept. 30, the city\u2019s top frequent user of 911 services was booked on multiple charges of disorderly conduct.\nPeople who have tried to work with San Diego\u2019s top 911 user have found him to be uncooperative, even combative.\nParamedics prepare to take San Diego's most frequent user of 911 services to a hospital emergency room on Aug. 11, 2015.\nHe was transported to UC San Diego Medical Center\u2019s emergency room in Hillcrest, then eventually taken back to the jail.\n\u201cEverybody, great job here,\u201d Gallagher told the man\u2019s public defender, San Diego police and representatives for the city\u2019s emergency medical services who were in the courtroom."}
