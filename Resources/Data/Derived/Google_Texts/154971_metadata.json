Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, both of Cuban descent, will help win over Latino voters.\n\nShe said the key is political stances, not identity, and she pointed to Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, who also is Hispanic but, she said, who struggled to win Latino voters until he embraced a more moderate record.\n\nDaniel Garza, executive director of the Libre Initiative, a Latino advocacy group with a libertarian bent, bristled at the NCLR\u2019s assertion that conservatives stand in the way of Hispanics\u2019 priorities, saying that was a \u201cfaulty assessment.\u201d\n\nMr. Garza said Hispanic voters aren\u2019t looking for government solutions as much as they want to see politicians promote conditions for economic growth.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking for leadership,\u201d Mr. Garza said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking for somebody who\u2019s going to advance policies generating an economic environment that spurs higher wages, generates more jobs.\u201d\n\nMr. Garza also said the NCLR\u2019s agenda placed most of the action at the feet of the federal government with calls for lower student debt, expanding Obamacare and imposing higher minimum wages or tighter workplace rules.\n\n\u201cFocus on a redistribution of knowledge and opportunity, not a redistribution of wealth and coercion,\u201d Mr. Garza said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hispanic voters like expansive federal spending, want to see an increase in the minimum wage, say the deficit should be solved by raising taxes and view tackling global warming as a major issue -- but nearly half say they're still open to voting for a Republican in next year's elections, according to Latino activists and pollsters.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hispanic voters like expansive federal spending, want to see an increase in the minimum wage, say the deficit should be solved by raising taxes and view tackling global warming as a major issue \u2014 but nearly half say they\u2019re still open to voting for a Republican in next year\u2019s elections, according to Latino activists and pollsters.", "title": "Hispanics supportive of Democratic agenda open to vote for GOP", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/12/hispanics-supportive-of-democratic-agenda-open-to-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/09/a846965323a7561f5c0f6a706700e3ba.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/09/a846965323a7561f5c0f6a706700e3ba.jpg", "description": "Hispanic voters like expansive federal spending, want to see an increase in the minimum wage, say the deficit should be solved by raising taxes and view tackling global warming as a major issue -- but", "card": "summary", "title": "Hispanics supportive of Democratic agenda open to vote for GOP"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, National Council Of La Raza, Tom Schaller"}, "article_summary": "Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, both of Cuban descent, will help win over Latino voters.\nBrian Sandoval, who also is Hispanic but, she said, who struggled to win Latino voters until he embraced a more moderate record.\nIn the first poll, Mrs. Clinton earned about 65 percent of Hispanics\u2019 support, but in the second poll, when asked how they\u2019d feel if Mrs. Clinton embraced the president\u2019s policies, her support shot up to 89 percent.\n\u201cFocus on a redistribution of knowledge and opportunity, not a redistribution of wealth and coercion,\u201d Mr. Garza said.\nHispanic activists face a challenge in trying to force elected lawmakers to focus on immigration, while also arguing that it\u2019s not the only issue for them."}
