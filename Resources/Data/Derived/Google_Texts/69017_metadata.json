In China, the problem is widespread.\n\nHere are more (juicy) details from the study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, from Johns Hopkins:\n\nDiets rich in cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, have been found to reduce risk of chronic degenerative diseases, including cancer. Broccoli sprouts are a source of glucoraphanin, a compound that generates sulforaphane when someone chews the plant or swallows the beverage. Sulforaphane acts to increase enzymes that enhance the body\u2019s capacity to expel these types of the pollutants.\n\nThe trial included 291 residents of a rural farming community in Jiangsu Province, about 50 miles north of Shanghai, one of China\u2019s more heavily industrialized regions. Controls drank sterilized water, pineapple, and lime juice while the half-cup daily drink for the treatment group also contained dissolved freeze-dried powder made from broccoli sprouts...\n\nAmong participants receiving the broccoli sprout beverage, excretion of benzene increased 61 percent beginning the first day and continuing throughout the 12-week trial. Acrolein excretion rapidly and durably increased 23 percent.\n\nResearchers say more trials are needed \u2013 those are being planned now. In the meantime, let\u2019s fire up that juicer and start looking at broccoli with new appreciation, as much as it might kill us to do it.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "You may have hated broccoli your entire life \u2013 as President George H.W.", "title": "A New Reason to Love Broccoli", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/18/New-Reason-Love-Broccoli", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06192014_Broccoli_Health_Smoothie_Juice.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/18/New-Reason-Love-Broccoli", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06192014_Broccoli_Health_Smoothie_Juice.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "You may have hated broccoli your entire life \u2013 as President George H.W.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd856e\"", "article_summary": "Among participants receiving the broccoli sprout beverage, excretion of benzene increased 61 percent beginning the first day and continuing throughout the 12-week trial.\nRelated: 14 Guilt-Free High-Fat FoodsNew research shows that drinking a daily \u201cbroccoli sprout cocktail\u201d \u2013 appetizing as this sounds \u2013 helps people fight off the cancer-causing chemicals found in air pollution.\nBroccoli sprouts are a source of glucoraphanin, a compound that generates sulforaphane when someone chews the plant or swallows the beverage.\n\u201cDaily consumption of a half cup of broccoli sprout beverage produced rapid, significant and sustained higher levels of excretion of benzene, a known human carcinogen, and acrolein, a lung irritant,\u201d writes Barbara Benham of Johns Hopkins University.\nNow it\u2019s time for all of us to finally let the broccoli hate go."}
