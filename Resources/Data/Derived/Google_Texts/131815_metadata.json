By far, the most canceled plans will come from Humana Insurance Company and Humana Health Plan.\n\nThat brings the state\u2019s Obamacare total to almost 340,000 canceled plans, according to Republican Rep. Cory Gardner, who\u2019s in a tight race for Senate with incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Udall.\n\n\u201cColoradoans continue to pay the price for Senator Udall\u2019s broken promise,\u201d Gardner said in a statement Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that Senator Udall has been so eager to please President Obama that he has forgotten thousands of Coloradoans across our state.\u201d\n\nWidespread Obamacare cancellations have been a political loser for Obamacare-supporters across the country, but the issue is especially fraught in Colorado.\n\nUdall, who voted for Obamacare and made the same debunked promises as President Obama that Americans could keep their health insurance plans, took heat earlier this year when emails suggested that his office tried to interfere with a state analysis of the number of plans cancelled by Obamacare. He was cleared of wrongdoing by a panel that refused to document its hearing.\n\nBut while over 18,000 people will be losing their coverage this month, that\u2019s nothing compared to next year.\n\nThe Obama administration said it would allow states to extend health care plans that aren\u2019t compliant with Obamacare through the end of 2016 and pushed the political responsibility for deciding when the plans should be canceled onto state officials. Colorado decided to extend plans through Dec. 31, 2015 \u2014 the remaining 192,942 Coloradoans that still purchase non-complaint health plans will have those canceled next November.\n\nFar from being an unknown glitch in the health-care law, the Affordable Care Act provision that outlaws certain insurance plans was in part intended to help drive healthier, previously-insured customers to Obamacare exchanges so that insurers\u2019 pools of customers were less populated by people with a pent-up need for health care.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s several administrative fixes, which allowed states to decide whether they\u2019d allow insurers to keep offering the plans for up to three years, make it more difficult for insurers to be profitable in Obamacare exchanges. The changes were likely part of the administration\u2019s reasoning in its decision to open the door to using taxpayer funding to bail out companies on the exchange who suffer losses on Obamacare exchanges.\n\nUdall\u2019s campaign said that the Senator had pushed for Colorado to extend canceled plans for another year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody more upset about the bungled roll out of the health care law than Mark,\u201d Udall spokesman James Owens said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he pushed the governor to use the authority to allow folks to keep their plans.\u201d\n\nUnder the Obama administration\u2019s current policy, all noncompliant plans will be canceled by Dec. 2016.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Udall hardest hit?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Over 22,000 Coloradoans have had their health insurance canceled by Obamacare in the past month -- and 200,000 are slated to be shut down in 2015, the state insurance department announced Friday.
