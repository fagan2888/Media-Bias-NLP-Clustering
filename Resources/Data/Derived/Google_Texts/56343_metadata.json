Carolyn Maloney.\n\nLOWER MANHATTAN \u2014 After Susan Herr managed to escape the 68th floor of Tower 2, as fire and chaos were enveloping the Twin Towers on Sept. 11, 2001 \u2014 she thought the toughest day of her life had to be behind her.\n\n\u201cBut I was wrong,\u201d Herr said, choking back tears. \u201cThe hardest day of my life has been going though chemotherapy and radiation at the same time.\u201d\n\nHerr, 51, along with dozens of other ailing 9/11 survivors and first responders who continue to suffer Sept. 11-related illnesses, including cancer and asthma, gathered with elected officials Thursday, to call for an extension to a soon-to-expire federal law that protects their health care benefits.\n\nThe $4.3 billion James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which provides health care and compensation for those sickened after breathing the toxic dust clouds at Ground Zero, will begin to expire in October, in phases, if Congress does not extend the bill, officials said.\n\nPeople fled the World Trade Center collapse on 9/11 amid a cloud of toxic dust.

The World Trade Center Health Care Program, which offers free health care, is slated to expire in October 2015. The other program, the Victim Compensation Fund, which reimburses responders and survivors for medical care as well as lost wages and pain and suffering, is slated to end in October 2016.\n\nThe programs would not stop immediately, they would remain in place until money runs out, if the act is not extended, officials said.\n\nThe fear of losing benefits, however, is too much for many who've suffered the trauma of Sept. 11, victims and officials said.\n\nKing said they are optimistic that an extension of some kind will push through Congress within the next year.\n\n\u201cIt has to be done,\u201d King said. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop until this is done.\u201d\n\nThere's a possibility that Congress would want to extend the bill, but not in perpetuity, officials said. There is precedent though, for permanent health care funding through Congress. Coal miners who suffer from black lung, for example, are entitled to federal funds indefinitely, officials said.\n\nNearly 70,000 first responders, recovery workers and survivors across the country are currently receiving medical treatment through the WTC Health Program, according to officials. The program treats numerous chronic diseases and respiratory illnesses, including asthma, obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease and several types of cancer.\n\nThe Victim Compensation Fund has deemed more than 7,000 survivors and workers eligible for compensation for their 9/11-related injuries.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "description": "The $4.3 billion 9/11 health care and compensation act is set to expire in phases starting October 2015.", "application-name": "DNAinfo", "og": {"url": "https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150903/financial-district/911-survivors-elected-officials-call-for-extension-of-zadroga-act", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/photo/2015/09/susan-herr-1441308843.jpg/extralarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "site_name": "DNAinfo New York", "description": "The $4.3 billion 9/11 health care and compensation act is set to expire in phases starting October 2015.", "title": "9/11 Survivors and Elected Officials Call For Extension of Zadroga Act"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"site": "@DNAinfo", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "DNAinfo", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-70x70px.png", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "54902139,1379988119,575522805,108424,5519941,48600120,112261,662865465", "app_id": 153948644632011}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Financial District,Health & Wellness,Politics,9/11,Zadroga Act,James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act,Carolyn Maloney,Peter King,Jerrold Nadler,Kirstin Gilibrand,Susan Herr,Downtown,Lower Manhattan", "google-site-verification": "AYA-4dHbK-igtSqpqIYyKuCbHO3o3KourjkrAnfCeZc", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-150x150.png", "googletag": {"topic": "health-wellness,politics", "tags": "james-zadroga-911-health-compensation-act,zadroga-act", "places": "lower-manhattan,downtown", "people": "jerrold-nadler,carolyn-maloney,peter-king,kirstin-gilibrand,susan-herr"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc80b\"", "article_summary": "The World Trade Center Health Care Program, which offers free health care, is slated to expire in October 2015.\nSusan Herr, a 9/11 survivor, speaks about her chronic illness, at press conference meant to rally support for an extension of the Zadroga Act.\nNearly 70,000 first responders, recovery workers and survivors across the country are currently receiving medical treatment through the WTC Health Program, according to officials.\nSenator Kirstin Gillibrand, have been pushing to make the funds and care available to survivors and first responders permanently available.\nThe Victim Compensation Fund has deemed more than 7,000 survivors and workers eligible for compensation for their 9/11-related injuries."}
