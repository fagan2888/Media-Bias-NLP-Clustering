The moderate Democrat, a former bank executive who rode President Obama\u2019s coattails to a narrow upset victory over Republican incumbent Elizabeth Dole in 2008, was heading into a tough campaign against Thom Tillis, the speaker of the state House of Representatives. Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, had already dished out more than $3 million for ads attacking Hagan \u2014 a mere precursor of an ugly eight months to come. But on this day, at least, the senator figured to have the news cycle all to herself, with Tar Heel TV stations broadcasting the usual announcement fanfare of broad smiles and soundbite-worthy platitudes.\n\nAll went according to plan until pesky reporters started asking Hagan about her vote for the Affordable Care Act, and about her past echoing of Obama\u2019s claim that \u201cif you like your insurance plan, you can keep it.\u201d She\u2019d been asked such questions dozens of times, no doubt, but the senator still had no answer. As campaign staffers anxiously whisked her away from the podium and outside to her waiting car, reporters chased Hagan, repeating the Obamacare questions. Finally, she responded, somewhat mysteriously, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t clear that insurance companies were selling substandard policies.\u201d Cue the evening sound bite: the backside of Senator Hagan fleeing from journalists in her bright pink announcement-day dress, dodging questions about a seminal controversy. \u201cDodging,\u201d along with its synonym \u201cducking,\u201d would soon become the verb of choice for headlines about the Hagan campaign.\n\nCAPITAL: The Week in Politics and Issues\n\nBROKEN CITY: Examining politics in an age of paralysis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was not, to say the least, what the senator\u2019s strategists had in mind. But Hagan\u2019s tentative attitude has become a common theme across the South this year. As the region has become the Republican Party\u2019s national fortress, Southern Democrats have won Senate seats by playing down their ties to their party.This year, six Democrats \u2014 three incumbents and three challengers \u2014 are waging competitive campaigns. The results in North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi could determine whether Obama faces a hostile Senate for his last two years in the White House. (Republicans need to pick up six seats to gain control, and only about 15 are competitive nationally.)\n\nThe question is whether Democrats in these states are better served by following the region\u2019s five-decade-long drift toward the GOP \u2014 or by betting that the climate is finally changing in their favor.\n\nRELATED: Elizabeth Warren takes populist message to GOP-dominant South\n\nIt\u2019s a sign of things to come in states like North Carolina, where large influxes of Latino immigrants and \u201crelocated Yankees,\u201d both black and white, are tilting the demographic balance toward the Democrats and inspiring a new progressive movement. But despite Obama\u2019s own surprising Southern breakthroughs \u2014 after Al Gore and John Kerry lost the entire region, he won three large Southern states in 2008 and two in 2012, falling just short in North Carolina \u2014 the region\u2019s blue future is still a long-term proposition. Candidates like Hagan are stuck between the past, when Southern Democrats\u2019 recipe for victory involved courting white moderates and conservatives, and a future in which they\u2019ll be able to successfully campaign as full-throated, national-style Democrats. To win, Hagan and her compatriots must simultaneously woo independent-minded whites while persuading massive numbers of young voters and nonwhites, who lean left on both economic and social issues, to join them.\n\nIt\u2019s an awkward proposition, to be sure. But the Democratic contenders have appeared hell-bent on making it look downright impossible.\n\nA few months after Hagan fumbled her big day, Georgia Democrat Michelle Nunn \u2014 a lavishly funded first-time candidate who is the daughter of much-loved former Senator Sam Nunn \u2014 had her moment in the national spotlight, courtesy of MSNBC. But when Nunn, whom The Guardian newspaper has described as exerting \u201crobot-like control\u201d over her carefully scripted campaign, was asked by the friendly reporter about her stance on Obamacare, the script turned to mush. Pressed on whether she\u2019d have voted for the Affordable Care Act, Nunn prevaricated, kvetched, and weaved, before finally offering that \u201cit\u2019s impossible to look back retrospectively.\u201d In a subsequent interview with Politico, Nunn \u2014 who\u2019s running in a state that is now more than 40 percent nonwhite and headed toward being \u201cmajority-minority\u201d \u2014 even declined to say whether she\u2019d support Harry Reid as Senate majority leader or whether Obama is doing a good job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNunn, like Hagan, is running a classic Southern Democratic campaign, in which the great goal is to come across as a milder version of a Republican. The same is true for incumbent senators Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, and for Democratic challengers Travis Childers in Mississippi and Alison Lundergan Grimes, the young Kentucky secretary of state who\u2019s waging a fierce battle to unseat Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. The demographics in those four states aren\u2019t trending Democratic the way North Carolina or Georgia are, but the candidates face the same dilemma: How do you sound like the future while running a campaign that\u2019s rooted in the past?\n\nE-BOOK: Broken City\n\nOnly Landrieu, who\u2019s running a tight race for a fourth term in a state that is one-third African-American, has found an issue to run on \u2014 as opposed to spending all her time running away from sticky issues like Obamacare, which she has (mostly) defended without reservation. But Landrieu\u2019s big selling point is hardly a traditional Democratic one. As the newly minted chair of the Senate Energy Committee, she\u2019s cast herself as an ardent booster of the state\u2019s oil and gas industries, championing the Keystone pipeline and distancing herself from Obama by loudly and frequently decrying the Obama EPA\u2019s new greenhouse-gas regulations. \u201cI\u2019ve been in Washington a long time \u2014 some say too long, but I hope not,\u201d Landrieu recently told the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation Convention. \u201cMy seniority is your clout.\u201d An April TV spot narrated by the wonderfully named Louisiana shipbuilder Boysie Bollinger \u2014 a prominent Republican donor, no less \u2014 put a slightly different spin on the same theme: \u201cLouisiana can\u2019t afford to lose Mary Landrieu.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the South, the Democrats\u2019 messages are comically muddled. Their races are competitive mostly because of the deep flaws in their Republican opponents. In Kentucky, Grimes has a shot because McConnell, a leader in the seismically unpopular Congress, has approval ratings that are as bad as Obama\u2019s. The Republican seeking to unseat Hagan in North Carolina, Thom Tillis, has a similar problem: He\u2019s the most prominent leader of a legislature whose right-wing policy making has made it more radioactive than Obama. Mississippi\u2019s longtime Republican senator, Thad Cochran, narrowly survived a runoff in late June with Tea Party challenger Chris McDaniel, and at 76, he\u2019s shown his age on the campaign trail; asked at one point what he\u2019d do after the election, Cochran replied, all too honestly, that he\u2019d \u201ctake a nap.\u201d Now the senator is fending off legal challenges as McDaniel and the Tea Party furiously claim voter fraud in the runoff. In Arkansas, pundits considered Democratic Senator Mark Pryor a likely loser against Representative Tom Cotton, a young war veteran and rising Tea Party star \u2014 until Cotton revealed himself to be an unwavering right-wing ideologue and a cold fish on the campaign trail. \u201cI\u2019m warm, dammit,\u201d he insisted to a visiting national reporter in June.\n\nBut for Democrats, \u201cI\u2019m not that other guy you can\u2019t stand\u201d is hardly a campaign message that will motivate the base. That\u2019s especially true in a midterm year, when it\u2019s the most reliably Democratic voters \u2014 young people and minorities \u2014 who are likeliest to sit out election day. \u201cThey\u2019re going to stay home again unless we make sure they understand why there\u2019s something big at stake in 2014,\u201d says Page Gleason, who runs the state\u2019s new progressive voter-mobilization group, Pro-Georgia. Nunn, whose campaign ads don\u2019t identify her as a Democrat, is doing them no favors.\n\nRELATED: Elizabeth Warren takes populist message to GOP-dominant South\n\nIf Democratic-leaning voters in Georgia voted in similar numbers to Republicans, the state would already be blue. But the Democrats\u2019 old habit of running Republican Lite campaigns, while it\u2019s given them a chance to win the occasional statewide election in a good year, has convinced much of what could be the base that there\u2019s little reason to bother with voting. Statewide, more than 800,000 eligible nonwhites are nonvoters \u2014 much more than what it would have taken for Obama, who ran no campaign in the state, to carry Georgia in 2008.\n\n\u201cThe old blue-dog model doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d says Ed Kilgore, a Georgia native and Democratic strategist who helped craft that model during his years with the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. \u201cThe people you\u2019re appealing to aren\u2019t going to vote for any Democrat anymore. You just don\u2019t go right on every conceivable issue.\u201d But that is exactly what his old friend Nunn \u2014 aside from her progressive stances on abortion rights and gay marriage, which she doesn\u2019t like to talk about \u2014 is doing. Her platform consists of reducing corporate tax rates, entitlement \u201creform\u201d (read: cuts) and debt reduction, supporting the Keystone pipeline, and cheering for military strikes in Syria. It\u2019s not exactly catnip for the state\u2019s emerging majority.\n\nBROKEN CITY: Examining politics in an age of paralysis\n\nThe surest way to fire up young people and minorities in Georgia \u2014 and North Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana \u2014 would be for the Democratic candidates to grit their teeth, take the plunge, and embrace Obama, even just a little. There\u2019s a reason, after all, why turnout in most Southern states skyrocketed with the president topping the ticket. The voting rate in North Carolina went from 51 percent in 2000 to 66 percent in 2008; in Georgia and Mississippi, turnout was even lower in 2000 and 2004 than in North Carolina, but rose to more than 60 percent in the Obama years. While the president might not exactly be beloved in a state like Georgia, his approval ratings there are exactly the same as his national average: 42 percent.\n\nNunn is running neck and neck for an open seat against two potential Republican challengers. (The GOP primary is Tuesday.) Surely a big late-October rally in Atlanta, with Obama embracing Nunn on a stage packed with homegrown civil-rights legends like Andrew Young and Representative John Lewis, would be exactly what Nunn, would need to push her over the top \u2014 and, very likely, keep Democrats in control of the Senate. Obama\u2019s presence could also fire up conservative whites, but that would make a marginal difference: It\u2019s those very voters who tend to show up for mid-term elections, and they\u2019re already itching to cast one last anti-Obama vote in 2014.\n\nNo matter. Southern Democrats like Nunn are about as likely to welcome Obama as they are to make a public announcement that they\u2019ve converted to French socialism. Southern Democrats have turned Obama-avoidance into a virtual art form \u2014 even Hagan, who wouldn\u2019t have a Senate seat without the success of the Obama machine in 2008. In January, when the president visited Raleigh to announce a $140 million manufacturing initiative in the state, Hagan said she was too busy in Washington to make the trip. Hagan\u2019s snub turned into one more public-relations fiasco when Obama pointedly brought up her absence and cheekily gave her the kind of endorsement that gives her campaign staff nightmares: \u201cYour senator, Kay Hagan, couldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I wanted to thank her publicly for the great work she\u2019s been doing.\u201d Most of the next day\u2019s headlines read a lot like the one in the New York Daily News: \u201cSen. Kay Hagan avoids Obama during his North Carolina visit.\u201d RELATED: The book Democrats are reading about\n\nWhat might happen if Democrats in the fast-evolving 21st-century South ran as honest-to-goodness, true-blue Democrats? Because the old Republican Lite habit dies hard \u2014 and because politicians of all stripes are timid by nature \u2014 we won\u2019t find out this year. But it won\u2019t be long. Perhaps in 2016, maybe in 2020, the mold will be broken: A new-style Southern Democrat will run in a state like Georgia or North Carolina or Texas and win with a full-throated progressive message. The demographics make it inevitable. And the result ultimately will be a whole new national political order. No longer will it be Southerners in Congress who are the stubborn impediments to progressive reform, as they\u2019ve been for 150 years. And no longer will Republicans have a stranglehold on the region in presidential elections. The five largest Southern states \u2014 Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, Texas, and Florida \u2014 account for most of the region\u2019s electoral votes. They\u2019re also the states where conservative whites are losing their hegemony by the day. How will the GOP carry national elections without them?\n\nBy the next decade, if demographics are (and they usually are) destiny, it will be Southern Republicans who are dodging and ducking and triangulating, conjuring ways to hold on to their aging and shrinking white base while appropriating Democratic issues and rhetoric to woo the new progressive majority. If they need tactical advice, they can always hire Kay Hagan or Michelle Nunn as campaign consultants. Their species of Southern Democrat will be, by then, a fading relic of a strange, distant, and inexplicable past.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.316142733", "eomportal-id": 422079, "description": "The hegemony of the blue-dog Southern Democrat is fading fast \u2014 as exemplified by the muddled reelection campaigns of North Carolina Democratic Senator Kay Hagan and others.", "eomportal-instanceid": 14, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "The hegemony of the blue-dog Southern Democrat is fading fast \u2014 as exemplified by the muddled reelection campaigns of North Carolina Democratic Senator Kay Hagan and others.", "title": "Southern Democrats, meet your future: No more Republican Lite - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/07/20/southern-democrats-meet-your-future-more-republican-lite/0QCGp3SSv7YhNrsnTMVy6L/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2014/07/18/BostonGlobe.com/EditorialOpinion/Images/0720oped_moserF.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Kay R Hagan, Elizabeth  Dole, Al  Gore, John  Kerry, Sam  Nunn, Harry  Reid, Mark  Pryor, Mary L  Landrieu, Travis  Childers, Mitch  McConnell", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 18:17:14 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Kay R Hagan, Elizabeth  Dole, Al  Gore, John  Kerry, Sam  Nunn, Harry  Reid, Mark  Pryor, Mary L  Landrieu, Travis  Childers, Mitch  McConnell, Thad  Cochran, Tom  Cotton, Andrew  Young, John  Lewis,Democratic Party, House of Representatives, Senate, Republican Party, MSNBC, The  Politico, Farm Bureau, Senate,House of Representatives, Democratic Leadership Council, New York Daily News, National Journal", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "7dd1be10-0fc9-11e4-9351-fb3e22086765"}, "article_summary": "As the region has become the Republican Party\u2019s national fortress, Southern Democrats have won Senate seats by playing down their ties to their party.This year, six Democrats \u2014 three incumbents and three challengers \u2014 are waging competitive campaigns.\n\u201cDodging,\u201d along with its synonym \u201cducking,\u201d would soon become the verb of choice for headlines about the Hagan campaign.\nAdvertisementNunn, like Hagan, is running a classic Southern Democratic campaign, in which the great goal is to come across as a milder version of a Republican.\nThe five largest Southern states \u2014 Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, Texas, and Florida \u2014 account for most of the region\u2019s electoral votes.\nCandidates like Hagan are stuck between the past, when Southern Democrats\u2019 recipe for victory involved courting white moderates and conservatives, and a future in which they\u2019ll be able to successfully campaign as full-throated, national-style Democrats."}
