He said it often took just one allegation for a teaching career to be over, even if proven false, and many were frightened to discipline students for fear of ramifications.\n\nTeachers receive training in handling violent situations in the classroom, including how to repel physical attacks through defensive \"block and move\" manoeuvres using the arms to parry an attacker's blow and dodge out of harm's way.\n\nNew teachers have won extra time away from the classroom for professional development and improved mentoring support but the NSW Teachers' Federation says more is needed.\n\n\"Chucking people in (to a classroom) and saying they have a university degree and teaching is second nature is just stupid,\" federation officer Fionie Stavert said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "TEACHERS confronted by &#173;violent students are banned from \"shouting angrily\" or pursuing children who try to run away unless they are in danger or likely to cause harm.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "TEACHERS confronted by &#173;violent students are banned from \"shouting angrily\" or pursuing children who try to run away unless they are in danger or likely to cause harm.", "title": "Teachers confronted by \u00adviolent students are powerless to control them due to strict NSW Department of Education guidelines", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/teachers-confronted-by-violent-students-are-powerless-to-control-them-due-to-strict-nsw-department-of-education-guidelines/story-fni0cx12-1226810306299", "image": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/01/25/1226810/306216-2b222f14-83bb-11e3-b939-7fcb48a5bb4a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/01/25/1226810/305896-d0b97ba4-79a6-11e3-ad16-5b01da53a32e.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226810306299, "keywords": "violent students, pursuing children, violent situations, extreme situations teachers, non-confrontational behaviour management, senior departmental officer, professional development, government schools, Blue Mountains solicitor, violent children, collegial environment, behaviour management style, department shows, school teacher, misbehaving student, physical violence, school staff, school principal, reports show principals, corporal punishment, beginner teachers, mentoring support, school classrooms, teaching career, angry parents, special schools, personal items, gardening shears, education chiefs, assault teachers, lengthy list, NSW Industrial Relations Commission, ,Blue Mountains,New South Wales,Australia, Ian Collins, ,Sydney,New South Wales,Australia, Stephen Krix, ,,,Australia, Peter Newall, NSW Department of Education, Dr. Peter van Onselen, Malek Fahd, commission teachers", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sun Jan 26 11:58:31 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sun Jan 26 11:58:31 EST 2014", "author": "BRUCE McDOUGALL LINDA SILMALIS"}}, "article_summary": "Teachers confronted by \u00adviolent students are powerless to control them due to strict NSW Department of Education guidelinesTEACHERS confronted by \u00adviolent students are banned from \"shouting angrily\" or pursuing children who try to run away unless they are in danger or likely to cause harm.\nNew teachers have won extra time away from the classroom for professional development and improved mentoring support but the NSW Teachers' Federation says more is needed.\nAs more than a million students in NSW prepare for the new school year teachers are under orders from education chiefs to develop a \"non-confrontational behaviour management style\".\nSchool serious incident \u00adreports show principals and teachers are abused, threatened or bashed daily in schools by violent students, angry parents or intruders with a grudge.\nBlue Mountains solicitor Ian Collins, who specialises in litigation involving teachers, said the power balance in classrooms had shifted from teachers to students."}
