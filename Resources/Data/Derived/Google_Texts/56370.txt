× Clinic will help repair smiles of homeless Utahns

SALT LAKE CITY — A Utah organization is opening a new clinic that will provide dental and oral care to homeless individuals in Utah.

The Fourth Street Clinic will have an open house and ribbon cutting ceremony on Jan. 23, and on Friday they invited media to take a peek at the clinic, which is located at 409 West and 400 South.

According to a press release from Fourth Street Clinic, dental care is a major service gap for Utahns without insurance, as decayed or missing teeth can damage a person’s self-confidence and contribute to continued unemployment.

The facility was funded as “part of a $2.9 million capital improvement project funded through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that effectively doubled the size of Fourth Street Clinic and allows for service expansions.”

The clinic will be able to help nearly 2,000 homeless Utahns once the clinic is fully operational at the end of 2015. Officials with the clinic are currently fundraising to collect the $450,000 that is needed to operate the clinic on an annual basis, according to the press release.
