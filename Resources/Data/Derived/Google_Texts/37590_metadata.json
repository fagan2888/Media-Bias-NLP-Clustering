The insurer is demanding reductions from what it believes are overpaid hospitals and physicians, while CHI is health is trying to meet it with what it believes are reasonable compromises.\n\nLast year, CHI Health offered a deal that would come with an estimated $10 million in savings compared to 2014\u2019s rates, and with reductions to hospital and physician charges at Omaha-area hospitals and clinics, could total $80 million in savings.\n\n[Also: Tracking 2015 mergers and acquisitions]\n\nNebraska Blue ended up not accepting that offer over issues with providers in Omaha, home to four CHI Health hospitals. Nebraska Blue, insurer of 700,000, said that CHI Health\u2019s Omaha providers cost 10 percent to 30 percent more for the same services than peers in the metro area, $60 million in total.\n\nFactoring in requested increases at two facilities, the proposal accounted for less than a 2 percent decrease for the insurer.\n\n\u201cWe carefully evaluated CHI\u2019s proposal, but in the final analysis it doesn\u2019t do nearly enough to seriously address the cost differences between CHI and other providers,\u201d Nebraska Blue senior vice president Pat Bourne said in November. \u201cWe have a responsibility to our members to hold the line on rising healthcare costs.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, in January Nebraska Blue did start covering members in-network at five CHI Health facilities -- all of them outside of metropolitan Omaha.\n\nBut for now the deadlock continues for CHI Health\u2019s hospitals and physicians in Omaha, and it seems to be hurting both organizations.\n\nLast year, Nebraska Blue fell to last place in J.D. Power\u2019s survey of consumer satisfaction with Heartland region insurers, a move the company attributed to the provider network disruption. Local media have profiled some of the dissatisfied members, like Julia Foote, a Grand Island resident who was receiving treatment for early-stage lung cancer at CHI\u2019s St. Francis Cancer Treatment Center. A continuity of care provision allowed her to keep getting chemotherapy there for 90 days, but after that she was encouraged by BCBS to find another provider, or else be prepared for out-of-network charges.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nWhether the impasse has hurt the insurer\u2019s bottom line isn\u2019t yet clear. But for CHI Health, there has been a financial impact. CHI laid off 150 staffers in Nebraska amid income declines, and the state\u2019s hospitals saw their second quarter fiscal 2015 income fall to $13 million, from $40 million the year before.\n\nCHI Health is optimistic that it will eventually \"rejoin the BCBS NE network under mutually agreeable terms.\u201d\n\nNew value-based contracts with other payers are \u201ceffectively diversifying the payer landscape and returning volume to the system, while reducing long-term exposure to BCBS of NE,\" CHI Health said in its annual report.\n\nIn February, CHI Health and Coventry, the Aetna subsidiary, announced a tentative deal for a contract starting for 2016 open enrollment and extending beyond 2017.\n\nThe same month, CHI Health and UnitedHealthcare renewed a contract for both individual and employer-sponsored plans, crafting a multi-year relationship with performance-based incentives.\n\n\u201cCHI Health\u2019s mission is to build healthy communities by delivering the region\u2019s most effective and efficient care,\u201d said Cliff Robertson, MD, CEO of CHI Health. \u201cWe have built a regional, clinically integrated network to fulfill that mission.\u201d\n\nAt some point, there will be a resolution to the network skirmish with Nebraska, said Juan Serrano, Catholic Health Initiatives\u2019 national senior vice president of payer strategy and operations, a former UHG exec who\u2019s helping nurture a small but growing portfolio of CHI health plans.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime,\u201d Serrano said, \u201cBlue Cross isn\u2019t the only insurer in Nebraska. Others continue to offer a full network. We have some very compelling partnerships serving the communities we\u2019re in. We view all of our relationships as long-term proposition.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/Catholic-Health-Initiatives-bitter-price-war-Blue-Cross-Blue-Shield-Nebraska", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/CHI-Health-livewellnebraska-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The insurer is demanding reductions from what it believes are overpaid hospitals and physicians, while CHI is health is trying to meet it with what it believes are reasonable compromises.", "title": "In stalemate with Blues, CHI finds other willing payers"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/CHI-Health-livewellnebraska-feature.gif"}, "description": "The insurer is demanding reductions from what it believes are overpaid hospitals and physicians, while CHI is health is trying to meet it with what it believes are reasonable compromises.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "In stalemate with Blues, CHI finds other willing payers"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska is waging a network battle and trying to win price concessions from CHI Health, Nebraska\u2019s largest health system and a part of Catholic Health Initiatives, the large national faith-based hospital system.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska is waging a network battle and trying to win price concessions from CHI Health, Nebraska\u2019s largest health system and a part of Catholic Health Initiatives, the large national faith-based hospital system.\nThe same month, CHI Health and UnitedHealthcare renewed a contract for both individual and employer-sponsored plans, crafting a multi-year relationship with performance-based incentives.\n\u201cCHI Health\u2019s mission is to build healthy communities by delivering the region\u2019s most effective and efficient care,\u201d said Cliff Robertson, MD, CEO of CHI Health.\nNebraska Blue\u2019s contract with CHI Health and its UnitNet physician network expired last fall, and the organizations have been in negotiations ever since.\nIn February, CHI Health and Coventry, the Aetna subsidiary, announced a tentative deal for a contract starting for 2016 open enrollment and extending beyond 2017."}
