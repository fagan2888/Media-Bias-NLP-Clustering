But he continues to win small victories against Hillary Clinton, in both primary elections and in the campaigns\u2019 competition to win each news cycle.\n\nOver the weekend, following a high profile speaking engagement at the Vatican, Sanders returned to the US prepared to highlight the differences between his campaign and Clinton\u2019s.\n\nRelated: Bernie Sanders Goes All in with Pope Francis\n\nSanders went to Rome and met (albeit briefly) with Pope Francis, a beloved religious figure known for his humility and distaste for the gilded trappings of the papacy.\n\nClinton met with actor George Clooney and his wife, famed human rights attorney Amal Clooney, at their Hollywood mansion for a $15 million fundraiser -- a figure that Clooney himself said was part and parcel of the \u201cobscene\u201d amounts of money being spent on presidential elections. On the way there, Clinton\u2019s motorcade passed Sanders supporters lined up along the side of the road who threw a blanket of dollar bills in the path of her motorcade.\n\nIn addition, after protracted and unexplained delays, Sanders finally released his most recent tax returns. The delays had caused some speculation that the Vermont senator\u2019s returns might contain something that would damage his reputation with his supporters. In the end, all it showed was that Sanders and his wife, Jane, made about $206,000 in 2014 -- conveniently about the same amount Hillary Clinton was paid for a single speech to investment bank Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe tax return issue perfectly set up Sanders\u2019 most recent attack on Clinton, an advertisement blasting the former secretary of state for being late to support the push to raise the minimum wage to $15. Clinton, during last week\u2019s Democratic debate, appeared for the first time to endorse a federal $15 per hour wage.\n\nRelated: Clooney vs. The Pope -- Whose Endorsement Will Count More?\n\n\u201cWall Street banks shower Washington politicians with campaign contributions and speaking fees,\u201d the ad says. \u201cAnd what do they get for it? A rigged economy, tax breaks and bailouts. Two hundred thousand dollars an hour for them, but not even 15 bucks an hour for all Americans. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\nWhile the ad doesn\u2019t mention Clinton by name, anyone who has paid even a little bit of attention to the Democratic primary surely can\u2019t help associating \u201cspeaking fees\u201d and $200,000\u201d with Clinton\u2019s controversial series of speeches at Wall Street events.\n\nIn an appearance on ABC News, Clinton fought back against the Sanders ad, saying, \u201cHe knows very well\u201d that she is a supporter of a $15 minimum wage and that she has been endorsed by the coalition of unions and activists leading the fight.\n\nShe was asked by host George Stephanopoulos to reconcile her current position with her stance earlier in the campaign, where she appeared to suggest that a $15 might be too high, and would do more damage by eliminating jobs than it would do good by raising workers\u2019 living standards. At the time, she said that she supports an increase to $12.\n\nRelated: Hillary and Bernie Mix It Up Over Guns, Goldman, and Gaza\n\nClinton tried to bridge the gap by claiming that she is in favor of graduated increases in the minimum wage, coupled with constant analysis that can assure the wage increases are having no impact on job growth. She said that was the sort of legislation that she was referring to when she discussed signing a minimum wage bill in the most recent debate. She added, \u201cI think their campaign is trying to make something where there is nothing.\u201d\n\nSanders appeared on the same show immediately after Clinton, and challenged her version of the minimum wage fight, arguing that her expressed willingness to support a $15 wage if the Congress approves it falls short of what he is doing.\n\n\u201cI am trying to lead this country in a different direction,\u201d Sanders said, suggesting that Clinton acceding to a wage increase passed by legislators falls short.\n\n\u201cI want to lead that effort, not just follow,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Bernie Sanders still faces a daunting uphill path to the Democratic presidential nomin", "title": "Sanders \u2018Berns\u2019 Clinton on Minimum Wage Issue", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/18/Sanders-Berns-Clinton-Minimum-Wage-Issue", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04052016_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/18/Sanders-Berns-Clinton-Minimum-Wage-Issue", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04052016_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Bernie Sanders still faces a daunting uphill path to the Democratic presidential nomin", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The tax return issue perfectly set up Sanders\u2019 most recent attack on Clinton, an advertisement blasting the former secretary of state for being late to support the push to raise the minimum wage to $15.\nShe said that was the sort of legislation that she was referring to when she discussed signing a minimum wage bill in the most recent debate.\nIn addition, after protracted and unexplained delays, Sanders finally released his most recent tax returns.\n\u201cI am trying to lead this country in a different direction,\u201d Sanders said, suggesting that Clinton acceding to a wage increase passed by legislators falls short.\nClinton, during last week\u2019s Democratic debate, appeared for the first time to endorse a federal $15 per hour wage."}
