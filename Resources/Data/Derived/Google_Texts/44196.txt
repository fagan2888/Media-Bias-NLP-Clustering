Jeb Bush adviser and GOP hack Mike Murphy thinks it may be in Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s (D-NV) interest to throw the Senate to Republicans.

In an appearance on Sunday’s Meet The Press, the conservative-bashing consultant who has yet to win a presidential election and once referred to Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) as Reid’s secret weapon, said if Republicans took back the Senate, it could turn into an “American idol of grievance.” Todd snickered and egged Murphy on, showing nothing but contempt for conservatives.

“Harry Reid may throw the Senate,” Murphy said. “You can argue it’s in his interest.”

If Reid wanted to throw the Senate and become Minority Leader, he would have pushed Obama to enact a massive executive amnesty before the midterms. But Obama decided not to in order to preserve the Senate for Democrats. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who gave Obama recommendations for executive actions, said that the administration delayed its executive amnesty to not get slaughtered at the polls like in the 1994 midterms. But Todd, who promised his viewers that he would stop the spin and hold establishment hacks and pundits to account, did not even mentions these points. Nor did he inform his viewers that Murphy advises Bush.

After “Republican” Joe Scarborough was at the the table for Todd’s inaugural show, Murphy was the “Republican” on the panel this week. It seems like the best way for a Republican to get on the program is to bash conservatives and volunteer to be the show’s “Brooklyn Brawler.” But as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told Todd earlier on the program, Americans on the left and the right loathe the permanent political class and the establishment press for being out of touch. Todd and his panel again proved Sanders right.
