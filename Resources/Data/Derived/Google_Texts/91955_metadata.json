However, its chairman, Rep. Matt Ramsey, on Thursday said the group will sum up what it has learned in a report rather than make an up-or-down recommendation before lawmakers return to the Capitol on Jan. 11.\n\nIn the meantime, gambling powerhouses aren\u2019t staying quiet. MGM Chairman and CEO Jim Murren teased interest in a downtown resort and casino at the panel\u2019s first meeting, adding that metro Atlanta could support a $1 billion project with restaurants and concerts for other entertainment options.\n\nMGM has 14 lobbyists prepared to continue making the company\u2019s pitch, a number that rivals other Capitol powerhouses. For instance, state records listed 15 lobbyists registered on behalf of the utility Georgia Power and named eight for the Georgia Chamber of Commerce.\n\nOther gambling firms have hired lobbyists ahead of the session. Records show three registered for the Boyd Gaming Corp., which runs 22 casinos in eight states including Louisiana and Mississippi. Penn National Gaming, with 27 casinos including several Mississippi properties, also has three registered lobbyists.\n\nOpponents of gambling expansion in Georgia, wary of gambling companies\u2019 clear preparations for 2016, are trying to reach members at home before the session begins. The conservative Faith and Freedom Coalition this month sent out flyers headlined \u201cStop the casino rip-off!\u201d to voters in several of the study committee members\u2019 districts, warning that crime, corruption and addiction will follow gambling expansion.\n\nGambling in Georgia is largely limited to a state-run lottery, and previous bids to permit casinos or horse racing have failed. Meanwhile, Georgians are traveling to casinos run by Indian tribes with compacts that limit commercial facilities in other Deep South states, pro-casino lawmakers say.\n\nTo the north, the Cherokee tribe in North Carolina opened its second casino this summer, located an hour closer to Atlanta gamblers. Florida and Seminole Tribe officials this week announced a new gambling deal, awaiting legislative approval, which would allow table games at the tribe\u2019s existing locations and limit commercial development. The Poarch Band of Creek Indians runs three casinos with electronic bingo machines in Alabama, where lawmakers rejected commercial expansion this year as a fix for the state\u2019s budget woes.\n\nDemand for Georgia\u2019s merit-based Hope Scholarship program has outpaced lottery funding in recent years, prompting casino supporters to suggest the facilities as a fix. Without casinos in Georgia, potential scholarship money is crossing the border, said Rep. Ron Stephens, a Savannah Republican sponsoring the casino bill.\n\nStephens\u2019 proposal would divide the state into districts. Stephens said last week that he\u2019s open to allowing two casinos in metro Atlanta and another four at each corner of the state to ward off competitors in other states.\n\nLawmakers seized an opportunity to consider gambling in the \u201cPreservation of the Hope Scholarship Program\u201d study committee meetings, without deeper study of other options, said Virginia Galloway with the Faith and Freedom Coalition.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of misinformation that could come out from supporters with large budgets,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people don\u2019t even know this committee is meeting. They don\u2019t know by the name what it\u2019s about.\u201d\n\nSupporters\u2019 odds of winning gambling expansion this year remain unclear. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal has told reporters he\u2019s concerned the state lottery will lose revenue and has suggested a higher tax rate is necessary for him to reconsider.\n\nStephens\u2019 existing bill would tax 12 percent of gross gambling revenue, with at least 90 percent of the total going toward educational programs including Hope Scholarships. Stephens said last week he\u2019s open to that conversation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/114064/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/facebook_share_images/gainesville/020216thetimesogimgoptimzed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "ATLANTA \u2014 The start of Georgia\u2019s legislative session is weeks away, but supporters and opponents of a proposal to allow casinos throughout the state are already battling for lawmakers\u2019 attention.", "title": "Casino supporters, opponents prepare for 2016 debate"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Casino supporters, opponents prepare for 2016 debate"}, "article_summary": "A study committee met three times this fall to hear testimony about the issue.\nOpponents of gambling expansion in Georgia, wary of gambling companies\u2019 clear preparations for 2016, are trying to reach members at home before the session begins.\nWithout casinos in Georgia, potential scholarship money is crossing the border, said Rep.
