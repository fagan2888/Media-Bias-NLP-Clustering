Let Us Count The Ways\n\nBy Paul E. Sax, MD\n\nGuest contributor\n\n\n\nEveryone hates mindless paperwork.\n\nBut certain types are particularly annoying, seemingly designed to send you screaming into the night, dragging a broken fax machine behind you as your brain explodes.\n\nToo strong? Take a look at this fax cover sheet I recently received about a patient who had been receiving IV antibiotics at home:\n\nTo get at the root of why this particular communication rankles so, let\u2019s do a close reading of the cover sheet \u2014 an explication, a detailed description of the prosody and narrative arc, to borrow some words from my English-major days.\n\nStarting at the top, working down:\n\nIt\u2019s from \u201cHealth Information Management\u201d: Even though names have changed a lot over the years \u2014 hardly anyone was named \u201cSophia\u201d or \u201cEmma\u201d back Even though names have changed a lot over the years \u2014 hardly anyone was named \u201cSophia\u201d or \u201cEmma\u201d back when I was a kid \u2014 it\u2019s highly unlikely that \u201cHealth Information Management\u201d is the name of the person who sent this handwritten note.\n\nIt\u2019s 5 pages. Pages 1 is this cover sheet. Pages 2, 3, and 4 are boilerplate documentation of what has already been done. And page #5 is a task that raises paperwork to a new level of torture \u2014 it asks for my signature in 4 ways: 1) Slow signature; 2) Fast signature; 3) Initials; 4) Printed name. That\u2019s a first for me, let\u2019s hope it\u2019s the last.\n\nPages 1 is this cover sheet. Pages 2, 3, and 4 are boilerplate documentation of what has already been done.

Look, the word has squiggly underlining \u2014 that means it must be really important. But one might wonder why it\u2019s so important when, as mentioned above, the care has already been given (and, for the record, the patient no longer needs their services, he\u2019s much improved). Could it be that that the definition of \u201curgent\u201d for this company differs quite substantially from a clinician\u2019s? To a clinician, examples of \u201curgent\u201d problems include a patient who is short of breath, or bleeding, or having chest pain. For this company, \u201curgent\u201d means \u201cwe want to be paid as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nNot just Urgent, but How do we know?

Clearly, they want me to stop whatever I\u2019m doing and sign the form \u2014 4 times \u2014 NOW . One company admitted they stamp all their forms \u201cSECOND REQUEST!!!\u201d \u2014 even first requests \u2014 as they found this made doctors respond more rapidly to their queries. Sneaky.\n\nSee above, for \u201curgent\u201d, though now they\u2019ve brought out the all-caps, along with the same squiggly underlining.

One company admitted they stamp all their forms \u2014 even first requests \u2014 as they found this made doctors respond more rapidly to their queries. Sneaky. This is all happening by fax. The fax machine is a virtually obsolete form of communication, soon to take its place besides dial phones, signal flags, and smoke signals. But not for home care companies \u2014 they love fax machines. They love them so much that the fax number doesn\u2019t just have the squiggly underlining, it also is BOLDED. I can just imagine the office where Health Information Management sits \u2014 wall-to-wall fax machines, each carefully monitored, and each shrill fax tone a thrilling announcement that a doctor\u2019s signed (4 times) order is incoming. What joy. (Small aside about fax machines: Over the telephone, \u201cSax\u201d sounds just like \u201cfax\u201d \u2014 which meant back in the heyday of fax machines in the 1990s, I received plenty of correspondence \u2014 even faxes \u2014 to a \u201cDr. Fax.\u201d)\n\nThe fax machine is a virtually obsolete form of communication, soon to take its place besides dial phones, signal flags, and smoke signals.

No stamps. No signatures from NPs or PAs. Nothing from residents. In case it\u2019s not clear, they\u2019ve done something very special with the word \u201cunable\u201d \u2014 the triple-whammy of ALL-CAPS, BOLD, and of course our friend the squiggly underline. Must be very important. But think about this for a moment: Can\u2019t residents write orders in the hospital? Prescribe medications to their outpatients? Do various procedures? And PAs and NPs do routine office visits, plus more complex tasks such as covering inpatient medical and surgical services, even performing colonoscopies. So residents, PAs and NPs can do these things \u2014 and do them well \u2014 but they can\u2019t sign these forms? Maybe the PA and NP curricula don\u2019t include the special class we MDs took on how to sign our name 4 different ways (slow, fast, initials, and print). And that special class isn\u2019t given to just any MD \u2014 just those who are board-certified, credentialed, and have completed their post-graduate training. I\u2019d go so far as to say that our ability to sign these forms (4 times) is the true meaning of working to the highest level of our esteemed MD degrees.\n\nOK, I\u2019ll stop now.\n\nThis post first appeared on the NEJM Journal Watch blog HIV and ID Observations here, under the headline \u201cA Detailed Analysis of Paperwork, and the Special Power of the MD Degree.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An infectious disease doctor decries some of the worst of medical paperwork, including the still-rampant requisite use of the fax machine.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "An infectious disease doctor decries some of the worst of medical paperwork, including the still-rampant requisite use of the fax machine.", "title": "How Do Doctors Hate Paperwork?
