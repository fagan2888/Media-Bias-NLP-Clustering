These Catholic Members Of Congress Disagree. CREDIT: AP Photos/Graphic by Patrick Smith Clockwise from top left: Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Rep. John Boehner (R-OH), Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R-ME), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Rep. Steve King (R-IA) , Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC), and Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-PA).\n\nSince elected to the papacy, Pope Francis has seemed to drive a wedge between American conservatives and the Catholic Church. On Thursday, he drove that wedge just a bit deeper, by acknowledging that climate change is mostly man\u2019s fault.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it is all [man\u2019s fault] but the majority is, for the most part, it is man who continuously slaps down nature,\u201d Francis told reporters. \u201cWe have in a sense taken over nature.\u201d\n\nPope Francis has long advocated for protection of the environment and climate, but Thursday\u2019s comments mark the first time the Pope has acknowledged humans\u2019 role in causing global warming. His theological justification for both environment and climate action has been that respect for the \u201cbeauty of nature and the grandeur of the cosmos\u201d is a Christian value. Later this year, Francis is expected to tell the planet\u2019s 1.2 billion Catholics why acting on climate change is essential to the faith using an influential church document called an encyclical.\n\nThough the vast majority of climate scientists agree with the Pope on this point, many members of Congress \u2014 169 members, to be exact, \u2014 are on record denying the science of human-caused climate change. Thirty-five of those members of Congress are self-identifying Catholics, 12 of whom have used the tenets of Catholicism to justify certain policy positions.\n\nThinkProgress has compiled a list of those 12 Catholic members of Congress who cite their religion as part of their political ideology, and are also on record denying climate change. We reached out to all of them to see if the Pope\u2019s words might change their minds. No one has responded yet, but we\u2019ll update if anyone does. That list is below.\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R-WI-01)\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Steve Helber\n\nPaul Ryan is perhaps the most well-known Catholic conservative in Congress, if only because of the times he used his faith to justify proposed economic policies that he has said would benefit the poor.\n\nIndeed, Ryan\u2019s personal politics have often intersected with his Catholicism. In an interview with The Brody File, Ryan said the Catholic principle of \u201csubsidiarity\u201d guided his thought process while he was crafting his budget. He\u2019s cited his faith as a need to push comprehensive immigration reform, telling Rep. Luis Gutierrez, \u201cYou\u2019re a Catholic; I\u2019m a Catholic; we cannot have a permanent underclass of Americans exploited in America.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to climate change, Ryan disagrees with the head of the Catholic church. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that question,\u201d Ryan said this past October when asked whether climate change was real and caused by humans. \u201cI don\u2019t think science does, either.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRep. Alex Mooney (R-WV-02)\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Chris Tilley, File\n\nAfter being endorsed by CatholicVote.org in April 2014, Alex Mooney said he has \u201ca proven record of voting for traditional values,\u201d and would \u201ccontinue to be the most adamant fighter for life and traditional West Virginian values in Congress.\u201d Mooney also said in 2007 that, as a Catholic, \u201cI do what I do because I think it\u2019s what God wants me to do with my life.\u201d\n\nBut if Pope Francis wants Catholics to act on climate change, it\u2019s not clear that Mooney would follow suit. Mooney said in July that he didn\u2019t think climate change was a settled debate among scientists. ThinkProgress reached out to Monney\u2019s office but hasn\u2019t gotten a response.\n\nRep. John Boehner (R-OH-08)\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner seems to identify deeply with his Catholic faith. In fact, in an interview with Seminarian Casual, a blog written by the St. Charles seminarians, Boehner said his Catholicism is the biggest reason why he decided to run for public office. To quote the Speaker, \u201cThe idea of running for the U.S. House was tugging at me, but I kept asking myself \u2014 do you really want to do this?\u201d he remembered. \u201cUltimately I decided God wanted me to do it, and I was in.\u201d\n\nIn that same interview, Boehner also noted that his faith helps dictate some of his conservative political views. \u201cThe notion that a large, ever-growing federal government should be or can ever be the moral center of our society is at odds not just with what I and most of my constituents believe, but also with what the Church teaches,\u201d he said.\n\nThe current head of that church, Pope Francis, is expected to teach Catholics to act on climate change. But Boehner\u2019s remarks on the subject don\u2019t hint that it\u2019s a teaching he\u2019ll likely follow \u2014 he\u2019s called the science that states carbon dioxide is harmful \u201calmost comical.\u201d More recently, he has refused to acknowledge climate change\u2019s existence, saying multiple times that he is not qualified to \u201cdebate the science.\u201d Boehner\u2019s office did not return ThinkProgress\u2019 request for comment.\n\nRep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC-05)\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Mary Ann Chastain, Pool\n\nMick Mulvaney touts himself as a devout Catholic. He graduated from a Catholic high school, is a member of St. Philip Neri Catholic Church, and helped found the Our Lady of Grace Catholic Mission.\n\nHe has also used his faith to support religious exemptions to the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWhile religious liberties are something that mean a great deal to me as a Catholic,\u201d he wrote last October, \u201cI suppose I have always focused on the exercise of my beliefs in a very \u2018domestic\u2019 setting (the Health and Human Services rules regarding religious exceptions to certain mandates within Obamacare come immediately to mind).\u201d\n\nDespite Mulvaney\u2019s Catholic roots, however, his comments on climate change so far aren\u2019t in line with the Pope\u2019s. On climate change, Mulvaney stated on his campaign website in 2010 that, though energy independence and renewable energy are worthy goals, the U.S. \u201cshouldn\u2019t seek to accomplish that by taxing people based on questionable science. Neither should we ignore domestic energy resources \u2014 coal, natural gas, oil \u2014 because of baseless claims regarding global warming.\u201d\n\nThinkProgress contacted Mulvaney\u2019s office to get his thoughts on Pope Francis\u2019 comments, but hasn\u2019t yet gotten a response.\n\nSen. Patrick Toomey (R-PA)\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite\n\nIn 2013, Patrick Toomey said that his policy views are directly influenced by his faith. \u201cAs a Catholic lawmaker,\u201d he said, \u201cI take the fundamental principles that the faith provides and view policy through that lens.\u201d He opposes the contraception coverage requirement under the Affordable Care Act (but \u201cnot because I\u2019m a Catholic. I really think that any American should be outraged when the federal government decides that it has the power to force a religious institution to violate a deeply held religious conviction\u201d) and is pro-life.\n\nUnlike the Pope, Toomey has not been definitive when it comes to climate change. He said in 2010 that, though he does accept that the Earth\u2019s temperature has been going up over the last century, \u201cthe extent to which that has been caused by human activity I think is not as clear. I think that is still very much disputed and has been debated.\u201d ThinkProgress reached out to Toomey\u2019s office but has yet to receive a response.\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK)\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Ted S. Warren\n\nAlaska\u2019s new Senator Dan Sullivan is a lifelong Irish Catholic who has cited his faith as one reason for his pro-life stance. Case-in-point: in an interview in 2014, Sullivan said that he\u2019s \u201ca lifelong Catholic who is staunchly pro-life.\u201d\n\nSullivan also said last year that he thinks \u201cthe jury\u2019s out on climate change\u201d and that he is not convinced that climate change is caused by human actions. No word on whether he\u2019ll change that view now that Pope Francis has said he is convinced \u2014 Sullivan\u2019s office has not yet responded to ThinkProgress\u2019 request for comment.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite\n\nMarco Rubio\u2019s Catholicism is complicated. He is, according to his spokesperson, a \u201cpracticing and devout Roman Catholic\u201d who \u201cregularly attends Catholic Mass\u201d and \u201cwas baptized, confirmed and married in the Roman Catholic Church.\u201d But he has also been associated with other faiths. He was first baptized Catholic, but then baptized Mormon. Later, he attended a Baptist church, and reportedly worshiped regularly at an evangelical mega-church. Now, he identifies again as Catholic.\n\nHe has outwardly disagreed with the Pope before, specifically when it came to Pope Francis\u2019 role in helping President Obama normalize relations with Cuba. Rubio said he would \u201cask His Holiness to take up the cause of freedom and democracy.\u201d\n\nNow, it seems he disagrees with the Pope again on climate. \u201cI do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying,\u201d Rubio said back in May. \u201cAnd I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy.\u201d ThinkProgress hasn\u2019t yet heard back from Rubio\u2019s office for a response to the Pope\u2019s comments.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ-04)\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Cliff Owen\n\nArizona\u2019s Paul Gosar has used his Catholicism to justify some of his policy positions, particularly his anti-abortion stance. Explaining his reasoning for co-sponsoring a bill that would make it illegal for physicians to perform an abortion when they know the abortion is being sought because of the race or gender of the child, he said that \u201cas a Catholic and a father of three wonderful children, it is clear to me that protecting innocent lives is the right thing to do.\u201d Gosar also used Catholicism to justify his opposition to the contraception coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act, saying that \u201cas a Catholic, a father and a strong supporter of our nation\u2019s Constitution, I believe that no person, company or educational institution should be forced into compromising their religious values because Big Government has decided it knows best.\u201d\n\nGosar\u2019s thinking on climate change, however, is out of line with the head of the Catholic church. In 2012, he said that climate change \u201cis likely not in our control in any event. Historical records clearly demonstrate vast temperature swings long before Man arrived, from temperate zones in Alaska to ice ages in New York.\u201d\n\nGosar\u2019s office hasn\u2019t returned ThinkProgress\u2019 request for comment.\n\nRep. Steve King (R-IA-04)\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Justin Hayworth\n\nKing has always identified as a Catholic, but has not always been in line with what would be considered Catholic values. Catholic leaders were not happy with the congressman when he said that undocumented youth were drug mules, a statement which one bishop said \u201cundermines their human dignity and the respect owed them as children of God.\u201d King has also said that he \u201cwould hope that our pope will promote the sacred value of human life \u2026 and also promote the sanctity of marriage.\u201d\n\nKing also hasn\u2019t historically agreed with the Pope on climate change. King said in 2013 that the earth\u2019s warming trend \u201cis not proven, it\u2019s not science. It\u2019s more of a religion than a science.\u201d ThinkProgress hasn\u2019t yet heard back from King\u2019s office in response to a request for comment.\n\nRep. Steve Scalise (R-LA-01)\n\nCREDIT: AP\n\nSteve Scalise recently used his Catholicism to defend himself against accusations that he appeared at an event for white supremacists in 2002. \u201cAs a Catholic, I think some of the things they profess target people like me. At lot of their views run contradictory to the way I run my life,\u201d he told The Times-Picayune.\n\nIn contrast to the Pope\u2019s views, Scalise also seems to think global warming is a conspiracy, saying last year that \u201cthirty years ago liberals were using global cooling to push new radical regulations. Then they shifted their focus to global warming in an effort to prop up wave after wave of job-killing regulations that are leading to skyrocketing food and energy costs.\u201d\n\nThinkProgress hasn\u2019t heard back from Scalise\u2019s office for a response to the Pope\u2019s comments.\n\nRep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC-05)\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Charles Dharapak\n\nUnlike her other climate-denying Catholic colleagues, Virginia Foxx\u2019s position on climate change actually intersects with her faith. A staunch Catholic, Foxx has said that it\u2019s silly to believe that humans have an impact on the climate, because the climate is God\u2019s creation. Climate hawks, she said, \u201cthink that we, human beings, have more impact on the climate and the world than God does.\u201d\n\nHer position is similar to Rush Limbaugh\u2019s, who has said that \u201cif you believe in God, then intellectually you cannot believe in man-made global warming \u2026 You must be either agnostic or atheistic to believe that man controls something that he can\u2019t create.\u201d\n\nNo word yet on whether Foxx subscribes to the theology of Limbaugh or Pope Francis \u2014 she has not yet responded to ThinkProgress\u2019 request for comment.\n\nRep. Bruce Poliquin (R-ME-02)\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty\n\nIn his own words, Bruce Poliquin says he was raised in \u201ca traditional Franco-American Catholic home in Central Maine\u201d where cherished values were \u201cclose family, religious freedom, independence, and hard work.\u201d Those values seem to have seeped in to his policy somewhat: Poliquin defended his anti-same-sex marriage views to the Bangor Daily News by saying that \u201cI\u2019m Catholic and believe in traditional marriage.\u201d\n\nPoliquin isn\u2019t as convinced as Pope Francis that humans are contributing to climate change. He said in 2010 that \u201cclearly our climate is changing; the question is, is man responsible for that climate change? I personally am suspect.\u201d Poliquin\u2019s office has not returned ThinkProgress\u2019 request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "ThinkProgress has compiled a list of the twelve Catholic members of Congress who cite their religion as part of their political ideology, and are also on record denying climate change.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "ThinkProgress has compiled a list of the twelve Catholic members of Congress who cite their religion as part of their political ideology, and are also on record denying climate change.", "title": "Pope Francis Says Humans Cause Climate Change.
