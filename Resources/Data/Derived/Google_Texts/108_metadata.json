The implication of his argument is you should too.\n\nHe admits right off the bat that his friends and close relatives, including his famous brothers (Rahm and Ari, one the mayor of Chicago, the other arguably the mayor of Hollywood entertainment industry) and his parents, think either the idea is crazy or he is crazy.\n\nBut Zeke is serious. This is how he argues living older than 75 is bad:\n\n\u201cLiving too long is also a loss. It renders many of us, if not disabled, then faltering and declining, a state that may not be worse than death but is nonetheless deprived. It robs us of our creativity and ability to contribute to work, society, the world. It transforms how people experience us, relate to us, and, most important, remember us. We are no longer remembered as vibrant and engaged but as feeble, ineffectual, even pathetic.\u201d\n\nThis is reminiscent of the former Governor of Colorado, Richard Lamm, who thirty years ago shocked the nation by telling a medical conference that the old have a duty to die. \u201dYou\u2019ve got a duty to die and get out of the way,\u201d Lamm said in 1984. \u201dLet the other society, our kids, build a reasonable life.\u201d It should be noted Dick Lamm is still among us at age 79, and that he never gave a specific age at which a person\u2019s \u201cduty to die\u201d should occur.\n\nBut Zeke Emanuel\u2019s neo-duty-to-die declaration is much more dangerous than Lamm\u2019s three decades ago. Lamm was not in charge in fundamentally transforming the American health care system. Emanuel was, and he did. We now have a system of health care that reflects his fundamental beliefs about how much health care resources should go to the young and how much to the old.\n\nIf you think Emanuel\u2019s design of Obamacare is going to apportion health care resources to the sick at whatever age the patient may be, I\u2019ve got a bridge to sell you.\n\nZeke Emanuel\u2019s beliefs about how long a person should live, and what should or shouldn\u2019t be done to extend life beyond a certain number of years\u201375!\u2013will be reflected in the way Obamacare takes care of those who are on the good side of seventy five years and those who are on the other side of seventy five.\n\nFrankly, I don\u2019t care if Emanuel wants to go at three quarters of a century, more or less.\n\nWhat I worry about is that this kind of thinking permeates the medical system in this country that is largely of his design. It\u2019s none of his business how long you live, or I live. It\u2019s none of his business how long either you or I want to live. As a medical professional it\u2019s his job to keep us alive (\u201cFirst, do no harm\u201d\u2013Hippocrates).\n\nObviously, there are end-stages of life in which heroic efforts to prolong life a few days or weeks or even months are futile. I am not arguing that huge dollars of medical resources should be spent pushing life a short distance farther.\n\nEmanuel concludes his argument with this:\n\n\u201cI am talking about how long I want to live and the kind and amount of health care I will consent to after 75. Americans seem to be obsessed with exercising, doing mental puzzles, consuming various juice and protein concoctions, sticking to strict diets, and popping vitamins and supplements, all in a valiant effort to cheat death and prolong life as long as possible. This has become so pervasive that it now defines a cultural type: what I call the American immortal.\n\nI reject this aspiration. I think this manic desperation to endlessly extend life is misguided and potentially destructive. For many reasons, 75 is a pretty good age to aim to stop.\u201d\n\nWhat is troubling about this is not Emanuel\u2019s personal decision, foolish though it may be. After all, in this article he talks about his parents well past his cut off age who are physically fine (though slowing down) and have all their marbles.\n\nThe disquieting aspect of Emanuel\u2019s argument is who he is. As one of the primary designers of the basics of Obamacare one has to take his argument seriously as one of the basic tenets of the nation\u2019s fundamentally transformed healthcare system. It is already showing up in news reports.\n\nDeath Panels anyone?\n\nAhhhh\u2026 Sarah Palin. Condemned and mocked when she said it five years ago, now some are noting those two words could be her greatest legacy.\n\nAnd in a weird and certainly unintended way, Zeke Emanuel, Mr. Obamacare, just confirmed it.", "article_metadata": {"prism.channel": "fnc", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "FOX News Radio", "description": "by John Gibson\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter, Like us on Facebook, and listen LIVE on the FoxNewsTalk App\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Ezekiel Emanuel, one of the primary medical professionals who shaped Obamacare, writes in the current Atlantic Magazine that he wants to die at 75.
