SALVADOR, Brazil (AP) — Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer says playing a team of Portugal’s caliber and featuring a star of Cristiano Ronaldo’s class gives their World Cup group opener an elevated status.

Neuer told a news conference Sunday, “After that match, we will really know where we stand.”

Monday’s Group G encounter is a rematch of the Euro 2012 opener, when Germany beat Portugal 1-0.

Three points in this match will go a long way toward helping the winner advance from a group that also contains Ghana and the United States.

Neuer, feeling upbeat after recovering from a shoulder injury, says “In a way, it’s almost like a final.”

Despite lingering knee problems, Ronaldo is likely to play. Neuer says “If he is fit, he will be the top danger for our team.”
