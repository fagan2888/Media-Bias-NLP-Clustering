Under a \u201cclosed rule,\u201d though, not one was considered.\n\nUnder a \u201cclosed rule,\u201d the Rules Committee\u2014the body responsible for determining when and if legislation and amendments come up for a vote\u2014decided to move the legislation forward on its own and without amendments.\n\nConsidered an informal arm of House leadership, the Rule Committee regularly takes its marching orders from the speaker\u2019s office.\n\nRyan told Politico the move was \u201cdefinitely outside of the realm of regular order\u201d but necessary. So far, conservative House members have not challenged the new speaker on the decision.\n\nThe refugee screening legislation represents a significant Republican victory and reflects a reinvigorated House. The bill passed 289-137, with enough bipartisan support to overcome President Obama\u2019s promised veto.\n\nOne of the most significant amendments not considered was a proposal by Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, to place a six-month moratorium on refugee immigration. Fourteen lawmakers joined as cosponsors.\n\nA supporter of that measure, Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Babin\u2019s amendment didn\u2019t get a vote but pleased that the House \u201cpassed a monumental piece of legislation.\u201d\n\nA board member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republican lawmakers, Duncan told The Daily Signal that although leadership under Ryan moved quickly to bring the bill to a vote, they were \u201cvery inclusive\u201d of and \u201cvery responsive\u201d to members\u2019 concerns.\n\n\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened if Paul didn\u2019t get engaged in this early on,\u201d Duncan said of Ryan. \u201cHe created a task force over the weekend [of the Paris attacks]. He showed some real leadership.\u201d\n\nAlthough the bill bypassed committee markup and came to a vote without amendments, leadership posted the legislation for review three days before Thursday\u2019s vote.\n\nAsked about the process, Rep. John Fleming, R-La., told The Daily Signal that \u201cof course this is not regular order.\u201d However, Fleming noted that the process looked very different from how it would have a month ago under Ryan\u2019s predecessor, Speaker John Boehner of Ohio.\n\n\u201cWe are taking a different approach than Boehner would. Boehner would come up with an idea and twist our arms to pass it,\u201d Fleming said.\n\nRyan also deployed his staff in a secondary, supporting role during the drafting process. Unlike Boehner, he invited individual members and recruited committee leaders to give their input.\n\nRep. Dave Brat, R-Va., said Ryan\u2019s suspension of regular order is far from the new norm. Brat told The Daily Signal that Congress had to move swiftly to address a pressing matter of \u201cnational security\u201d after the Nov. 13 terrorist attack in Paris.\n\n\u201cThey did a closed rule because if they opened it up, we wouldn\u2019t have been done before recess,\u201d Brat said.\n\nBrat said the bill is a \u201cfirst step\u201d toward greater reform, and leadership already has \u201cgiven assurances\u201d the Babin amendment on a refugee moratorium will be allowed to come up for a vote during the appropriations process.\n\nMore proposed reforms of how the nation handles refugees are expected during the budget battle in December.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of us that want to see limitations on refugee resettlement programs,\u201d Duncan told The Daily Signal. \u201cWith regard to funding in the omnibus [budget bill], we\u2019re going to push for that.\u201d\n\nThe South Carolina Republican said members \u201calready had conversations with leadership\u201d about other reforms.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative House members say they credit the new speaker for keeping the process open when time was short\u2014and for setting the stage for future reforms.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservative House members say they credit the new speaker for keeping the process open when time was short\u2014and for setting the stage for future reforms.", "title": "Why Conservatives Didn't Object to Ryan's Refugee Bill", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151123_PRHoneymoon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-23T18:51:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QEckC0"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservative House members say they credit the new speaker for keeping the process open when time was short\u2014and for setting the stage for future reforms.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151123_PRHoneymoon.jpg"}, "title": "Why Conservatives Didn't Object to Ryan's Refugee Bill", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-11-23T12:41:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-23T18:51:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Syrian Refugees, Refugee Bill, Speaker Paul Ryan, House Freedom Caucus"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere are a lot of us that want to see limitations on refugee resettlement programs,\u201d Duncan told The Daily Signal.\nConsidered an informal arm of House leadership, the Rule Committee regularly takes its marching orders from the speaker\u2019s office.\nSo far, conservative House members have not challenged the new speaker on the decision.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s honeymoon with many conservatives continues despite his decision to block amendments to legislation tightening screening standards for Syrian refugees.\nBrat told The Daily Signal that Congress had to move swiftly to address a pressing matter of \u201cnational security\u201d after the Nov. 13 terrorist attack in Paris."}
