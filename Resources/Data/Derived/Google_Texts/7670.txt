As someone who fought hard to help get President Barack Obama elected, and later worked to defend Obamacare, I saw firsthand how frustrating it was for the volunteers who helped get Obama elected to see Democrats take votes to undermine the implementation of Obamacare. Our former Congressman, Brad Schneider, supported some of those Republican attempts to undermine Obamacare. I am proud to see the candidate I support, Nancy Rotering, taking a stand against political attempts by Republicans to tear down the Affordable Care Act.

In fact, the Administration released a statement regarding specific legislation H.R. 2575 saying, "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2575 ... Moreover, the proposed change would reduce the number of people receiving employer-based coverage by about one million, while increasing the number of uninsured â€¦ If the President were presented with H.R. 2575, he would veto it."

We need a strong advocate in office who will fight to protect access to health care. That is among the many reasons I support Nancy Rotering for U.S. Congress.
