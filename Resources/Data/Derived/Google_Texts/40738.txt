To cap his breakout season with the Broncos, running back C.J. Anderson was named to the Pro Bowl in place of Pittsburgh’s Le’Veon Bell (knee injury), the NFL informed the team Monday.

Anderson played 15 games for the Broncos last season and totaled 849 rushing yards with eight touchdowns on 179 carries (4.7 avg.), and ahd 34 receptions for 324 yards (9.5 avg.) with two touchdowns.

The second-year player who signed with the Broncos as an undrafted free agent in 2013 led the league in yards from scrimmage (709) in November and tied the league-best in touchdowns (seven) in December.

The addition of Anderson gives the Broncos 11 players in the Pro Bowl this year and makes him the first Broncos running back selected since Willis McGahee in 2011. Receiver Emmanuel Sanders was also named to the Pro Bowl, in place of Julio Jones, while Peyton Manning and Demaryius Thomas both withdrew because of injury.
