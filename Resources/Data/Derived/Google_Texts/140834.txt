ARLINGTON, Texas — Wes Welker was cleared to fly with the Broncos for their final preseason game against the Dallas Cowboys.

Welker has not yet been medically cleared from his concussion to engage in contact, so he won’t play in the game Thursday night at AT&T Stadium. Then again, none of the Broncos’ other projected opening-day starters will play against the Cowboys.

The slot receiver’s recovery, though, is encouraging. He was seen joining the Broncos’ offense in the team’s weightlifting and exercise facility Tuesday and was able to travel Wednesday.

The Broncos open their season Sept. 7 against the Indianapolis Colts at Sports Authority Field at Mile High — 15 days after Welker suffered his concussion.

Welker caught a 9-yard pass across the middle with seconds to play in the first half of the Broncos’ preseason game Saturday against Houston. Immediately after catching the ball, Welker took a blow to helmet by Houston safety D.J. Swearinger, who received a 15-yard penalty for unnecessary roughness.

Welker walked into the locker room under his own power. It was his third concussion in less than 10 months.

After he suffered his first concussion against Kansas City on Nov. 17, Welker returned the next week. After he suffered another concussion in a game Dec.8 against Tennessee, Welker sat out the final three games of the season.

He returned with a more padded, eggshell-type helmet and caught 18 passes in three postseason games. Welker, 33, was wearing the concussion helmet when he was hit Saturday by Swearinger.

Welker’s 841 catches rank 24th on the NFL’s all-time receptions list. An additional 80 catches would move him past the likes of No. 22 Rod Smith and No. 15 Torry Holt, among others.
