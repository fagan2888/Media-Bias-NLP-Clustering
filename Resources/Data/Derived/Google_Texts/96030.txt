Walnut Hill Medical Center

Among the newest hospitals in greater Dallas is not a replacement or a new outpost of an established health system, but a new for-profit, independently-owned facility spearheaded by physicians and designed with ideas from leading consumer companies like Apple and Ritz Carlton. This spring, the the 100-bed Wall Hill Medical Center opened just across the road from Texas Health Resources’ 898-bed Presbyterian Hospital. The hospital features all-private rooms with 42-inch plasma screen televisions as well as ample natural light (including ICU rooms), complimentary valet parking, iPads and free Wi-Fi, a bistro where clinicians are encouraged to dine with patients and families, a Starbucks, a movie theatre (largely for the kids) and 100 pieces of original artwork, commissioned by the hospital. There are also guiding policies borrowed from the hospitality industry, like the Ritz Carlton’s “15-5” rule for staff to smile at patients from 15 feet away and greet them at five feet. “What drew me was the ability to create a culture all our own,” Walnut Hill CEO Cory Countryman said. “There’s no hangover culture from a hospital that’s been around for 40 years. We had that luxury.”
