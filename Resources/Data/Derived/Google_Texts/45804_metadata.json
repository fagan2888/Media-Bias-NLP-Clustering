But the date falls within the 120-day period by which Botox-maker Allergan had to call the meeting after receiving requests from those holding 31% of the company\u2019s shares. Valeant needed 25% of shares to call for the meeting.\n\nValeant and William Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Management, an activist investor in Allergan, are pushing for a $53 billion merger. The shareholder vote would pave the way for such a merger.\n\nAllergan plans to hold a board meeting on Sept. 4 to decide whether the meeting request is valid and follows company bylaws. Further, Allergan holds out hope that a federal judge might put an injunction on the meeting until it is determined whether Valeant and Ackman violated securities laws by collaborating to buy shares in preparation for Valeant\u2019s bid. Ackman now holds 9.7% of Allergan.\n\nAllergan was up marginally at the close to $163.97, while Valeant climbed 1.4% to $117.10.\n\nFollow @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:\n\nObamacare may take the blame for baseball\u2019s \u2018tarp game\u2019\n\nObama tries to shift birth control burden from faith groups to insurers\n\nThe bio-pharma players that could benefit from ALS dunkings", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-08-26T16:51:03-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Allergan Inc. tentatively sets a date for a special meeting of shareholders to decide whether the company's board should be fired and control awarded to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc", "title": "Allergan sets Dec. 18 meeting date for shareholders on Valeant merger", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/26/allergan-sets-dec-18-meeting-date-for-shareholders-on-valeant-merger/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CP930_allerg_MG_20140811112636.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Allergan Inc.,health care,mergers and acquisitions,pharmaceuticals,Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.", "article.headline": "Allergan sets Dec. 18 meeting date for shareholders on Valeant merger", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Allergan Inc.,health care,mergers and acquisitions,pharmaceuticals,Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Allergan Inc. tentatively sets a date for a special meeting of shareholders to decide whether the company's board should be fired and control awarded to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc", "article.published": "2014-08-26T16:51:03-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/26/allergan-sets-dec-18-meeting-date-for-shareholders-on-valeant-merger/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Allergan Inc. tentatively sets a date for a special meeting of shareholders to decide whether the company's board should be fired and control awarded to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc", "title": "Allergan sets Dec. 18 meeting date for shareholders on Valeant merger", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/26/allergan-sets-dec-18-meeting-date-for-shareholders-on-valeant-merger/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CP930_allerg_MG_20140811112636.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-3020", "article.updated": "2014-08-26T16:51:03-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb909\"", "article_summary": "Allergan plans to hold a board meeting on Sept. 4 to decide whether the meeting request is valid and follows company bylaws.\nBut the date falls within the 120-day period by which Botox-maker Allergan had to call the meeting after receiving requests from those holding 31% of the company\u2019s shares.\nValeant and William Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Management, an activist investor in Allergan, are pushing for a $53 billion merger.\nValeant needed 25% of shares to call for the meeting.\nAllergan was up marginally at the close to $163.97, while Valeant climbed 1.4% to $117.10."}
