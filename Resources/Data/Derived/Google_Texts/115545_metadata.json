The Kauai County Council approved it on October 16 by an overwhelming six to one vote after a tortuous 19-hour-long hearing that went past 3 a.m. The hearing had been preceded by months of protests and debates on genetically modified crops and pesticides that set tempers flaring on the usually laid-back island. Then, 10 days after the council vote, much to the dismay of the bill\u2019s supporters, Mayor Bernard Carvahlo, who had been skeptical about the bill from the start, vetoed it.\n\nThe councilmembers will vote on the bill again today, this time to override the mayor\u2019s veto. The council needs five votes to override the mayor\u2019s veto. It could be a closer margin this time round, since Councilwoman Nadine Nakamura, who voted in favor of the bill last time, has stepped down and taken a job as the mayor\u2019s managing director.\n\nBill 2491 requires agricultural companies and farms to disclose the type and volume of pesticides they are spraying, as well as the location of the fields being sprayed. It also requires them to set up buffer zones between fields growing GM crops and public spaces like schools, hospitals, and parks. Companies have to notify the public before spraying pesticides.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day all we are asking for is disclosure of pesticides used and locations of GMO fields, not trade secrets or a total ban on GMOs,\u201d says Councilman Gary Hooser, who co-introduced the bill in June. \u201cAll we are trying to do is to protect the health of our community. Frankly, the mayor hasn\u2019t taken the time to understand the issue and he\u2019s surrounded by industry, who are some of the largest employers in the island.\u201d\n\nThe proposed legislation mostly affects the four big biotech companies \u2014 Dow, Syngenta, BASF, and DuPont-Pioneer \u2014 that have operations in Kauai and are heavy users of restricted-use pesticides. Together the companies occupy about 15,000 acres of Kauai\u2018s agricultural land. Some of this land is leased from the state and the rest from private owners. (The one local company that would be affected is Kauai Coffee Co.)\n\nThe biotech companies mainly grow seed corn on the island, which is Kauai\u2019s number one crop. But they also have trail plots where they test genetically modified seeds for pesticide resistance. Hawaii\u2019s warm climate allows for three corn crop harvests in a year, which makes it a perfect place to experiment with seeds.\n\nBill 2491 is the product of increasing concern among islanders about the health and environmental impact of the pesticides used at these trail plots and on the seed-corn fields. There has been special concern about the health impact of pesticides on children.\n\nFor example, students and teachers at Waimea Canyon Middle School, which is near a Syngenta field, complained of noxious odors on several occasions between 2006 and 2008. On one occasion, according to locals, the school had to be evacuated and some chidlren were sent to the hospital.\n\nThe volume of protests and demonstrations against pesticide use in Kauai has been on the rise.\n\nSome doctors say the region seems to have unusually high rates of asthma, cancer and birth defects. But so far there have been few studies investigating these allegations.\n\nIn 2011, residents of the west Kauai town of Waimea filed a suit against Pioneer Hi-Bred International, a DuPont affiliate, citing multiple violations of law in pesticide and land management of Pioneer\u2019s test corn fields upwind of residential homes and schools.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kauai island is debating bills that would require companies to disclose details about their use of pesticides", "title": "Hawaii: The new battleground for GMO regulation", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Kauai island is debating bills that would require companies to disclose details about their use of pesticides", "title": "Hawaii: The new battleground for GMO regulation", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/16/kauai_become_battleground_of_gmo_regulation_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/gmo_hawaii2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kauai island is debating bills that would require companies to disclose details about their use of pesticides", "title": "Hawaii: The new battleground for GMO regulation", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/gmo_hawaii2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Maureen Nandini Mitra", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Earth Island Journal, Environment, GMO, GMO regulation, Hawaii, Kauai", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b8f\"", "article_summary": "Following the recent demise of Washington State\u2019s GMO labeling initiative, Bill 2491 has turned Kauai into the latest battleground in the fight over genetically modified crops.\nBut they also have trail plots where they test genetically modified seeds for pesticide resistance.\nThere has been increasing concern among Kauai residents about the health and environmental impact of the pesticides used in GMO trail plots and on the seed-corn fields.\nThe hearing had been preceded by months of protests and debates on genetically modified crops and pesticides that set tempers flaring on the usually laid-back island.\nTopics: Earth Island Journal, Environment, GMO, GMO regulation, Hawaii, Kauai, News, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Earth Island JournalLawmakers in Kauai today will decide the fate of a hotly debated bill that would require agri-biotech companies to disclose details about the pesticides they are using as well as the genetically modified crops they are growing on the Hawai\u2018ian island."}
