Ako Abdul-Samad seems to be as ignorant as Al Sharpton was on how the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed [\u201cCandidates support restrictions on voting,\u201d Aug. 6]. He insists Republicans are out to suppress minority votes, but fails to mention the GOP voted yea 94 percent to 73 percent Democrat. Surely, in the interest of fairness, he would have included that fact. Similar stats apply to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nU.S. voter fraud is overwhelmingly a Democrat phenomenon, and Republicans have tried to fix what Obama and his former attorney general have allowed to proliferate. Read \u201cInjustice,\u201d by a Justice Department lawyer who resigned in protest.\n\nEarly voting has proven to be a mechanism for fraud and restricting it has the same effect on both parties. Likewise requirements for identification at the polls. But Samad, Obama, the Register editorial board and others aren\u2019t interested in fairness. If illegals were voting for Republicans, instead of free stuff, the left would be screaming for ID requirement. Which is no different than opening a checking account or buying a beer.\n\n\u2014 John Burns, West Des Moines\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1T32QlR", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Republicans have tried to fix what Obama, others have allowed to proliferate", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Republicans have tried to fix what Obama, others have allowed to proliferate", "title": "Voter fraud is a Democrat phenomenon", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/08/08/voter-fraud-democrat-phenomenon/31315367/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans have tried to fix what Obama, others have allowed to proliferate", "title": "Voter fraud is a Democrat phenomenon", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a032733674bb3242890ce22812214f6584dfa43c/c=300-0-1140-840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/07/DesMoines/B9318382028Z.1_20150807190959_000_GSLBID9E3.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Republican Party", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Republican Party", "title": "Voter fraud is a Democrat phenomenon", "author": "John Burns, West Des Moines", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e26cfb82badd8e84cd9db68bc780c54591f1861e/c=405-0-1035-840/local/-/media/2015/08/07/DesMoines/B9318382028Z.1_20150807190959_000_GSLBID9E3.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dac7d256a59f84940e502b66fdba9c9126e1eda5/c=300-0-1140-840/local/-/media/2015/08/07/DesMoines/B9318382028Z.1_20150807190959_000_GSLBID9E3.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ea01a6a00dbd2496de65f37025887b7eaa790f77/c=160-0-1280-840/local/-/media/2015/08/07/DesMoines/B9318382028Z.1_20150807190959_000_GSLBID9E3.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bd64435675ed77d92ee7226039c86a4975acbcd1/c=0-15-1440-825&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/07/DesMoines/B9318382028Z.1_20150807190959_000_GSLBID9E3.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-07T23:14:16.563000-05:00", "shorthed": "Voter fraud is a Democrat phenomenon", "articleid": 31315367, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf590beeec04e793cbf8e7ec6bbd1a1289afc9ba/c=0-15-1440-825/local/-/media/2015/08/07/DesMoines/B9318382028Z.1_20150807190959_000_GSLBID9E3.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a7e9250d0c4461d31b889d1561416dbe34fc853/c=484-0-956-840/local/-/media/2015/08/07/DesMoines/B9318382028Z.1_20150807190959_000_GSLBID9E3.1-0.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca50\"", "article_summary": "U.S. voter fraud is overwhelmingly a Democrat phenomenon, and Republicans have tried to fix what Obama and his former attorney general have allowed to proliferate.\nHe insists Republicans are out to suppress minority votes, but fails to mention the GOP voted yea 94 percent to 73 percent Democrat.\n(Photo: DesMoines)Democrat State Rep.
