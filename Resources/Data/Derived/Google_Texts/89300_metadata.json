The public response has been overwhelmingly negative [I tried but couldn\u2019t make the sentence long enough for all the criticism\u2026]. To put this simply enough that a Forest Service bureaucrat can understand it, the First Amendment doesn\u2019t allow the government to forbid speech in public places, to regulate the content of that speech, to subject speech to an arbitrary preclearance process, or to condition a government benefit on waiving the right to free speech. Somehow the Forest Service managed to do all of this in a single proposal.\n\nThe proposal would require a permit for any \u201ccommercial\u201d filming, which is broadly defined as any sound or video recording that could generate income and uses models, sets, or props. Say, for example, a nonprofit filmed a video in the forest that might generate donations [*cough* hint *cough*]:\n\nThis video would require Forest Service approval, even though the filming took place in a public place and had no adverse impact on the environment.\n\nThe regulation also prohibits unpermitted still photography if it uses models, sets, or props or causes any administrative inconvenience for the Forest Service (although it\u2019s not clear why the permit regime isn\u2019t itself an administrative inconvenience).\n\nNot only is the Forest Service prohibiting speech in public areas, it\u2019s limiting permits to only those pictures or videos that would have a \u201cprimary objective of dissemination of information about the use and enjoyment of wilderness or its ecological, geological, or other features of scientific, educational, scenic, or historical value.\u201d Or, as the Service\u2019s Wilderness Director put it: \u201cIf you were engaged on reporting that was in support of wilderness characteristics, that would be permitted.\u201d But if you\u2019re criticizing the Forest Service and its policy of excluding humans from the natural environment, as PLF has, you wouldn\u2019t be eligible.\n\nBut surely the Service wouldn\u2019t enforce the regulation this way, right? Unfortunately, the Service has been enforcing this regulation (or something like it) for the last four years, and has abused this power to control speech. For example, an Idaho Public Television crew approached the Service about filming a documentary on the anniversary of the Wilderness Act earlier this year. According to the general manager of the station:\n\n\u201cWe had to convince them [the Forest Service] our stories would be in keeping with their interpretation of the values of wilderness,\u201d said Ron Pisaneschi, general manager of Idaho Public Television. \u201cWe got the permits, but now we\u2019re saying, \u2018Enough.\u2019 That\u2019s not right. Our role is not to be a PR office for the Forest Service. It\u2019s to cover stories how we see fit.\u201d\n\nMaybe the regulation was unintentionally drafted too broadly, and the Service didn\u2019t mean to limit speech. But that\u2019s still a serious problem in an agency with more than 30,000 employess, some of whom will abuse this unnecessarily broad power to control criticism.\n\nIf, as the Forest Service claims, its concern is negative impacts on the environment, there\u2019s no reason for it to impose a costly and time-consuming permitting regime limiting speech. Rather, it should directly regulate impacts to the environment, and only require a permit for those activities with actual impacts. This proposal regulates speech qua speech on the off-chance that it might impact the environment.\n\nNor can the Forest Service defend its regulation on the grounds that it\u2019s merely imposing a condition on a benefit\u2014access to the nation\u2019s forests. The unconstitutional conditions doctrine forbids the government from using its power to give or withhold goodies to coerce people into giving up their constitutional rights. Just last term, the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional to require someone to endorse government policy as a condition of a benefit.\n\nBecause of the backlash, the Forest Service has slightly promised to back off of its unconstitutional proposal, but it hasn\u2019t gone nearly far enough.\n\nFirst, the Service has promised to respect the freedom of the press by exempting \u201cbreaking news\u201d from permitting. Setting aside the problem of giving Forest Service bureaucrats discretion to define \u201cbreaking news,\u201d this exemption fundamentally misunderstands the First Amendment. The First Amendment\u2019s guaranty of freedom of the press doesn\u2019t mean that \u201cthe press\u201d has any greater right to speak than ordinary citizens. We all have the same broad right to speak free of government interference. The freedom of the press means that the government can\u2019t limit who can have access to techologies to disseminate that speech whether that\u2019s the printing press (which dominated at the time of the founding), or blogs, Facebook, and Twitter today. A government agency\u2019s promise not to limit some privileged speakers\u2019 freedom of speech isn\u2019t consistent with the First Amendment.\n\nSecond, even if the Service limited its application of the regulation to true commercial activity, this wouldn\u2019t cure the First Amendment problem. Most obviously, this is because the First Amendment doesn\u2019t distinguish between commercial and noncommercial speech. Unfortunately, the courts have fallen asleep at the switch and allowed commercial speech to be regulated more easily since the 1940s. But that has always been a purely arbitrary and uninteligible doctrine. Or, as Ansel Adams\u2019 grandson explained:\n\n\u201cTough part is where do you draw the line on commercial activity,\u201d Matthew Adams wrote. \u201cIt seems pretty clear when a camera crew goes in to film a commercial, but does a free-lance writer or landscape photographer need a permit? Would Henry David Thoreau or Ralph Waldo Emerson or Ansel Adams need a permit? Seems ludicrous.\u201d\n\nThis profoundly unconstitutional law is open for comment until December 3, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PLF Liberty Blog - Donor-supported PLF (www.pacificlegal.org) is the leading watchdog organization that litigates, without charge, for limited government, property rights, individual rights, and a balanced approach to environmental regulations, in courts nationwide.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "PLF Liberty Blog", "description": "Last month, the Forest Service proposed a regulation that would require permits costing as much as $1500 to take photographs or film on Forest Service land.
