Smith had just sixteen more minutes of the Korean War to survive before the cease-fire came into effect at 10:00 p.m. You can imagine this twenty-one-year old marine from Illinois, out on combat patrol that evening, looking at his watch. Smith didn\u2019t have to be in Korea. He had already served his time in the Philippines. But he volunteered for the fight. He also didn\u2019t have to be on patrol that evening. But he offered to take the place of another guy who went out two nights before.\n\nSuddenly, Smith tripped a land mine and was fatally wounded. \u201cI was looking directly at him when I heard the pop and saw the flash,\u201d recalled a fellow marine. \u201cThe explosion was followed by a terrible scream that was heard probably a mile away.\u201d Another soldier said, \u201cI was preparing to fire a white star cluster to signal the armistice when his body was brought in.\u201d\n\nTwenty-two years later, on April 29, 1975, Lance Corporal Darwin Judge and Corporal Charles McMahon were marine guards near an air base outside Saigon in South Vietnam. Judge was an Iowa boy and a gifted woodworker. He once built a grandfather clock that still kept time decades later. His buddy, McMahon, from Woburn, Massachusetts, was a natural leader. \u201cHe loved the Marines as much as anybody I ever saw in the Marines,\u201d said one friend.\n\nThe two men had only been in South Vietnam for a few days. They were part of a small U.S. security force that remained after the main American withdrawal in 1973. McMahon and Judge arrived just in time for the military endgame, as North Vietnamese troops bore down on Saigon. McMahon mailed his mother a postcard: \u201cAfter this duty, they may send us home for a while\u2026. I\u2019ll try to write when I have time and don\u2019t worry Ma!!!!\u201d\n\nAt 4:00 a.m. on April 29, a Communist rocket struck Judge and McMahon\u2019s position and the two men died instantly. In the chaos of the final American exit from South Vietnam, with helicopters desperately rescuing people from rooftops, McMahon and Judge\u2019s bodies were accidentally left behind. It took months to negotiate their return.\n\nOn the early evening of November 14, 2011, Army Specialist David Hickman was traveling in an armored truck through Baghdad. Hickman, from North Carolina, had been in ninth grade when the Iraq War started in 2003. He was a natural athlete with a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. \u201cHe always seemed like Superman,\u201d said one of his friends.\n\nA massive explosion ripped into Hickman\u2019s truck. It was a roadside bomb\u2014the signature weapon of the Iraqi insurgents. Hickman was grievously wounded. The next day, just before midnight, the army visited Hickman\u2019s parents in North Carolina to tell them their son was dead.\n\nSmith, Judge, McMahon, and Hickman were the final American combat fatalities in Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq, respectively. An unknown soldier will have the same fate in Afghanistan. These men are the nation\u2019s last full measure of devotion. The final casualty in war is uniquely poignant. It highlights the individual human price of conflict. It represents the aggravated cruelty of near survival. It has all the random arbitrariness of a lottery. The Soviet-made 122 mm rocket that killed Judge and McMahon in 1975 was famously inaccurate. It could have landed anywhere in the vicinity. But it fell just a few feet from the marines. Sergeant Kevin Maloney found their bodies and wondered, \u201cWhy them and not me?\u201d\n\nThe closing casualty has particular resonance in a war without victory. Who could expect anyone to be the final soldier, as the saying went in Korea, to die for a tie? Or even worse, as former navy lieutenant John Kerry remarked during congressional testimony on Vietnam in 1971, \u201cHow do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?\u201d One of David Hickman\u2019s buddies said about Iraq, \u201cI\u2019m just sad, and pray that my best friend didn\u2019t lay down his life for nothing.\u201d\n\nMost of all, the final casualty underscores the value of ending a failing conflict. If we could have resolved the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq earlier\u2014even just a few minutes earlier\u2014 Smith, Judge, McMahon, and Hickman\u2019s lives would have been the first to be spared.\n\nAnd now we can imagine Smith, Judge, McMahon, and Hickman standing in three great lines of the American dead from these wars. Arranged single file in the order they fell in battle, the columns stretch back like solemn processions. As we conclude the violence a day earlier, a month earlier, or a year earlier, more and more of these men and women are spared.\n\nHow can we end a deteriorating war? Is it possible to withdraw from a stalemated or losing campaign without abandoning our interests or betraying our values? When military victory is no longer possible, can we escape with a draw or a minor failure rather than endure a complete debacle? In other words, is there a right way to lose a war?\n\nToday, these are critical questions because we live in an age of unwinnable wars, where decisive triumph has proved to be a pipe dream. Since 1945, the United States has suffered a string of military stalemates and defeats in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan.\n\nTime and again, in the face of a worsening campaign, Washington struggled to cut the nation\u2019s losses and find an honorable peace. Following battlefield failure, the United States groped for the exit like a man cast in darkness. We\u2019re good at getting in but bad at getting out. Or, as Barack Obama put it in 2014, \u201cI think Americans have learned that it\u2019s harder to end wars than it is to begin them.\u201d\n\nIn Korea, we spent two years negotiating a truce, even as brutal attritional fighting continued. In Vietnam, peace talks lasted for five years, with little to show for it. It took twenty-one days to capture Baghdad in 2003 and 3,174 days to leave Baghdad. We seized Kabul in November 2001 \u2014 and we\u2019re still there. The price for these failed exit strategies was paid in American lives, domestic discord, crippled presidencies, and devastation for the local people.\n\nIn an era when American wars usually end in regret, we need to think seriously about military failure: why it happens and what we can do about it.\n\nBut before we consider how to get out of a military quagmire, we need to understand why we get lured into the morass in the first place.\n\nThe Golden Age\n\nOn June 5, 1944, the eve of D-day, U.S. general George S. Patton strode onto a makeshift stage in southern England to address thousands of American soldiers. \u201cAmericans play to win all of the time,\u201d said Patton. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That\u2019s why Americans have never lost nor will ever lose a war, for the very idea of losing is hateful to an American.\u201d\n\nIt was the golden age of American warfare. Patton could look back on a century of U.S. victories in major wars. Victory means that Washington achieved its core aims with a favorable ratio of costs and benefits. Major war means an operation where the United States deployed over fifty thousand troops and there were at least one thousand battle deaths on all sides.\n\nThe golden age began in 1846, when the United States locked horns with Mexico. For eighteen months, the United States won battle after battle. In the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Washington paid $15 million to Mexico, and assumed several million dollars\u2019 worth of Mexican debts, in return for seizing about half of Mexico\u2019s territory and creating the modern American Southwest. Northern Whigs recoiled at the acquisitive U.S. objectives. But the Mexican-American War was popular with most Americans, especially Democrats in the South and West, who believed in the nation\u2019s Manifest Destiny to expand from sea to shining sea.\n\nTwo decades later, the Civil War was widely seen in the North as a heroic struggle for Union and emancipation, which saved, in Lincoln\u2019s words, \u201cthe last best hope of earth.\u201d13 The nation emerged through a hellfire of fratricidal slaughter to preserve the United States, in the words of a sergeant from Indiana, as \u201cthe beacon light of liberty & freedom to the human race.\u201d\n\nThe Spanish-American War of 1898 heralded the emergence of the United States as a new great power. The campaign was a wildly popular adventure where Washington brushed aside Spanish forces, freed Cuba from Madrid\u2019s grasp, and annexed Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. Theodore Roosevelt became a national celebrity after he charged up San Juan Heights accompanied by the Rough Riders and an embedded journalist. \u201cUp, up they went in the face of death, men dropping from the ranks at every step\u2026.Roosevelt sat erect on his horse, holding his sword and shouting for his men to follow him.\u201d\n\nNot every U.S. war in this era was a clear-cut triumph. Following the Spanish-American War, for example, the United States suppressed a nationalist insurgency in the Philippines at a high cost of over four thousand American dead, and over two hundred thousand Filipino civilian fatalities\u2014mostly from famine and disease related to the war. It was a harbinger of the darker era of warfare to come.\n\nBut the United States soon returned to the path of victory. The country was a late entrant into World War I, joining the fray in 1917, three years after the opening salvos. U.S. intervention proved decisive in breaking the stalemate and defeating Germany. When the armistice was finally reached in 1918, the United States was clothed in immense physical power and moral prestige.\n\nIn 1944, as Patton addressed the troops, the glorious era was about to reach its pinnacle. \u201cBy God,\u201d he said, looking ahead to D-day, \u201cI actually pity those poor sons of bitches we are going up against.\u201d World War II passed into history as the good war: a struggle of moral clarity and total commitment against the architects of the Holocaust. The campaign was a testament to the valor-studded splendor of American warfare.\n\nThe century from 1846 to 1945 was defined mainly by conventional interstate wars, where the United States fought enemy countries on a clear battlefield. Our army met their army, we won decisively, and then we imposed our terms. World War II epitomized America\u2019s talent for overwhelming opposing states with mass production, logistics, and technology. At its peak capacity, American industry churned out a new aircraft every five minutes and forty-five seconds. The atom bomb was the ultimate expression of American technological prowess. \u201cTo say that everything burned is not enough,\u201d recalled one witness at Nagasaki. \u201cIt seemed as if the earth itself emitted fire and smoke, flames that writhed up and erupted from underground.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "America used to win wars.
