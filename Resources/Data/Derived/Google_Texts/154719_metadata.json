Republicans are furious at what Harry Reid did. The atmosphere was pretty bad, anyway. This isn\u2019t really going to change anything, is it?\n\nCRUZ: Well, it\u2019s unfortunate. It\u2019s yet another abuse of power by the Democrats. And, frankly, it\u2019s continuing the same pattern we\u2019ve seen with Obamacare. It is a pattern of smoke and mirrors.\n\nHUNT: Will it complicate passing budgets or debt ceilings or anything?\n\nCRUZ: Of course it will. I mean, it will poison the atmosphere of the Senate, but, you know, it\u2019s also an illustration of the Democrats breaking their word. Just like President Obama said, if you like your plan, you can keep it. And he said it over and over again. We now know that at the time he said that, he knew it was false.\n\nFreshman Cruz was busy poisoning the atmosphere in the Senate on day one. In March, having been in the Senate for ten weeks, the brand new Senator told a Dallas paper that he was busy teaching veteran Republicans a thing or two. As if predicting Cruz\u2019s future, the reporter asked him how he would get things done after burning so many bridges.\n\nCruz took refuge in \u201cI can\u2019t control what they do\u201d answers and then pivoted.\n\nIn September, before Cruz shutdown the government and thereby ripped the last remaining shred of dignity from his fellow Republicans, the Republican Party has turned on Ted Cruz:\n\nNew York Republican Congressman Peter King: \u201cMy sound bite is to say he\u2019s a fraud\u2026I start with that, and then I go on. It takes me two or three minutes to explain it.\u201d Arizona Senator, and failed 2008 Republican Presidential Candidate, John McCain: \u201cI spoke to Senator Cruz about my dissatisfaction.\u201d I\u2019m going to go out a limb here and characterize the famously fiery McCain\u2019s paraphrase as the understatement of the month. McCain once publicly described his fellow lawmaker as a \u201cwacko bird.\u201d Anonymous GOP Aide: \u201cSome people came here to govern and make things better for their constituents. Ted Cruz came here to throw bombs and fundraise off of attacks on fellow Republicans. He\u2019s a joke, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nNo, Democrats didn\u2019t \u201cgrab\u201d any power by removing Ted Cruz\u2019s ability to fundraise for himself instead of doing the job our tax dollars pay for \u2014 and that is what he\u2019s really complaining about. Obama isn\u2019t \u201cstacking the courts\u201d by getting a vote on his nominees and it\u2019s hardly Democrats\u2019 fault that the five year Republican war on Obama and the nation finally backfired.\n\nTed Cruz shut down the government over ObamaCare, but he doesn\u2019t even have a suggestion or an idea for an alternative to ObamaCare. He is very, very good at blaming others for his actions though \u2014 to wit, pretending that it\u2019s Democrats who poisoned the atmosphere in the Senate, which was obstruction central but still polite\u2026\n\n\u2026 Until this year when an unstoppable id with a penchant for grifting blew in with his big mouth, closed mind and a gaping hole of endless, childish need.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) wailed about losing the ability to fundraise on the Senate floor,  saying that Harry Reid change to the filibuster rule will \"poison the atmosphere of the Senate.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) wailed about losing the ability to fundraise on the Senate floor,  saying that Harry Reid change to the filibuster rule will \"poison the atmosphere of the Senate.\"", "title": "The Audacity of Dope: Ted Cruz Claims Democrats Poisoned The Atmosphere of the Senate", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/11/24/shutdown-cruz-claims-democrats-poisoned-atmosphere-senate-filibuster-change.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ted-cruz.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-24T17:11:30+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-11-24T16:48:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-24T17:11:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7291\"", "article_summary": "Ted Cruz shut down the government over ObamaCare, but he doesn\u2019t even have a suggestion or an idea for an alternative to ObamaCare.\nTed Cruz came here to throw bombs and fundraise off of attacks on fellow Republicans.\nI mean, it will poison the atmosphere of the Senate, but, you know, it\u2019s also an illustration of the Democrats breaking their word.\nYes, as if Cruz\u2019s government shutdown that caused his own party to hate him even more didn\u2019t poison the atmosphere of the Senate.\nFreshman Cruz was busy poisoning the atmosphere in the Senate on day one."}
