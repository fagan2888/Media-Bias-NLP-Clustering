An 18-year-old Tampa woman was in critical condition and four others were injured after an early-morning crash involving three vehicles on the Selmon Expressway near the exit for U.S. 41, troopers said.

Just before l:30 a.m., a Nissan Ultima, driven by Makayla Harrell, 18, of Tampa, was stopped on the inside shoulder of the Selmon Expressway with a flat tire. A Toyota Scion, driven by Phillip Pereira De Souza, 25, of Tampa, struck the Nissan from behind, according to a release from the Florida Highway Patrol.

The Nissan was spun around by the impact and stopped in both eastbound lanes before it was struck again by a Honda CRV, driven by Christopher Kennedy, 25, of Palmetto.

Tyra Janelle Brown, one of two passengers in the Nissan, was taken to Tampa General Hospital in critical condition, troopers said.

De Souza was hospitalized with serious injuries, troopers said.

Harrell, her other passenger, 17-year-old Brittney Jackson, of Tampa, and Kennedy were all taken to the hospital with minor injuries.
