Gary Herbert in 2016 at the state GOP\u2019s annual convention Saturday and via social media accounts. Both Johnson and Herbert are Republicans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the worst kept secret in the state that I\u2019ve intended to run,\u201d Johnson told The Associated Press on Saturday, noting that he had spent the last year touring the state listening to would-be voters.\n\nJohnson enters a race against a popular sitting governor with approval ratings as a percentage of the population in the mid-to-high-70s who has already amassed $1.3 million to campaign, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.\n\nHerbert\u2019s campaign spokesman Marty Carpenter confirmed the amount and said the governor\u2019s approval ratings have been consistently between 68 and 76 percent.\n\n\u201cEconomically, things are going very well in our state,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong sense that Utah is doing far better than the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nJohnson called Herbert a \u201cfine manager\u201d Saturday but argued he can\u2019t take all the credit for the state\u2019s business growth pointing instead to entrepreneurs like him. As for approval ratings, he said much of it comes down to the way questions are phrased, like asking people if they like puppies versus asking if they\u2019d like to buy a puppy.\n\nJohnson said that despite Herbert\u2019s approval ratings he hears from people who are frustrated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that people think Utah can do better than it\u2019s doing today,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Utah businessman said he plans to focus on improving the state\u2019s education system, making Utah less reliant on federal funding and securing the transfer of federal lands to state control, something Johnson said Herbert has failed to do so far.\n\nFirst, though, Johnson said he wants to debate Herbert early and often.\n\nCarpenter said it\u2019s too early for talk of debates considering the filing deadline to run for governor isn\u2019t until March.\n\nHe said Herbert, elected in 2009 after serving five years as the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, has always debated opponents in the past. For now, he said Herbert is focused on governing.\n\nAs for the question of federal land transfers, Carpenter said Herbert has been a firm believer that Utah can manager its lands better than the federal government can and continues to work with federal lawmakers to make that happen. He said the governor\u2019s perspective is that there\u2019s really one shot to get it done right.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former CEO of Overstock.com announced on Saturday the start of a campaign to unseat Utah's sitting governor.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/15/former-overstockcom-ceo-launches-bid-for-utah-gove/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The former CEO of Overstock.com announced on Saturday the start of a campaign to unseat Utah\u2019s sitting governor.", "title": "Former Overstock.com CEO launches bid for Utah governor"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former CEO of Overstock.com announced on Saturday the start of a campaign to unseat Utah's sitting governor.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Former Overstock.com CEO launches bid for Utah governor"}, "Author": "KIMBERLY PIERCEALL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba1b\"", "article_summary": "Herbert\u2019s campaign spokesman Marty Carpenter confirmed the amount and said the governor\u2019s approval ratings have been consistently between 68 and 76 percent.\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The former CEO of Overstock.com announced on Saturday the start of a campaign to unseat Utah\u2019s sitting governor.\nCarpenter said it\u2019s too early for talk of debates considering the filing deadline to run for governor isn\u2019t until March.\nJohnson said that despite Herbert\u2019s approval ratings he hears from people who are frustrated.\nHe said Herbert, elected in 2009 after serving five years as the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, has always debated opponents in the past."}
