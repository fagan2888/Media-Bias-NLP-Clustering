A nearly $40 million federally funded U.S. Army Corps of Engineers beach replenishment project from Philips Avenue in southern Deal to Loch Arbour will begin this week.

The replenishment project will cover the placement of 1.4 million cubic yards of sand for reconstruction of the shoreline. It includes lengthening six existing stormwater outfalls and modification of two existing groins.

The Army Corps had planned to notch six jetties but now will only do three after getting some opposition from fishermen, surfers and concerned citizens, said U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.)

Notching is when a jetty is split in two to allow for ocean flow.

No beach replenishment in northern Ocean for now

"The fight for Sandy aid has not been easy, but the start of this project is a rewarding milestone in our efforts," said Pallone. "Beaches are a fundamental part of life here on the shore, both for residents and our tourist economy."

The Army Corps awarded the contract to Manson Construction Company. A contract award for the second half of the overall project, which includes beach replenishment from Philips Ave in Deal north to Lake Takanasee in Elberon, will be awarded later this year.

This is the first time the section of coast from Elberon to Loch Arbour will receive beach replenishment, Pallone said.
