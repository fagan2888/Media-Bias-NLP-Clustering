At that time, the State Department did not provide a specific number.\n\n>>> Cuba Releases \u2018Some\u2019 of 53 Political Prisoners, US Finally Reveals\n\nTheir agreed upon release was part of Obama\u2019s Dec. 17 announcement that he planned to restore \u201cfull diplomatic relations\u201d with Cuba after five decades of hostile relations with the island.\n\nThe U.S. official says the administration will hold the Cuban government accountable if it continues to detain or harass other political opponents.\n\nAccording to Reuters, which first broke the news of the freed prisoners, the White House will provide the names of the 53 prisoners to Congress and expects lawmakers to make them public.\n\nOpponents of President Obama\u2019s decision to restore diplomatic ties with Cuba expressed doubts that the island will deliver on its promises.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a Cuban-American and critic of Obama\u2019s move, told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d that \u201cthousands\u201d of political prisoners remain in Cuban jails.\n\n\u201cCertainly for those 53 prisoners it\u2019s great news, but unfortunately we don\u2019t know who they are,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe list has been kept secret from the world. Beyond it, our understanding from the ones who have been released, is that many are at the end of their terms anyway and all have been warned that if they take up the cause of democracy they will be right back in jail.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The White House said today that Cuba has released all 53 prisoners it promised to free as part of a deal to normalize relations with the United States.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The White House said today that Cuba has released all 53 prisoners it promised to free as part of a deal to normalize relations with the United States.", "title": "Cuba Releases 53 Political Prisoners, White House Claims", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rtrlsix814588.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-12T21:41:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1y5xMYy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The White House said today that Cuba has released all 53 prisoners it promised to free as part of a deal to normalize relations with the United States.", "title": "Cuba Releases 53 Political Prisoners, White House Claims", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rtrlsix814588.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "latin america", "published_time": "2015-01-12T18:27:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-12T21:41:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Cuba, political prisoners, White House, State Department, President Obama, dissident, Marco Rubio"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCertainly for those 53 prisoners it\u2019s great news, but unfortunately we don\u2019t know who they are,\u201d Rubio said.\nThe White House said today that Cuba has released all 53 prisoners it promised to free as part of a deal to normalize relations with the United States.\nAccording to Reuters, which first broke the news of the freed prisoners, the White House will provide the names of the 53 prisoners to Congress and expects lawmakers to make them public.\n>>> Cuba Releases \u2018Some\u2019 of 53 Political Prisoners, US Finally RevealsTheir agreed upon release was part of Obama\u2019s Dec. 17 announcement that he planned to restore \u201cfull diplomatic relations\u201d with Cuba after five decades of hostile relations with the island.\nSen.
