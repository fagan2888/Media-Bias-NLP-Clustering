The other posts can be accessed here, here, here and here.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s education system is entering a new environment. The Common Core State Standards are in full effect providing for new curriculum. The Excellent Public Schools Act\u2019s Read to Achieve section which ends social promotion in the third grade threatens to hold back many students. Proven measures like early childhood education programs that improve End of Grade test results have been cut.\n\nUnfortunately, students who find themselves in environments of racial segregation and high poverty will feel the effects of the changes in education policy in this state worse than their more affluent peers. According to a 2013 report published by the UNC Center for Civil Rights called \u201cThe State of Exclusion\u201d, North Carolina is rife with racially identifiable schools. In the report, these are schools where \u201cthe racial composition of the school was more than 10% different than the county average.\u201d Their composition can reflect either a higher population of white students than the county average or more students of color than the county average. Using the methodology explained in the report, the research found that throughout the entire state, 63.44% of the population lives near an elementary school that is racially identifiable.\n\nThe literature is clear on the impacts of racially identifiable schools on students learning. In a research brief, UNC Charlotte Professor Roslyn Michelson, states that \u201c[s]egregated schools are highly effective delivery systems for unequal educational opportunities.\u201d This point is illustrated by research from the Cedar Grove Institute for Sustainable Communities which states that \u201c[i]n North Carolina, segregated high-poverty schools have less experienced teachers, fewer fully-qualified teachers, and fewer teachers with advanced degrees\u2026\u201d Racial segregation in schools creates a system for student underachievement.\n\nRacial segregation was not the only consideration in the UNC report. Research also addressed high-poverty schools. It comes as no surprise that, according to the report, high-poverty schools are also likely to be racially identifiable. The most impoverished counties in North Carolina also have higher rates of their populations living near failing schools.\n\nThese findings are highly correlated with other findings of the report around segregated housing patterns. Again, Michelson finds that assignment policies for schools necessarily are linked to housing policies.\n\nFortunately, there are solutions. Research shows that racial and socioeconomic integration is beneficial to all students and society. Prof. Michelson\u2019s research brief shows that where there is diversity, students of color are more likely to have higher grades, graduate high school and continue their education in college than students attending schools with a population of mostly disadvantaged students of color and students living in poverty.\n\nA Century Foundation report called \u201cHousing Policy is School Policy\u201d studied Montgomery County, Maryland, which has one of the first inclusionary zoning programs in the United States. The policy allows low-income students to attend school with their more affluent peers. Low-income students with access to schools where there are students with more wealth outperformed poor students in the schools where there was not socioeconomic integration.\n\nIn places like Wake County, where housing is segregated but an \u201caggressive district-wide socioeconomic integration policies\u201d has been used, there was less of an achievement gap than there would have been without the integration policy.\n\nOf course, there are many places in the state where there is no racial or socioeconomic diversity. If inclusionary zoning or strong diversity policies are not available, there are still other solutions. The state can ensure that qualified, experienced teachers are in every classroom by making and paying teachers like the professionals they are. North Carolina could also restore the Teaching Fellows Program so that only people who know that they want to teach will enter the profession. There should also be restoration of funding for professional development programs.
