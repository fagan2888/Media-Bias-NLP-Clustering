LARAMIE, WYO. — In order for Colorado State to end Wyoming’s four-year reign of holding the Bronze Boot, the focus will be on CSU’s offense Saturday at War Memorial Stadium.

That’s because the Rams (2-4, 0-1 Mountain West) must find a way to keep up with Wyoming’s high-powered offense.

The Cowboys (4-2, 2-0), led by junior quarterback Brett Smith, average 37.7 points per game and rank 10th nationally in total offense with 518.8 points per game.

Smith has thrown for as many 511 yards in a game (56-23 win at Air Force) and ranks third nationally in total offense (379.0).

Colorado State averages 30 points per game but that may not be enough here Saturday. The good news for the Rams is Wyoming’s defense yeilds 429 yards per game so CSU should be able to move the football. Cashing in with touchdowns instead of field goals will be critical.
