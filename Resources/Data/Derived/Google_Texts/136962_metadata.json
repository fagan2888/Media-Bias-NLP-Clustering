Other issues also seem to be in play. (RELATED: Senate Democrats Fight For More Illegals In Anti-Prostitution Bill)\n\nNow the debate is delaying a vote on whether to confirm Loretta Lynch as Eric Holder\u2019s successor at the Justice Department, a fact that has occasioned much wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n\nTen of the trafficking bill\u2019s 13 Democratic cosponsors voted to filibuster it Tuesday, including Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin. But that isn\u2019t Durbin\u2019s biggest position change: the Illinois Democrat was once pro-life.\n\nIn 1982, Durbin bragged about being a five-time master of ceremonies at annual pro-life rallies in Springfield \u2014 while competing in a Democratic primary. He supported overturning Roe v. Wade as late as 1989, even voting for constitutional amendments to that effect.\n\nBy 1995, Durbin was opposed even to making partial-birth abortion illegal. National Review\u2019s Ramesh Ponnuru observed in his book \u201cThe Party of Death\u201d that Durbin insisted John Roberts must support Roe in order to be confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWhat Durbin was saying,\u201d Ponnuru wrote, \u201cwas that Roberts should be disqualified for the job for taking the exact same position that Durbin took in the 1980s.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden also voted for a pro-life, anti-Roe constitutional amendment that stated, \u201cthe right to an abortion is not secured by this Constitution.\u201d\n\nBy the time Biden first ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988, he was pro-choice. That field also included several other prominent abortion flip-floppers: Jesse Jackson, Dick Gephardt, Al Gore and Paul Simon.\n\nAnd by Paul Simon, I mean the late Illinois senator, not the singer. Though like \u201cThe Boxer,\u201d the pro-life Democrats\u2019 story is seldom told.\n\nThe most interesting case is Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who once took the position that abortion should only be legal in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. In 2003, Reid was one of only three Democrats in the Senate to vote against an amendment affirming that Roe was decided correctly.\n\nWhat makes Reid remarkable is that he has never publicly changed his position, even if he now blocks bills that restrict federal funding of abortion. Pro-life Democrats celebrated as Reid rose up the party\u2019s Senate leadership ranks. Democrats for Life listed him as an \u201call star\u201d in 2004, after he had been the Democratic whip for three years.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton wanted to pair with a pro-life senator to write an op-ed emphasizing \u201ccommon ground\u201d on abortion, she chose Reid. In the opening line of the 2006 piece, Clinton and Reid identified themselves as \u201ctwo senators on opposite sides of the abortion debate.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think Hillary was supposed to be the pro-life one.\n\nA Reid spokesman insisted to The Weekly Standard in 2009 that the senator \u201cis strongly pro-life\u201d and the spox \u201cresent[ed] any suggestion to the contrary.\u201d\n\nFair enough. But Reid, whose ratings from pro-life and pro-choice groups have fluctuated wildly over the years, voted with NARAL Pro-Choice America 100 percent of the time in 2012 (though only 70 percent in 2013) but hasn\u2019t voted with the National Right to Life Committee more than half the time since 2003-04.\n\nReid\u2019s 33 percent National Right to Life rating in 2013 was probably high for a Democrat, but he didn\u2019t vote with the pro-life group a single time in 2009-12, according to their scorecard.\n\nEven Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey Jr., who like his late father identifies as a pro-life Democrat and who supports the human trafficking bill with the pro-life language intact, voted with National Right to Life 33 percent of the time in 2014 and 2013, NARAL Pro-Choice America 70 percent in 2013, the last year for which data is available.\n\nThere are exceptions. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin voted with National Right to Life 100 percent of the time in 2014 and 2013 after supporting them 23 percent of the time in 2011.\n\nManchin also went from voting with NARAL 100 percent of the time in 2011 to not siding with them on any scored votes in 2013.\n\nBut by and large, the pro-life Democrats\u2019 last gasp came when Bart Stupak led them in capitulating on Obamacare. It\u2019s hard to remember that the pro-life Hyde amendment originally passed in a Democratic-controlled Congress.\n\nW.
