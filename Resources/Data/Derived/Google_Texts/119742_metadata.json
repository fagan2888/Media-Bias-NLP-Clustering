State Medicaid Expansion\n\nSynopsis: Gov. Jan Brewer surprised nearly everyone in the state when she announced in her State of the State address to the Legislature in January that she wanted the cutoff for state indigent medical insurance raised to 133 percent of the poverty line in accordance with the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Brewer had been an opponent of Obamacare and had rejected setting up a state health care exchange as part of the ACA, but she said she had been convinced by the state\u2019s medical industry that the expansion was crucial for the state\u2019s economic health. Her decision set up an epic showdown in the Legislature in June when 14 Republicans voted with every Democrat to pass the expansion. The losing legislators have since sued the state, saying the expansion violates the state constitution because it didn\u2019t pass with a two-thirds majority. Voters in 1992 required all tax increases be passed with a two-thirds vote of the Legislature. The legislators say a fee imposed on hospitals by the new law constitutes a tax. A ruling on the suit by a Maricopa County Superior Court judge is expected imminently, however both sides have vowed an appeal, so the issue won\u2019t be resolved until sometime in 2014.\n\nWhy its No. 1: The expansion will bring about $8 billion in federal money over three years to the state in the form of matching funds. As part of the ACA, the federal government covers 100 percent of the cost to states of the Medicaid expansion. After that it will cover between 80 to 90 percent of the cost. During the recession-caused state budget crisis, the Legislature capped new enrollments to the state Medicaid plan to reduce its indigent health insurance outlay. Hospitals claimed that as a result, their amounts of uncompensated care rose steeply and seriously threatened the financial stability of many hospitals, especially rural ones. Tucson Medical Center was among the leaders of the expansion lobbying effort. Tucson\u2019s high poverty rate, its proximity to the border and having the only Level 1 trauma center in all of Southern Arizona means it has a large uncompensated care problem. The expansion will alleviate some of that financial pressure and improve the financial health of the metro area\u2019s health care industry.\n\n2. Grand Canyon University doesn\u2019t come to town\n\nSynopsis: Grand Canyon University, a Phoenix-based non-denominational Christian college, announced at the end of 2012 it wanted to add a new campus in the metro Phoenix East Valley area and also that it was considering expanding to other parts of Arizona. Tucson, Marana and Oro Valley, through TREO, began talks with GCU about suitable locations in Tucson metro. Tucson offered up its El Rio Golf Course near Speedway Boulevard and Silverbell Road and discussions advanced. When news broke of the El Rio offering, neighborhood activists who had protested El Rio in the 1960s seeking a community center to be built at the once exclusive golf course, protested again. The protest spooked Councilwoman Regina Romero, who pulled her support for the college at El Rio, causing the rest of the council through the unwritten rules of deferring to council members whose wards are affected, to agree. About the same time, Tucson\u2019s more liberal activists began to lobby the all-Democratic city council against city involvement with Grand Canyon in general because of the college\u2019s resistance to the normalization of homosexuality laws. Grand Canyon subsequently announced it was building a campus in Mesa and shelving plans to expand in Tucson.\n\nWhy it\u2019s No. 2: It\u2019s hard to judge the effect of losing something you never had, especially when it\u2019s uncertain you were ever going to get it. But Grand Canyon made No. 2 on the list because the Grand Canyon snafu has turned into a political club that city council opponents use to beat up council members for a perceived lack of business acumen, i.e. screwing up a sure thing (even though there\u2019s no proof it was a sure thing), and an overall hostility toward growth and economic development. Irrespective of the council\u2019s business acumen and growth attitude, if the kerfuffle over El Rio did indeed spook Grand Canyon executives about doing business with Tucson, and if the El Rio issue had been handled better and GCU had decided to build a campus here, it would have meant millions of dollars in construction work and hundreds of short and long-term jobs, plus helped Pima County overcome deep workforce training deficits, which all-in-all would have been a huge boon to the local economy.\n\n3. Forest Service gives Rosemont mine tentative OK\n\nSynopsis: After nearly three years of review, the U.S. Forest Service released a 2,500 page Environmental Impact Statement that essentially said one of five alternative mine operation plans was within federal environmental laws and other regulations. That set the stage for Coronado National Forest Supervisor Jim Upchurch to release a draft Record of Decision this month giving tentative approval for the mine in the eastern foothills of the Santa Rita Mountains. That starts a series of mandated waiting periods starting Jan. 1 that all told could take 120 days. Which means the Forest Service could issue a mining permit sometime in late March or April. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Rosemont will be able to start mining. The company also needs a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers, which needs the Environmental Protection Agency to sign off on the permit and the EPA has raised objections over the mine\u2019s potential effects on riparian habitats down range.\n\nWhy Its No. 3: When Rosemont is finally allowed to start mining, or finally prevented from mining, the story will be No. 1 on that year\u2019s end-of-the-year Top 10 list because of the billion-dollar economic effect the mine will have on the Tucson region. Until then, it remains an important business story that this year saw significant steps forward to permitting.\n\n4. Tucson and Rio Nuevo bury the hatchet\n\nSynopsis: The city of Tucson and the Rio Nuevo Multi Facilities District Board announced in January they had reached an accord and had resolved disputes over numerous issues. The agreement settled several lawsuits and allowed the two governments to begin working cooperatively on downtown economic development.\n\nWhy Its No. 4: After years of debilitating bickering, renovations have begun on the decrepit Tucson Convention Center and the city is looking to bring in a private firm to manage the TCC. Improving the TCC\u2019s bookings will help sustain the new businesses that have opened downtown the past two years and will be key to attracting a convention hotelier. Moreover, Rio Nuevo is now sitting on a growing pile of cash that can be used to further improve downtown.\n\n5. USAF pulls the plug on the A-10\n\nSynopsis: Due to budget pressures created by the sequester, the U.S. Air Force announced it was mothballing the A-10, for which Davis-Monthan Air Force Base serves as its major training base. This month, though, as part of a Congressional budget deal, the A-10 was given a one-year reprieve to evaluate how the A-10\u2019s close combat support missions will be met until the F-35 comes online sometime in 2016 or 2017.\n\nWhy Its No. 5: While it\u2019s unlikely the Air Force would ever close D-M because of its relationship to the boneyard, where several hundred billion dollars of military aircraft are stored, it can significantly reduce the number of personnel stationed at the base if the base has no major program or mission. Thousands of airmen and officers purchase goods and services in Tucson, and the air base uses dozens of Tucson subcontractors to provide it supplies and services.\n\n6. Continued slow growth forecasted for 2014\n\nSynopsis: Economists at Arizona State University and University of Arizona reported slow but steady economic growth in Arizona in 2013 and said 2014 will have more of the same, with small increases in housing sales, jobs and income growth.\n\nWhy Its No. 6: Growing is better than receding. A growing economy not only provides jobs, of which Arizona lost 350,000 in the recession and has only replenished half, it gives Arizona consumers more confidence to spend money, or borrow, meaning more home and car sales, and other big ticket purchases. Moreover, it spurs taxable economic activity that helps restore government budget cuts made during the recession.\n\n7. ACC dims solar subsidies\n\nSynopsis: The Arizona Corporation Commission in January cut TEP\u2019s residential rooftop solar subsidy and eliminated statewide the subsidy for commercial rooftop solar. Then in November, it cut the subsidy for APS, the largest power utility in the state.\n\nWhy Its No. 7: The solar subsidies created by the ACC last decade spurred a boom in rooftop solar. Homes and businesses producing their own electricity and selling any excess production back to power providers helped offset the cost of installation. Solar installation boomed and dozens of new installation companies sprung up to meet the demand creating hundreds of jobs statewide. However, it also started to present a problem for utility companies as the increase in user-generated power cut into utility profits and reduced the amount of money utilities could put into supporting the overall power grid, which is critical infrastructure necessary for the economic growth and prosperity of the state. The ACC then had to strike the balance of making the subsidy fair for utilities without reducing it so much it put the kibosh on the burgeoning solar installation industry. The effect the regulatory changes will have on either likely won\u2019t be known until the end of 2014.\n\n8. UA\u2019s TechLaunch takes off\n\nSynopsis: The University of Arizona hired David Allen in late 2012 to improve the university\u2019s conversion of its research into economic activity. He began making reforms in earnest in 2013 and the beginnings of what could be a large spurt of university-related entrepreneurship began in 2013. In April, TechLaunch released its \u201croadmap\u201d to research commercialization and in November, it licensed medication management software to Sinfonia Healthcare Corporation, which provides a variety of home health care services.\n\nWhy Its No. 8: UA, despite being one of the best research universities in the nation, is one of the worst at converting its research into dollars. Allen previously did the same job at Ohio State and the University of Colorado, where both schools became national leaders in research commercialization. TechLaunch\u2019s success could mean instead of being able to only point to a couple of UA-born corporations, such as Ventana Medical Systems or Sanofi, regional leaders could point to dozens of such companies. The economic harvest the metro region could reap from TechLaunch\u2019s success is enormous.\n\n9. Downtown business growth/mega dorm development\n\nSynopsis: Downtown continued to be a hot real estate commodity, with two new towers nearing completion, a third about to start, a half dozen new restaurants opening and the end of streetcar construction. Meanwhile, one of the new towers, The Cadence, is intended for UA student housing, and the city approved a collection of towers to be constructed as part of a renovation of the West University area between Park and Euclid Avenues south of Speedway. One student tower is complete and two adjacent towers nearly so.\n\nWhy Its No. 9: Downtown\u2019s renaissance is a vital cog in the economic development of metro Tucson. The UA, the streetcar, downtown dining and entertainment are all essential to creating the critical mass necessary to push downtown revitalization into the next phase \u2013 increased residential density, increased retail shopping and improvements to the Westside cultural amenities.\n\n10. Port of Tucson reaches key milestones\n\nSynopsis: The port began receiving and shipping international containers in the spring and in the fall received a federal transportation grant to build a rail spur directly through the port, making it a true inland port.\n\nWhy Its No. 10: Tucson has been looking for ways to diversify its economy and rely less on Raytheon, the UA and D-M as its main economic engines. The sudden increase in Mexican manufacturing has all the border states looking to capitalize on the transshipment of goods north and south across the border. Tucson is supremely positioned to be a logistics hub for that movement of goods across the border. The PoT is the first to capitalize on the international trade possibilities and could serve as an incubator for further logistics development.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Obamacare mandate delays and rollout fiasco; New Pima County soccer stadium opens; Marana voters OK sewer system purchase.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Inside Tucson Business", "description": "1.
