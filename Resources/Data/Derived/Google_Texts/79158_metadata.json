Rahall II waited at the Charleston airport for a 4:50 p.m. U.S. Airways Express flight to Washington. If the plane left on schedule, the roughly 80-minute flight would allow him to get to the Capitol in time for votes in the House of Representatives that evening.\n\nThings did not go according to plan. The flight didn\u2019t leave Charleston for another four hours, giving Rahall, then the top Democrat on the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, plenty of time to \u201cboil over,\u201d as he later wrote. When he finally arrived in Washington, having missed three votes, he lambasted the airline\u2019s handling of the delay in a statement in the Congressional Record:\n\n\u201cAt moments, the arrival/departure information was so confused that the airplane would have had to violate the laws of physics in order to abide by the airline schedule,\u201d Rahall\u2019s statement read. \u201cNeedless to say, all passengers were inconvenienced and the airline\u2019s explanations were wholly unsatisfactory. This flight delay prevented me from carrying out my Constitutional duty to represent the people of southern West Virginia: I feel I owe them and this body an explanation about why that was not possible last night.\u201d\n\nVoting is one of the most important duties of a lawmaker, and most miss very few votes. Yet voting attendance has become a topic of discussion in the Republican presidential primary, as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has missed about a third of all votes this year, by far the most in that chamber.\n\nIn the House, unlike the Senate, lawmakers are given a chance to provide \u201cPersonal Explanations\u201d to explain missed votes. These entries filed in the Congressional Record say not only how a Representative came to be absent, but also how they would have voted though they don\u2019t have the effect of adding or changing a vote.\n\nThe custom has been in place since at least 1845, according to a 2008 Congressional Research Service report.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Rahall said he wanted it on the record that he would have voted in support of the three bills the House considered that day \u2014 a measure to convey federal land in Utah to the state, another changing the rules for granting ski area permits on national forest land and a third granting submerged land surrounding the Northern Mariana Islands to the American territory \u2014 if only to prevent political opponents from using the missed votes against him.\n\n\u201cThey could end up as a 30-second sound bite in a campaign,\u201d he said. (Rahall was defeated in 2014 by Evan Jenkins, a Republican).\n\nProPublica has collected all of the Personal Explanations filed since 2007 \u2014 some 5,058 in all, covering 21,176 votes \u2014 and created a database that lets readers look up their representatives\u2019 missed votes, as well as their explanations. These statements are by no means required \u2014 only one in six absences are explained \u2014 but they document a little-discussed aspect of the lives and work of lawmakers, and provide hints at the competing priorities and difficulties of a system that, to many, seems chronically dysfunctional.\n\nThe reasons lawmakers cite most for missing votes range from the mundane (travel delays, often due to weather, or remaining in their districts for job fairs) to more personal (the birth of a child or a graduation ceremony or illness). Lawmakers have missed more than 2,000 votes for medical reasons, and thousands more for personal and family reasons.\n\nThe record is full of stories documenting the working lives of Representatives: Marcy Kaptur, a Democratic congresswoman from Ohio, missed a 2008 House vote because she was searching the Capitol for high school students visiting from her district. Jeff Landry, a Louisiana Republican, \u201ccompletely lost track of time\u201d and missed two votes in 2011. For Ben Ray Lujan, Democrat of New Mexico, an \u201coperational issue\u201d with a House voting machine meant that a 2012 vote wasn\u2019t recorded.\n\nFor some, avoiding a vote is a sign of defiance. In 2012, Jan Schakowsky of Illinois was one of 108 Democrats who declined even to vote on a resolution holding then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress. She was the only one, though, to insert a statement in the Record saying she would have voted no: \u201cI would not participate in what I strongly believe was an abuse of power by the majority.\u201d\n\nAlthough many explanations are short, lawmakers can be more expansive when a key issue is at stake. When J. Randy Forbes, a Virginia Republican who has missed less than 3 percent of votes since 2007, was absent for a January 2015 vote on a bill to ban federal funding for abortion, his explanation provided no reason, but emphasized his stance on the issue: \u201cI am and always have been pro-life, and throughout my tenure in Congress will continue to be a strong advocate for the unborn.\u201d\n\nThe Rules of the House say that \u201cEvery Member shall be present within the Hall of the House during its sittings, unless excused or necessarily prevented, and shall vote on each question put, unless having a direct personal or pecuniary interest in the event of such question.\u201d Lawmakers routinely say that they take their voting responsibilities seriously, and in general attendance records bear that out: most lawmakers participate in the overwhelming majority of votes held.\n\nDemocrats have missed more votes than Republicans since the beginning of 2007, but they account for an even greater share of the explained missed votes: two of every three since the beginning of 2013.\n\nLuis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat, has missed nearly one in six votes this year, according to voting records, one of the highest rates among current members of the House. He has been absent for 15 percent of all votes since the beginning of 2007, often due to his work on immigration policy, which frequently has him on the road.\n\n\u201cCongressman Gutierrez prioritizes constituent case work and spending time in the District in Chicago,\u201d said Douglas G. Rivlin, a spokesman for Gutierrez, in a statement emailed to ProPublica. \u201cHe also devotes a great deal of time to traveling all over the country to build support for immigration reform. As a national figure, his time is in great demand. He rarely misses substantive votes and when he does, it is because he cannot be in two places at once.\u201d\n\nGutierrez sporadically explains his absences \u2014 a statement for the Record in July gave a clear reason for one: He was attending oral arguments in a federal court case over immigration policy. He also missed votes due to a family medical issue, meetings at the White House and, in 2011, \u201cmy participation in a peaceful rally and protest against the current Administration\u2019s enforcement policies against immigrant students and the families of U.S. citizens.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives\u2019 schedules are hardly overstuffed with days spent in the House chamber. In 2014, the members of the House spent only 29 weeks in session, each of which was bookended by long weekends spent doing district work, fundraising or running for re-election. The House is not scheduled to be in session for a five-day week this year.\n\nAs lawmakers balance their duties, not every vote is created equal. Both ProPublica\u2019s analysis and research by Eleanor Neff Powell, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, found that lawmakers miss more lopsided votes than ones that are important to either political party.\n\nThere have been 20 times when the number of explained missed votes exceeded the final margin of approval or defeat. Half were on amendments. One, a 2011 amendment to a spending bill about labor agreements on federal construction projects was approved by a single vote and had eight explanations from the 25 House members who did not vote, including three Republicans opposed to the amendment.\n\nBills that have widespread bipartisan support often are considered \u201cunder suspension of the rules,\u201d which means they are debated fairly quickly, sometimes in a few minutes, and must have the support of two-thirds of those voting. About four in 10 personal explanations occur on these so-called suspension votes, which often are scheduled on the first day of the week that the House is in session, when travel delays could make it more likely for a member to miss votes. Absences (explained or not) on suspension votes account for 36 percent of all House votes missed between 2007 and October 2015.\n\nIf personal explanations are optional, why do representatives use them at all? Often, to indicate to constituents that just because they didn\u2019t vote doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have an opinion.\n\n\u201cIt shows that you care about what they\u2019re asking about,\u201d said Powell.\n\nFor lawmakers facing tight re-election contests, missed votes can be part of a political balancing act. Opponents are quick to make use of a poor voting record. Missing a vote can be a graceful way to dodge votes designed to put lawmakers on the spot. Explanations, in turn, can provide a way to miss the actual vote and still claim that they would have voted the way constituents might have preferred.\n\nIn 2013, Brad Schneider, an Illinois Democrat, voted against a Republican spending bill that also delayed the individual health insurance mandate created by the Affordable Care Act. The next year, he missed a vote on a bill to delay the individual mandate but explained that, had he been there, he would have voted in favor of delaying the mandate, as he did on a similar bill in July 2013. Schneider lost his seat in 2014 to Bob Dold, a Republican former congressman who voted against the health care law while in the House, in a race where the health insurance law figured prominently. He is running against Dold again in 2016; Schneider\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMissing potentially controversial votes, then submitting explanations is an example of what researcher Powell calls \u201cstrategic abstention\u201d: when a member skips a vote on which her party\u2019s position is incompatible with her constituents\u2019 views. Rather than disappoint either, the Representative can simply miss the vote, later explaining that she would have voted the way her constituents would have wanted, without actually doing so and creating a rift with her party.\n\nThe ProPublica analysis, which covers a different time period than Powell\u2019s, found some evidence of this: there were 128 votes on bill passage in which a member who missed the vote later registered opposition to his or her party\u2019s majority position. Fifty-six of those contained no clear reason for the absence.\n\nLawmakers\u2019 explanations cover not only missed votes, but mistaken ones as well. It\u2019s not common \u2014 explanations attempting to correct a wrong vote or saying that a member tried to vote but could not \u2014 number about 320 during the past eight years. But more than one in five current lawmakers has done it at least once since the beginning of 2007, with John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat and the chamber\u2019s longest-serving member, claiming 12 incorrect votes. The official record of a 2011 vote on an bill to expand offshore oil and gas leases shows Conyers voting in favor, when he meant to vote against the bill. Conyers, who at 86 is also the House\u2019s oldest member, did not respond to several requests for comment made through his office.\n\nA handful of other lawmakers have reported voting incorrectly at least four times, including Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat who is the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee. On at least one of those occasions, on a vote that occurred at 1:53 a.m. on Feb. 18, 2011, Smith voted for an amendment and later explained that he should have voted no. Rebecca Bryant, a spokeswoman for Smith, said that in that case the congressman \u201chad some misinformation\u201d on the nature of the amendment that was only clarified the next morning.\n\n\u201cThe key thing is transparency,\u201d said Bryant of the vote explanations. \u201cWe wanted to articulate how the congressman felt.\u201d\n\nOccasionally, lawmakers change their minds after a vote and submit a personal explanation about it. In 2008, the House voted to censure Charlie Rangel, a New York Democrat, over ethics violations, and Texas Republican Lamar Smith voted in favor of doing so. Later, in a statement in the Record, Smith reconsidered his vote: \u201cMembers had no advance notice of the vote, and I did not familiarize myself with the substance of the motion as much as I would have liked. If the vote were taken again, I would vote present rather than \u2018aye\u2019.\u201d\n\nProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.
