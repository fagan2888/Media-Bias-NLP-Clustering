Now he was calling her from an unknown location with this request: \u201cYour country needs you.\u201d\n\nMs. Van Dyk, who is from Vancouver, jokingly said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re talking about my country.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, then said: \u201cFine, fine \u2014 the President needs you.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how Ms. Van Dyk became one of three Canadians who were part of the so-called \u201ctech surge\u201d: a group of the best and brightest techies rounded up to resuscitate HealthCare.gov, the website where uninsured Americans could sign up for health coverage.\n\nRelated\n\nI view healthcare as a human right, it doesn\u2019t really matter if it is Canada or America or any other country\n\nThe portal was the centrepiece of U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Health Care Act, and a technical and political mess. The Act, also known as Obamacare, was at the centre of a fierce battle between U.S. Democrats and Republicans.\n\nWhen the website launched on Oct. 1, it was riddled with glitches and only a trickle of the millions of Americans who rushed to enrol in insurance exchanges got through.\n\nProblems persisted for weeks and Montreal-based CGI Inc., one of the contractors who helped build the website, also came under fire for the bungled rollout. The furor prompted President Obama himself to apologize for the glitches.\n\nAnd in a bid to fix it, U.S. officials launched what they called a \u201ctech surge\u201d: they flew in a team of software engineers, developers, designers and analysts from the likes of Silicon Valley and the Obama election campaign.\n\nAmong this technological elite were three Canadians: Mountain View, Calif.-based site reliability engineer Ms. Van Dyk, Vancouver-based software engineer Ben Komalo, and University of Waterloo student David Hu.\n\nMs. Van Dyk did accept the call to work \u2014 taking unpaid leave from her new Google job \u2014 because healthcare is a cause close to her heart as a Canadian, she said.\n\n\u201cI view healthcare as a human right, it doesn\u2019t really matter if it is Canada or America or any other country,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Komalo got a similar message from Brandon Ballinger, a friend and former colleague from his time at Google, in early December about a top-secret but \u201ccool\u201d opportunity.\n\nHe later discovered it was the debacle all over the news. That challenge, and the high stakes, prompted him to take a leave of absence at his job as software engineer with Khan Academy, he said.\n\n\u201cIt really, really needed fixing,\u201d said Mr. Komalo, who is originally from the Toronto area.\n\n\u201cIt was a really important thing, and when else am I going to be on a project where I can apply my technical skills and actually improve the lives of millions of users in such a short term?\u201d\n\nAnd within days, Mr. Komalo found himself working 12-to-18 hour days, seven days a week, at the HealthCare.gov command centre in a non-descript DoubleTree hotel in suburban Columbia, MD.\n\nMr. Komalo was part of the team tasked with rewriting components of the broken system, he said.\n\nIt had a startup feel, he said. But it also felt at times like a college dorm, with techies strolling down the hall in their pyjamas to talk to a friend in a nearby room, he said.\n\nMs. Van Dyk was part of the team tasked with site reliability engineering to stabilize the website. She says she worked \u201cintense\u201d 12-to-16 hour days virtually non-stop in both Washington, D.C. and Columbia, Maryland.\n\nMr. Hu, however, still had one more school term at the University of Waterloo when Mr. Bellinger called him in November.\n\n\u201cI proposed that I would be able to work on this remotely, and possibly for a few weekends, at a time while I would be in school,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Hu flew down to New York and Baltimore before his term started, and on weekends, and cut an extra course from his software engineering program to accommodate the workload.\n\nHe was part of Mr. Komalo\u2019s team, which was also tasked with building a new, simplified process to sign up on the website.\n\nIn all, there were as many as 50 people on a rolling basis on the team working with U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park to fix HealthCare.gov to try and hit the Obama administration\u2019s target of 7 million enrolments by March 31.\n\nAnd, indeed, the inner workings of Healthcare.gov were a mess.\n\n\u201cIf you can imagine, there were 55 different sub-teams working on one website,\u201d Mr. Komalo said. \u201cIt is complete chaos.\u201d\n\nThere was also a \u201cculture shock\u201d between the lean, agile startup world and the government\u2019s hierarchical approach of using multiple contractors and layers of bureaucratic processes, Ms. Van Dyk said.\n\n\u201cMost of the problems were people problems,\u201d she said. \u201cLittle communication between the companies, little communication between the contractors. People didn\u2019t really know who was in charge of any one thing.\u201d\n\nAfter a couple of gruelling months, the \u201ctech surge\u201d began bearing fruit.\n\nOn April 1, the White House announced it surpassed its target with 7.1-million enrollees by the March 31 deadline. Two weeks later, President Obama updated the figure to 8 million.\n\n\u201cWe were all happy at that point,\u201d Mr. Komalo said.\n\nPresident Obama celebrated the \u201ctech surge\u201d team with a reception in the White House in May. He thanked each worker individually with a handshake, said Mr. Komalo.\n\nThere were a couple of tech-appropriate celebrities on hand, too \u2014 such as actor Will Wheaton, of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and Bill Nye The Science Guy, Mr. Hu said.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a really exciting project,\u201d said Mr. Hu. \u201cI\u2019m not even out of school yet, and had such an impact.\u201d\n\nNow, all three Canadians are back to their respective jobs. Mr. Komalo has returned to Vancouver to work for Khan Academy, and Ms. Van Dyk is back at Google. Mr. Hu graduated earlier this month and is in Toronto, but will soon be moving to Silicon Valley to join Khan Academy there.\n\nBut the work isn\u2019t done yet. Some Marketplace Light members are now working on a new version of the website before the next open enrolment period begins on Nov. 15, Mr. Komalo said.\n\nOthers are also being dispatched to work on other government portals.\n\n\u201cI think our involvement has spurred some real change,\u201d said Ms. Van Dyk.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last November, three Canadians were called to a very important task: Fix the glitch-ridden website that was turning Obamacare into a technical and political mess.
