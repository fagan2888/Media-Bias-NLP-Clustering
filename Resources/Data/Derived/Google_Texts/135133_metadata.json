So throughout the region, mobile health units are attempting to bridge that gap and bring services to some of the populations that need them the most.\n\nOutside of an old train station in southwestern Virginia, Teresa Gardner and Paula Hill-Meade are seeing patients.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now is kind of reviewing a couple patients that came in this morning,\" says Gardner, executive director of The Health Wagon, a mobile health unit that provides primary care to underserved Appalachian populations. \"This gentleman, he has been in the recent coal mining layoffs.\n\n\u201cWe are down to less than 100 coal mining jobs in Wise County,\u201d she says. \u201cThe coal mining industry has just been devastated. There used to be thousands of jobs in the area and now it\u2019s reduced to less than 100.\u201d\n\nGardner says the miner\u2019s family had been able to get insurance through the Affordable Care Act, but that it was costing them more than $1,000 a month.\n\n\u201cThey were wanting to get established with us because they knew they wouldn\u2019t be able to continue affording that,\u201d she says.\n\nPaula Hill-Meade is the clinical director of the Health Wagon. She says when they first started, they almost exclusively saw people without insurance.\n\n\u201cBut now we\u2019re seeing a lot of people with high co-deductibles of some $3,000-$4,000. So it\u2019s really catastrophic insurance because how do you pay out $3,000-$4,000?\u201d says Hill-Meade.\n\nIn 2013, the latest year for which data are available, the Health Wagon assisted more than 11,000 patients at 11 southwest Virginia sites. These are often really sick people who either don\u2019t have insurance at all or can\u2019t afford the insurance they have.\n\n\u201cNot a day goes by that patients\u2019 lives are not saved here,\u201d says Gardner. \u201cThey come in with various co-morbid conditions, like diabetes, obesity, heart disease or lung disease.\u201d\n\nOne of those people is a young woman named Mary. We withheld her last name to protect her privacy. Like almost a million other Virginia residents, she doesn\u2019t have insurance, although she says she should get it in the next couple of months. She started using the Health Wagon about six months ago.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve really helped me get my diabetes under control, which I wasn\u2019t aware that I had it, so I really don\u2019t know where I would be in the last six months as far as health-wise,\u201d says Mary. \u201cI probably would be in a lot worse shape than I am now.\u201d\n\nThe Health Wagon asks for a $10 donation from patients if they have it. But if not, services are free. They are able to provide these services at a free or reduced cost to clients like Mary because the Wagon closely collaborates with universities and organizations around the country, such as The University of Virginia Health System and The Virginia Healthcare Foundation.\n\nHill-Meade says The Health Wagon takes a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to healthcare. Partnerships with labs, pharmacy schools and universities allow them to provide specialty consults through telemedicine services and tests at free or reduced cost. The vast majority of the population that uses their services are working poor adults. Most of the children in the area qualify for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to address these healthcare disparities because we have higher rates of just about every disease process,\u201d says Gardner. \u201cI mean, we have higher rates of diabetes, have higher rates of mental illness, suicide\u2026\u201d\n\nAccording to the Health Wagon website, compared with the rest Virginia: Health Wagon clients are 21 percent more likely to die from diseases of the heart, 14 percent more likely to die from diabetes, 40 percent more likely to die from unintentional injuries and 50 percent more likely to die from suicide.\n\n\u201cYou know the economy is just kind of devastated here \u2013 I\u2019ve been here in this clinic for 23 years and I\u2019ve never seen it this dire for patients,\u201d says Gardner. \u201cThey have to make daily choices between eating and paying electricity bill or medications and so on and so forth. We see that on a daily basis. And, unfortunately, people die without a health care access because of the economic factors that play into that.\u201d\n\nThis year, in part due to the coal mining layoffs, they\u2019ve had a waitlist for services. The Health Wagon just added a new nurse practitioner to try and meet the demand.\n\nAppalachia Health News is a project of West Virginia Public Broadcasting, with support from the Benedum Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "In Appalachia, barriers to healthcare include distance from a provider, lack of transportation, lack of health insurance, and the inability to take the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wvpublic.org/post/mobile-health-provides-medical-care-underserved-populations-southwestern-virginia", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wvpn/files/styles/medium/public/201603/176A3874.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In Appalachia, barriers to healthcare include distance from a provider, lack of transportation, lack of health insurance, and the inability to take the", "title": "Mobile Health Provides Medical Care for Underserved Populations in Southwestern Virginia"}, "story_id": 472182969, "twitter": {"site": "@wvpublic", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@KaraLofton"}, "author": "Kara Leigh Lofton", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Mobile Health Provides Medical Care for Underserved Populations in Southwestern Virginia"}, "nid": 48205, "datePublished": "2016-03-28", "keywords": "Appalachia Health News, Health Wagon, Virginia, Mobile Health Units, Mobile Health Clinic, Mobile Health, Underserved Populations, Rural Health, Free Clinic", "wordCount": 831, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now is kind of reviewing a couple patients that came in this morning,\" says Gardner, executive director of The Health Wagon, a mobile health unit that provides primary care to underserved Appalachian populations.\nThe Health Wagon just added a new nurse practitioner to try and meet the demand.\nPaula Hill-Meade is the clinical director of the Health Wagon.\nHill-Meade says The Health Wagon takes a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to healthcare.\nIn 2013, the latest year for which data are available, the Health Wagon assisted more than 11,000 patients at 11 southwest Virginia sites."}
