The recommendation now is that women wait until they\u2019re 50 years old before getting their first mammogram.\n\nThe screenings should happen every two years instead of every year, it says.\n\nBut local doctors strongly disagree with these new guidelines.\n\nThey say it could lead to hundreds of women dying from breast cancer nationwide.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video\n\n\u201cI am so grateful that a mammogram detected my breast cancer so early,\u201d Lynne Goldade said.\n\nAt 43, Goldade started her battle with cancer.\n\nHer mother died from the same disease so Goldade knew she had a higher risk.\n\n\u201cIf I had waited till I was 50 to get a mammogram, that cancer would have been a huge problem,\u201d Goldade said.\n\nThat is why Goldade and others are confused over a sweeping change.\n\nThe independent task force is now recommending women at average risk wait 10 more years, until they're 50 for their first mammograms, instead of 40.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very distressing because I see firsthand the importance of getting the mammogram,\u201d Dr. Kara Carlson said.\n\nCarlson added that waiting an extra decade to get your first mammogram could be deadly for hundreds of women.\n\n\u201cAt Evergreen, 25% of all our breast cancers are under the age of 50; that is a startling figure,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nAnd about 90% of all of Evergreen Hospital's cases involve women with no history of breast cancer in their family.\n\n\u201cEvery cancer is different, no two look alike,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nThe new recommendations stem from concerns over mammograms giving false positives, leading to unnecessary procedures.\n\nBut Carlson said the benefits still outweigh the risks.\n\n\u201cI think women should make that decision versus a task force and, potentially, insurance companies; it's taking a step backwards,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nSo she\u2019s hoping to clear up any confusion.\n\nShe said all women should continue to get annual mammograms at 40.\n\nGoldade said she and many of her friends are alive today because of it.\n\n\u201cThe treatment, if caught early, is relatively short,\u201d Goldade said.\n\nCarlson said many women with a history of breast cancer should get mammograms even earlier than 40 years of age. For example, if you have a family member who was diagnosed with breast cancer at 42, you should start mammograms 10 years earlier, at the age of 32, she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "KIRKLAND, Wash. -- New guidelines for breast exams are causing a stir among medical professionals because they say most women can wait a lot longer before getting their first mammograms.
