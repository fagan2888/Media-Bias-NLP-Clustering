Without the office, run by the Ministry of Caring, hundreds of poor adults would endure dental problems.\n\nIn addition to the dental care he gets at Pierre Toussaint, Roy also receives a confidence that allows him to beam a smile.\n\n\"I like to smile. I like to look good for people I'm around,\" he said flashing his teeth. \"It also makes me feel good. It builds up my self-esteem.\"\n\nThe Pierre Toussaint office, which turned 20 in October, has been helping uninsured adults with fillings, cleanings, extractions, dentures and partial dentures. Located at 830 Spruce St., it helps fill a void for many indigent people in need of dental health care, which is hard to come by in Delaware.\n\nDental care is not mandated under the Affordable Care Act and Delaware is one of just a few states without Medicaid coverage for adult dental care, forcing patients to pay out of pocket for care considered to be the first line of defense against health risks, including premature births, heart disease and complications from diabetes.\n\nDental care, especially among those with little money, is usually one of the last things they seek, usually out of fear of pain and anxiety about costs.The average national cost of teeth cleaning without insurance is $82.08, according to the American Dental Association. A root canal or porcelain crown costs about $1,000.\n\n\"It is very expensive to maintain good health,\" Roy said.\n\nApproximately 25 percent of children do not have some form of dental insurance, while about 50 percent of adults in Delaware are estimated to not have dental insurance, according to state officials.\n\nBuy Photo Rob Roy, 49, of Wilmington arrives in the rain on his bike for his dentist appoint at the Pierre Toussaint Dental Office which has been providing basic dental services to residents across Delaware, including fillings, cleanings, extractions, dentures and partial dentures for uninsured poor patients ages 19 to 64.

Some suffer from various addictions, which have fed into neglect of or deterioration of their teeth and gums.\n\n\"So when they come in, their needs are tremendous and we save the teeth that we can,\" said Dr. Gary Isaacs, who has been at Pierre Toussaint for 15 years. \"For some individuals, all we can simply do is remove all the remaining diseased teeth or replace them with partials or full dentures.\"\n\nIsaacs, who spent nine years in private practice in Milford and then 17 years as pastor of Christian Tabernacle church and administrator of the Christian Tabernacle Academy in Lincoln, has one word to describe his coming to Pierre Toussaint: Providential.\n\n\"The opportunities afforded here at Pierre Toussaint Dental Office seem to mesh well with my focus and my desire to serve people who are under-served,\" he said. \"The need was here. It wasn't down in Sussex County. God provided a way that I could connect with the Ministry of Caring.\n\n\"And for 15 years, I think it's been a good marriage.\"\n\nIf there is any doubt as to the devotion Isaacs has for the dental office's mission, one only needs to take into consideration that for the last 15 years he has driven 72 miles to work. That's the distance \u2013 one way \u2013 he drives from his home in Lincoln to the Wilmington location.\n\nIsaacs used to drive five days a week, but now only makes the trip three days a week, although the office is still open Monday through Friday.\n\nWhile a majority of people who go to Pierre Toussaint are in dire need, there is an appreciation that the patients display to the clinic staff that one does not see in private practice.\n\n\"When people are paying for service, they have certain expectations and it can be a more formal business relationship,\" Isaacs said. \"But when people are being served, there's an element of grace there.\n\nBuy Photo Dr. Gary Isaacs (left) lets Rob Roy, 49, of Wilmington in as he arrives in the rain on his bike for his dentist appoint at the Pierre Toussaint Dental Office which has been providing basic dental services to residents across Delaware, including fillings, cleanings, extractions, dentures and partial dentures for uninsured poor patients ages 19 to 64.
