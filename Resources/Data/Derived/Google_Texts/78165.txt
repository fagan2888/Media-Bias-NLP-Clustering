Emergency responders were called to a pedestrian hit by a vehicle around 4 o'clock Saturday afternoon.

Metro ambulance director Clayton Cobler says the child did not receive any major injuries, but was taken to the hospital for precautionary measures. Bystanders tell Newscenter 11 that the child was riding his bike down a hill when a car pulled out onto the road in front of him. Witnesses also say the stop sign in that area is hard to see.
