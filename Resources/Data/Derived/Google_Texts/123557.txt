DeSean Jackson is inactive and will not play in the Washington Redskins’ game against St. Louis on Sunday after sustaining bruises on his legs in the loss to Indianapolis a week ago.



Jackson, who did not practice all week, has only played in all 16 games twice in his first six seasons. He entered Sunday leading the league with an average of 20 yards per reception and had a 942 receiving yards and five receiving touchdowns, both team highs.



The Redskins will also be without inside linebacker Keenan Robinson and strong safety Brandon Meriweather, each of whom were also injured in the game against the Colts. Robinson, who leads the team with 99 tackles, sprained the MCL in his left knee, was unable to practice Thursday or Friday and will be replaced at mike linebacker by Will Compton.



Meriweather, considered doubtful entering the game, sprained one of his big toes and did not practice at all during the week. With Meriweather out, the Redskins will turn to Phillip Thomas, a fourth-round pick in 2013, to make the first start of his career.



Also inactive for the Redskins on Sunday will be third quarterback Kirk Cousins, right guard Josh LeRibeus and right tackle Tyler Polumbus. The team previously ruled out defensive end Kedric Golston, who has been bothered by a strain in his lower back.



Outside linebacker Gabe Miller and cornerback Kenny Okoro, signed off the Redskins’ practice squad on Saturday, are active and should play a role on special teams. They replaced cornerback Chase Minnifield, who was placed on injured reserve after sustaining a concussion in the game against the Colts, and wide receiver Aldrick Robinson, who was waived after being inactive for the last seven games.



Inactive for the Rams will be free safety Lamarcus Joyner, cornerback Marcus Roberson, tight ends Justice Cunningham and Alex Bayer, right tackle Brandon Washington, defensive tackle Alex Carrington and defensive end Ethan Westbrooks.
