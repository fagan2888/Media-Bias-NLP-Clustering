Sioux Falls, SD

On Sunday, a Sioux Falls woman turns 100 years old, and her downtown church held a celebration in her honor.

Georgia Spooner was born 100 years ago Sunday in St. Francisville, Louisiana. Following 2005's Hurricane Katrina, she moved to Sioux Falls. Center of Life Church honored their new centenarian today, with family and friends sharing what Georgia and her one hundred years mean to them.

"Just to have her presence. (She's) one of our elders in our community, it has just been really great," Center of Life lead pastor Judy Shaw said.

When Georgia was born, South Dakota was celebrating its 25th year as a state, and Woodrow Wilson lived in the White House. Today, a letter from Barak Obama addressed to her was read. Following a stroke in August 2013, doctors did not like her chances of recovery. Today, on her 100th birthday, she sang "Amazing Grace."
