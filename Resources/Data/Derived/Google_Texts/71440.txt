If you're looking to add a furry friend to the family, or just get outside and play with puppies, you can stop by Alaqua Animal Refuge's first ever PuppyPalooza Saturday.

The event is benefiting the Unconditional Love program, which provides inmates in local jails and prisons the skills needed to train and provide care to Alaqua animals.

Families are bringing their dogs out for a day of fun at the Aaron Bessant Park in Pier Park, while others had the chance to take home many of the dogs up for adoption.

The Alaqua Animal Refuge is a no-kill animal shelter located in Freeport, where they're known for animal welfare and cruelty prevention.

"Well to me, this is the most important program we have at the rescue, because it gets to save dogs that are on death row that are untrained. We train them, we get them easy adopted, and we also get to give those dogs to homes of people that need them. And we do that free of charge, the therapy dogs," Alaqua Founder Laurie Hood said.

It's not too late to swing by the park. The event will continue until 9 p.m. Saturday.
