And especially in this system, I know what I can do off being 100 percent. So it\u2019s definitely frustrating playing at 85 or 90 percent, when I could be playing at 100.\u201d\n\nMcGee\u2019s inclusion in the game Friday night against the Washington Wizards was far from guaranteed. In fact, the blowout allowed Nuggets coach Brian Shaw to play McGee and see how things went. McGee played the entire fourth quarter and scored two points, grabbed three rebounds and blocked two shots.\n\n\u201cIt felt good,\u201d McGee said. \u201cI haven\u2019t played in like five games, four games. So it felt good being out there.\u201d\n\nMcGee described the pain in his left shin as \u201csometimes there\u2019s just a real soreness. So, sometimes I just have to be cautious of how hard I go. And I\u2019m a jumper too, and it\u2019s a lot of weight jumping. So, sometimes I have to ration out how much I\u2019m jumping on that day.\u201d\n\nAnd that means practices and shootarounds will be done at half speed or not at all in many cases. McGee said he\u2019s still trying to lose weight to take stress off his tibia, but most condition exercises require being on his legs to do it.\n\nRobinson update. Nuggets guard Nate Robinson left the game in the fourth quarter and did not return after taking a knee to the back on a foul by Washington\u2019s Rasual Butler.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had anything like this,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest knee I ever took in my life.\u201d\n\nRobinson is day to day.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets center JaVale McGee unable to escape soreness, frustration", "title": "Nuggets center JaVale McGee unable to escape soreness, frustration", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/05/nuggets-center-javale-mcgee-unable-to-escape-soreness-frustration/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141205__20141206_B5_SP06BKNNUGSBRIEFSp1.jpg", "height": 507}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141205__20141206_B5_SP06BKNNUGSBRIEFSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-05T22:38:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:38:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2270\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The most frustrating part of it all for Nuggets center JaVale McGee is the lingering pain.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely frustrating,\u201d McGee said.\nMcGee played the entire fourth quarter and scored two points, grabbed three rebounds and blocked two shots.\nIn fact, the blowout allowed Nuggets coach Brian Shaw to play McGee and see how things went.\nSo it\u2019s definitely frustrating playing at 85 or 90 percent, when I could be playing at 100.\u201dMcGee\u2019s inclusion in the game Friday night against the Washington Wizards was far from guaranteed."}
