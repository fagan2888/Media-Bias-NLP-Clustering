The 1-year-old TTP is the only program of its kind among Arizona universities and colleges offering nursing degrees.\n\n\u201cIt was pure adrenaline,\u201d the 34-year-old former medical assistant said of that morning last January. \u201cYou see how the unit collaborates, communicates, how it all comes together. We talk about medical emergencies like this in lectures and simulations, but actually being a part of it is amazing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign that I was meant to do this.\u201d\n\nHead is among more than 130 GCU nursing students who have gained practical knowledge and experience and made connections in ICUs, emergency rooms and other units in Abrazo Community Health Network and Banner Health hospitals since TTP began.\n\nDr. Melanie D. Logue, CONHCP\u2019s new dean, said the program is necessary because patients are sicker and health care delivery is more complex than ever. Nurses must be prepared to hit the ground running and function as safe, effective team members, she said.\n\n\u201cEntering into the field of nursing is more stressful now than ever before, and nurses require a high degree of confidence to be successful,\u201d said Logue, who herself completed a nurse residency at Phoenix Children\u2019s Hospital as a GCU student in the early 1990s. \u201cGCU understands the real-world need and is responsive to this need by offering the first program of its kind in the state.\u201d\n\nHead is a stellar example of how the program works: She started her final semester clinical rotation in the ICU in February, graduated from GCU in April and became employed by Abrazo as a nurse extern in May.\n\n\u201cI knew I wanted to be somewhere fast-paced, where I was constantly challenged,\u201d Head said. \u201cThe ICU is that place, and I can\u2019t imagine doing anything else. GCU gave me that opportunity.\u201d\n\nNurses and the future\n\nWith chronic disease in the U.S. at epidemic proportions and expectations for the quality and accessibility of health insurance raised by the Affordable Care Act, multiple sources have predicted a critical shortage of nurses. As Baby Boomers age (and the generation\u2019s nurses retire) and the complexity of health care grows, the Bureau of Labor forecasts 1.05 million job openings for registered nurses by 2022.\n\nAt the same time, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2011 called for 80 percent of the U.S. nursing workforce to have bachelor\u2019s degrees or better by 2020 and for nurse residency programs to be in place. Such programs, the IOM said, reduce turnover and costs, stabilize staff and support newly licensed nurses in the development of their clinical decision-making and autonomy.\n\nTaking the report to heart, Dr. Dawna Cato, a GCU alumna, adjunct faculty member and architect of the TTP residency, got together with other state nurse leaders to form the Arizona Action Coalition. Cato focused her 2013 Ph.D. dissertation on the relationship between nurse residency and evidence-based practice, an increasingly popular interdisciplinary approach. It integrates the best available evidence on a treatment\u2019s efficacy, clinical expertise to identify a patient\u2019s health and appropriate diagnosis, and the patient\u2019s preferences and values.\n\n\u201cIf we empower our new grads, they can transform the profession,\u201d said Cato, market director of professional development for Abrazo, which recently was awarded $661,000 in state funds to establish a workforce pipeline with GCU on specialty fields in nursing.\n\nTyna Williams, chief clinical value officer and regional chief nurse executive for Abrazo and its parent company, Dallas-based Tenet Health Care, said the nurse residency/nurse fellowship program will transform 192 new graduate nurses from novice to expert. The goal is to certify more nurses in areas such as intensive care, emergency department, operating room and telemetry.\n\nResearch shows that as many as 50 percent of newly graduated nurses don\u2019t feel prepared to assume responsibility for patient care, Williams said. TTP gives participating hospitals a close look at a prospective nurse\u2019s skills and personality before making formal employment offers.\n\n\u201cNurses drive patient care,\u201d said Cato, who has a BSN and a master\u2019s in nursing education from GCU. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good at providing research on best practices of patient care. For example, we know what we need to do to prevent a catheter-associated urinary tract infection or pressure sores or falls. We know we can have better patient outcomes if we support the evidence.\n\n\u201cBut education and practice haven\u2019t collaborated as well as they should to put the patient and family at the center of the team.\u201d\n\nCato said \u201cthe reality shock of being a new nurse,\u201d feeling unprepared and unsupported, almost caused her to quit the profession years ago.\n\nFrom classroom to patient room\n\nHead has had the opposite experience at Abrazo Maryvale, where she started out working a 12-hour shift each week.\n\n\u201cI felt very welcomed and had a sense of belonging,\u201d she said. \u201cI learned that if there\u2019s something you don\u2019t know, you\u2019re not going to\n\nbe judged. They help you \u2014 \u2018This is how we do it.\u2019 You learn from that. From day one I thought, \u2018I can see myself staying here for the long term.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnlike other clinical opportunities, in which teams of students regularly rotate from one supervisor, one medical department and one facility to the next, TTP placed Head in the same location with the same preceptor for 10 weeks. That enabled her to build relationships and hone her skills.\n\nHead, who grew up in a large family in El Paso, Texas, in which Spanish was the primary language, loves connecting with the Maryvale ICU\u2019s many Spanish-speaking patients. It feels like home.\n\n\u201cThere was a language barrier, and I felt that even as a novice nurse, I was an important component in closing that gap,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen I see this population, it reminds me of my family. It\u2019s important for them to have that nursing support and to know what\u2019s happening with their loved one.\u201d\n\nCONHCP graduate Megan Easton did her residency in the ER at Abrazo Scottsdale Campus in Phoenix, then started in May as an extern in an even more dramatic place: the Level 1 Trauma Center at Abrazo West Campus in Goodyear.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have the TTP experience, it would have been a huge shock because, although you get to experience a little through rotations, it\u2019s not the full effect of going a couple of times a week, getting to know the staff and how it actually works,\u201d said Easton, 27.\n\n\u201cThis eased a lot of my anxieties as a new nurse. I still have some because it\u2019s a big job and there\u2019s a lot on the line, but I\u2019m more certain about what needs to be done.\u201d\n\nIn June, GCU senior Jordan Prudente started his residency at Abrazo Arrowhead Campus in Glendale, where he is learning about pre- and post-operative care and hopes to be assisting in the hospital\u2019s OR before completing his 109 hours and graduating.\n\nThe 20-year-old is becoming familiar with OR instruments, facilities and medical staff, performing basic procedures and seeing how effective nurses help patients who may be disoriented, fearful or uncomfortable after surgery. Prudente has had to go outside his comfort zone but knows that will build his confidence and boost his\n\nemployability.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little scary to find your way into a team that\u2019s been together for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cBut so far, I\u2019ve met really great nurses who explain a lot of things and are starting to know who I am and my name when they see my purple scrubs.\u201d\n\nExpansion on the horizon\n\nAs of early August, 57 new CONHCP graduates had been hired as full-time nurses through the Banner Health New Graduate Transition Program and Abrazo Community Health Network. More employment offers are forthcoming.\n\n\u201cAs an employer, we\u2019ve seen them in action and that\u2019s huge,\u201d said Karen Josey, Banner\u2019s director of simulation. \u201cFor the student, it\u2019s about bridging the gap between nursing school and practice.\u201d\n\nStudents in the Banner program go through corporate and clinical nursing orientations and electronic medical records training, then are immersed in their specific work areas for several weeks. After being hired, the nurses have 2-3 days of simulation training in which they \u201cwork out the kinks\u201d by repeatedly practicing their skills on a human patient simulator, Josey said.\n\nStudents also learn whether they like the field of nursing they\u2019ve chosen as much as they thought they would, said Noelle Trinder, a Banner RN Clinical Education Director.\n\n\u201cIt might not be a fit for the unit or the student, and isn\u2019t that valuable to find out early on?\u201d Trinder said. \u201cIt really helps with the retention piece.\u201d\n\nThe continued growth of TTP is among Logue\u2019s priorities.\n\n\u201cMy residency helped me to apply my learning immediately, and then I had a job right away,\u201d she said. \u201cThe nurses nurtured me and helped grow me as one of their own. It\u2019s an amazing opportunity.\u201d\n\nAlthough Head\u2019s knowledge, skills, experience and confidence have bloomed in myriad ways since that dramatic winter morning eight months ago, she still repeats the same prayer driving to work every day.\n\n\u201cI ask God to help me get through this, give me strength, give me guidance to be a good nurse,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring my residency and externship, there were times I felt, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u2019 But there was always something that occurred or that I experienced that gave me that assurance: \u2018You can do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nContact Janie Magruder at 602-639-8018 or janie.magruder@gcu.edu.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In its first year, GCU's Transition to Professional Nursing Practice program enabled 130 students to gain practical knowledge and experience in the facilities of two major Arizona health care corporations.
