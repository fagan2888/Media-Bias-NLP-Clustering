(Photo: Submitted photo)\n\nIncumbent congressman Charles Boustany, R-Lafayette, has endorsed Scott Angelle for his 3rd District seat, a seal of approval revealed Friday on Angelle's campaign Facebook page.\n\nAngelle, a Public Service commissioner, former interim lieutenant governor and former secretary of the state Department of Natural Resources, is seeking to replace Boustany, a six-term U.S. representative. The 3rd District encompasses most of Acadiana.\n\nREAD MORE: Angelle shows early strength\n\n\"I am proud to support Scott Angelle for the Third Congressional District. I've worked with Scott to support our farmers, our ports, and to restore our coastline. We fought together against the Obama administration in the wake of the Gulf drilling moratorium and won,\" reads the endorsement touted by Angelle. \"I'm supporting Scott because he's the best candidate to stop Washington's war on oil, repeal Obamacare, and secure our border.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Field says Angelle is not inevitable\n\nBoustany is leaving his House of Representatives seat to run for Senate. If elected, he would replace incumbent David Vitter, who, after an unsuccessful bid for Louisiana governor in 2015, announced he would not seek re-election to the Senate.\n\nAngelle finished third in that 2015 race for governor, just behind Vitter. Boustany endorsed Vitter in that race; there was speculation that Angelle would seek the Senate seat that Boustany is pursuing.\n\n6 are vying to replace Boustany\n\nSix candidates \u2014 Angelle, Greg Ellison, Brett Geymann, Erick Knezek, Gus Rantz and Grover Joseph Rees \u2014 have qualified to seek Boustany's House seat.\n\nREAD MORE: Lots of time before election\n\nThe Hayride, a Louisiana political web site, reported Friday that Rantz said Boustany had promised not to endorse any of the six candidates at the first stage of the election. None of the candidates contacted by The Daily Advertiser said Boustany had made such a promise. Repeated messages to the Boustany campaign were not answered Saturday.\n\n\"Endorsements are not going to decide this race,\" Knezek said in an issued statement made late Friday. \"Career politicians haven't gotten the job done.\n\n\"It is time for the hard-working voters to choose a political outsider with the business experience and fortitude of a veteran to stand up for our Constitutional rights and conservative principles. I\u2019m the candidate who is prepared for this challenge. Failure is not an option for me in this election or moving our country forward.\"\n\nEllison: Endorsement won't matter\n\nEllison, too, said the endorsement would not matter.\n\n\"It's time for good people to step up,\" he said Saturday. He noted that he placed second among the six candidates in a preferential poll, and that he trailed only Angelle in raising funds.\n\n\"We're running hard every day. We're going to be there. We fully anticipate making the runoff.\"\n\nBoustany, Angelle and Dr. Ralph W. Baucum, who is seeking the 4th congressional district seat, share the same fund raiser, The Bautsch Group in Washington.\n\nThat group represented Angelle in the 2015 governor's race.\n\nThe election is scheduled for Nov. 8.\n\nThe runoff, if needed, will be held Dec. 10.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/2016/05/07/boustany-endorses-angelle-congress/84079220/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Incumbent congressman Charles Boustany, R-Lafayette, has endorsed Scott\u00a0Angelle for his 3rd District seat.", "og": {"site_name": "The Advertiser", "description": "Incumbent congressman Charles Boustany, R-Lafayette, has endorsed Scott\u00a0Angelle for his 3rd District seat.", "title": "Boustany endorses Angelle for Congress", "url": "http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/2016/05/07/boustany-endorses-angelle-congress/84079220/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/theadvertiser.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Incumbent congressman Charles Boustany, R-Lafayette, has endorsed Scott\u00a0Angelle for his 3rd District seat.", "title": "Boustany endorses Angelle for Congress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/36baf75fffe5e7eb55ba061de91ab6a33306afc7/c=0-936-3744-4680&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/07/LAGroup/LafayetteLA/635982367553444109-1boustany.jpg", "creator": "@theadvertiser", "site": "@theadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=743844896", "fb": {"app_id": 150147415035780}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Scott Angelle, Charles Boustany, Guy Rantz, Grover Joseph Rees, Gregory Ellison, David Vitter, Brett Geymann, Erick Knezek"}, "article_summary": "Boustany endorsed Vitter in that race; there was speculation that Angelle would seek the Senate seat that Boustany is pursuing.\nCharles Boustany has endorsed Scott Angelle for Congress, Angelle's campaign said.\nREAD MORE: Angelle shows early strength\"I am proud to support Scott Angelle for the Third Congressional District.\nBoustany, Angelle and Dr. Ralph W.
