Information about the cost for different treatments based on the region or even city is readily available online. Consumers can also find the rate the government pays for medical procedures online, which LaMontagne says can often be 25% less than even what insurance companies\u2019 pay.\n\nOnce patients determine the fair price, it\u2019s time to dissect a bill to make sure there aren\u2019t duplicate charges or errors in the billing. \u201cThere are a lot of mistake out there,\u201d says LaMontagne. \u201cThere are a lot of double charges in particular that don\u2019t always get caught right away.\u201d\n\nWhere a procedure was done plays a role in how much patients can negotiate. Under the Affordable Care Act, non-profit hospitals are required to offer patient assistance programs, says Mark Rukavina principal at Community Health Advisors.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to Rukavina, tax exempt hospitals have to officially establish their financial assistance program by detailing eligibility requirements for discounts and possible savings. The programs also have to be made readily available to patients. Hospital can jeopardize their federal tax exempt status by not complying, which means people who are struggling with extraordinarily- high bills will be able to see some relief. Keep in mind that the discounts and relief will vary from one hospital to the next.\n\nWhile for profit-hospitals aren\u2019t required to offer assistance programs, Rukavina says many do, so don\u2019t be afraid to ask. In some cases, a for-profit hospital will reduce the amount owed or create a payment plan to make a bill more manageable, he says.\n\nThere are also state-run assistance programs along with plans from medical device and drug companies that can provide some relief.\n\nThe first step to the negotiation process is for cash-strapped patients to call the health-care provider and be upfront and honest about their financial situation, says LaMontagne. After all, defaulting on the bill leads to credit score damage.\n\nSome negotiation options include offering to pay a reduced rate in cash at the time of the treatment/procedure, asking for a payment plan or hiring an advocate to get the bill reduced.\n\nThere are non-profit and for-profit advocates available, so be sure to research professionals before making a selection. For-profit advocates typically earn a commission based on the amount that\u2019s saved, according to LaMontagne.\n\nWhile hospitals and other medical facilities will often have official policies when it comes to negotiating bills often that isn't the case if you can\u2019t afford your bill from your private doctor.\n\nPrivate doctors often don\u2019t have official policies when it comes to negotiating bills, but that doesn\u2019t mean patients shouldn\u2019t try for a lower rate since the only option for the doctor would be to try and sell the claim to a collection agency for a lot less that a reduction.\n\n\u201cThere has been so many changes in the health insurance landscape and health technology landscape that there\u2019s more opportunity than ever for consumers, patients and caregivers to leverage data available on the internet to get a sense of what prices ought to be and use that data to their advantage,\u201d says LaMontagne. \u201cIt\u2019s less around guess work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-07 10:51:34 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Just because a medical bill says you owe a certain amount--there is some wiggle room.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/02/11/dont-pay-that-total-how-to-negotiate-your-medical-bills.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/02/11/dont-pay-that-total-how-to-negotiate-your-medical-bills/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452223418557.jpg?ve=1", "description": "Just because a medical bill says you owe a certain amount--there is some wiggle room.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Don\u2019t Pay that Total.
