Massive Time Warner Internet outages are being reported nationwide this morning — and on Twitter, the company reports no estimated time for service to be restored.

We're working to restore services to all areas as quickly as possible; no ETR. Tweets will be delayed while this is addressed.

According to ABC News:

More than 11 million residents and companies across the United States subscribe to Time Warner Cable.

“Nothing says good morning like a nationwide Time Warner Cable internet outage,” one person wrote on Twitter.

Frustrated subscribers wrote about the situation online, making Time Warner a trending topic on Twitter.

The web site DownDetector.com, which tracks service outages, showed this spike in complaints during early morning hours on Wednesday.

Still no report on what might have caused the problem. We’ll update the story as more news becomes available.
