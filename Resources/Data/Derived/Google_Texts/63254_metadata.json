There are style points in gymnastics. Here it\u2019s having one point more than your opponent. We\u2019re 12-0. You can\u2019t do better than that.\u201d\n\nThe Hawkeyes (8-0 Big Ten, No. 4 CFP) locked arms and ran to the south end zone to pick up the Heroes Trophy that goes to the winner of this game. Then it was off to the corner to salute their fans before heading to the warmth of their locker room.\n\nThere\u2019s still work to be done to make this season even better. Next stop: the Big Ten championship game in Indianapolis, where the Hawkeyes will play for their first conference title since 2004. Win there, and a berth in the College Football Playoff is a real possibility. Maybe even a certainty.\n\n\u201cThe goal is three more (wins),\u201d said Hawkeyes offensive lineman Austin Blythe. \u201cRight now we\u2019re going to enjoy this one and find out our (Big Ten championship game) opponent on Sunday.\u201d\n\nIowa\u2019s Jordan Canzeri ran for 140 yards on 17 carries Friday and broke long touchdown runs on back-to-back series in the third quarter on a raw afternoon when a gusty north wind created wind chill of 12 degrees.\n\nThe Hawkeyes generated only 250 total yards and were limited to just 44 plays from scrimmage because they went 0-for-9 on third downs. But Nebraska\u2019s Tommy Armstrong Jr. threw four interceptions, with Parker Hesse returning one 4 yards for a touchdown. The Cornhuskers (5-7, 3-5) committed eight penalties, including four personal fouls.\n\n\u201cReally shot ourselves in the foot,\u201d said first-year NU coach Mike Riley. \u201cThe production was crazy different, time of possession, they were 0-for-9 on third down. There was a lot of good stuff in the game. It was those other parts we couldn\u2019t overcome.\u201d\n\nThe Huskers finished with 433 total yards, but Armstrong\u2019s four interceptions were killers.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Iowa football perfect in only place it matters: final score", "title": "Iowa football perfect in only place it matters: final score", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/27/iowa-football-perfect-in-only-place-it-matters-final-score/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__498966586p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__498966586p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T19:46:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T04:40:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It was those other parts we couldn\u2019t overcome.\u201dThe Huskers finished with 433 total yards, but Armstrong\u2019s four interceptions were killers.\nNext stop: the Big Ten championship game in Indianapolis, where the Hawkeyes will play for their first conference title since 2004.\nThe Hawkeyes generated only 250 total yards and were limited to just 44 plays from scrimmage because they went 0-for-9 on third downs.\n\u2014 Iowa certainly didn\u2019t change the minds of critics who say the Hawkeyes don\u2019t look the part of a national championship contender.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be pretty, we\u2019re trying to be productive,\u201d said Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz."}
