Thanks, Bernie Sanders.\n\n2 The Media Must Decide Whether to Follow Donald Trump Down the Sewer\n\n3 The Real Reason Neocons Are So Upset About Donald Trump\n\n4 When Donald Trump Says His Foreign Policy Is \u2018America First\u2019\u2014What Exactly Does He Mean?\n\n5 If Bernie Is Serious About Political Revolution, He Has to Work With the Democratic Party\n\n\u201cMost people excuse their lack of involvement in politics as politics being dirty and politics causing problems,\u201d says Blankenship, \u201cbut the only way to have good government is to have better candidates and elect better people and it\u2019s why we have $17 trillion in debt and an economy that\u2019s declining.\u201d\n\nBlankenship concedes that he is not as active in the political realm as he used to be, though he still gives an occasional phone call to his former colleagues. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the US Chamber and I\u2019ve spoken to the coal associations. You can not just immediately have your hand out to compromise, you\u2019ve got to have belief and you have to stand up for what\u2019s right, not what\u2019s politically correct.\u201d\n\nAfter listening to Blankenship\u2019s short diatribe against the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, I asked Blankenship what should be done about these environmental groups. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to fight them at every step,\u201d he replies. \u201cThe environmental movement isn\u2019t a great cause, it\u2019s a great business.\u201d\n\nTo Blankenship, the EPA\u2019s coal power plant regulations and the mine safety crowd all represent the same ideology. \u201cThe actual UBB explosion was partially the result of the war on coal,\u201d he says.\n\nA minute later, after mentioning that he is going to be late to meet his date for lunch, he makes the connection even more explicit. \u201cUBB is just another example of how willing the far left is to outright lie and of course when I was CEO of Massey I was coached to say \u2018untruthful,\u2019 but really it\u2019s a lie. The reason you know they will lie about the science of global warming is because they lied about the very science of UBB. Their willingness to lie about that solidifies in my mind their willingness to lie about the science of global warming.\u201d\n\nOver the last year, Blankenship has tried to clear his name over the UBB mine disaster. He created a short video and has told almost any reporter willing to listen that the disaster was a freak accident relating to the buildup of natural gas. Reports from workers and subsequent investigations have made clear that Massey Energy\u2019s mines had skirted safety rules and were infamous for allowing a dangerous build-up of methane and other flammable gas. A study from the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University showed that Massey\u2019s corner-cutting had led to the worst safety record of any coal mining company for ten years prior to the disaster.\n\nBlankenship continues to expound on his worldview. \u201cHere\u2019s where I get into answers that are very unpopular.\u201d A wry grin creeps Blankenship\u2019s otherwise expressionless face. \u201cYou\u2019re basically seeing, well, I don\u2019t want to use the word, but the way I describe fascism is the control of people\u2019s lives by the combined efforts of big business and big government.\u201d He rattles off several examples: GE\u2019s getting sweetheart deals from the Obama administration, the bank bailouts, Warren Buffet. Publicly traded companies are increasingly making their money overseas, so they don\u2019t have to comply with domestic regulations, Blankenship says. That\u2019s why they support the Obama administration.\n\nBefore he has to go, he reminds me that his movie on regulation will come out on Labor Day. Its argument, he claims will even sell with union workers, who have been duped by their bosses into supporting anti-mining politicians like Obama and Joe Biden.\n\nWho would better lead our country?\n\n\u201cI love Ted Cruz\u2019s courage with the Obamacare filibuster,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t like Rand Paul as much as father Ron Paul. Like what Rubio\u2019s been saying. Ben Carson.\u201d If he had his druthers, who would he pick for the White House? \u201cI\u2019d reincarnate Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\nWith that, he smiled for the second time in the conference, waddled into his seat and disappeared into a crowd of other libertarian activists.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/coalplant_rtr_img_3-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Lee Fang", "description": "Coal baron Don Blankenship spotted at libertarian Freedom Fest.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Coal baron Don Blankenship spotted at libertarian Freedom Fest.", "title": "Disgraced Coal Baron Don Blankenship Rebrands As A Libertarian Activist", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/disgraced-coal-baron-don-blankenship-rebrands-libertarian-activist/", "image": {"width": 615, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/coalplant_rtr_img_3.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T11:07:00+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Coal baron Don Blankenship spotted at libertarian Freedom Fest.", "title": "Disgraced Coal Baron Don Blankenship Rebrands As A Libertarian Activist", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/disgraced-coal-baron-don-blankenship-rebrands-libertarian-activist/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/coalplant_rtr_img_3.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/coalplant_rtr_img_3.jpg", "width": 615, "height": 462}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "July 28th, 2014", "sailthru.title": "Disgraced Coal Baron Don Blankenship Rebrands As A Libertarian Activist", "sailthru.tags": "Climate Change,Environment,Politics,Blog", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 112307, "keywords": "coal, war on coal, climate change, environmentalism, don blankenship, freedom fest, the nation, lee fang", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "lee fang", "published_time": "2014-07-28T19:38:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T11:07:00+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/"}, "sailthru.description": "Coal baron Don Blankenship spotted at libertarian Freedom Fest.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/coalplant_rtr_img_3-615x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8af4\"", "article_summary": "Publicly traded companies are increasingly making their money overseas, so they don\u2019t have to comply with domestic regulations, Blankenship says.\n\u201cThe environmental movement isn\u2019t a great cause, it\u2019s a great business.\u201dTo Blankenship, the EPA\u2019s coal power plant regulations and the mine safety crowd all represent the same ideology.\nThe reason you know they will lie about the science of global warming is because they lied about the very science of UBB.\n\u201cThe actual UBB explosion was partially the result of the war on coal,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the US Chamber and I\u2019ve spoken to the coal associations."}
