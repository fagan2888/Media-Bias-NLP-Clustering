(AP) - The best chance advocates have to save a Michigan law that promises better wages on public works projects is if Republican legislators ignore a petition initiative and instead let voters decide the fate of prevailing wage.\n\nThe 50-year-old statute requires workers on state-financed government construction projects to be paid local wage and benefit rates, which are based on union contracts. GOP Gov. Rick Snyder supports the law as a way to address a shortage of skilled tradespeople, prompting nonunion contractors and conservative donors who have pushed for its repeal to finance a citizen-initiated measure.\n\nAssuming voter signatures that were turned in last month are certified, the Republican-controlled Legislature will have a window to pass the bill with no possibility of a veto. Right to Life of Michigan has successfully used the method four times to enact anti-abortion measures, most recently in 2013.\n\nBut defenders of the 1965 wage law, including many in the construction industry and Democrats, want lawmakers not to act so that the legislation goes to a statewide vote in November 2016.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of Michigan voters support prevailing wage policies. Let the public decide this important issue,\u201d said Herb Spence III, president and CEO of Spence Brothers, a construction company with offices in Saginaw, Ann Arbor and Traverse City. He recently gathered with fellow construction executives and union officials in Lansing to speak in favor of the law, warning that cost cutting will squeeze apprentice programs and other benefits provided under local agreements between trade unions and contractors.\n\nAbout one-fifth of Michigan\u2019s construction workforce is unionized. But prevailing wages aid nonunion workers, too, particularly when they work on government projects, according to Patrick Devlin, secretary-treasurer of the nearly 100,000-member Michigan Building and Construction Trades Council union.\n\n\u201cWe are building the next generation of construction workers out there,\u201d he said. \u201cLowering the pay scale for workers is not the way to attract, retain or grow a workforce. It simply doesn\u2019t work no matter what industry you\u2019re from.\u201d\n\nMany states began passing prevailing wage measures after last century\u2019s Depression to prevent out-of-state companies from underbidding local employers on public jobs. The federal government has a similar wage law that covers federal projects.\n\nRepublicans say the law inflates costs for taxpayers and makes it harder for nonunion contractors to compete with lower bids.\n\nThe repeal effort has a lot of money behind it: Protecting Michigan Taxpayers, the ballot committee, reported raising $1 million as of mid-July for signature gathering and other expenses. Almost all of the money came from the nonunion Associated Builders & Contractors\u2019 legal and issue advocacy arm in Washington, D.C. ($310,000); ABC\u2019s Michigan chapter ($354,000); and the Michigan Freedom Fund, which has ties to Amway\u2019s founding DeVos family ($380,000).\n\nMcKinley Associates, an Ann Arbor-based real estate company founded by GOP fundraiser and donor Ron Weiser, chipped in $55,000. Weiser and businessman Dick DeVos\u2019 behind-the-scenes efforts were instrumental in Michigan passing right-to-work laws in 2012.\n\nThe ballot committee opposing the repeal, Protect Michigan Jobs, reported raising no money as of mid-July but was formed weeks before that filing deadline.\n\nThe Senate, which passed a separate bill to repeal prevailing wage this year, is expected to approve the initiated legislation. Opponents are hopeful that the House, where Republicans\u2019 edge is narrower, may balk. However, Speaker Kevin Cotter has made scrapping the law a priority.\n\n\u201cWe have the right under the constitution to make a choice,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cI think there\u2019s broad support within our caucus to make the change. If those votes are there, I plan to take the vote.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow David Eggert at http://twitter.com/DavidEggert00", "article_metadata": {"description": "The best chance advocates have to save a Michigan law that promises better wages on public works projects is if Republican legislators ignore a petition initiative and instead let voters decide the fate of prevailing wage.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The best chance advocates have to save a Michigan law that promises better wages on public works projects is if Republican legislators ignore a petition initiative and instead let voters decide the fate of prevailing wage.", "title": "Prevailing wage law: Backers ask for public vote on repeal", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/3/prevailing-wage-law-backers-ask-for-public-vote-on/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/02/5e56e250452db02c830f6a7067003e2e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/02/5e56e250452db02c830f6a7067003e2e.jpg", "description": "The best chance advocates have to save a Michigan law that promises better wages on public works projects is if Republican legislators ignore a petition initiative and instead let voters decide the fa", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Prevailing wage law: Backers ask for public vote on repeal"}, "Author": "DAVID EGGERT", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2ab0\"", "article_summary": "The Senate, which passed a separate bill to repeal prevailing wage this year, is expected to approve the initiated legislation.\n\u201cThe vast majority of Michigan voters support prevailing wage policies.\nThe federal government has a similar wage law that covers federal projects.\nBut defenders of the 1965 wage law, including many in the construction industry and Democrats, want lawmakers not to act so that the legislation goes to a statewide vote in November 2016.\n\u201cWe are building the next generation of construction workers out there,\u201d he said."}
