(KAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe ruling marks the latest setback for Google over its neighborhood mapping project, which has been targeted by privacy advocates for the company's broad collection of personal information from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks. The decision upheld a federal judge's similar ruling two years ago and moves forward a number of class action lawsuits.\n\nThe company already apologized for the data collection and earlier this year settled a parallel case over the project brought by 38 states, including California, agreeing to pay a $7 million fine and take steps to avoid continued privacy violations. But Google has continued to fight the private lawsuits, maintaining the collection, while perhaps ill-advised, was permissible under the wiretap law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Google spokeswoman said the company is disappointed in the 9th Circuit ruling and is \"considering our next steps.\" The company can ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case with an 11-judge panel, or appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nPrivacy advocates lauded the ruling.\n\n\"Landmark decision for Internet privacy,\" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which intervened against Google in the case. \"The 9th Circuit has made clear that the federal wiretap act protects private Wi-Fi networks.\"\n\nHoward Mintz covers legal affairs.
