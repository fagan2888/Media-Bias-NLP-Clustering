Jon Stewart took on this week’s big Obamacare ruling tonight, and mocked all the cable news melodrama over the “huge blow” it apparently was and how big a “mess” it was and how much “chaos” it will unleash upon the political world.

A bit much, perhaps?

Stewart also couldn’t help but notice that another court ruling upheld the same Obamacare subsidy provision that the previous court struck down. He asked and answered his own question about this dilemma: “How did the Republican judges not hold up Obamacare, yet the Democratic judges did? I just… oh.”

But what really bewildered Stewart the most was how all of this could be fixed with just one more sentence being added to the health care law. Literally one sentence.
