He promptly held a presser at the White House, beaming that the Affordable Care Act was \u201chere to stay.\u201d Now, it appears he\u2019s taking his victory tour to Tennessee.\n\nRep. Diane Black (R-TN), a former nurse, suggested that maybe the president should have done a little research before choosing her state to promote his pride and joy.\n\n\u201cDuring his visit to Tennessee, perhaps President Obama will explain why Obamacare customers in our state have been told to expect a 36 percent premium increase next year, despite the President\u2019s promise that his law would save families an average of $2,500 per year. Or maybe he will address the 28,000 Tennesseans who lost their insurance coverage in a single day despite his pledge that \u2018If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\u2019 Whatever the case, the President has picked the wrong location to take a victory lap on the Supreme Court\u2019s irresponsible ruling and my conservative colleagues and I will not relent in the fight to fully repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nOuch.\n\nThe ACA's trail of destruction doesn\u2019t end there. A nationwide CNN poll revealed that twice as many Americans were hurt by Obamacare than benefited from it.\n\nThe pinch was especially felt in Tennessee, where state-sponsored insurance programs, which thousands of residents relied on, were effectively shut down thanks to ACA. Here\u2019s how families found out:\n\nLetters are going out this week to explain the changes to people covered by AccessTN, a program for people who have pre-existing medical conditions, and by CoverRX, a prescription benefits program. The 16,000 people enrolled in CoverTN, a limited benefits plan, have already been notified it will end Dec. 31. Many families also have received notice they will no longer be able to buy into CoverKids.\n\nNo wonder why Rep. Black is sending a message to President Obama that no speech can put a Band Aid on what these families endured.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not a great location....05/26/2016 19:22:28PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Not a great location...", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Obama Takes ACA Victory Tour to Tennessee, Where 28,000 Lost Insurance Coverage", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/06/29/obama-to-tout-obamacare-success-in-tennessee-where-28000-lost-insurance-coverage-n2018790", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/177/2015-06-26T175453Z_1_LYNXMPEB5P0XC_RTROPTP_3_USA-COURT-GAYMARRIAGE-OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Not a great location...", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Obama Takes ACA Victory Tour to Tennessee, Where 28,000 Lost Insurance Coverage", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/06/29/obama-to-tout-obamacare-success-in-tennessee-where-28000-lost-insurance-coverage-n2018790", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/177/2015-06-26T175453Z_1_LYNXMPEB5P0XC_RTROPTP_3_USA-COURT-GAYMARRIAGE-OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama Takes ACA Victory Tour to Tennessee, Where 28,000 Lost Insurance Coverage, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "No wonder why Rep.
