Phil Walls talks about a Phoenix veteran turned away by the VA after telling them he was depressed with suicidal thoughts.

PHOENIX — A suicidal veteran claimed he was denied care at a Phoenix Veterans Affairs facility Wednesday because he did not have an appointment.

The veteran, an acquaintance of Rob & Karie co-host Rob Hunter who wishes to remain anonymous, said he told a nurse at the VA he “was not feeling well” and “did not trust himself” when asking for care. The nurse allegedly informed him that appointments were required and a mental health professional would contact him.

Dr. Sam Foote, one of the whistle blowers who gave life to the VA scandal investigation, said the veteran’s status with the VA could have played a small part.

“If you have an established provider, they can usually grease the wheels for you,” he told News/Talk 92.3 KTAR’s Rob & Karie.
