NBC's Saturday Night Live isn't exactly known as a vehicle for conservative propaganda. Yet on the Saturday, October 26, 2013 episode, which was hosted by Obama-supporting actor Edward Norton, the show dedicated its opening sketch to lambasting the botched healthcare.gov website and rollout of the Affordable Care Act.

Tips given by the sketch include "restarting your computer" and "flying to Canada to buy cheaper perscription drugs."

When you've lost SNL, you know you're in trouble.
