MILWAUKEE — Washington Nationals ace Max Scherzer has lost his bid for a perfect game on a bloop single in the seventh inning by Milwaukee’s Carlos Gomez.

Gomez led off the seventh Sunday with a soft fly to shallow right field that fell just beyond the reach of second baseman Anthony Rendon. Scherzer watched the ball drop, then turned away.

Scherzer had struck out 11 through six innings at Miller Park.

The closest that the Brewers had come to an early hit was a hard bounceout up the middle by pitcher Taylor Jungmann to end the third.

Scherzer had reached base by himself more than the Brewers through the sixth with a single.

The Nationals lead 4-0.
