Rubio, who faced criticism from the right over his work on the Senate bill, now backs a piecemeal approach that would begin with border security.\n\n\u201cI still believe we need to do immigration reform,\u201d said Rubio, who is the son of Cuban immigrants. \u201cThe problem is we can\u2019t do it in one big piece of legislation.\n\n\u201cThe votes aren\u2019t there\u201d in the House of Representatives, he said.\n\nRubio is one of a half-dozen Republicans officially running to be the party\u2019s nominee in the November 2016 election, with more expected in the race soon.\n\nSome critics have accused him of backing away from comprehensive reform to placate conservatives who will play a big role in the Republican presidential primaries. Asked why he would not fight for comprehensive reform, Rubio said he was dealing with political realities.\n\n\u201cThe context in which we are having this debate is much different,\u201d he said.\n\nHe cited Republican House majority leader Eric Cantor\u2019s primary loss last year in part because of his support for comprehensive immigration legislation, as well as Republican opposition to President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order last year easing the threat of deportation for millions of undocumented residents.\n\n\u201cClearly, leaders stand for the idea you need to do something, but you also have to deal with the reality that in the political process people are going to vote based on what they\u2019re hearing from their constituents and others,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Republican presidential candidate who previously worked toward a major bill says changing political landscape requires a piecemeal approach to reform", "application-name": "The Guardian", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Republican presidential candidate who previously worked toward a major bill says changing political landscape requires a piecemeal approach to reform", "title": "Marco Rubio says comprehensive immigration reform would not pass", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/17/marco-rubio-comprehensive-immigration-reform", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431894208431/ae887719-d4b0-4c66-837d-ef2b46af18b7-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=8bdbcd406d9779438ecfb3ccd45a2807", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/may/17/marco-rubio-comprehensive-immigration-reform?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/17/marco-rubio-comprehensive-immigration-reform", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/may/17/marco-rubio-comprehensive-immigration-reform?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431894208431/ae887719-d4b0-4c66-837d-ef2b46af18b7-2060x1236.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/may/17/marco-rubio-comprehensive-immigration-reform?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US immigration,Marco Rubio,US elections 2016,US politics,Republicans,US news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "US news", "tag": "US immigration,Marco Rubio,US elections 2016,US politics,Republicans,US news", "published_time": "2015-05-17T20:28:58.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-05-26T21:53:31.000Z"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431894208431/ae887719-d4b0-4c66-837d-ef2b46af18b7-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=b8655c6b67776d92d88b4bb3d0927b97", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US immigration,Marco Rubio,US elections 2016,US politics,Republicans,US news"}, "article_summary": "Asked why he would not fight for comprehensive reform, Rubio said he was dealing with political realities.\n\u201cI still believe we need to do immigration reform,\u201d said Rubio, who is the son of Cuban immigrants.\nThe Republican presidential contender Marco Rubio said on Sunday he still favours immigration reform, but he has accepted the need for a piece-by-piece legislative approach because \u201cwe don\u2019t have the votes to pass\u201d a comprehensive measure.\nSome critics have accused him of backing away from comprehensive reform to placate conservatives who will play a big role in the Republican presidential primaries.\nRubio, a US senator from Florida, said on Fox News Sunday there were fewer votes in Congress for comprehensive immigration reform now than two years ago, when he worked with Senate Democrats to help pass a comprehensive bill that included a path to citizenship for those in the country illegally."}
