The housing market may be in recovery. And Wall Street has forked over tens of billions to repay the bailouts and settle grievances stemming from the financial crisis.\n\nBut Americans still hate the banking industry. A Gallup poll and companion analysis \u201cWhy It\u2019s Still Cool to Hate Banks\u201d found that only 28% \u201chave a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the banks.\u201d Even though that\u2019s up from the 21% nadir in 2012\u2019s poll, it\u2019s well below the 40% average the banking industry held for the past 35 years, Gallup said. And it\u2019s still well below the zenith year of 1979\u2019s 60% rating.\n\n\u201cFew institutions have seen such a steep drop in confidence in recent years,\u201d Gallup said.\n\nGallup\u2019s Beth Youra notes that 67% of Americans have confidence in small business, but just 21% have confidence in \u201cbig business.\u201d\n\n\u201cBanks are often portrayed as the epitome of big business and all its trappings \u2014 specifically highly paid executives who are out for profit at all costs,\u201d Youra wrote.\n\nSome of the problem for banks improving their image comes from banking\u2019s lack of sexiness. \u201cNobody\u2019s paying $12 for a ticket or subscribing to Netflix to watch a movie about someone who did the right thing the first time. But these are some of the real-life examples of ways in which customers have told us that their bank \u2014 even some of the \u2018big banks\u2019 \u2014 provided them with extraordinary, confidence-building experiences,\u201d Youra says.\n\nTrue. That is a big reason banks have had historically low confidence numbers compared to other industries. On the other hand, 4 million borrowers lost their homes to foreclosure in the financial crisis aftermath. Unemployment soared. People rightly believe that reckless banking was a big reason why.\n\nAnd much of the public\u2019s resentment is fueling the populist shift in Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign as well as the grass-roots effort to draft banking scourge Sen. Elizabeth Warren into higher office.\n\nFor banks to regain public confidence, Gallup suggests some common sense: treat customers better. A valuable lesson might be the S&L crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Banks, perhaps not in response to the crisis, offered more credit to the public and financed a strong period of economic growth.\n\nDon\u2019t bet on much of a shift anytime soon. Banking is too consolidated. Just four banks; Bank of America Corp. BAC, -1.47% Citigroup Inc. C, -1.77% J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.75% and Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +0.10% control more than half of the nation\u2019s assets and deposits. Why would they have any incentive to improve their conduct or services?\n\nThe real problem is a lack of competition, not the public\u2019s confidence.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Scandals and poor relationships with retail customers are keeping this business in the public penalty box, writes David Weidner.", "creator": "@davidweidner", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DD391_dimon__ZG_20150114085336.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "David Weidner", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Scandals and poor relationships with retail customers are keeping this business in the public penalty box, writes David Weidner.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-industry-is-still-hated-by-most-americans-2015-06-24", "author": "David Weidner", "parsely-title": "This industry is still hated by most Americans", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-24T15:46:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Scandals and poor relationships with retail customers are keeping this business in the public penalty box, writes David Weidner.", "title": "This industry is still hated by most Americans", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-industry-is-still-hated-by-most-americans-2015-06-24", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DD391_dimon__ZG_20150114085336.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DD391_dimon__ZG_20150114085336.jpg"}, "article.id": "DACCCE7E-1A9B-11E5-BE55-528AE33840D8", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "That is a big reason banks have had historically low confidence numbers compared to other industries.\nThe real problem is a lack of competition, not the public\u2019s confidence.\nBut Americans still hate the banking industry.\nFor banks to regain public confidence, Gallup suggests some common sense: treat customers better.\nPeople rightly believe that reckless banking was a big reason why."}
