strong voice for fiscal responsibility and government management.\u201d\n\nThe director of the OMB helps the president execute his policies and programs and works to develop his budget.\n\n\u201cHis

loyal and would defend administration goals and priorities even when the result would be unfavorable to the country\u2019s fiscal health.\u201d\n\nSessions said Donovan was probably \u201cstunned\u201d to find out he was nominated to lead the OMB because based on conversations \u201che certainly has not prepared himself for it.\u201d\n\nThe Senate also confirmed two U.S.
