Davin Crampton stormed over Dane Gagai to score late in the second quarter, before former NRL player Rod Jensen touched down a short time later to put the Goannas back within a converted try.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny hope of an upset was swiftly extinguished after the half-time break, as the Knights superior conditioning began to show. Wayne Bennett's men gave us an early indication of what to expect at next week's Auckland Nines, crossing for five unanswered tries in the second half.\n\nHolden Cup graduate Jake Mamo has been included in the Knights squad for the Nines and he showed just how dangerous he will be in the new format, with the speedster scoring a hat-trick.\n\nFellow young gun Joseph Tapine also crossed twice, with the New-Zealand born forward looking to make the jump into the senior ranks in 2014.\n\nFormer Mackay Cutters half, Matt Minto, who remains only on a \u201ctrain and trial\u201d contract with the Knights, had a hand in a number of tries, before crossing the line himself in the 63rd minute, in what was a solid debut.\n\nEx-Raider, Michael Dobson, who has returned to the NRL from the English Super League, didn't quite have the impact of young Minto and it remains to be seen where he lies in Bennett's plans, with Tyrone Roberts and Jarrod Mullen performing solidly at the back end of last season.\n\nNewcastle head to the Auckland Nines having named a strong squad for the inaugural event, with Mullen, Willie Mason and Akuila Uate to make their first appearance in a Knights jersey for 2014.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Newcastle Knights, League News", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "THE Newcastle Knights have got their 2014 campaign off to a winning start with a crushing 52-12 win over the First Nation Goannas at Hunter Stadium on Saturday night.", "title": "Newcastle Knights cruise to win over First Nation Goannas", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/newcastle-knights-cruise-to-win-over-first-nation-goannas-20140208-3295y.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/2/9/8/q/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.3295y.png/1391860429280.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/2/9/8/q/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.3295y.png/1391860429280.jpg"}, "description": "THE Newcastle Knights have got their 2014 campaign off to a winning start with a crushing 52-12 win over the First Nation Goannas at Hunter Stadium on Saturday night.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Newcastle Knights cruise to win over First Nation Goannas"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "THE Newcastle Knights have got their 2014 campaign off to a winning start with a crushing 52-12 win over the First Nation Goannas at Hunter Stadium on Saturday ..."}, "article_summary": "Newcastle Knights 52 First Nation Goannas 12Goannas prop James Livock is tackled by Joe Boyce of the Knights.\nPhoto: Getty ImagesTHE Newcastle Knights have got their 2014 campaign off to a winning start with a crushing 52-12 win over the First Nation Goannas at Hunter Stadium on Saturday night.\nJust as it looked like the Knights would run away with things, the Goannas came to life.\nNewcastle head to the Auckland Nines having named a strong squad for the inaugural event, with Mullen, Willie Mason and Akuila Uate to make their first appearance in a Knights jersey for 2014.\nAdvertisementAny hope of an upset was swiftly extinguished after the half-time break, as the Knights superior conditioning began to show."}
