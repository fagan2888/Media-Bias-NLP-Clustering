Rick Perry turned a tribute to his 14 years as governor into a rabble-rousing speech about the future of American leadership, laying the groundwork for a potential second presidential run after leaving the Texas stage.\n\nIn a passionate speech before almost 10,000 GOP delegates at their state convention in Fort Worth, Perry spoke of Washington failures, Texas successes and putting the nation\u2019s future in the hands of better leaders.\n\nIt is his last address to the Republican activists before stepping down as the state\u2019s longest serving governor in January. But he left little doubt that he was not through with political life.\n\nHe reserved special venom for the Affordable Care Act and for the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 failures in meeting the medical needs of servicemen and women.\n\n\u201cSome states took the bait of Obamacare, and expanded their Medicaid. We did not,\u201d Perry said triumphantly.\n\n\u201cFederal money is not free. It\u2019s the fruit of taxpayers\u2019 labor, and the problem is not states that refuse it but a federal government that so freely spends it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you need any greater proof that government-run health care doesn\u2019t work, ask a military veteran,\u201d Perry said to loud cheers.\n\nTexas has the highest rate of uninsured children and adults. Critics have pointed out that his decision to reject Medicaid expansion has left more than 1 million Texans without health care.\n\nPerry touted conservative principles that have guided Texas \u2013 a list of core talking points he has emphasized for the past four years. They include keeping taxes low, limiting environmental and business regulations and making it more difficult to file lawsuits.\n\nHe said Washington needs to heed Texas\u2019 example.\n\nAnd he dismissed efforts by Democrats to win their first statewide election in two decades.\n\n\u201cThe national Democrats think Texas is the next battleground. Well let\u2019s be really clear: Texas will be their political burial ground,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile praising the Texas economy and baiting Democrats, Perry\u2019s speech frequently employed lyrical words to speak about the nation\u2019s needs to achieve a brighter future.\n\nThroughout his speech he set the tone of a candidate aiming for the White House again.\n\n\u201cWe need to set the stage for 2016 when we will win the White House and we will rebuild the American dream,\u201d Perry said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re too good a country to wander through the wilderness of economic darkness. We must seize our promise at home. We must establish our moral authority overseas. We must live up to our promise,\u201d he said.\n\nHe concluded by telling the Republican delegates to \u201croll up their sleeves\u201d to help rebuild the nation.\n\n\u201cThis America we love faces some hard decisions. And it requires better leaders. Leaders willing to do what is difficult rather than what is expedient,\u201d Perry said, exhorting the crowd to \u201cLet\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n\nIf there was any doubt to his intentions, his wife, Anita, underscored it in her introduction of the governor. While talking of Perry\u2019s 24 years in public office and their journey together, the state\u2019s First Lady said they look forward to the future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to say we both have some tread left on our tires,\u201d she said.\n\nTexas Democrats responded to the Perry speech, saying he is leaving the state with a bleak future, including crumbling infrastructure and schools struggling with insufficient funding.\n\n\u201cTexas is great, not because of Republican politicians, but because of its people and our state\u2019s vast natural resources,\u201d said Democratic Party spokesman Emmanuel Garcia.\n\n\u201cFor all of Perry\u2019s rhetoric and grandstanding we saw today, he left Texans with a neglected state water plan, transportation infrastructure and an unconstitutional school finance system. It will weigh on his conscience no matter where politics takes him,\u201d Garcia said.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wNi9yaWNrLXBlcnJ5LWZhcmV3ZWxsLXNwZWVjaC10by1nb3Atc291bmRzLWEtbG90LWxpa2UtYS1sYXVuY2gtaGVsbG8tdG8tbmF0aW9uYWwtY2FtcGFpZ24uaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Christy Hoppe", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "Gov.
