Sioux Falls, SD

A strange haze with a foul odor hung over the City of Sioux Falls today.

A visible fog could be seen for miles, focused around the center of the city. The National Weather Service says they are picking up the unusual haze on their radars but say they could not pinpoint the exact cause.

They say the smoke was not restricting visibility but did come with a nasty smell.
