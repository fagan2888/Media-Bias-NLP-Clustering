That something was . . . National Review, which dubbed Sasse a \u201cRising Conservative Star\u201d in John J. Miller\u2019s cover stor y , \u201cObamacare\u2019s Nebraska Nemesis.\u201d\n\nIt was a great article. One of many, of thousands, of terrific articles \u2014 editorials, \u201cThe Week\u201d paragraphs, columns, Corner posts, Campaign Spot and Bench Memos and Agenda items \u2014 that we published, in the magazine and on this great website, in just one year.\n\nAll, here on NRO, for free.\n\nHundreds? Thousands? Just how much have you read and enjoyed and commented on and e-mailed and liked and tweeted? Surely, a heck of a lot. Surely too: NRO, with all of its seemingly endless free content, has become an important part of your day, has helped you form and sharpen your beliefs, has provided you with facts and arguments that you have used in all sorts of situations, from sharing with your child who needs help with a current-events report to shutting the yap of an obnoxious liberal cousin who was making some profoundly buffoonish claim.\n\nThat felt good, no?!\n\nBy the way, earlier, did I mention \u201cfor free?\u201d I see that I did.\n\nAh well, \u201cfree\u201d \u2014 that is a matter of perspective. Sure, NRO content is free to you. But that\u2019s it. From the suits\u2019 perspective, NRO is anything but free. Our incredibly wise but poorly paid writers and editors do actually get paid. Our server provider takes only cash \u2014 the bribe of NR mugs was laughed at. As were our attempts to get free software, computers, and all the rest of the gizmos and gadgets and binary things one needs to run a 24/7/365 website.\n\nThis \u201cbusiness\u201d of opinion journalism, of wise and stylish and deeply thought and soundly argued commentary, is usually the . . . toy, if you will, of billionaires who want influence and who don\u2019t mind losing a few million annually on a product that generates little revenue.\n\nNR has no billionaire owner or, for that matter, any sugar daddies. But we do have lots of people who are generous in their way \u2014 many of them with the widow\u2019s mite \u2014 who realize these fundamentals: (1) that NR is, as a business, a money-losing entity; (2) that, regardless of its ability to turn a profit (or, for 58 years, not turn one), National Review\u2019s existence is imperative; (3) that the world would indeed be a worse place minus NR; and (4) that they have a duty to see to it that NR survives. And thrives. And (5) that the only way this can happen is by making a donation.\n\nWhich can be done here.\n\nDo you \u201clive\u201d on NRO? You know what I mean \u2014 spend many an hour here over the course of a week, or even a day. Maybe you don\u2019t live here, but you sure as heck frequent and haunt the environs, right? Whatever you do, you know that NRO greatly enriches your life. You know that NRO is vital, to yourself and to this country. You accept that NRO\u2019s continued existence and growth is dependent on the generosity of friends, readers, users, followers.\n\nYou also know you should do the honorable thing and make a donation.\n\nSo there, I have made my pitch, a windy explanation of the old tale, that there is no such thing as a free lunch. So that must mean this plea is heading into the homestretch.\n\nIt is, but before it ends, allow me to raise two things. The first is a reiteration: No one here gets rich. Frayed khakis from Sears, hole-adorned socks from K-Mart, a small cape with a leaky roof located two hours from the office, a \u201995 Ford Taurus wagon as a sports car, six days a week in the office: This is the life I have chosen, and my colleagues can tell similar stories. We will sleep when we die, and we will enjoy riches if our Powerball numbers are drawn. All this told so you can know that when We Suits spend money, we know we are spending the money of good people who donated it selflessly and who expect that it will be spent wisely, and directly for the causes we mutually embrace.\n\nThe second: This week we had a visitor, Ryan, and his lovely friend, Ella. As often happens, they were \u201cin town: and wanted to drop by to visit NR\u2019s HQ. \u201cOf course,\u201d we said, as we always say, and they come. Like Rich Lowry, Ryan has been reading NR from his early teens, and at some point in his twenties embarked on a project to read all issues of NR EVER PUBLISHED. To the library with its aging bound volumes he went, and went, and went. He has read every issue since 1955 and talked with great affection of this place, this magazine, the website, our writers old, our writers new \u2014 Kevin D. Williamson (he made sure to use the \u201cD\u201d), Michael Knox Beran, Jonah, and Jay being among his very favorites. KDW was in and, as usual, was happy to meet and talk with the couple.\n\nWhat\u2019s this story about? Yes, it\u2019s another anecdotal nice NR experience. But the story is really about how NR makes a difference. In the life of our country. In the world\u2019s fate this past half century. And, profoundly, in the actual lives of actual people. Like Ryan. Like you. To a great degree here, to a lesser degree there, but still, a difference is made.\n\nI am confident NR has made a difference in your life. Help us to continue to do that, for yourself, or for others. For the Ryans.\n\nFor the Ben Sasses.\n\nDonate here.\n\nAnd watch our groovy \u201cdonate\u201d video here:\n\n\u2014 Jack Fowler is National Review\u2019s publisher.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "NR Makes a Difference", "sailthru.author": "Jack Fowler", "news_keywords": "Jack Fowler, Politics, Nation, World", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "| National Review", "og": {"site_name": "National Review Online", "description": "NR publisher Jack Fowler asks National Review readers to do the honorable thing and make a donation.", "title": "NR Makes a Difference", "url": "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/378472/nr-makes-difference-jack-fowler", "image": "http://c0.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/uploaded/pic_FB_052114_D.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/378472/nr-makes-difference-jack-fowler", "description": "Over the following days, you will hear from colleagues (more editorially glorious and esteemed than I) about how truly important National Review is in real political terms \u2014 everything being political nowadays.\n\nI speak, and they will speak, of the Nebraska Senate primary last week, where Ben Sasse bested a field of once-tough opponents.\n\nSomething happened a few months back to change the dynamics of the crowded Cornhusker race.
