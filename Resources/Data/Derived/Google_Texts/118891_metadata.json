Various states have introduced similar versions of this legislation.\n\nThe American Psychological Association defines transgender as \u201cpersons whose gender identity, gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.\u201d\n\nThose in favor of the measure say the proposal is necessary to protect the physical privacy of students against the advances of the transgender movement in allowing people to use the restroom of their choice rather than the one that coordinates with their biological sex.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what these bills are designed to protect\u2014the privacy of 99 plus percent of students who have very serious concerns about sharing bathrooms with kids of the opposite biological sex,\u201d said Jeremy Tedesco, a senior legal counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal organization that supports Nevada\u2019s bill.\n\nTedesco says transgender advocates are \u201ctrying to undo\u201d the way society has regulated the use of bathrooms, showers and locker rooms \u201cfor the course of our country\u2019s history,\u201d and maintains \u201cthe duty is on them to explain why we suddenly shouldn\u2019t care what people\u2019s biological sex is when it comes to a facility where people are going to be in a state of undress.\u201d\n\nOpponents call the policy \u201cfundamentally discriminatory\u201d and say Nevada lawmakers are addressing a problem that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nTod Story, executive director of the Nevada American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told The Daily Signal that he has \u201cyet to see one example\u201d of an individual taking advantage of such policies that would allow transgender individuals to use the bathroom of their choice.\n\n\u201cThere certainly was no proof of a problem that exists,\u201d he said in reference to a hearing on the legislation last Friday. \u201cIf you can\u2019t provide any concrete proof that something is happening, why are you proposing a solution?\u201d\n\nStory, along with many of the bill\u2019s challengers, say the measure is a form of \u201csegregation\u201d because it requires schools to provide \u201cthe best available accommodation\u201d that meets the need of the transgender student\u2014similar to the policy, \u201cseparate but equal.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve been through this kind of situation where segregation was a black mark on the history of the United States, it\u2019s certainly not something that anyone was proud of, so at this point in time when we would segregate individuals according to the facilities they should use in places of public access is reminiscent of the laws that we have worked to eradicate.\n\nNevada\u2019s legislation coincides with an apparent push by the Obama administration to advance lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights by announcing its first-ever \u201cgender-neutral\u201d bathroom in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to provide White House employees and visitors an \u201cadditional option.\u201d The administration is also publicly condemning conversion therapy, which it defines as a practice \u201cby mental health providers that seek to change an individual\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity.\u201d\n\nIn Nevada\u2019s case, to accommodate those who identify with a gender different from their biological sex, the bill requires public schools to \u201cprovide the best available accommodation\u201d that meets the need of the student.\n\nThis can mean \u201caccess to a single-stall restroom, access to a unisex restroom or controlled use of a faculty restroom, locker room or shower.\u201d\n\nTedesco of Alliance Defending Freedom believes the proposal is a \u201creasonable solution\u201d to the riffs between transgender advocates and those concerned with the privacy of students.\n\n\u201cAll the evidence that\u2019s out there, transgender is something that affects the population at far less than one percent,\u201d Tedesco said. \u201cSchools have it within their authority, states have it within their public policy-making authority, to balance the competing interests and arrive at a reasonable resolution.\u201d\n\nBut Story said the ACLU believes the measure is in violation of Title IX and VII, and pledged to \u201clitigate it based on its violation of those two titles.\u201d\n\nTitle VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex (among other characteristics) in the work place. Title IX requires schools that receive federal funds to provide gender equality for boys and girls, as commonly observed in the context of sports.\n\nTedesco says \u201cplenty of courts\u201d have looked at whether the claim of Titles IX or VII covers claims of discrimination on the basis of transgender status and \u201cthe near universal response is no, they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIn order to to apply either statute to gender or sex identity, Tedesco says Congress would have to make transgender people a protected class, which could trigger a national debate similar to that which occurred after Indiana decided to adopt a controversial religious freedom law.\n\n\u201cThis could be the next [Religious Freedom Restoration Act],\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Should transgender students attending public schools be allowed to use the bathroom aligned to their asserted gender?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Should transgender students attending public schools be allowed to use the bathroom aligned to their asserted gender?", "title": "\u2018Bathroom Bill\u2019 Resurfaces in Nevada", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Transgender_041015.png", "updated_time": "2015-04-13T21:09:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PECh2f"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Should transgender students attending public schools be allowed to use the bathroom aligned to their asserted gender?", "title": "\u2018Bathroom Bill\u2019 Resurfaces in Nevada", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Transgender_041015.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "individual freedom", "published_time": "2015-04-13T22:02:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-13T21:09:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "bathroom bill, nevada bathroom bill, LGBT, transgender, discrimination, Nevada ACLU"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce587\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s the question Nevada lawmakers are debating this week, as they consider a bill that would ban transgender students from using a bathroom, locker room or shower different from their biological sex.\nThe legislation, Assembly Bill 375, is popularly known as a \u201cBathroom Bill\u201d because it specifically applies to transgender persons using sex-specific facilities.\nShould transgender students attending public schools be allowed to use the bathroom aligned to their asserted gender?\nTitle IX requires schools that receive federal funds to provide gender equality for boys and girls, as commonly observed in the context of sports.\n\u201cAll the evidence that\u2019s out there, transgender is something that affects the population at far less than one percent,\u201d Tedesco said."}
