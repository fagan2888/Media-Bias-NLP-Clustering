Mike McCarthy can’t wait for Sunday. Can’t blame him.

The thought of clinching the NFC North at Lambeau Field certainly is an enticing one. McCarthy’s Packers can do so with a victory over the Lions, whose recent history in Green Bay is, well, dismal.

Detroit has not won there since 1991. And the Pack is 7-0 at Lambeau this season.

Both teams are 11-4 and the winner still could get home-field advantage throughout the conference playoffs if Seattle falls to St. Louis. The focus is not on anywhere but the Green Bay tundra for McCarthy and his players.

“I think it’s great that Detroit and our records are the same and we’re playing for the title,” the Packers coach says. “Yeah, I think this is exactly how you’d want it. I know it’s how I’d prefer it.”

Especially at home, where the Packers (No. 3, AP Pro32) are 7 1-2 point favorites over the Lions (No. 6, AP Pro32).

Spread should be higher.
