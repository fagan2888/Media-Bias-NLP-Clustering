(By Brandon Riddle) [ View Full-Size ]\n\nAfter a delay that lasted more than an hour, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made his case to a crowd of supporters in Little Rock on Wednesday, inserting a number of Arkansas references as he spoke.\n\n\"Our country doesn't win anymore,\" he said. \"We don't win in trade. We don't win with our military. Look at ISIS, I mean they're laughing at us.\"\n\nTrump's speech Wednesday at Barton Coliseum touched largely on economic policy, including trade with China. He also spoke on his plan for a border fence to control immigration, his proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act and ways to improve the treatment of veterans.\n\nOne of his remarks on Arkansas included saying that Bill and Hillary Clinton \"left you folks.\"\n\n\"Whether you like it or not, they left you,\" he said.\n\nAddressing remarks he made earlier in the day on Twitter, Trump reiterated his claim that Republican challenger Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas committed \"fraud\" in the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\"Oh, that voter fraud. You know, these politicians are brutal,\" he said. \"They are a bunch of dishonest cookies, I tell you. That's one of the reasons I'm doing this.\"\n\nSome left the venue before Trump made his arrival, while others were escorted out of the building for remarks made prior to the candidate's speech.\n\nSeveral protesters were also removed from the building as Trump spoke with at least one shouting an undistinguishable remark as she left.\n\nTrump paused from speaking as one group of protesters was escorted out.\n\n\"I didn't think we'd see that in Little Rock,\" he said.\n\nProtesters had also assembled along Roosevelt Road outside the venue before Trump's speech.\n\nLittle information regarding the reason for Trump's delayed arrival was announced to the crowd before he arrived.\n\n\"[It] was not easy with all the traffic and all the problems, mechanical and everything else,\" he said, adding that he refused a proposal to return to New York.\n\nTrump told the crowd that his appearance had broken attendance records at Barton Coliseum, citing information from a facility official. The number of attendees was not clear, though several seats were noticeably empty.\n\nRead Thursday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "2016-02-03 9:01", "description": "After a delay that lasted more than one hour, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made his case to a crowd of his supporters in Little Rock on Wednesday, inserting a number of Arkansas references as he spoke.", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas Online", "description": "After a delay that lasted more than one hour, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made his case to a crowd of his supporters in Little Rock on Wednesday, inserting a number of Arkansas references as he spoke.", "title": "VIDEO: Trump to Little Rock crowd: Cruz committed fraud, Clintons 'left you'", "url": "http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/feb/03/trump-little-rock-crowd-cruz-committed-fraud-clint/", "image": "http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2016/02/03/Screen_Shot_2016-02-03_at_8.58.47_PM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2016/02/03/Screen_Shot_2016-02-03_at_8.58.47_PM.png", "description": "After a delay that lasted more than one hour, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made his case to a crowd of his supporters in Little Rock on Wednesday, inserting a number of Arkansas references as he spoke.", "site": "@arkansasonline", "card": "summary", "title": "VIDEO: Trump to Little Rock crowd: Cruz committed fraud, Clintons 'left you'"}, "keywords": "Arkansas Democrat Gazette, newspaper, news, state newspaper, statewide, statewide news, local news, daily news, northwest Arkansas, northwest news, Little rock, little rock news, north little rock, classifieds, jobs, Arkansas jobs, employment, sports, Arkansas sports, business, feature, opinion, column, politics, real estate, automotive, cars, advertising, Homes Arkansas, Auto Arkansas, Jobs Arkansas, razorbacks, archive, archives, newspaper archive, photos, photography, calendar, tourism, Wal mart, Tyson, Alltel, Acxiom, j b hunt, Clinton, bill Clinton, Clinton library, little rock, central high, Rivermarket, huckabee, rss, video, news video, entertainment, movie review, outdoors, camping, biking, hunting, fishing, marathon, trojans, university of arkansas, UA, UALR", "fb": {"app_id": 345816788851641}, "msvalidate.01": "8459C5DE4A10EF31C19D7DF9B0FF311D", "verify-v1": "5JzmKoVhew2OYBfLqFCO1lUM6lo4mmRL2iPaOd1Y5WU=", "y_key": "39edafb08bb9ce52"}, "article_summary": "Trump's speech Wednesday at Barton Coliseum touched largely on economic policy, including trade with China.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to supporters during a rally Wednesday, Feb. 3, 2016, at Barton Coliseum in Little Rock.\nTrump told the crowd that his appearance had broken attendance records at Barton Coliseum, citing information from a facility official.\nAddressing remarks he made earlier in the day on Twitter, Trump reiterated his claim that Republican challenger Sen.
