But for busy doctors, it isn't always easy to spend more time with patients.\n\n\"Everyone has time pressures in the hospital. But a few little comments (about) patients' lives show them that you value them as people,\" Nathan Wanner, M.D., an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Utah and medical director of the University Hospital's palliative care service, told the newspaper.\n\nListening is an important skill, said Wanner, a patient experience physician leader at his organization, which is why he introduces himself to patients and then stays quiet so they have a chance to talk.\n\nA report released earlier this year showed that healthcare organizations with a commitment to compassion enjoy both a better bottom line and increased patient and caregiver satisfaction.\n\nThe emphasis on the patient empathy has led many providers to train healthcare professionals in interpersonal skills. It's become an essential part of medical practice, according to Helen Reiss, M.D., director of the empathy and relational science program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and chief scientific officer of Empathetics, which provides training for healthcare providers. Research by Reiss and her co-workers shows that just three 60-minute training sessions can boost a physician's patients ratings. Prior studies indicate empathy is a non-negotiable part of the doctor-patient relationship.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- Read the article\n\n- Check out the Empathetics web site\n\nRelated articles:\n\nThe link between compassionate care and patient satisfaction\n\nPatient-centered care requires physician empathy training\n\nOnline ratings game: To boost PR, many hospitals post their own patient satisfaction info", "article_metadata": {"description": "In recognition of how poor bedside manners could hurt both patient satisfaction scores and finances, more healthcare providers put a higher priority on physician empathy training,\u00a0according to\u00a0the\u00a0Deseret News.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "In recognition of how poor bedside manners could hurt both patient satisfaction scores and finances, more healthcare providers put a higher priority on physician empathy training,\u00a0according to\u00a0the\u00a0Deseret News.", "title": "Physician empathy is key to patient satisfaction", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/physician-empathy-key-patient-satisfaction/2015-06-26", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "empathy training,hospital reimbursement,HR & Workforce Management,Marketing,patient empathy,patient engagement,patient satisfaction,patient satisfaction scores,physician training", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Marketing,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction"}, "article_summary": "In recognition of how poor bedside manners could hurt both patient satisfaction scores and finances, more healthcare providers put a higher priority on physician empathy training, according to the Deseret News.\nTo learn more:- Read the article- Check out the Empathetics web siteRelated articles:The link between compassionate care and patient satisfactionPatient-centered care requires physician empathy trainingOnline ratings game: To boost PR, many hospitals post their own patient satisfaction info\nThe emphasis on the patient empathy has led many providers to train healthcare professionals in interpersonal skills.\nEmpathy--or showing patients that healthcare professionals care about them--is increasingly on the minds of providers and hospital leaders, especially post-Affordable Care Act, with Medicare reimbursements partially hinging on patient satisfaction scores.\nA report released earlier this year showed that healthcare organizations with a commitment to compassion enjoy both a better bottom line and increased patient and caregiver satisfaction."}
