It\u2019s one more reason to think Obamacare is not the fiasco that critics claim it to be.\n\nIn a new paper for the Journal of the American Medical Association, a group of scholars attempt to produce a before-and-after picture of the health care law\u2019s implementation. To do so, they draw on three years of data from Gallup\u2019s ongoing \u201cwell-being index\u201d survey, which asks respondents about health insurance status as well as their access to care.\n\nAmong the survey\u2019s regular questions: Are you having an \u201ceasy\u201d time paying for medication? Do you have a regular primary care physician? Do you feel like you\u2019re in good health? That last question is important because, according to some previously published research, how people answer is a pretty good predictor of mortality. People who say they are in good health usually are.\n\nThe picture from the raw data is a little muddled. The number of people without health insurance has dropped precipitously, from 20.3 percent of working-aged adults before the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage expansion took full effect to 14.5 percent at the beginning of 2015. And the percentage of respondents who say they \u201ccannot afford care\u201d fell from 20.4 percent to 17.8 percent during that same time period.\n\nOn the other hand, the percentage who said they have no personal physician remained basically the same, and the percentage who said they were in \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d health actually increased a bit, from 18.3 percent to 18.8 percent.\n\nBut the researchers didn\u2019t simply pull numbers from the surveys. They adjusted the responses for variables like unemployment, in an attempt to isolate the effects of the health care law from other factors, such as the recovering economy. The researchers also looked specifically at the trends -- in other words, whether access to care was getting worse before the health care law\u2019s implementation, and, if so, whether that deterioration stopped.\n\nThat lens produced a more consistent story. Every trend had been getting worse -- and then, with the health law\u2019s full implementation, either stopped getting worse or started getting better. Lead author Benjamin Sommers, a Harvard economist and physician who used to work at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the difference amounted to 11 million more adults saying they can afford their health care and 6.8 million reporting they were in good health. (Sommers made these comments on a conference call that HHS, which sponsored and reviewed the study, held on Monday -- although the paper itself does not represent the agency\u2019s official view.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Study suggests the law has improved access to care.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-07-29 12:48:17 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Study suggests the law has improved access to care.", "title": "Another Argument From Obamacare Critics Is Starting To Crumble", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-critics-argument_us_55b79f5be4b0a13f9d1a36af", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55b7a6971d00002f00142f54.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Study suggests the law has improved access to care.", "title": "Another Argument From Obamacare Critics Is Starting To Crumble", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55b7a6971d00002f00142f54.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "@citizencohn", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-28 12:48:17 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_55b79f5be4b0a13f9d1a36af", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Affordable Care Act,JAMA,Health Insurance,Benjamin Sommers,affordability,access to care,prescription drugs,drug prices,deductibles,HHS,Health", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Obamacare,Affordable Care Act,JAMA,Health Insurance,Benjamin Sommers,affordability,access to care,prescription drugs,drug prices,deductibles,HHS,Health", "published_time": "2015-07-28 12:48:17 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-07-28 16:29:08 -0400", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/CitizenCohn"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Every trend had been getting worse -- and then, with the health law\u2019s full implementation, either stopped getting worse or started getting better.\nResearchers used Gallup data from a survey that asks people about their health care access and how healthy they think they are.\nIn a new paper for the Journal of the American Medical Association, a group of scholars attempt to produce a before-and-after picture of the health care law\u2019s implementation.\nBut does that mean Americans actually have better access to health care?\nPeople who say they are in good health usually are."}
