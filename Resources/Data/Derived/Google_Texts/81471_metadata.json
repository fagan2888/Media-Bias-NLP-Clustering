(Photo: Tania Savayan/The Journal News)Buy Photo Story Highlights More than 30,000 cancer patients per year are expected to receive treatment at the new center.\n\nMayor says the 2,500 employees at White Plains Hospital make it the city's largest employer\n\nCancer survivors nationally have increased from 9 million to 14 million, says hospital CEO.\n\nWhite Plains Hospital opened its $50 million cancer center Tuesday amid unprecedented upheaval in the Lower Hudson Valley's health care landscape.\n\nThe two-year construction project expanded on the downtown hospital's existing cancer program, and included investments from its parent organization, Montefiore Health System. More than 30,000 cancer patients per year are expected to receive treatment at the new center, up from about 15,000.\n\nAs competition heats up for patients in the region, the 70,000-square-foot cancer facility planted another Montefiore flag in the heart of Westchester County at 2 Longview Ave. Featuring massage rooms, a sleek lobby and waiting rooms that feel more like a hotel than a medical office, the center's parent also has affiliations with hospitals in New Rochelle and Mount Vernon.\n\nOther major health care systems, including New York-Presbyterian, NYU Langone and Northwell Health (formerly North Shore-LIJ), also have grown their presence steadily in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam counties. All this comes in the wake of the Affordable Care Act, which prompted tectonic shifts in how billions of tax dollars flow to hospitals nationally.\n\nA race to treat more cancer patients started over the last decade as medical advances began prolonging their lives. The Affordable Care Act in 2010 also focused on reducing emergency room visits, which were traditionally among hospitals' largest source of income. Hospitals reacted by investing in more stable long-term specialty care, such as cancer.\n\nAbout 100 politicians, business leaders and hospital workers gathered for the White Plains cancer center opening. Many talked about the trend among New York City health organizations pushing northward into the Lower Hudson Valley, which has seen hundreds of millions of dollars invested in its health infrastructure since 2013.\n\nSusan Fox, president and chief executive officer of White Plains Hospital, addressed ongoing efforts to reduce the number of patients traveling to New York City for specialized care. She also discussed how Montefiore's deep pockets affected the new cancer center.\n\nThe cancer center project began as a $25 million expansion, but doubled in size and scope after the 292-bed hospital finalized its partnership with Montefiore last year.\n\n\"We had a vision for having a new cancer center, and we've been able to make the center even bigger than that, and we've been absolutely on budget and on time and closer to $50 million, including the total renovation of one building and adding the second building,\" she said.\n\nWhite Plains Mayor Thomas Roach told the crowd about his cancer treatment at the hospital prior to the expansion. He focused on benefits from being able to remain in his community for chemotherapy, rather than spending hours traveling to NYC hospitals.\n\n\"It's been seven years since I came off chemo,\" Roach said, drawing applause. \"If I had to go to the city it would've been a disaster,\" he said.\n\nRoach also touted the economic impact of health care, saying the 2,500 employees at White Plains Hospital make it the city's largest employer. He described the $50 million cancer center and other recent hospital upgrades as crucial to major investments in its surrounding neighborhood, including a $275 million apartment development proposed for the Post Road/South Broadway/Maple Avenue area.\n\n\"The hospital's rising and the city's rising and together we're going to have a great future,\" he said.\n\nThe Medical Mile\n\nMeanwhile, investments elsewhere in Westchester have underscored the transition to a health-care driven economy.\n\nLast year, WESTMED Medical Group opened it's 85,000-square-foot medical office building at 3030 Westchester Ave.\n\nThat project marked the first time in more than 25 years a new office building was constructed along the I-287 corridor spanning the county. It also reinforced how the corridor, once known as the Platinum Mile, is becoming the Medical Mile as outpatient facilities and medical office buildings replace office parks and gleaming corporate headquarters that once housed titans like Kraft Foods, Texaco and IBM.\n\nAt 500 Westchester Ave. in West Harrison, for example, a former Verizon building became a branch of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Center. The hospital converted the 114,000-square-foot complex into a $143 million cancer center that opened in 2014.\n\nFox, the White Plains Hospital CEO, said another factor in the growth is increasing demand for cancer treatment and other health care. As technology improves, people are living longer and straining the system, which Fox said is transforming to ensure they receive quality care.\n\nSurvival rates\n\nCancer survivors nationally have increased from 9 million to 14 million, she said. The new cancer center's strategy to sustain that progress involves a range of services, from helping patients deal with health insurance companies to providing rooms for holistic treatments like aromatherapy and acupuncture.\n\n\"Our goal is to keep them healthy as possible as long as possible,\" Fox said.\n\nCancer rates in the Lower Hudson Valley also reflect demand, with Putnam County (at 1,066 per 100,000) slightly higher than Rockland (1,044) and Westchester (1,016), state data show.\n\nThe cancer center is among several upgrades at White Plains since Fox took over as CEO last year, replacing Jon Schandler, who ended his nearly 35 years leading the hospital.\n\nMuch of the investment at area hospitals followed reforms under the Affordable Care Act, which changed how state and federal governments pay for Medicare and Medicaid, the health insurance programs for elderly, disabled and low-income. The programs cover nearly half of the more than 319 million people in the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, fears of growing demand loom large as the 75 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964 \u2014 the baby boomers now ages 52 to 70 \u2014 enter the ranks of the most expensive health care demographic.\n\nOne of those baby boomers shared her story at the White Plains cancer center opening. Louanne Mitchell, 54, of Yonkers, told of the treatment she received since her stage-four cancer diagnosis in 2013. She ended by thanking her doctors and announcing she has been given a clean bill of health. The crowd's applause roared as she was given flowers and hugs while leaving the podium.\n\nAddressing how she went from feeling numb post-diagnosis to renewing her life, Mitchell smiled and said: \"It's been an incredible journey.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1TE8la1", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "New York health care upheaval part of national trend of partnerships, mergers, and a focus on long-term specialty care", "og": {"site_name": "lohud.com", "description": "New York health care upheaval part of national trend of partnerships, mergers, and a focus on long-term specialty care", "title": "Westchester's hospitals expand amid New York City's push northward", "url": "http://www.lohud.com/story/news/2016/02/23/westchesters-hospitals-expand-amid-new-york-citys-push-northward/80793740/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lohud.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New York health care upheaval part of national trend of partnerships, mergers, and a focus on long-term specialty care", "title": "Westchester's hospitals expand amid New York City's push northward", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fcbd372e3d76d81fff03374af863fe91fe88eb2c/c=842-0-4682-3840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/23/Westchester/Westchester/635918302611153853-ts022316wpcancer14.jpg", "creator": "@lohud", "site": "@lohud", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600070416", "fb": {"app_id": 169889109713077}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "New York, Westchester hospital, health care, Montefiore, White Plains Hospital, New York-Presbyterian Hospital ,NYU Langone, Northwell Health, Affordable Care Act"}, "article_summary": "White Plains Hospital opened its $50 million cancer center Tuesday amid unprecedented upheaval in the Lower Hudson Valley's health care landscape.\nBuy Photo Dr. Yael Zack attends a ceremony for the White Plains Hospital's new Center for Cancer Care, Feb. 23, 2016.\nOne of those baby boomers shared her story at the White Plains cancer center opening.\nRoach also touted the economic impact of health care, saying the 2,500 employees at White Plains Hospital make it the city's largest employer.\nMayor says the 2,500 employees at White Plains Hospital make it the city's largest employerCancer survivors nationally have increased from 9 million to 14 million, says hospital CEO."}
