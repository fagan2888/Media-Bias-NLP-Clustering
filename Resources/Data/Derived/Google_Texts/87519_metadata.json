What follows is an instructive lesson in the speed of the news cycle and how incorrect information takes on a life of its own.\n\nLast week, Ryan Lizza, a Washington correspondent with the New Yorker, did what I and many other journalists have done in the past three weeks: He attempted to sign up for an account on healthcare.gov, the federal government\u2019s health insurance marketplace site.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened:\n\nHuh, I just tested http://t.co/IV0cLrFUr3 for the first time and I was able to set up an account with no trouble. \u2014 Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) October 17, 2013\n\nHe even tweeted screengrabs showing the steps of his \u201csuccess.\u201d\n\nIt seems to work... pic.twitter.com/1e0VxrY7kc \u2014 Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) October 17, 2013\n\nNext step worked too. It verified my identity. pic.twitter.com/RcS0yLkWeL \u2014 Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) October 17, 2013\n\nBut within 40 minutes, he realized what the rest of us already had: His apparent success was illusive.\n\nGot all the way to the end on http://t.co/BAwCWsojC5 and then it got hung up trying to submit app pic.twitter.com/rdVraRoJU0 \u2014 Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) October 17, 2013\n\nSo, yes, http://t.co/IV0cLrFUr3 is still broken. \u2014 Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) October 17, 2013\n\nBut at this point, it was too late. His initial tweet caught fire, being retweeted within the White House and even by Press Secretary Jay Carney.\n\nLizza kept tweeting his problems, but those tweets didn\u2019t get noticed by federal officials.\n\nTried healthcare dot gov again. Still broken. Can set up an account and get identity verified, but can't view eligibility results or enroll. \u2014 Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) October 19, 2013\n\nThis is what it looks like when you hit \"View Eligibility Results\" pic.twitter.com/Dw5bNiqyzs \u2014 Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) October 19, 2013\n\n.@PressSec Jay, that tweet is very outdated. As I've subsequently noted on Twitter and on CNN, the site is still broken. \u2014 Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) October 19, 2013\n\nWhen I flagged him online that he had become a \u201csuccess story,\u201d he said he shouldn\u2019t be considered one.\n\nAnd to think @RyanLizza, HHS official @HealthCareTara retweeted your apparent early success with @HealthCareGov. Not so much now. @ericuman \u2014 Charles Ornstein (@charlesornstein) October 19, 2013\n\n@charlesornstein @healthcaretara @healthcaregov @ericuman ugh, she should delete that or RT a more current one. It's misleading. \u2014 Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) October 19, 2013\n\nYesterday, I emailed Lizza and asked if he\u2019d been back to the site. He said he hadn\u2019t yet. But he had strong thoughts about the way in which his initial tweet was used. His email to me:\n\nIt seems that the web site launch was such a disaster that the White House was incredibly desperate to retweet any shards of good news. I considered deleting that tweet because after two senior White House officials retweeted it, it took off and left the false impression that my conclusion was that the site worked, which isn\u2019t the case. It was the Twitter equivalent of blurbing a book using the one positive line from a review that actually trashed the book.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Lizza\u2019s experience was similar to mine (but his was magnified). Here\u2019s mine in a few tweets:\n\nSo, I just tested @healthcaregov for the first time and was able to complete my application in 15 minutes. No prob. @ddiamond @philgalewitz \u2014 Charles Ornstein (@charlesornstein) October 8, 2013\n\nPerhaps I spoke too soon. After submitting my application, I'm getting errors I didn't encounter before @ddiamond @philgalewitz \u2014 Charles Ornstein (@charlesornstein) October 8, 2013\n\nMany have retweeted my initial success with @healthcaregov website. It was premature. The site keeps failing. https://t.co/56Kux7r8xG \u2014 Charles Ornstein (@charlesornstein) October 12, 2013\n\nThe moral of the story: Be careful with your first tweet. Even if you later amend it, it could take on a life of its own.\n\nLike this story?
