The outside visibility of buildings was almost entirely obscured by rain and clouds.\n\nThe storm forced authorities to close a section of Interstate 17 in Phoenix, with no estimated time for when the freeway would re-open.\n\nBranches and debris littered streets around the city and at least one traffic light was knocked over. Some trees were toppled by the ensuing wind. The Salt River Project utility said that more than 14,000 customers were without power.\n\nMost of the outages were in west and northwest Phoenix, with smaller clusters reported in Scottsdale, Mesa and Tempe. Utility officials estimated that power would be restored sometime Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe weather was a mix of Phoenix\u2019s first fall storm and leftover monsoon moisture, National Weather Service meteorologist Marvin Percha said. Between \u00bd inch and 1 inch of rain was expected with more in localized spots.\n\nIn southeast Nevada\u2019s rural Moapa Valley, heavy rains brought flooding but authorities say that despite a river cresting at a record high, the damage wasn\u2019t as bad as what was caused by high waters in the area earlier in the month.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Southwest storms knock over trees, drench Phoenix", "title": "Southwest storms knock over trees, drench Phoenix", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Southwest storms knock over trees, drench Phoenix", "title": "Southwest storms knock over trees, drench Phoenix", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/27/southwest_storms_knock_over_trees_drench_phoenix/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/arizona-storms.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Southwest storms knock over trees, drench Phoenix", "title": "Southwest storms knock over trees, drench Phoenix", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/arizona-storms.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Terry Tang", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9eac\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Intense storms swept through the Southwest on Saturday, snapping trees and shrouding metropolitan Phoenix in cascading showers while also bringing flooding to parts of Nevada.\nThe skies above downtown Phoenix were completely gray in the afternoon as strong winds, thunder and rain hit the region.\nBetween \u00bd inch and 1 inch of rain was expected with more in localized spots.\nMost of the outages were in west and northwest Phoenix, with smaller clusters reported in Scottsdale, Mesa and Tempe.\nThe storm forced authorities to close a section of Interstate 17 in Phoenix, with no estimated time for when the freeway would re-open."}
