If a shutdown happens again, we would have to close the crisis shelter.\u201d\n\nWhile the organization always looks for private donations, they also seek help from volunteers, which can go a long way to keep services running, Humphrey said.\n\nThe plight of domestic and sexual violence programs during the 16-day shutdown was eclipsed by public attention to the closing of national parks and monuments.\n\nAlthough several members of congress proposed offering piecemeal legislation to open the parks to visitors despite the shutdown, none offered to do the same for domestic violence shelters, many of which lost funding on October 1.\n\n\u201cI love the national parks,\u201d said Southworth. \u201cBut I was heartbroken to hear the speeches about [saving] them when at the same time shelters weren\u2019t able to access their funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot everyone understands how pervasive domestic violence is,\u201d Southworth added. \u201cOne in three women will be assaulted by an intimate partner in her lifetime\u2014that\u2019s not a small special interest group. That\u2019s a huge swath of our community.\u201d\n\nThreats to Grant Funds\n\nNonprofits with government grant funding typically provide services first and then get reimbursed by the government.\n\nWhen the federal shutdown began, organizations across the country were told they would no longer be able to access the grant money they rely on.\n\nManagers of programs that provide critical services to victims of domestic and sexual violence had no way of knowing how long they would be without the funding they receive from congressional appropriations through the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).\n\nMany of those programs are operated by \u201csmall organizations that run on shoestring budgets and count on a steady stream of federal dollars coming in at exact times on the calendar\u201d to figure out their budget, Mai Fernandez, executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime, said in an interview.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t usually have reserves or lines of credit to fall back on; so when the federal government pulls the kind of stuff they\u2019re pulling now, there is no safety net for these organizations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Service providers worry that in 90 days, they could be denied grant money that helps keep their doors open", "title": "Domestic violence centers may not survive the next shutdown", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Service providers worry that in 90 days, they could be denied grant money that helps keep their doors open", "title": "Domestic violence centers may not survive the next shutdown", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/19/domestic_violence_centers_may_not_survive_the_next_shutdown/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/8553979620_b3dbba37201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Service providers worry that in 90 days, they could be denied grant money that helps keep their doors open", "title": "Domestic violence centers may not survive the next shutdown", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/8553979620_b3dbba37201.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Deirdre Bannon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Congress, domestic violence, The Crime Report", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Congress, domestic violence, The Crime Report, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on The Crime Report, the nation's largest criminal justice news source.\nWhile the 11th-hour vote reached by Congress Wednesday effectively reopened the federal government, the 16-day shutdown left deep scars on domestic violence and rape crisis centers that rely on federal funding to provide life-saving services.\nThe plight of domestic and sexual violence programs during the 16-day shutdown was eclipsed by public attention to the closing of national parks and monuments.\nThat\u2019s a huge swath of our community.\u201dThreats to Grant FundsNonprofits with government grant funding typically provide services first and then get reimbursed by the government.\nAlthough several members of congress proposed offering piecemeal legislation to open the parks to visitors despite the shutdown, none offered to do the same for domestic violence shelters, many of which lost funding on October 1."}
