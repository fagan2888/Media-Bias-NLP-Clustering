NEW ORLEANS (AP) â€” The first weekend of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival is wrapping up.

The high-profile performances Sunday include the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nick Jonas who will close their respective stages.

The festival is seven days of rock, R&B, jazz, gospel and other types of music and lectures across 12 stages.

While there are a number of big-name, out-of-state acts, the festival features a vast array of local talent.

The Imagination Movers, a rock group for kids that wears blue coveralls and shoots toilet paper into the audience, will perform on the Gentilly Stage.

The New Orleans Suspects, a band that longtime Radiators' bass player Reggie Scanlan helped create, performs on the Acura Stage.
