A libertarian Republican who voted for Ron Paul in 2012 and believes that Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is the future of the GOP, Pittman sees Barack Obama\u2019s presidency as a \u201cfailure\u201d who hasn\u2019t lived up to the nation\u2019s expectations.\n\nBut on Tuesday morning, Pittman logged on to HealthCare.gov and after some initial glitches and delays, successfully enrolled in a Bronze-level Obamacare health insurance plan. \u201cIt took me all day, really,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cIt kicked me out and told me you have to try again, but I knew what I was getting into with so many people exploring it.\u201d\n\nThough he initially supported repealing the law, Pittman became curious about Obamacare in the days and weeks before it launched. For years, he had gone uninsured, thinking he\u2019d be able to \u201cget over anything with a bandaid and a six pack of beer.\u201d But a lead poisoning incident earlier this year shook his confidence and bank account, leading him with tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills. \u201cI was a healthy person and it really depleted me financially, so it made me look at things in a different way than I would before. I understood the importance of people being insured.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen first hand people hitting up the emergency room for free health care and then putting a burden on [everyone else] and that\u2019s not something I would want to do, I want to take personal responsibility \u2026 By no means am I trying to take a government handout\u2026it\u2019s not a free handout, you\u2019re paying for this health care, but it\u2019s making it more accessible to more people.\u201d\n\nAsked what he liked about Obamacare, Pittman highlighted its prohibition against denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, noting that he wouldn\u2019t be able to find coverage without it, and said that the policies offered in the marketplace seemed more affordable and comprehensive than those available to him on the individual market. \u201cYou may pay $18 a month [for a cheaper plan] and you\u2019re missing a level of coverage. It\u2019s not as easy as you\u2019re going to pay this much a month,\u201d he says.\n\nGovernment data shows that premiums for an individual Blue Cross and Blue Shield Bronze-level plan in Montgomery County, Alabama averages $160 per month for a 27-year old. An older adult will pay $273 per month.\n\nPittman doesn\u2019t believe that Obamacare is perfect, but says Republicans in Congress should stop trying to repeal the law and give it a chance to work. \u201cAs a Republican, I think [the GOP\u2019s repeal effort] is childish and I think this is the wrong way to lead\u2026 it\u2019s babyish and I think as a party it just reflects negatively upon us,\u201d he explains.\n\nHe predicts that other conservatives will set aside their party politics and do what they feel is best for themselves and their families. \u201cI think there are Republicans that are all types of people who are making these decisions and they\u2019re not basing them on political party. It\u2019s just common sense kind of things. And I think that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to make a change in this country if people start thinking on those lines, instead of political party lines.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Joshua Pittman doesn't believe that Obamacare is perfect, but says Republicans in Congress should stop trying to repeal the law and give it a chance to work.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Joshua Pittman doesn't believe that Obamacare is perfect, but says Republicans in Congress should stop trying to repeal the law and give it a chance to work.", "title": "How A Rand Paul Republican From Alabama Learned To Love Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/10/04/2730801/joshua-pittman/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-shot-2013-10-04-at-9.04.32-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Joshua Pittman doesn't believe that Obamacare is perfect, but says Republicans in Congress should stop trying to repeal the law and give it a chance to work.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-shot-2013-10-04-at-9.04.32-AM-320x213.png", "title": "How A Rand Paul Republican From Alabama Learned To Love Obamacare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-shot-2013-10-04-at-9.04.32-AM.png", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-shot-2013-10-04-at-9.04.32-AM.png", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-04T08:39:07+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd87cc\"", "article_summary": "Health How A Rand Paul Republican From Alabama Learned To Love Obamacare CREDIT:Joshua Pittman of Montgomery, AL CREDIT: RSVP MontgomeryJoshua Pittman is a 31-year-old self-employed videographer from Montgomery, Alabama.\nBut on Tuesday morning, Pittman logged on to HealthCare.gov and after some initial glitches and delays, successfully enrolled in a Bronze-level Obamacare health insurance plan.\n\u201cYou may pay $18 a month [for a cheaper plan] and you\u2019re missing a level of coverage.\nA libertarian Republican who voted for Ron Paul in 2012 and believes that Sen.
