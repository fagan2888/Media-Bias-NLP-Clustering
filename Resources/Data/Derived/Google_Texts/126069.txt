Sioux Falls, SD

With it being the unofficial start to the summer season, you might be in search of that summertime glow. But skin cancer is on the rise.

For years people have soaked up the sun in search of a gorgeous glow.

"It makes me give a nice, little glow," sunless tanner Darci Guerra said.

Now more people are heading indoors for a UV-free tan.

"I sunless about once a week," Darci Guerra said.

Darci Guerra is one of a growing number of women using sunless tanning booths.

"It gives me that flawless look. It smoothes my face, and covers some freckles. I am a mommy, so it covers some of those imperfections I have on the side," Guerra said.

Your sunless tan can last a day, or a week, depending on what you do before, during and after your application.

Stacey Burkhart, the district manager at Sun Tan City, says you should moisturize and exfoliate before hitting the sunless booth.

"There's different types of exfoliants. You want to get that dead skin off because dead skin can't tan in the bed or the sunless unit as well," Burkhart said.

Whether you head to a booth or put lotion on at home by yourself, make sure you choose the right shade and apply evenly.

"Not everyone is going to have the same color. We're going to find out what best fits you," Burkhart said.

Right after your sunless tan, it's also not a bad idea to try a tan extender, and drink plenty of water.

"That's how your skin keeps hydrated--water and products that keep your skin moisturized," Burkhart said.

You also want to wait four to six hours after a tan to work out, shower or swim.

"A lot of people want to get fast, instant results. That's a great way to do it," Burkhart said.

For Guerra, it's a great way to get a summer tan without the fear of skin cancer.

"As a mom, I want to be healthy as long as I can for my young ones. It is a healthier way to maintain a great color," Guerra said.

Pregnant women should consult a doctor before hitting a sunless tanning booth.
