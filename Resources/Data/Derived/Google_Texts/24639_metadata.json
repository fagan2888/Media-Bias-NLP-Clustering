But he came to mind as I watched Tony Carter\u2019s accidental awesomeness Sunday against the New York Giants.\n\nIf you recall, it was the first play of the fourth quarter, Broncos up 24-16, while the Giants had a second-and-2 from their own 28-yard line. Denver defensive back Carter cut in front of receiver Rueben Randle and batted the pass with his left hand. (\u201cRandle allows Carter to come underneath him,\u201d CBS\u2019 Phil Simms said on the broadcast. \u201cThat\u2019s a sin on those in routes.\u201d)\n\nBut then, one of the highlights of the day was cooked up in a jambalaya of gravity, timing and luck.\n\n\n\nAs Carter lunged forward, the batted ball landed on the back heel of his left foot, which Carter kicked into the air \u2014 and into the arms of teammate Chris Harris for an interception.\n\nIt was Ibra-esque. The soccer wizard has scored numerous goals with his back heel over the years \u2014 here are a couple classics:\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was definitely some luck right there,\u201d Harris told reporters after the game of the Carter-Harris play, \u201cbut you\u2019ve still got to catch it and I was able to be there in the right spot and make a play. Not every pick is going to come right in your hands. I was lucky it came my way.\n\n\u201cThe tip that he made wasn\u2019t luck. We knew from watching the Cowboys. \u2026 I mean look how many interceptions the Cowboys had off of tips and overthrows. \u2026 There are a lot of tips and overthrows, so we were getting ready for that.\u201d\n\nA lot is made about how the Broncos are thriving without the services of Von Miller, a top-three defensive player in the league, but Denver is without Champ Bailey too. Though Bailey told The Denver Post\u2019s Mark Kiszla that he\u2019ll try to play next Monday against the Oakland Raiders, other players are making plays, notably Harris with two interceptions in two games thus far. Denver totaled four INTs off Peyton\u2019s little brother, though Denver defensive backs committed eight penalties in the game.\n\nBut Denver is 2-0, and while it waits for Champ to heal, it\u2019ll seemingly rely on its heel. (See what I did there? Pretty bad.)\n\nAs for the most famous football-kick-that-wasn\u2019t-an-actual-football kick? Probably Nebraska against my alma mater Missouri, back in 1997.
