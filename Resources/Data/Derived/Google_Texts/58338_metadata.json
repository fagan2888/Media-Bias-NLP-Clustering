Martin Luther King Jr. dedicated his life to much more than achieving racial equality. That goal, he said again and again, was inseparable from alleviating poverty and stopping war. And he reiterated this theme after being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 50 years ago this week.\n\n\u201cI refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war, that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality,\u201d he said in his Nobel acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cSooner or later, all the people of the world will have to discover a way to live together in peace.\u201d\n\nHalf a century later, it\u2019s obvious that enormous progress has been made toward overcoming racial discrimination \u2014 that King was right in his vision about race. Yet widespread poverty remains, in America and beyond, and bombs still fall as brutal wars rage on.\n\nWas King naive? Was his full vision simply unobtainable \u2014 do free markets require poor people to function, and will war always assert itself as a defining human habit?\n\nIs King\u2019s Nobel vision relevant five decades later?\n\nAbsolutely, insist some who study King\u2019s life and philosophy. They say his racial proclamations and strategies, so controversial back then but now part of the American cultural canon, can and should apply to today\u2019s stubborn issues of poverty and war.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think his vision has ever been more relevant,\u201d says Paul Chappell, a West Point graduate who served in Iraq and now teaches and writes books about peace. \u201cThe problem is, people don\u2019t realize how prophetic King was.\u201d\n\nChappell, the Peace Leadership Director for the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, which seeks a world without nuclear weapons, says a close examination of King\u2019s life and work shows he predicted today\u2019s protests over income inequality and trillions of war dollars drained from America\u2019s budgets.\n\n\u201cHe realized that American military intervention is not only harmful to people around the world, it\u2019s also harmful to the American people,\u201d Chappell says.\n\nThe peace prize for King, then just 35 years old, honored a Southern preacher whose philosophy, courage and oratory galvanized the civil rights movement, on whose behalf he said he accepted it. It gave a unique international recognition to the movement\u2019s accomplishments at a pivotal time.\n\nThe prize was announced on October 14, 1964, against a backdrop of the Civil Rights Act, whose passage earlier that year finally granted black Americans full citizenship. But it also came as the nation approached all-out war in Vietnam. King accepted the award in Oslo, Norway, on December 10, and the following day delivered the traditional Nobel lecture.\n\nIn his remarks, King returned to a lifelong theme of describing a world where love and compassion could conquer poverty and conflict. His strategies were based on nonviolence \u2014 \u201cthe need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to violence and oppression,\u201d as he said in his speech.\n\n\u201cThe foundation of such a method is love,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Nobel speeches really are neglected gems of how long-term progress against these evils requires a great commitment of mind and spirit and cooperation all rolled into one,\u201d says the historian Taylor Branch, author of the definitive trilogy \u201cAmerica in the King Years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s na\u00efve,\u201d Branch says. \u201cI think he\u2019s saying, if there\u2019s hope, it\u2019s through nonviolent cooperation and really applying it with courage and all your heart and your mind against the evils that still plague the world.\u201d\n\nBranch says that even though dozens of countries are at war today, levels of global violence and large-scale casualties have been declining since the mid-20th century. By that measure, there has been progress toward King\u2019s dream of peace.\n\nKing used his Nobel lecture to expand on the connections between racism, poverty and war.\n\n\u201cEach of these problems, while appearing to be separate and isolated, is inextricably bound to the other,\u201d he said.\n\nUsing nonviolence to achieve racial progress, King said, meant people \u201chave taken suffering upon themselves instead of inflicting it on others . It has meant that we do not want to instill fear in others or into the society of which we are a part.\u201d\n\nThat society is far bigger than America, King stated. It is the human family.\n\n\u201cWe have inherited a big house, a great \u2018world house\u2019 in which in which we have to live together \u2014 black and white, Easterners and Westerners, Gentiles and Jews, Catholics and Protestants, Moslem and Hindu, a family unduly separated in ideas, culture, and interests who, because we can never again live without each other, must learn, somehow, in this one big world, to live with each other,\u201d King lectured.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Measuring MLK\u2019s peace prophecy, 50 years later", "author": "Jesse Washington", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Measuring MLK\u2019s peace prophecy, 50 years later", "title": "Measuring MLK\u2019s peace prophecy, 50 years later", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/12/measuring_mlks_peace_prophecy_50_years_later/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/the-sixties-at-50-mlk\u2019s-nobel.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Measuring MLK\u2019s peace prophecy, 50 years later", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/the-sixties-at-50-mlk\u2019s-nobel.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Measuring MLK\u2019s peace prophecy, 50 years later", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Measuring MLK\u2019s peace prophecy, 50 years later", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09a8\"", "article_summary": "And he reiterated this theme after being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 50 years ago this week.\nUsing nonviolence to achieve racial progress, King said, meant people \u201chave taken suffering upon themselves instead of inflicting it on others .\nIs King\u2019s Nobel vision relevant five decades later?\nKing used his Nobel lecture to expand on the connections between racism, poverty and war.\nThat goal, he said again and again, was inseparable from alleviating poverty and stopping war."}
