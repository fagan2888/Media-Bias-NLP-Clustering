Though \u201cX-Men: Days of Future Past\u201d was already in its second week of release, the feat is still quite remarkable because of the many identifiable faces, from Hugh Jackman to Ian McKellen to Jennifer Lawrence \u2014 and their corresponding quadrants \u2014 to which the X-sequel appealed. In contrast, check the promotional material for \u201cMaleficent\u201d and you will see only one prominent visage. Taking it further, I challenge anyone who has not already seen the film to name two other actors featured. Angelina Jolie is one of the very few Hollywood leading ladies who has the sheer recognizability and widespread appeal to singlehandedly open a motion picture up to the chance of blockbuster success. She literally has face value. Studios are willing to bank on it, and if you want proof, recall the poster for \u201cSalt.\u201d\n\nSo, what does this mean for the handful of other women who breathe the same rarefied air as Jolie? It\u2019s too soon to tell, but not for long. I haven\u2019t seen \u201cMaleficent\u201d yet myself, but I\u2019m betting that all weekend long, while the Disney adventure was raking in its $70 million, it was preceded in each multiplex by a preview for Scarlett Johansson\u2019s upcoming sci-fi action vehicle \u201cLucy.\u201d Without even a franchise or a fairy tale to build from, the potential success of \u201cLucy\u201d hinges entirely on whether audiences around the world want to see a psychically enhanced Johansson \u2014 and Johansson alone \u2014 kick butt in the near future. Though Scar-Jo may appeal to a slightly younger demographic than Jolie, the folks behind \u201cLucy\u201d can\u2019t help but feel bolstered by the fact that, this weekend, more than just teenage girls paid good money to see a beautiful, badass heroine manifesting unimaginable, superhuman powers. \u201cLucy,\u201d itself, will also function as a test for Johansson\u2019s next high-profile action project, a feature film vehicle for Marvel\u2019s Black Widow. That catsuited character made a splash alongside the Avengers, but solo is another story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Angelina Jolie's blockbuster hit is good news for kick-ass heroines to follow", "title": "What \u201cMaleficent\u201d tells us about the future of female movie protagonists", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Angelina Jolie's blockbuster hit is good news for kick-ass heroines to follow", "title": "What \u201cMaleficent\u201d tells us about the future of female movie protagonists", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/02/what_maleficent_tells_us_about_the_future_of_female_movie_protagonists/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/lucy_maleficent.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Angelina Jolie's blockbuster hit is good news for kick-ass heroines to follow", "title": "What \u201cMaleficent\u201d tells us about the future of female movie protagonists", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/lucy_maleficent.jpg", "creator": "@Neil_Salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Neil Drumming", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Angelina Jolie, Film, Scarlett Johansson", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cLucy,\u201d itself, will also function as a test for Johansson\u2019s next high-profile action project, a feature film vehicle for Marvel\u2019s Black Widow.\nTaking it further, I challenge anyone who has not already seen the film to name two other actors featured.\nTopics: Angelina Jolie, Film, Scarlett Johansson, Entertainment NewsAngelina Jolie\u2019s \u201cMaleficent\u201d is by no means a superhero, but the deliciously villainous character possesses enough powers to displace an entire squad of mutants from the top spot at the box office.\nIn contrast, check the promotional material for \u201cMaleficent\u201d and you will see only one prominent visage.\nThat catsuited character made a splash alongside the Avengers, but solo is another story."}
