UPDATE 9/13/15

A fire burning on Fort Carson is 700 acres and 80% contained. Crews continued containment efforts starting at 8 a.m. Sunday.

Previous story:

Crews say they have a containment line set up around the entire fire, and they're letting it burn itself out.

As of just after 5:00 p.m. crews said the fire had grown to 700 acres, and was burning in grass and brush in a Fort Carson practice range, just east of the Pikes Peak International Raceway.

Initially Fort Carson was being assisted by crews from Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, El Paso County, and the Fountain Fire Department, but now only Fort Carson crews remain on scene.

Fort Carson officials say that crews are confident that their containment lines will hold; now they will let the fire burn up to those lines and put itself out.

Crews will stay on scene to monitor it. They say it could burn and smoke for the next few hours.

There is no word yet on what started the fire.
