While President Obama was in Malaysia earlier, he held a press conference and addressed the media’s coverage of terrorism issues.

As he spoke of America’s response to terrorist attacks, the president said “the media needs to help” because “how we report on this has to maintain perspective.”

He expressed concern that more overblown media coverage of terrorism may “empower” terrorists “or elevate them in a way that makes it easier for them to recruit or make them stronger.”
