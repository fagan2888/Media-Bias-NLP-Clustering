Its Mercatus Center is a free-market think tank that does some great work in advancing market-based solutions to large-scale problems.\n\nThe study looked at the growth of regulatory restrictions handed down by the president, the executive branch and the federal government agencies that serve the administration.\n\nGiven the tremendous power of the presidency in 21st-century America, you can expect whoever wins the golden ticket to continue to use that power to impose their regulatory stamp on society.\n\nWe know this based on past behavior, as outlined to us by Mercatus.\n\nHere\u2019s the study\u2019s opening paragraph, which sets the stage for why this is an important issue for everyone:\n\nPresidents and their administrations wield extraordinary authority over federal regulation. While executive agencies can only write rules within the bounds set by Congress, their mandates are often expansive. Presidents set priorities, appoint and direct agency leadership, and determine how and when to review proposed or existing rules for cost-efficiency and consistency. These decisions materially affect the pace of regulatory accumulation during a president\u2019s time in office, which in turn affects the cost and complexity of doing business in the United States.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how Mercatus calculated this, and what the results revealed.\n\n***\n\nThe key term here to note is \"regulatory accumulation.\"\n\nThe study counted individual restrictions in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, which contains all regulations currently in force. The annual publication of the CFR allows Mercatus to basically keep a running tab of individual restrictions.\n\nNot so surprising was the fact that every president from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama increased the total number of regulatory restrictions during their respective presidencies.\n\nAccording to Mercatus:\n\nAcross no president\u2019s term did the total number of regulatory restrictions actually decline. The cumulative effect of these increases by successive presidents is a near-doubling of total regulatory restrictions, from about 580,000 when President Carter took office to about 1,070,000 in 2014.\n\nOuch!\n\nIf you\u2019re an opponent of Big Government intrusion into our lives via the nanny state, then this runaway presidential regulation train is not good news.\n\nSo, which presidents were the biggest, most active nannies?\n\n***\n\nThe table below shows that hands-down, President Obama wins the title of Biggest Nanny-in-Chief.\n\nAs Mercatus describes it:\n\nPresident Obama not only oversaw the greatest increase in regulatory restrictions in a single term, his first, but as of 2014 he has edged past President George W. Bush as the president with the greatest total increase in restrictions since 1976.\n\nOther interesting findings in this study show that while Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton both added regulations at similar rates across their two terms, President Clinton added significantly fewer restrictions overall compared to Bush.\n\nThe reason I find this interesting is that Clinton\u2019s second term was pretty darn good for both the economy, and the financial markets.\n\nSimilarly interesting to me is that during his first term, President Reagan was responsible for a substantial increase in regulation. Yet during his second term, there was a tiny increase in restrictions.\n\nLike Clinton, Reagan\u2019s second term also coincided with a good economy and a strong stock market. (Right up until that pesky little 1987 \"Black Monday.\")\n\nOne other similarity between Clinton\u2019s second term and Reagan\u2019s second term is that both were embroiled in scandals \u2014 Clinton with the Lewinsky matter and Reagan with Iran-Contra.\n\nCould we conclude from this that presidential scandals are actually good for the economy and the markets?\n\nI\u2019m tempted to say yes, but the more logical conclusion is that those respective scandals likely distracted each Nanny-in-Chief from meddling in the country\u2019s affairs too much. That could be part of why things were good during those aforementioned administrations.\n\nMercatus concludes its analysis with a word of advice for 2016 presidential contenders:\n\nFuture presidents will need to look to their predecessors to determine how to effectively manage the cumulative effect of regulation and maintain the necessary conditions for entrepreneurship and growth.\n\nWhen assessing the presidential candidates in tonight\u2019s debates, and for the remainder of the 2016 election follies, it would be wise to keep this lesson in mind.\n\n***\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the acceleration of the presidential regulatory train? Can it be stopped, or should it be stopped? And, who amongst the score of current candidates is most likely to slow the pace of executive restrictions?\n\nSend me your thoughts and let me know by leaving a comment on our website or by sending me an e-mail.\n\n***\n\nU.S. stocks dropped for the sixth-straight day, as traders took risk off the table in anticipation of Friday\u2019s July jobs report release. Elsewhere in the news today \u2026\n\n\u2022 Tesla Motors (TSLA) shares sank more than 9% Thursday, their biggest one-day drop since September 2014. This came one day after the company trimmed its vehicle delivery forecast for the year from 55,000 \u2026 cars to 50,000 to 55,000. \u2022 Viacom Inc. (VIA) shares tumbled some 13% after the company reported lower-than-expected Q3 sales. The miss was the second high-profile media fail in two days, as Walt Disney (DIS) shares disappointed Wednesday. \u2022 Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) dropped almost 30% today after the company reported decent earnings but weak guidance for the coming quarter. This leads us to wonder \u2014 might Coca-Cola (KO), which owns a large stake in the company, use this pullback to buy more or potentially even buy it out? \u2022 Gold futures were higher Thursday as the selling in equities pushed some money into safe-haven assets such as the yellow metal. \u2022 After a three-day slump that sent the Greek banking stock index down 63%, the index managed to close 11% higher today.\n\nGood Luck and Happy Investing,\n\nBrad Hoppmann\n\nPublisher\n\nUncommon Wisdom Daily", "article_metadata": {"revised": "Thursday, August 6th, 2015, 5:57 pm", "description": "Just in time for tonight's presidential debate, Mercatus' study of the growth of regulatory restrictions by the executive branch reveals a troubling trend.", "application-name": "Uncommon Wisdom Daily", "author": "Brad Hoppmann", "og": {"site_name": "Uncommon Wisdom Daily", "description": "Just in time for tonight's presidential debate, Mercatus' study of the growth of regulatory restrictions by the executive branch reveals a troubling trend.", "title": "Slowing the Presidential Regulation Train - Uncommon Wisdom Daily", "url": "http://www.uncommonwisdomdaily.com/slowing-the-presidential-regulation-train-21320", "image": "http://www.uncommonwisdomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Celebrity-Donald-Trump-Star_000016140156Small.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-06T17:57:14-04:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Uncommon Wisdom Daily", "description": "Just in time for tonight's presidential debate, Mercatus' study of the growth of regulatory restrictions by the executive branch reveals a troubling trend.", "title": "Slowing the Presidential Regulation Train - Uncommon Wisdom Daily", "image": {"src": "http://www.uncommonwisdomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Celebrity-Donald-Trump-Star_000016140156Small.jpg"}, "site": "@uncommon_wisdom", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/windows-tile.png", "keywords": "Afternoon Edition, General, Issues", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-06T17:23:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-06T17:57:14-04:00"}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) August 2015", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Slowing the Presidential Regulation TrainThis evening\u2019s first presidential primary debate ushers in the real start of the 2016 race for the White House.\nOne other similarity between Clinton\u2019s second term and Reagan\u2019s second term is that both were embroiled in scandals \u2014 Clinton with the Lewinsky matter and Reagan with Iran-Contra.\nIf you\u2019re an opponent of Big Government intrusion into our lives via the nanny state, then this runaway presidential regulation train is not good news.\n***What\u2019s your take on the acceleration of the presidential regulatory train?\nSimilarly interesting to me is that during his first term, President Reagan was responsible for a substantial increase in regulation."}
