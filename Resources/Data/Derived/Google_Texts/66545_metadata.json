He hit safely in 27 of 28 games.\n\nThat was nothing.\n\nCheck out what the Rockies\u2019 third baseman has done to Cactus League pitchers so far this spring. By hitting 2-for-3 with a double on Sunday against the Giants, he boosted his average to .606 (20-for-33). He\u2019s hit five doubles, a triple and two homers. The three-time Gold Glove third baseman has a hit in all 12 games in which he\u2019s played, and has multiple hits in seven straight games. His OPS is a mind-boggling 1.600.\n\nBefore the game, manager Walt Weiss was asked if Arenado should be in the conversation with the likes of the Angels Mike Trout and the Nationals\u2019 Bryce Harper as one of the game\u2019s greatest young players. Weiss couldn\u2019t wait to say yes.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of great young players in the game right now,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIt\u2019s really an exciting time. Nolan is one of those guys. He has to be in that conversation about the best young players in the game. He\u2019s 24 years old, he\u2019s already got three Gold Gloves and already hit (42) home runs (last) season.\u201d\n\nRockies Mailbag: Pose a question for Patrick Saunders\n\nArenado got both of his hits on Sunday by swinging at the first pitch. In his third at-bat, he flied out to right, going for the fences on a 3-0 pitch.\n\n\u201cIt was my game plan going in,\u201d he said. \u201cI just told myself I was going to be aggressive and swing at the first pitch if it was there. I usually don\u2019t do that during the season, but I wanted to try it out and see what happens.\u201d\n\nHale\u2019s chance. Right-hander David Hale, finally recovered from a hamstring injury, is scheduled to throw 30-35 pitches Monday against the Rangers. Hale wants to compete for a spot in the starting rotation, but if he can\u2019t build up enough innings, he can be optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Red-hot Nolan Arenado belongs with Trout, Harper, Rockies\u2019 Weiss says", "title": "Red-hot Nolan Arenado belongs with Trout, Harper, Rockies\u2019 Weiss says", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/20/red-hot-nolan-arenado-belongs-with-trout-harper-rockies-weiss-says/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160320__Nolan-Arenadop1-2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160320__Nolan-Arenadop1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-20T19:28:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:11:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In his third at-bat, he flied out to right, going for the fences on a 3-0 pitch.\n\u201cThere are a lot of great young players in the game right now,\u201d Weiss said.\nHe has to be in that conversation about the best young players in the game.\nHe\u2019s hit five doubles, a triple and two homers.\nBefore the game, manager Walt Weiss was asked if Arenado should be in the conversation with the likes of the Angels Mike Trout and the Nationals\u2019 Bryce Harper as one of the game\u2019s greatest young players."}
