A recent comparison of 27 countries only confirms America\u2019s inefficient health spending by looking at it in terms of life expectancy.\n\nAccording to a study in the American Journal of Public Health, every $100 that a person in the U.S. gets to put toward their health care extends their lifespan by approximately two weeks. This is magnitudes less than Germany, which can brag about its ability to add four months to a person\u2019s life for the same amount of money.\n\nStudy leader, Jody Heymann, of the University of California explained to The Atlantic that a lack of preventative measures accounts for much of this difference in longevity. According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, $2.7 trillion is spent annually on health care in this country with $96 billion of it being spent on smoking-related illnesses, $43 billion for hypertension, and $17 billion on diabetes.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason the United States spends so much on health care is that millions of Americans are in poor health,\u201d the foundation\u2019s website explains. \u201cChronic conditions such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes are responsible for seven in 10 deaths among Americans each year, and account for nearly 75 percent of the nation\u2019s health spending. Approximately 45 percent of the population has at least one chronic health condition.\u201d\n\nThe study also found that men\u2019s life expectancy in most countries benefited more form health spending than women\u2019s. Part of the reason for this lop-sided trend, Heymann told The Atlantic, is that women suffer more from being misdiagnosed for specific illnesses in addition to a bias towards male subjects in medical research until 1993.\n\nBut overall, the study highlighted differences in how nations are mindful healthier, active lifestyles that make people less prone to diseases. \u201cWe are doing little to make sure people have opportunities for physical activity, a decent diet \u2014 the things that would help with their risk of developing cancer and diabetes,\u201d Heymann said.\n\nHeymann and team\u2019s study also made it apparent that part of the problem with providing access to a healthier lifestyle is poverty. Countries that got more out of the money they put into health care had programs that addressed poverty, which is linked to less healthy diets.\n\nA review in the British Medical Journal found that healthier foods, indeed, cost more than processed foods and concluded that \"many decades of policies focused on producing inexpensive, high volume commodities have led to a complex network of farming, storage, transportation, processing, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities that favor sales of highly processed food products for maximal industry profit.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lifespan, longevity, life expectancy, health spending, cost efficiancy, preventative, lifestyle", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A comparison study in the American Journal of Public Health found that American deep pocket spending in health care doesn't translate into lengthier lifespans as well as in other countries like Germany.
