He can perhaps claim that the firebrands got Obama to discuss spending somewhere down the road. They can all battle again when the next artificial deadline arrives in January.\n\nAll hell can still break loose with the GOP. The Tea Party diehards have not played by traditional rules up to now. We\u2019ll know for sure Tuesday.\n\nAn agreement over the government shutdown and the possible debt default is expected to be finalized Tuesday.
