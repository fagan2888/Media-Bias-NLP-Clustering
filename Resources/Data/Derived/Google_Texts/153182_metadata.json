The organizations involved are calling for an investigation into whether members of Congress and their staff violated laws by claiming to be a \u201csmall business\u201d in order to buy their insurance and qualify for taxpayer-funded subsidies.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, required that members of Congress and their staff enroll in individual plans through the healthcare exchanges created by the law,\u201d the group said in a press release. \u201cAs open enrollment approached in 2014, members and staff realized that by enrolling as individuals, they would no longer receive generous taxpayer-funded contributions to help pay their insurance premiums as they had for decades under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. They would instead only qualify for subsidies if their household income was less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level, just like millions of other Americans that had to purchase insurance in the individual market.\u201d\n\nThe group notes that senators worked with the White House and the Office of Personnel Management for guidance on how to enroll in the Small Business Health Options Program in order to skirt any obstacles.\n\nOn October 2, 2013, the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) used a federal regulation to deem Congress a small business despite its having more than 12,000 employees and dependents. Additionally, individual congressional offices do not directly pay salaries\u2014their payment comes from the House of Representatives and Senate.\n\nThe group says this was done in order to allow members of Congress and their staff to have access to the taxpayer-funded subsidies.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this rather arbitrary and capricious action was to enable members of Congress, their staff, and families to gain access to taxpayer-funded subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This special exemption was cooked up by members of Congress, with help from the White House, to get something that no other individual or business can obtain.\u201d\n\nAs the first Obamacare enrollment period was underway in February 2014, one individual filed an application to the Washington D.C. Small Business Health Options Program acting on behalf of the entire Senate.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the Small Business Health Options Exchange allows businesses that employ 50 or fewer full-time workers to shop around for health insurance and gives employers greater control of the coverage, such as how much they wish to contribute to their employees\u2019 premiums\n\nJudicial Watch, a government watchdog group, filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the application submitted on behalf of the Senate. The FOIA request was granted in part and denied in part.\n\nThe unredacted information they obtained showed that the individual who submitted the application said that he or she employed 50 or fewer full-time employees and had used the first name \u201cTwenty\u201d and the last name \u201cCongress.\u201d The individual also used the address of the Senate Dispersing Office. This was also done for the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cBy pushing for OPM to issue the regulation that ostensibly allows them to \u201cbe a small business\u201d and participate in the D.C. SHOP, members of Congress and their staff have found a clever, but potentially illegal way to get access to government financial assistance to help pay for their health insurance premiums,\u201d CCAGW said.\n\n\u201cMembers of Congress have tried to keep this special carve-out for themselves quiet. After all, they are supposed to participate in Obamacare like any other citizen who purchases their health insurance in the individual market.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anti-waste groups claim staffers improperly obtained Obamacare subsidies by claiming to be employed by a \u2018small business\u2019", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A coalition of 10 organizations has filed an ethics complaint calling for an investigation into whether senators and their staff committed fraud when they submitted applications to the\u00a0health insuran", "title": "Complaint: Congressional Staffers Committed Fraud When Applying for Obamacare", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/complaint-congressional-staffers-committed-fraud/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/u.s.-capitol-building-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A coalition of 10 organizations has filed an ethics complaint calling for an investigation into whet", "creator": "@JoeSchoffstall", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/u.s.-capitol-building-150x150.jpg", "title": "Complaint: Congressional Staffers Committed Fraud When Applying for Obamacare", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After all, they are supposed to participate in Obamacare like any other citizen who purchases their health insurance in the individual market.\u201d\nBY: Follow @JoeSchoffstallA coalition of 10 organizations has filed an ethics complaint calling for an investigation into whether senators and their staff committed fraud when they submitted applications to the health insurance exchange in Washington, D.C.\nOn October 2, 2013, the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) used a federal regulation to deem Congress a small business despite its having more than 12,000 employees and dependents.\nAdditionally, individual congressional offices do not directly pay salaries\u2014their payment comes from the House of Representatives and Senate.\nThe group says this was done in order to allow members of Congress and their staff to have access to the taxpayer-funded subsidies."}
