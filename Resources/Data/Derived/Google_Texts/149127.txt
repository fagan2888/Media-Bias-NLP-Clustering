The House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to vote on legislation Tuesday that would change the health care reform law's definition of a full-time employee, shielding more employers from a stiff financial penalty imposed by the law.

Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, employers are required, effective in 2015, to offer qualified coverage to full-time employees — defined as those working an average of 30 hours per week — or be liable for an annual $2,000 penalty per employee.

The legislation, H.R. 2575, introduced by Rep. Todd Young, R-Ind., would change the definition of full-time employees to those working an average of 40 hours per week.

The health care reform law's 30-hour-per-week definition of a full-time employee would hurt workers as employers reduce hours of employees currently not provided coverage to avoid the reform law penalty, Rep. Young said when he introduced the measure in June 2013.

However, some employers who had not been providing health care coverage to employees working less than 40 hours per week have decided to do so.

For example, effective Oct. 1, 2013, Cumberland Gulf Group employees working as few as 32 hours per week became eligible for group coverage, down from the prior requirement of 40 hours per week.

Cumberland employees who had been working 30 or 31 hours per week were given the option of working 32 hours to become eligible for health insurance coverage. Employees who worked less than 30 hours per week were assisted by the company in finding coverage through public insurance exchanges.
