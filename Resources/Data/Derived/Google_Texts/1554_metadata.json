Matt Jones added a career-high 17 points off the bench and Tyus Jones scored 12 for the Blue Devils (20-3, 7-3 ACC), who shot 61 percent \u2014 81 percent in the first half \u2014 and used an early 43-7 run to give Notre Dame its worst loss since 1999.\n\nSteve Vasturia had 15 points but top scorer Jerian Grant was held to just seven on 3-of-10 shooting for the Fighting Irish (21-4, 9-3 ACC), who won the previous meeting 77-73 on Jan. 28.\n\nThis one was all Duke.\n\nPlaying before a crowd infused with an energy usually reserved for rival North Carolina, the Blue Devils clamped down on the nation\u2019s most efficient offense and built an insurmountable lead during its most dominant first half of the season.\n\nA comeback-capable Notre Dame team \u2014 the Irish rallied from 18 points down to beat North Carolina State on the road two weeks ago \u2014 never got closer than 18 in the second half of its worst loss since Villanova beat them 93-62 on Jan. 7, 1999.\n\nThey entered averaging a Division I-best 1.2 points per possession, and led the ACC with an 80.8-point scoring average. The Blue Devils held them to two baskets in 11 early minutes and needed about 15\u00bd minutes to build a 30-point lead.\n\nPerhaps most impressively, they did it almost entirely without Okafor. The preseason All-American picked up two fouls in 16 seconds and sat for the final 11:57 of the half.\n\nMatt Jones, who recently has taken over as Duke\u2019s sixth man, matched his previous scoring high of 13 points in the first half while hitting three 3-pointers in a 5-minute span.\n\nWinslow gave Duke its largest lead when his 3-pointer \u2014 the Blue Devils\u2019 seventh of the half \u2014 made it 43-13 with 4\u00bd minutes left.\n\nDemetrius Jackson added 11 points for the Fighting Irish.
