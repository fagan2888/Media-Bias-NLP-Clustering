If the US government, for the first time in its history, chooses not to pay its bills on time, we will be in default,\u201d said Mr Lew.\n\n\u201cAnyone who thinks that the United States government not paying its bills is anything less than default hasn\u2019t thought about it very clearly,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\n\nMr Lew said the treasury had already exhausted its normal funds in May and has been \u201ccreating room\u201d by resorting to one-off tricks, but these, too, have run dry. The government will have just $30bn by October 17, half what is needed to cover immediate needs over subsequent days.\n\n\u201cThat is a dangerously low level of cash, and we\u2019re on the verge of going into a place we\u2019ve never been. Even getting close to the line is dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Lew\u2019s dramatic comments mark a further escalation in the game of chicken on Capitol Hill. They suggest that the White House has for now ruled out a drastic fiscal squeeze to balance the books if there is no deal, and is unwilling to contemplate exotic loopholes \u2013 such as a $2 trillion platinum coin \u2013 to circumvent the will of Congress.\n\nGoldman Sachs said any attempt to balance the budget overnight would require savage cuts, stopping economic recovery in its tracks. This would go far beyond the current government shutdown, which has already led to the 800,000 \u201cnon-essential\u201d staff being sent home. \u201cWe estimate that the fiscal pull-back would amount to 9pc of GDP. If this were allowed to occur, it could lead to a rapid downturn in economic activity if not reversed quickly,\u201d it said.\n\nExpected tax revenues over the month following October 17 will cover just two-thirds of federal spending. The sheer force of the fiscal shock would be ruinous.\n\nThe US Treasury warned last week that the dispute could lead to a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d collapse. \u201cCredit markets could freeze, the value of the dollar could plummet, US interest rates could skyrocket, potentially resulting in a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse,\u201d it said.\n\nRepublicans have accused the Obama administration of whipping up hysteria to browbeat Congress. \u201cIt is irresponsible for high-ranking government officials to stoke fear into the marketplace,\u201d said Senator Orrin Hatch.\n\nHouse Republicans have refused to raise the debt limit unless the White House agrees to roll back the Affordable Care Act, dubbed \u201cObamacare\u201d. Speaker John Boehner said on Sunday that he did not have the votes to raise the debt ceiling unless Mr Obama gives ground, though there were signs that Congress is starting to crack, with moderates floating a compromise based on tax reform.\n\nBank of America said the Republicans\u2019 tough line is a high-risk strategy since Mr Obama believes he is on stronger political ground. \u201cThe President is very unlikely to agree to cuts in his proudest legislative achievement. He does not have to run for office again, while they are all up for re-election next fall. Surveys show Americans strongly disapprove of the shutdown and put more blame on Republicans. Ultimately, we expect them to drop the effort to weaken the Affordable Care Act, but this could take a while,\u201d said the bank.\n\nThe risk for the world is that headstrong Republicans do force the issue. Mr Lew\u2019s warnings suggest the White House may call their bluff, calculating that they will suffer greater opprobrium. Whoever is to blame, it is no way to run a railroad, let alone a superpower.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "DCSext.articleId": 10359616, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02682/Dollar_2682785k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Economics,Finance", "DCSext.cmsSect": "USA;Finance;Ambrose_Evans-Pritchard;Economics", "DCSext.Channel": "finance", "DCSext.MLC": "/finance/economics", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "WT.cg_n": "finance", "title": "White House openly threatens US default as debt fight escalates", "section-id": 3115, "GSACategory": "economics", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "finance-economics", "GSAMLC": "finance/economics", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "article-id": 10359616, "WT.cg_s": "economics", "description": "US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has issued a categorical warning that the \n  United States will default on its $16.7 trillion debt and throw the world \n  into turmoil unless Congress agrees to raise the legal debt ceiling by \n  October 17.", "tmgads.channel": "finance", "DCSext.pd": 1, "DCSext.Category": "economics", "DCSext.Level": 3, "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-06", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "finance-economics", "last-modified": "2013-10-06", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "Finance", "wordcount": 636, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Ambrose Evans-Pritchard", "tag": "Economics", "subsection": "Economics", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 4, "imagecount": 1, "externallinkcount": 0}, "tmgads.articleid": 10359616, "tmgads.level": 3, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"White House openly threatens US default as debt fight escalates \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10359616/White-House-openly-threatens-US-default-as-debt-fight-escalates.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02682/Dollar_2682785k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"10359616\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-06T19:32:21Z\",\"section\": \"Finance\",\"authors\": [\"Ambrose Evans-Pritchard\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"USA\",\"Finance\",\"Ambrose Evans-Pritchard\",\"Economics\"]}", "GSAChannel": "finance", "GSAChannelName": "Finance", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has issued a categorical warning that the   United States will default on its $16.7 trillion debt and throw the world   into turmoil unless Congress agrees to raise the legal debt ceiling by   October 17.", "title": "White House openly threatens US default as debt fight escalates", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10359616/White-House-openly-threatens-US-default-as-debt-fight-escalates.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02682/Dollar_2682785k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "finance.economics", "DCSext.author": "Ambrose Evans-Pritchard", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2013-10-06 20:32"}, "article_summary": "House Republicans have refused to raise the debt limit unless the White House agrees to roll back the Affordable Care Act, dubbed \u201cObamacare\u201d.\nMr Lew\u2019s warnings suggest the White House may call their bluff, calculating that they will suffer greater opprobrium.\nBank of America said the Republicans\u2019 tough line is a high-risk strategy since Mr Obama believes he is on stronger political ground.\nThe government will have just $30bn by October 17, half what is needed to cover immediate needs over subsequent days.\n\u201cThat is a dangerously low level of cash, and we\u2019re on the verge of going into a place we\u2019ve never been."}
