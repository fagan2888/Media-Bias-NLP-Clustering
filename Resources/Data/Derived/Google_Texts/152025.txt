Wittenberg, Wisconsin

One Shawano County, Wisconsin man is taking a song from the hit movie Frozen to whole new level.

Paul Dahms of Wittenberg decided to make a super-sized Olaf - that's the snowman who likes to give warm hugs.

The giant "Olaf" snowman stands about 22 feet tall and 12 feet wide at the base.

Dahms says his 12-year-old daughter gave him the inspiration to build the famous snowman from the movie. He says he began building it in December, adding a little more each snowfall.

He used a variety of tools, including plywood, two-by-fours and a five-gallon bucket to form the snowman.

After 50 total hours of work, Dahms finally finished his frozen masterpiece on Friday, much to the delight of the neighborhood.

Dahms says it's the positive reactions that make his hard work so rewarding.
