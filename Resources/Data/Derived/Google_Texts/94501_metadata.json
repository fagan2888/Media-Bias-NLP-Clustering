The attempts were unsuccessful, and the result was Stroman dragging a Cincinnati player to the pylon for a touchdown.\n\n\u201cIt just happened to fall in my hands,\u201d the Northern Virginia native said, \u201cand my teammates pushed me in.\u201d\n\nThe rare sack-fumble-fumble-touchdown pushed Virginia Tech\u2019s lead to three possessions, blowing open a game that, to that point, had been relatively close. Cincinnati quarterback Gunner Kiel was also injured on the play, leaving the Bearcats without an experienced replacement, and the Hokies had little trouble from there.\n\nJunior running back J.C. Coleman rushed for 157 yards and one touchdown and freshman kicker Joey Slye made each of his four field goals as Virginia Tech beat Cincinnati, 33-17, at a Hokie-friendly Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. The victory ensured that Virginia Tech (7-6) will finish with a winning record for a 22nd consecutive season, a streak that stretches before most of the players on the team were born.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very resilient group,\u201d associate head coach and running backs coach Shane Beamer said. \u201c[A record of] 7-6 isn\u2019t what our fans wanted, but the toughness and resiliency that our guys have shown, ignoring the outside noise and coming out and playing the way they did today \u2014 I couldn\u2019t be happier for that group of kids.\u201d\n\nShane Beamer addressed reporters in place of his father, Frank, who coached from the press box Saturday as he continues to recover from throat surgery. Though the 68-year-old wasn\u2019t on the field, he was as emotionally invested in the game as any other.\n\n\u201cHe made sure to let me know to run it in the second half,\u201d offensive coordinator Scot Loeffler said with a grin.\n\nShane Beamer assumed many of his father\u2019s responsibilities on the sidelines and was doused with the celebratory postgame ice water bath in his place. Afterwards, in the locker room, the elder Beamer wrote a note for a team official to read aloud to the group. Though Frank Beamer couldn\u2019t talk, the note read, he could still dance. And then he started dancing, as he\u2019s done after wins all season.\n\n\u201cHe does a little twist,\u201d linebacker Deon Clarke said, laughing.\n\n\u201cHe always kills it,\u201d added defensive lineman Nigel Williams.\n\nA few hours earlier, the two had combined to grab the game-altering turnover from Cincinnati (9-4). It started with Clarke, who had covered kickoffs all day in addition to his defensive responsibilities and had just asked to take a break. \u201cI forgot how kickoff was,\u201d he said. \u201cI was winded a little bit.\u201d\n\nShane Beamer gave Clarke a hard time and told him that if he was going to take a special teams play off, he had better make a play on defense. So on a 2nd-and-5 at midfield shortly thereafter, the junior from Richmond shot through the middle of Cincinnati\u2019s offensive line and sacked Kiel.\n\n\u201cHe backed it up,\u201d Shane Beamer said.\n\nThe ball bounced on the ground momentarily before Williams picked it up. He saw the end zone in front of him and a Bearcats player closing in behind him. The excitement of the fumble recovery was immediately replaced by dread when Williams felt the ball being poked out of his grasp.\n\n\u201cBut I saw a lot of guys behind me, 3-4 guys, and I trusted they would finish the play,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhich they did.\u201d\n\nStroman made sure of that, barreling into the end zone.\n\nThe sequence gave Virginia Tech an irreversible burst of momentum and also altered the game by forcing Kiel to exit. Cincinnati coach Tommy Tuberville declined to detail his quarterback\u2019s injury, only revealing that he was \u201ca little dizzy\u201d and not allowed to return. Kiel was replaced by senior Michael Colosimo, the Bearcats\u2019 fourth-string quarterback who had attempted only five passes in his career before Saturday.\n\nWith inexperience under center, Cincinnati\u2019s offense sputtered and Virginia Tech leaned on Coleman, who set a bowl-game rushing record for the program. Frank Beamer watched the final minutes from the press box, another winning season behind him and another locker room dance ahead.\n\n\u201cI just felt like we just had to stay focused, just do it for him,\u201d Stroman said. \u201cHe does a lot for us. We just had to do it for him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A sack-fumble-fumble-touchdown propelled the Hokies to a 33-17 victory in Annapolis, giving the program its 22nd consecutive winning season under Frank Beamer.", "Author": "Tom Schad", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A sack-fumble-fumble-touchdown propelled the Hokies to a 33-17 victory in Annapolis, giving the program its 22nd consecutive winning season under Frank Beamer.", "title": "Virginia Tech rides momentum of defensive touchdown to beat Cincinnati in the Military Bowl", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/27/virginia-tech-rides-momentum-defensive-touchdown-b/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/27/military-bowl-footballjpeg-058ae.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/27/military-bowl-footballjpeg-058ae.jpg", "title": "Virginia Tech rides momentum of defensive touchdown to beat Cincinnati", "description": "A sack-fumble-fumble-touchdown propelled the Hokies to a 33-17 victory in Annapolis, giving the program its 22nd consecutive winning season under Frank Beamer.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Cincinnati, Virginia Polytechnic Institute And State University, Greg Stroman, Kiel"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e66\"", "article_summary": "The sequence gave Virginia Tech an irreversible burst of momentum and also altered the game by forcing Kiel to exit.\n\u201cBut I saw a lot of guys behind me, 3-4 guys, and I trusted they would finish the play,\u201d Williams said.\nWith inexperience under center, Cincinnati\u2019s offense sputtered and Virginia Tech leaned on Coleman, who set a bowl-game rushing record for the program.\nJunior running back J.C.
