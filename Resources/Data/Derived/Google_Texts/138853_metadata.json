Ryan Gastin of the Los Angeles Police Department, who seemingly confirmed that James Franco was dead.\n\n\u201cThis is obviously being treated as a homicide case, but we need the coroner to make a final ruling for the homicide to be official,\u201d Gastin was quoted. \u201cThat\u2019s all the information we have at this time.\u201d\n\nBut the report quickly unraveled as a fake. The site it came from, CityWorldNews.com, is made up of other obviously false reports, including \u201cObama To Replace Washington On The One-Dollar Bills\u201d and \u201cGeorge W. Bush To Host Saturday Night Live,\u201d among many others.\n\nThere also appeared to be no \u201cDet. Ryan Gastin\u201d of the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nThe report likely gained steam thanks to the publicity surrounding Franco\u2019s latest film, The Interview. In the movie, he plays a celebrity interviewer who is able to land an exclusive interview with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, but is recruited by the CIA to turn it into an assassination mission.\n\nThe movie was scrapped this week by Sony, after receiving threats from hackers, who are reportedly connected to North Korea. The decision has raised controversy and been criticized by many actors and politicians, including both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.\n\nThe report that James Franco is dead is not the only fake story related to The Interview. A separate story on CityWorldNews.com claims that co-star Seth Rogen was abducted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "News that James Franco is dead spread across social media this weekend, all thanks to a fictitious report claiming that the actor was murdered in retribution", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "News that James Franco is dead spread across social media this weekend, all thanks to a fictitious report claiming that the actor was murdered in retribution", "title": "James Franco Dead: Internet Hoax Claims Actor Murdered By North Korea In Retribution For \u2018The Interview\u2019", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1693712/james-franco-dead-internet-hoax-claims-actor-murdered-by-north-korea-in-retribution-for-the-interview/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/James-Franco-Found-Dead-670x409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-20T16:24:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-20T17:18:28+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/James-Franco-Found-Dead-670x409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-12-20T16:24:13+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "james franco,james franco dead,james franco dies,the interview,the interview controversy,entertainment", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/James-Franco-Found-Dead-670x409.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "News that James Franco is dead spread across social media this weekend, all thanks to a fictitious report claiming that the actor was murdered in retribution"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd58dd\"", "article_summary": "The report that James Franco is dead is not the only fake story related to The Interview.\nRyan Gastin of the Los Angeles Police Department, who seemingly confirmed that James Franco was dead.\nNews that James Franco is dead spread across social media this weekend, all thanks to a fictitious report claiming that the actor was murdered in retribution for his part in the movie The Interview.\nThe movie was scrapped this week by Sony, after receiving threats from hackers, who are reportedly connected to North Korea.\nRyan Gastin\u201d of the Los Angeles Police Department."}
