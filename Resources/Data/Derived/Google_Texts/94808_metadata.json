Four players ties the AL record for fan-elected starters, achieved nine times previously.\n\nEight Royals were on track to start in vote totals announced June 15, but first baseman Eric Hosmer, third baseman Mike Moustakas and designated hitter Kendrys Morales also were overtaken.\n\nSeattle\u2019s Nelson Cruz, suspended for the final 50 games of the 2013 season for violating baseball\u2019s drug agreement, was elected to start for the second straight year. In the closest vote at any position, Cruz\u2019s 10.6 million votes edged Morales\u2019 10.32 million.\n\nToronto\u2019s Josh Donaldson will start at third for the second straight year after receiving a record vote total of 14.09 million, topping Josh Hamilton\u2019s 11.07 million in 2012.\n\nWashington outfielder Bryce Harper set a mark for NL players at 13.86 million, topping the previous record of 7.62 million set three years ago by San Francisco catcher Buster Posey, who was elected to start again this year.\n\nMLB said 620 million votes were cast, breaking the old mark of 391 million in 2012.\n\nAt least two elected starters will miss the game because of injuries: Miami outfielder Giancarlo Stanton broke a hand on June 26 and Detroit first baseman Miguel Cabrera hurt his left calf Friday. In addition, the Cardinals\u2019 Matt Holliday, who finished third among NL outfielders behind Harper and Stanton, has been sidelined since straining a quadriceps on June 8 and is uncertain when he will return.\n\nEach fan could cast up to 35 ballots in online voting. Pitchers and reserves will be announced Monday.\n\nAltuve overtuned a 232,000-vote deficit in totals announced Monday and finished with 9.63 million to top Inante, who was just shy of 9 million. Frazier trailed Carpenter by 63,000 at the start of the week but finished ahead by 2.1 million.\n\nLos Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout will make his fourth straight All-Star appearance after earning 14 million votes, the second-highest total.\n\nNL starters include Arizona first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, Miami second baseman Dee Gordon and St. Louis shortstop Jhonny Peralta, who also was suspended 50 games following MLB\u2019s investigation of the Biogenesis of America clinic.\n\nFinal National League All-Star Voting Results\n\nPlayer Team Votes FIRST BASEMEN 1.
