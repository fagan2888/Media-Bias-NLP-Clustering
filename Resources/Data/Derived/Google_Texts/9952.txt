You can now listen to a recording of the 911 call made by the suspect in the Lincoln Tunnel shooting scare on Tuesday.

Donald Wallace, 39, allegedly made a hoax phone call to 911 saying a sniper was near the tunnel in Weehawken. A tape of the 911 call has been released, CBS News reports, calling the recording "chilling."

The caller said, "First get your hospitals up. The DC sniper is here in your city ... Get all your police ready and captivate. It's a cold one and you better win. I have a DC sniper that's driving into your city right now. One part methyl chloride three parts nitrate," according to Weehawken police.

CBS says the caller could also have been saying, "menthol chloride, three parts titrate," but the former is a nonexistent chemical and "titrate" is a verb, not a noun, meaning to measure the quantity of one chemical in a solution by adding another chemical to the point where a reaction occurs.

The phoned-in threat triggered a massive police response near tunnel on Tuesday, while two separate incidents then prompted notification of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, officials said.

During the chaos, the tunnel was shut while Weehawken and Port Authority police searched for the caller but could not locate him.

During the drama, some bus passengers bound for Hoboken had to get off their buses and walk the rest of the way, according to officials.

At 11:50 p.m. on Tuesday, Wallace, was arrested at 47th Street and 11th Avenue in Manhattan by PAPD detectives, Port Authority Police spokesman Joe Pentangelo told The Jersey Journal. Wallace was charged with making a terroristic threat and creating false public alarm, he said. He made his first court appearance Thursday.
