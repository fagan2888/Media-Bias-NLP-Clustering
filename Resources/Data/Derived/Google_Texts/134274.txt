ABILENE, Texas -

Abiliene Regional Medical Center is helping residents sign up for the Affordable Care Act.

"We have certified counselors that can walk people through the different options," said Chief Operating Officer at ARMC, Matthew Leeuwe.

The counselors can help find out which of the several plans best fits your needs.

Over 5 million Texans still remain uninsured, dropping from last year. The government site has also improved from last year.

"The website that the government has set up was overloaded, as I understand the government subsequently got rid of the vendor that was running the website and hired a new vendor," said Leeuwe.

The deadline for enrollment is February 15, if you can afford insurance but don't sign up there will be a fine to pay.

"The way that I understand it's going to work is that the penalty increases year after year to try and encourage more people to use the program." said Leeuwe.

The website is healthcare.gov and if you would like to set an appointment with a ARMC counselor you can call 325-428-1290.
