Luke Messer, who invited his colleagues to Greenfield for the hearing.\n\nMesser introduced legislation dealing with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s effect on schools, and specifically, the mandate to provide insurance for anyone working 30 hours a week or more.\n\n\u201cThis rule, the 30-hour rule, is something that really gets in the way,\u201d said Ivy Tech president Tom Snyder. \u201cThis means some large number of (adjunct faculty) would have to be shifted into health care. It\u2019s not affordable, because we\u2019d have to pass that cost on to the students.\u201d\n\nZionsville\u2019s chief financial officer also testified, telling lawmakers about a popular middle school softball coach who had quit coaching because of the new regulations.\n\n\u201cThe former coach was successful, respected and a great role model, but wasn\u2019t allowed to coach anymore because that would put him over 29 hours a week,\u201d said Mike Shafer with Zionsville Community Schools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not fair to the working class honestly that we have hard working people who have had hours taken away,\u201d said Vigo County superintendent Danny Tanoos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to pay for the President\u2019s health care law on the backs of our students and our schools, particularly at times where kids are cash strapped,\u201d said Messer. \u201cIf we really care about kids we need to do something about it. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve authored legislation that would exempt schools.\u201d\n\nBut others felt the hearing was more about politics- with only Republican lawmakers in attendance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a hearing,\u201d said Anderson Federation of Teachers president Tom Forkner. \u201cI would have been happier, I suppose, if we had more representation from the other side.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly invited Democrats today (and) it was our hope that they would come,\u201d said Messer. \u201cWhat today is about, though, is to get beyond the rhetoric and let Hoosiers tell us their story of what the impact is today.\u201d\n\nOne doctor who testified was critical of Republican lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThe real fear in this room today is not the ACA is somehow going to ruin this country, it\u2019s the fear that the members here, including Mr. Messer, have that as the ACA goes forward and people are helped by it, they\u2019re going to want to go further and not back,\u201d said Dr. Robert Stone of IU Health, who testified on his own behalf. \u201cAs people come to appreciate the ACA, they\u2019re going to vote against politicians who are trying to repeal it and take it away from them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur children and working families deserve better,\u201d said Roe. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need to set aside the President\u2019s health care law and start over with real reform.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GREENFIELD (Sept. 4, 2014) - Several members of Congress were in the Hoosier State on Thursday for a special hearing on the issue of health care.
