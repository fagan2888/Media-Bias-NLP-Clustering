Broncos starting running back Montee Ball will undergo an emergency appendectomy Monday afternoon, the team confirmed.

The Broncos expect him to play in their regular-season opener Sept. 7 against the Indianapolis Colts. There is hope that he could return for the third preseason game against Houston on Aug. 23.

On Monday during camp a message was posted to Ball’s Twitter account that read: ” I appreciate the get well wishes everyone! I will be ok and come back stronger than ever!! #Broncos.”

Ronnie Hillman and C.J. Anderson shared running back reps with Peyton Manning’s first-team offense Monday.

Ball has been the Broncos’ starter since the start of the offseason. As a backup to Knowshon Moreno last year, Ball rushed for 559 yards and four touchdowns on 120 carries.

He finished his college career at Wisconsin as the most prolific running back in NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) history with 5,140 yards, 77 rushing touchdowns and 500 points.
