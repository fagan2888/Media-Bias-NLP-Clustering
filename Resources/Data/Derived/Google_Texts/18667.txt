A man was killed Saturday night after being struck by a train in Stemmons Corridor, a DART spokesman said.

Mark Ball said around 8:30 p.m. a westbound TRE train struck a 30-year-old man who was trespassing on the tracks near 2500 Market Center Boulevard.

The man was not identified.

There were 70 people on board the train at the time of the incident, but Ball said no one on the train was injured. The passengers were being interviewed by DART police who were leading the investigation.

There were no delays reported.

A TRE train headed east was expected to pick up the passengers on the westbound train, Ball said.
