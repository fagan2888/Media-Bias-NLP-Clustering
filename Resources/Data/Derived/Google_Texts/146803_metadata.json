After a glance at the packed eatery, he opted to keep it short.And so, without further ado, he made way for the Republican presidential hopeful.A lot of folks are now being introduced in New Hampshire as \u201cthe next President of the United States.\u201dSometimes it ends with a plea to donate to the candidate. Or to like them, really \u201clike\u201d them, on social media.And then it\u2019s \u201con with the show, this is it.\u201dAs Hurst demonstrated last month, people do not show up to pick over the appetizer: They want the hot main plate.It\u2019s an honor to be chosen to introduce a candidate. Sometimes these opening remarks are abbreviated. Sen. John McCain, the two-time New Hampshire primary victor, was known to dislike a lengthy opener.At a business roundtable in Portsmouth earlier this year, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, who is running for the Democratic nomination, interrupted his friend\u2019s verbose introduction to jump into his own remarks.At New England College, undergraduate students are given the privilege of introducing presidential hopefuls.Wayne Lesperance, a political professor at NEC, says he cannot think of another instance in which a candidate walked into a room to their own theme song. He\u2019s referring to Donald J. Trump, who spoke at the college on April 27. He walked in to \u201cMoney, Money, Money,\u201d the song used on \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d The place was jam-packed, and Trump\u2019s stroll to the front of the room was synched to the music\u2019s fade.\u201cIt was a little surreal, frankly,\u201d Lesperance said.Some of these presidential candidates are so well-known they really need no introduction. A good introduction depends on a number of things, according to Lesperance, who has made a few himself. He recalled introducing Rudy Giuliani with this line: \u201cNow America\u2019s Mayor wants to be America\u2019s President ....\u201dIntroductions vary by candidate and by setting, he said.Brevity, particularly when audience members have been waiting for some time in a stuffy room, can be more than just the soul of wit. Sometimes, for a campaign surrogate introducing the candidate, it\u2019s a quick call to action, like \u201cget out and vote,\u201d Lesperance notes.When Hillary Clinton held her first town hall meeting in New Hampshire in July, the introductory honors went to former Dover Mayor George Maglaras, now a county commissioner.Maglaras is an old Clinton friend. He was there when Bill Clinton gave his \u201clast dog dies\u201d speech at the Elks Lodge in Dover almost a quarter century ago.\u201cWe all know why we\u2019re here,\u201d Maglaras said, a nod to the Clinton family connection to the Garrison City.With a touch of humor, Maglaras offered, \u201cI was told to mention a lot of things, but I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201dA local marina owner, Maglaras talked about the economy. \u201cA rising tide floats all boats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a new rising tide in America and it\u2019s my privilege to introduce to you that person who\u2019s going to bring us that tide: Hillary Rodham Clinton, the next President of the United States.\u201dHe spoke for nearly four minutes before handing over the microphone to the Democratic presidential hopeful at Dover City Hall.At recent stops in Franklin and Milford, N.J., Gov. Chris Christie was introduced by Merrimack County Sheriff Scott E. Hilliard and Paul Chevalier, respectively. Local and state dignitaries sometimes get the nod to welcome a candidate.Juliana Bergeron, a Republican national committeewoman, introduced Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush when they spoke in Keene, her home city. She remains neutral in the primary because of her RNC role, but her introductions carry a certain gravitas.When Trump spoke earlier this summer in Laconia, his Belknap County leadership team spoke before the candidate. Who had the honor of introducing him? Matthew Ciepielowski, Trump\u2019s state director, recalled that Trump took the stage to a VOG announcement.VOG? It\u2019s an acronym for a booming, energetic announcement, usually pre-recorded. It stands for Voice of God.dtuohy@unionleader.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A lot of folks are now being introduced in New Hampshire as 'the next President of the United States.'", "title": "How to introduce a (possible) President to NH | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "A lot of folks are now being introduced in New Hampshire as 'the next President of the United States.'", "title": "How to introduce a (possible) President to NH | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150824/NEWS0605/150829691/1066/NEWS0605&template=mobileart", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20150824/NEWS0605/150829691/AR/0/AR-150829691.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Primary Plus", "robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "keywords": "Politics, Presidential, New Hampshire, Economy,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-08-24 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "A lot of folks are now being introduced in New Hampshire as 'the next President of the United States.'", "title": "How to introduce a (possible) President to NH | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150824/NEWS0605/150829691/1066/NEWS0605&template=mobileart", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20150824/NEWS0605/150829691/AR/0/AR-150829691.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Tapped to introduce Scott Walker at Joey\u2019s Diner in Amherst, Cliff Hurst was ready to uncork a classic stem-winder.\nHe\u2019s referring to Donald J.
