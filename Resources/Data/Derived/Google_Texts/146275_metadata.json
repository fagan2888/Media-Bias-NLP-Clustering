But it cannot be found on official maps.\n\nNor did it appear in the recent Osaka Asian Film Festival, after the director of a new movie that is set in the area pulled it, accusing city organizers of censorship.\n\nOsaka officials asked Shingo Ota to remove scenes and lingo that identify the slum, on the grounds that it was insensitive to residents.\n\n\u201cTo me, what they were asking was a cover-up attempt to make this place non-existent,\u201d he said in a recent interview.\n\nThis place is Kamagasaki, home to day laborers, the jobless and homeless, where one in three are on welfare. About 25,000 people live in this compact area, mostly single men who stay in free shelters or dozens of cheap dorms that charge as little as 800 yen ($8) a night.\n\nThe day starts early at the welfare-employment center, where hundreds of people line up for manual labor work, mostly with subcontractors of Japan\u2019s construction giants. Those not picked stroll the backstreets aimlessly, queue for free meals or resort to cheap alcohol. In the evening, the homeless line up at the center to get tickets for the shelters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m jobless, for months,\u201d said one 52-year-old resident who came to Kamagasaki after losing his home in the 1995 Kobe earthquake. He gambled away his monthly welfare money of 70,000 yen ($700). \u201cNow I\u2019m doomed.\u201d\n\nOta\u2019s movie, \u201cFragile,\u201d tells the story of a TV assistant director who takes off from his job one day after conflicts with his girlfriend and his colleague. He heads to Kamagasaki to make a film about a teenage boy, and whether success and wealth are necessary for happiness. But he quickly falls into trouble, and his plan unravels.\n\nThe full-length feature shows recognizable landmarks of the slum, such as a park known for both squatters and illegal garbage dumping and the center where men line up for jobs. It also shows the protagonist receiving an amphetamine injection from a drug dealer operating in the slum. Ota says Osaka officials wanted those scenes and others deleted, as well as the slang words \u201cdoya\u201d (cheap accommodations) and \u201cshabu\u201d (stimulants).\n\nOsaka official Kazumitsu Oue said the film festival organizers wanted to protect the area and its people from exposure to prejudice. \u201cWe felt that the film lacked consideration to the area and its people,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Japan\u2019s biggest slum not on maps or in film fest", "title": "Japan\u2019s biggest slum not on maps or in film fest", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Japan\u2019s biggest slum not on maps or in film fest", "title": "Japan\u2019s biggest slum not on maps or in film fest", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/23/japans_biggest_slum_not_on_maps_or_in_film_fest/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/japan-slum-cover-up.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Japan\u2019s biggest slum not on maps or in film fest", "title": "Japan\u2019s biggest slum not on maps or in film fest", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/japan-slum-cover-up.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mari Yamaguchi", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsOSAKA, Japan (AP) \u2014 Japan\u2019s biggest slum is visible just blocks from bustling restaurants and shops in Osaka, the country\u2019s second-largest city.\nOsaka official Kazumitsu Oue said the film festival organizers wanted to protect the area and its people from exposure to prejudice.\nOsaka officials asked Shingo Ota to remove scenes and lingo that identify the slum, on the grounds that it was insensitive to residents.\nHe heads to Kamagasaki to make a film about a teenage boy, and whether success and wealth are necessary for happiness.\n\u201cWe felt that the film lacked consideration to the area and its people,\u201d he said."}
