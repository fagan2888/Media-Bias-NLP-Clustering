For the first time Sunday, the empty church on back beach road will hold a new congregation.

It's the same church where a local builder was murdered in 2010.

The construction project was never completed.

Now three years later, a new and different congregation is turning something negative into something positive.

Saturday, Woodstock church volunteers focused on moving forward for Sunday's first church service.

Preparations began at nine this morning with a prayer and run-through over building details.

Saturday afternoon, the band practiced for its debut, and some final touches were made.

The grand opening is tomorrow morning for 9:30 and 11 am service.
