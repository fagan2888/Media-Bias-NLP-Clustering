To this bunch, I take responsibility means I have no intention of accepting any blame or consequences for these actions, but since I said the magic words, you have to quit pestering me about it.\n\nClinton, an exceedingly poor retail politician who still can\u2019t quite understand that her coronation has come off the rails, played all of these cards badly.\n\nShe explained that she had used a personal email account as a senator from New York and didn\u2019t spend much time considering alternatives when she became secretary of state in 2009. \u201cI did all my business on my personal email [in the Senate],\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI was not thinking a lot when I got in [to the State Department]. There was so much work to be done. We had so many problems around the world. I didn\u2019t really stop and think what kind of email system will there be.\u201d \u201cThis was fully above board, people knew I was using a personal email, I did it for convenience. I sent emails that I thought were work related to people\u2019s dot gov accounts,\u201d she added.\n\nThere\u2019s a sound bite every politician wants following them around: I was not thinking a lot when I got in.\n\nHer claim not to have thought about the matter much is patently, demonstrably false \u2013 she overrode a great deal of warning and advice from State officials to establish her homebrew server. The State Department\u2019s technical team did not know she was using a personal system \u2013 all hell broke loose when it went down, and they had no idea why her mail wasn\u2019t going through. It was all so \u201cfully above board\u201d that no one knew about it until lawsuits forced the existence of her email system to light, and the guy who set it up just invoked his Fifth Amendment rights to avoid discussing it with the FBI.\n\nAs for the \u201cconvenience\u201d claim, even leaving aside the copious evidence that she simply is not telling the truth about her desire to carry only one email device \u2013 and how ridiculous that sounded all along, coming from a high-powered official who travels with a vast retinue \u2013 she\u2019s making a terrible indictment of her own sense of judgment by pushing this line. Her quest for \u201cconvenience\u201d exposed classified material, launched both internal and law-enforcement investigations, and will very possibly end with indictments \u2013 if not of Clinton herself, than of whichever staffer takes the fall for violating protocols and getting classified material onto her server.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t seem to understand that her honesty and trustworthiness numbers are falling not just because she tells a lot of stories that don\u2019t check out, but because even if you take what she says at face value, she\u2019s making herself sound like a very poor candidate for high office in the Information Age.\n\nAs for her supposedly \u201cmore contrite tone,\u201d as NBC puts it, she didn\u2019t actually apologize for what she\u2019s done \u2013 she only said she\u2019s \u201csorry that this has been confusing to people and has raised a lot of questions, but there are answers to all these questions.\u201d\n\nIn other words, she\u2019s talking down to the people troubled by her conduct, which is not a great way to win them over. She\u2019s still trying to shift focus onto her critics and obscure what the story is really all about. The bottom line is that she lied about having classified material on that server \u2013 straight-up lied, with deliberate intent. She sent it, and she received it. It was classified when she handled it, much of the material in question remains classified to this day, and the only reason it wasn\u2019t \u201cmarked classified\u201d is that someone on Clinton\u2019s staff removed the markings. There is nothing \u201cconfusing\u201d about the matter at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clinton explained she used a personal email account as a senator and didn't consider alternatives when she became secretary of state.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Clinton explained she used a personal email account as a senator and didn't consider alternatives when she became secretary of state.", "title": "Clinton: 'I Was Not Thinking a Lot' When I Became Secretary of State - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Women-for-Hillary-Charlie-NeibergallAP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/04/clinton-i-was-not-thinking-a-lot-when-i-became-secretary-of-state/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Clinton explained she used a personal email account as a senator and didn't consider alternatives when she became secretary of state.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Women-for-Hillary-Charlie-NeibergallAP.jpg", "title": "Clinton: 'I Was Not Thinking a Lot' When I Became Secretary of State - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "campaign 2016, Clinton Email Scandal, Hillary Clinton, State Department,Big Government,Clinton", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "State Department", "published_time": "2015-09-04T12:00:37-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The bottom line is that she lied about having classified material on that server \u2013 straight-up lied, with deliberate intent.\n\u201cI was not thinking a lot when I got in [to the State Department].\n\u201cI did all my business on my personal email [in the Senate],\u201d Clinton said.\nShe explained that she had used a personal email account as a senator from New York and didn\u2019t spend much time considering alternatives when she became secretary of state in 2009.\nThere\u2019s a sound bite every politician wants following them around: I was not thinking a lot when I got in."}
