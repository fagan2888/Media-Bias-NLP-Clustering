Some health organizations are \u201cintegrating data almost for the sake of integrating data.\u201d\n\n[See also: 5 keys to leveraging data analytics]\n\nThat\u2019s a mistake that Davis sees some providers making as they try to adapt to health reform with the goal of transitioning to an organization driven by data.\n\nThere is the draw of going big fast, with millions of dollars spent even by medium-sized hospitals on basic electronic health records, but really providers should take their time in building onto the new EHR infrastructure \u2013 especially during this time of upheaval, with the Affordable Care Act attempting to align healthcare incentives but not having fully done so yet.\n\n\u201cAnalytics is an ongoing journey; it\u2019s really a way of doing business,\u201d Davis said.\n\nTo think about that journey-as-business approach, he offered a parable, \u201can imperfect analogy to healthcare but illustrative.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, large retailers like Wal-Mart started installing IT for supply chain management and for tracking sales \u2013 technology now considered basic that Davis said is the equivalent of EHRs today.\n\nAlthough the company didn\u2019t dive right into analytics (and perhaps it could not at the time), Wal-Mart didn\u2019t stop with that basic infrastructure. It later rolled out an analysis strategy that included not only customer data analysis but also external data, such as the weather, and soon knew when to \u201cstock water bottles and pop tarts at the front of the store,\u201d Davis said.\n\nFollowing that model, providers with EHR systems that are several years old could outline a vision for what they want analytics solutions to help them do in say, two, five and 10 years \u2013 what kinds of variabilities in patient care they want to reduce, for instance, or what kinds of clinical innovations they would like to develop.\n\nSome providers are already starting to use analytics smartly. And the successful organizations he\u2019s worked with start their analytics journey with a specific problem.\n\nMoffitt Cancer Center, for example, started with a program sequencing the genomes of cancer patients and tumors to build what is now a database with information on some 400,000 patients.\n\nThat database used in an informatics platform now supports clinical, molecular and epidemiological research, in addition to decision support at the point of care to help clinicians and patients get a sense of the comparative effectiveness of their treatment options.\n\n\u201cThe future is already here,\" Davis quoted cyberpunk author William Gibson, \"it\u2019s just not evenly distributed yet.\u201d\n\nThis story is based on a report that originally appeared on Government Health IT.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/using-analytics-business-strategy", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The lure of data analytics is strong, but providers need to slow down in order to get the most out of it and not undermine what they're trying to accomplish with it.", "title": "Using analytics as a business strategy"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "description": "The lure of data analytics is strong, but providers need to slow down in order to get the most out of it and not undermine what they're trying to accomplish with it.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Using analytics as a business strategy"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The lure of data analytics is strong, but providers need to slow down in order to get the most out of it and not undermine what they\u2019re trying to accomplish with it.&#13; \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bridges being built to nowhere,\u201d said Brett Davis, a general manager with Deloitte Health during a webinar on data analytics.
