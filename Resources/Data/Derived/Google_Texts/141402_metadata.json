Among its findings were that CMS did not conduct a number of assessments that would have revealed password vulnerabilities, it did not encrypt user sessions, and it used a shared account for access to the database that contained personal information.\n\nIn addition to those who have gone through the process of enrolling in insurance through healthcare.gov, the database retains information on anyone who starts an application on the site but decides not to finish, and information on anyone deemed eligible for Medicaid.\n\nThe findings were presented to CMS first, which \"reported that it remediated all vulnerabilities and addressed all findings\" in February of 2015. Though it follows a year later, the findings corroborate a study by the Government Accountability Office released in September of 2014 that criticized MIDAS for launching with \"incomplete security plans and privacy documentation.\"\n\nIn a statement to the Washington Examiner, Meaghan Smith, a spokesperson for HHS, stressed that no information had been lost as a result of the MIDAS vulnerabilities. \"The privacy and security of consumers' information is a top priority,\" Smith said. \"Operational and analytical databases are a part of any data-driven operation, and Marketplace data is protected by stringent security measures that adhere to industry best practices and meet or exceed federal standards.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly a year after making the discovery, a federal agency has reported that the database used to hold personal information from Obamacare enrollees had more than 100 security vulnerabilities at least until February of this year, which left the information vulnerable to hacking.\nThe analysis, conducted between August and December of 2014, was released on Monday by the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services.
