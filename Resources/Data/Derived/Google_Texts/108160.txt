While the July 10, 2015 Declaratory Ruling and Order (our summary of which can be found here) was released after the close of business on Friday, one petitioner has already filed a petition for review of the Declaratory Ruling: ACA International (the Association of Credit and Collection Professionals) (“ACA”). ACA filed its petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 10, and filed an amended petition on July 13. See ACA Int’l v. FCC, No. 15-1211 (D.C. Cir. filed July 10, 2015). ACA challenges the FCC’s “treatment of ‘capacity’ within the definition of an automatic telephone dialing system,” the FCC’s “treatment of predictive dialers,” and the FCC’s interpretation of the term “‘prior express consent’ (including its treatment of reassigned numbers.” Amended Petition for Review at 2-3, ACA Int’l v. FCC, No. 15-1211 (D.C. Cir. filed July 13, 2015), Doc. No. 1562251. ACA asks the DC Circuit to hold unlawful the FCC’s treatment of “capacity” and compel the FCC to “treat ‘capacity’ in a way that comports with a caller’s right of due process and free speech;” hold unlawful the FCC’s treatment of “predictive dialers” and compel the FCC to “treat them in a way that does not expand the statutory definition . . . beyond the definition that Congress enacted;” and hold unlawful the FCC’s treatment of “prior express consent, including the Commission’s treatment of reassigned numbers,” and compel the Commission to establish either a “viable safe harbor for autodialed ‘wrong number’ non-telemarketing calls to reassigned wireless numbers” or “define ‘called party’ as a call’s intended recipient.” Id. at 4-5.
