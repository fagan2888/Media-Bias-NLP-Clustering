First place turns out to go to Louisiana, which locks up 1,341 people for every 100,000 residents. (The figure includes inmates in federal prisons and local jails.) Thirty-five other states have incarceration rates that beat the Cubans', as does the District of Columbia.\n\nThe least prison-happy state? Vermont. You can head down to the comments to debate whether that's because it's full of soft-hearted hippies or if it's just that all those old people there don't commit as many crimes.\n\nBonus link: Our special issue on mass incarceration.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Mass incarceration, nation by nation.", "title": "If Every American State Was a Country, Which Would Have the World's Highest Incarceration Rate?", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/06/24/if-every-american-state-was-a-country-wh", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jwalker/2014_06/massincarceration.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you're a regular Reason reader, you\nprobably know that the U.S. has the world's highest incarceration\nrate.
