The 14-story, 86-room location in Chicago is the biggest in the world. The Winfield location will look much more like a large country home, inside and out.\n\nSaturday's event was open to corporate and individual donors of at least $1,000. Allabough expected about 160 people during the three-hour open house.\n\nJulie Evans of Glen Ellyn said her own experiences showed her the importance of actively supporting such an enterprise in the area. Though her son, Miles, was born at Central DuPage Hospital 14 years ago, he required several surgeries during his early years that took place at Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn. She and her husband were able to take advantage of a low-cost apartment near the hospital to take turns being near Miles all the time.\n\nAs welcome as that was, Ronald McDonald House would have provided a better environment if it had been available to them at the time, Evans said.\n\n\"It's very stressful to have your child hospitalized,\" she said. \"The whole thing about the community of the (Ronald McDonald) house was absent with the apartment.\"\n\nShe said Miles, who will be a freshman at Glenbard West High School this fall, will join her as a volunteer at the Ronald McDonald House in Winfield.\n\nGuests Saturday were invited to write personalized messages on the bare cement of the house's living room before the rest of the floor is completed on top. Allabough said donors can always return to the spot where they left their message and remember it beneath their feet.\n\nEvans chose to write the words \"Strength\" and \"Hope.\"\n\n\"Those two words really summarize the whole experience,\" she said. \"Patients need strength and families need strength, but hope is always there at the end.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Major donors and future volunteers of the new Ronald McDonald House Near Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield got a sneak peek Saturday at the construction progress of the 12-family facility nearly seven months before it will open. \"It's very stressful to have your child hospitalized,\" Julie Evans of Glen Ellyn said. \"The whole thing about the community of the (Ronald McDonald) house was absent with the apartment (she rented).\"", "author": "Eric Peterson", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald", "description": "Major donors and future volunteers of the new Ronald McDonald House Near Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield got a sneak peek Saturday at the construction progress of the 12-family facility nearly seven months before it will open. \"It's very stressful to have your child hospitalized,\" Julie Evans of Glen Ellyn said. \"The whole thing about the community of the (Ronald McDonald) house was absent with the apartment (she rented).\"", "title": "Donors visit future Ronald McDonald House in Winfield", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140719/news/140718531/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20140719/news/140718531/EP/1/6/EP-140718531.jpg&updated=201407191840&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Major donors and future volunteers of the new Ronald McDonald House Near Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield got a sneak peek Saturday at the construction progress of the 12-family facility nearly seven months before it will open. \"It's very stressful to have your child hospitalized,\" Julie Evans of Glen Ellyn said. \"The whole thing about the community of the (Ronald McDonald) house was absent with the apartment (she rented).\"", "creator": "@DHEricPeterson", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140719/news/140718531/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20140719/news/140718531/AR/0/AR-140718531.jpg&updated=201407191840&maxw=1200&maxh=1200", "title": "Donors visit future Ronald McDonald House in Winfield", "site": "@dailyherald", "card": "summary", "account_id": 8960722}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 105603449548761}, "keywords": "News, Winfield, Charities and Fundraising, Health & Fitness, Members Get More", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHeraldFans", "published_time": "2014-07-19", "modified_time": "2014-07-19T22:40:00Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eric.peterson.7737769"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b9d\"", "article_summary": "Donors visit future Ronald McDonald House in WinfieldhelloMajor donors and future volunteers for the new Ronald McDonald House near Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield got a sneak peek Saturday at the construction progress of the 12-family facility nearly seven months before it will open.\nThis fifth location for Ronald McDonald House Charities of Chicagoland and Northwest Indiana was chosen after Central DuPage Hospital and its parent company Cadence Health reached out, said Jim DeMaria, vice president of development for Ronald McDonald House.\nAs welcome as that was, Ronald McDonald House would have provided a better environment if it had been available to them at the time, Evans said.\nEach Ronald McDonald House fits into its specific community in terms of both capacity and architecture, DeMaria said.\n\"The whole thing about the community of the (Ronald McDonald) house was absent with the apartment.\""}
