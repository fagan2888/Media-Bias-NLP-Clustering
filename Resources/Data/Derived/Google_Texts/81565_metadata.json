Four reported injuries, but none of them were transported to the hospital.\n\nThe train usually travels 35 miles per hour in that area, Lyons said.\n\n\u201cThe operator saw the car in the intersection, went into maximum brake mode to stop the train, but it simply wasn\u2019t possible to stop the train at that time,\u201d he said.\n\nRail service was stopped in the area for over two hours. The scene has now been cleared and the train line is operating normally, Lyons said.\n\nOriginal, 10:43 a.m.: One person died Saturday morning after a Dallas Area Rapid Transit train crashed with a car in South Dallas.\n\nThe wreck happened around 9 a.m. at the 4100 block of Second Avenue, where the green line train passes over the road near Hatcher Station.\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear what caused the wreck.
