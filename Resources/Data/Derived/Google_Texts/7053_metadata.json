Last week he sounded like he was going to start singing Elton John's hit \"Sorry seems to be the hardest word\", as he apologized for people having their health plan canceled.\n\nLike the Fonz, Obama seemed to have a hard time time saying he was wrong, offering at times what sounded like a defensive apology. Obama was sorry, BUT.....\n\nOnce again, Obama mentioned that it was 5% of the population affected. He talked about seeing if HHS could fix the flaw and loophole in the law that allowed Insurers to cancel policies, instead of grandfathering them. The Administration knew that loophole existed before they launched the plan. Why didn't they fix it before the roll out?\n\nObamacare still offers more good than bad, in my opinion. But there's no denying the website was fatally flawed and Obama misled led people. It's good to see Obama no longer denies it.\n\nHealthCare.gov code and the cancellation loophole function like they were written by Potsie and Ralph. Hopefully Obama now has Richie working on the fix.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Jeff Darcy,Cleveland.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "editorial-cartoon, obama-apology, obamacare, opinion", "title": "Obama apologizes for plan cancellations: Editorial cartoon", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obama apologizes for plan cancellations: Editorial cartoon\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/darcy/index.ssf/2013/11/obama_apologizes_for_plan_canc.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/darcy/photo/13746594-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11613312\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-10T10:50:54Z\", \"author\": \"Jeff Darcy,Cleveland.com\", \"tags\": [\"editorial-cartoon\",\"obama-apology\",\"obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"description": "HealthCare.gov code and the canellation loophole function like the were written by Potsie and Ralph.
