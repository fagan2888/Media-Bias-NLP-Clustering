Held in conjunction with the Threefoot Arts Festival was the kickoff of 2016's Earth's Bounty.

The event featured many different vendors. People turned up to purchase fresh fruits, vegetables, plants, cupcakes, cheese and several other homemade goodies. Annette Baldwin has been coming since the fresh market's second year and says she is so happy to be a part of it this year.

"It's just incredible. We have larger crowds and I think people just come out and enjoy it. It's kind of like the first opportunity to get out this year," owner of The Potting Shed Annette Baldwin says.

Earth's Bounty is held on the first Saturday of each month through November at Singing Brakeman Park.
