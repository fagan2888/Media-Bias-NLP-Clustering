Catholic University says one of its basketball coaches has been killed in an accident in Kentucky while riding her bicycle across the country to support cancer research.

The university says Jamie Roberts was killed Friday in Scott County, Kentucky, when she and another rider were struck by a truck. A group of five cyclists had stopped while Roberts was changing a tire. The other rider who was struck sustained non-life-threatening injuries.

Roberts was an assistant coach for Catholic’s women’s basketball team and was the school’s assistant sports information director. She grew up in Rockville, Maryland, and graduated in 2011 from St. Mary’s College of Maryland. She played lacrosse, soccer and basketball.

Catholic University Athletic Director Sean Sullivan says Roberts will be remembered for her warmth, humor and thoughtfulness.
