Holder, who announced his plan to step down in September, is staying in his position until his successor's nomination is confirmed by Congress. (President Obama nominated Loretta Lynch earlier this month.)\n\n\"Are you saying that the Senate should refuse to confirm Loretta Lynch, the president's new nominee for attorney general, and thereby leave Eric Holder, who you don't like very much, in that position even longer?\" Wallace asked.\n\nCruz side-stepped Wallace's question, instead making general claims about checks and balances.\n\n\"What I\u2019m saying is we should use the constitutional checks and balances we have to rein in the executive,\" Cruz replied. \"In my view the majority leader should decline to bring to the floor of the Senate any nomination other than vital national security positions\u2026.If the majority leader announced that, it would impose real consequences on the president and the administration.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview with ABC's This Week that aired Sunday, Obama defended his record. \"The history is that I have issued fewer executive actions than most of my predecessors, by a long shot,\" he said. \"The difference is the response of Congress, and specifically the response of some of the Republicans.\"\n\n\"But if you ask historians\u2014take a look at the track records of the modern presidency\u2014I\u2019ve actually been very restrained, and I\u2019ve been very restrained with respect to immigration,\" added Obama. \"I bent over backwards and will continue to do everything I can to get Congress to work because that\u2019s my preference.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Texas senator possibly hasn&#39;t thought the whole plan out.", "author": "Allen McDuffee", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The Texas senator possibly hasn&#39;t thought the whole plan out.", "title": "Ted Cruz's Answer to Obama's Immigration Order: Keep Eric Holder in Office", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/11/AP985403864916/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/ted-cruzs-solution-to-immigration-order-is-to-keep-eric-holder-in-office/383085/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1120\"", "article_summary": "\"What I\u2019m saying is we should use the constitutional checks and balances we have to rein in the executive,\" Cruz replied.\n(President Obama nominated Loretta Lynch earlier this month.)\nAnd that's when Fox host Chris Wallace pointed out the problem with that approach: Attorney General Eric Holder, who has been a target for Republicans, would remain in office.\n\"I bent over backwards and will continue to do everything I can to get Congress to work because that\u2019s my preference.\u201d\nHolder, who announced his plan to step down in September, is staying in his position until his successor's nomination is confirmed by Congress."}
