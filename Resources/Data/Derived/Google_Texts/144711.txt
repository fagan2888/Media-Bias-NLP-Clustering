Charges have been dropped against a 85-year-old man who was accused of hitting a parking monitor on the head with his cane during an argument over his handicapped placard.

The Denver District Attorney dropped the assault charge Friday against John Copeland, according to Siddhartha Rathod, Copelandâ€™s attorney.

The third-degree assault charge stemmed from the incident that took place Dec. 15 when Copeland allegedly hit the parking monitor with his cane in the parking lot of a Home Depot in Stapleton.

The parking monitor was 66-year-old Richard Knudson, a volunteer for the Denver Office of Disability Rights.
