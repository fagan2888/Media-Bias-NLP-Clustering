â€” The mother of a 7-year-old girl who died in a Christmas night wreck on N.C. Highway 49 in Alamance County has been arrested and charged with her daughter's death.

Stephanie Flinchum, 31, was charged with felony death by motor vehicle, driving while impaired and two counts of misdemeanor child abuse. She was being held at the Alamance County Jail under $250,000 secured bond.

N.C. State Highway Patrol Trooper Christopher Knox said that while Flinchum's blood tests determining her blood alcohol content have not come back, there was enough evidence to charge her with DWI.

Flinchum was also charged with one count each of careless and reckless driving, driving left of center, failure to maintain lane, speeding and unsafe tires.

On Christmas night, Flinchum was estimated to have been traveling 90 mph in a 50 mph zone when her car ran off the road, struck a ditch and then hit a tree. Flinchum's two children, 8-year-old Kaden Deroiser and 7-year-old Kaylee Deroiser, were in the back seat.

Kaden Deroiser was wearing a seatbelt and Kaylee Deroiser was in a booster seat, but they were both ejected from the vehicle when it crashed. Authorities said that Kaylee Deroiser died on impact, and Kaden Deroiser was taken to UNC Hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. Flinchum, who was wearing a seatbelt, crawled out of the car and was taken to the hospital.
