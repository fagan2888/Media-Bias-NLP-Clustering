(AP) \u2014 A Spokane minister has been acquitted of a hate crime charge after convincing a jury he was acting in defense of his home when he allegedly used a gay slur while throwing out his estranged son and another man.\n\nRev. Derrick G. Moore, who pastors at New Destiny Tabernacle Apostolic Church, physically removed the two naked men from a shower in his home.\n\nThe incident resulted in Mr. Moore, 51, being charged and tried for felony charges of malicious harassment from the Spokane County prosecutor\u2019s office, the Spokesman-Review said.\n\nMr. Moore was recently acquitted. The state must cover the legal costs if a defendant successfully argues self-defense. Washington\u2019s laws protect defendants who are defending the lives of themselves or their families, as well as defending \u201creal or personal property,\u201d the Spokesman-Review said Wednesday.\n\nMr. Moore\u2019s attorney, Tim Note, said the case hinged on his right to establish rules in his home.\n\nDeputy prosecutor John Love said Mr. Moore could have handled the situation without violence and without hate speech.\n\nAccording to The Spokesman-Review, Mr. Moore was trying to keep several teenagers who were spending the night preparing for a youth church event the next day from seeing the behavior of his son, Antonio, who turned 21 in April.\n\n\u201cWe should be able to set the rules of acceptable conduct in our own home,\u201d Mr. Note told the Spokesman-Review. He also called the prosecution of the case \u201cabsurd and offensive.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Love, who tried the case, said one of the men received a cut above his eye in the scuffle and Mr. Moore could have handled the situation differently.\n\n\u201cOf course he has the right to make his own rules in his home,\u201d Mr. Love said this week. \u201cBut do you bust through a locked door and throw two naked men out in the middle of the night in February? Or do you ask them to leave first?\u201d\n\n\n\nNeither the father or son responded to interview requests for this story, the Spokesman-Review said.\n\n\n\nThe other man in the shower contacted police a week after the incident and requested that charges be filed.\n\nBoth he and Antonio said they went to the home after a night of drinking and were allowed inside, but the defense said they snuck in and were trespassing.\n\n\n\nMr. Note said Antonio, who has a history of property and drug crimes, was not allowed to stay overnight. Antonio had told his father he was gay just a few days before the shower incident, Mr. Note said.\n\n\n\nMr. Moore said he was awakened by his wife, who is his son\u2019s stepmother; she told him she suspected Antonio had brought a male friend into the home, Mr. Note said.\n\nMr. Moore listened at the bathroom door, where the men were allegedly having sex in the shower, then broke in.\n\n\n\nA scuffle followed, during which the other man sustained the cut after he was punched by Mr. Moore and pushed into the wall, he told police. Both men in the shower said Mr. Moore used a gay slur while dragging them out of the house at about 2:30 a.m.\n\n\n\nMr. Moore said at trial he didn\u2019t remember if he used the word, but admitted he was angry. Mr. Note said Mr. Moore, as a minister, cares for young people of all sexual orientations.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s not out in the public square spewing hate, he\u2019s in his own home,\u201d Mr. Note said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hate gay people.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe decision by the jury, composed of six men and six women, is at least the second time Spokane County has affirmed the protections of property owners from prosecution, the Spokesman-Review said.\n\nMr. Note had argued that Antonio, by sneaking into the home and having sex in the shower, was maliciously trespassing, a crime for which state law allows a self-defense argument. The term \u201cmalicious\u201d is defined under state law as any act showing an \u201cevil\u201d inclination \u201cto annoy, vex or injure another person,\u201d the Spokesman-Review said.\n\n\n\nMr. Note said the Moores do not allow premarital sex of any kind in their home.\n\nBut Mr. Love said the evidence didn\u2019t show the traditional indications of a self-defense case. \u201cThere was testimony that no one was being hurt, that no property was in threat of being damaged,\u201d Mr. Love said. \u201cThe defendant himself said what was being assaulted was \u2018my mind, and my rules.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\nDespite the acquittal, Mr. Note said his client regretted his choice of words that night.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I used a lot of words that night that are not the words I would choose to use in my house,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Note told the Spokesman-Review.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Spokane minister has been acquitted of a hate crime charge after convincing a jury he was acting in defense of his home when he allegedly used a gay slur while throwing out his estranged son and another man after finding them in his shower.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Spokane minister has been acquitted of a hate crime charge after convincing a jury he was acting in defense of his home when he allegedly used a gay slur while throwing out his estranged son and another man after finding them in his shower.", "title": "Spokane minister acquitted of gay hate crime by jury", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/12/spokane-minister-acquitted-of-hate-crime/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/12/AP464745367708.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/12/AP464745367708.jpg", "description": "A Spokane minister has been acquitted of a hate crime charge after convincing a jury he was acting in defense of his home when he allegedly used a gay slur while throwing out his estranged son and ano", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Spokane minister acquitted of gay hate crime by jury"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Derrick G Moore, Tim Note, Spokesman Review, John Love"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd5da\"", "article_summary": "Deputy prosecutor John Love said Mr. Moore could have handled the situation without violence and without hate speech.\n\u201cOf course he has the right to make his own rules in his home,\u201d Mr. Love said this week.\nMr. Moore was recently acquitted.\n\u201cThere was testimony that no one was being hurt, that no property was in threat of being damaged,\u201d Mr. Love said.\nNote said Mr. Moore, as a minister, cares for young people of all sexual orientations."}
