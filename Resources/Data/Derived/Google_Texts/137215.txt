Oklahoma City police arrested two suspects who broke into a home and assaulted the residents inside early Thursday morning.

According to police, at about 12:40 a.m., officers responded to the report of a home invasion in the 2700 block N. Coltrane Road. The caller said to police on the phone, “They broke in and have guns.”

There were five people inside the home at the time of the break-in. Police said multiple suspects knocked on the door and pushed their way in, when one victim began to open the door. Once inside, two suspects, 21-year-old Shaquille Devonte Mayes and 21-year-old Deondre Reece, began attacking the victims and even pistol-whipped them.

According to police, Mayes and Reece then kicked in the bedroom door where two more victims were sleeping, and they held them at gunpoint. Police said Reece told those two victims to take off their clothes and stand up against the wall.

The victims said when officers arrived, Reece held his gun against one victim's head and counted down from three, after he threatened to kill the victim.

According to police, during the attack, the suspects stole several items from the home and loaded them into an SUV. Mayes was standing on the front porch of the home when he saw the officers. He then ran back into the home and jumped out of the window, but officers were able to take him into custody.

Police searched the home and found Reece hiding in a bathtub. Officers said another suspect was able to run out of the house. That suspect has not been arrested.

Officers said they were able to locate the guns the suspects hid in a bedroom.

Both Mayes and Reece were booked into the Oklahoma County Jail on charges of robbery with a dangerous weapon, and assault with a dangerous weapon. Police said Mayes also had a warrant out for larceny of a motor vehicle.
