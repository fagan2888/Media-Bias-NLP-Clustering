I think the party has no choice but to go up from here.\u201d\n\nRepublicans spent the final day of the convention hurling procedural challenges at each other for hours in an attempt to throw out or defend some divisive delegates.\n\nThe day before, the often-overlooked credentials committee approved throwing out nearly 20 percent of the delegation. While committee members said they were enforcing party rules, the delegates facing removal said the panel had been stacked with tea party favorites who were picking and choosing who could vote on a new party chair and changes to the platform.\n\nDelegates were supposed to vote on platform amendments, including ensuring the placement of non-denominational Bibles in every classroom and removal of the provision demanding the repeal of the 17th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which allows voters to directly elect U.S. senators.\n\nBy Saturday, the general assembly became visibly angrier as the day went on, yelling out jeers as audience members held signs reading \u201cGood riddance cronyism.\u201d\n\nBy mid-afternoon, Labrador reminded the crowd that the convention was scheduled to adjourn at 3 p.m. Republicans approved leaving without voting on a single platform amendment.\n\n\u201cThe whole convention was a travesty,\u201d said Grant Loebs, a Twin Falls County delegate. \u201cAnd that adjournment vote was a mercy killing.\u201d\n\nMike Duff, a candidate for party chair, said he was also disappointed in how the convention ended. Many Republicans have been critical of current chairman Barry Peterson\u2019s leadership, and Duff said change needed to happen now rather than in two years. Duff campaigned as the candidate able to bring together tea partyers and traditional Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe have to maintain our credibility,\u201d Duff said. \u201cAnd today demonstrated we are not there yet. We need to make a change.\u201d\n\nLabrador, who seeking to become U.S. House majority leader after Eric Cantor\u2019s primary loss, had touted his work on a solution to unite the party for weeks prior to the convention but said it quickly fell apart once the event started. While his deal failed, Labrador said it was not indicative of his ability to lead House Republicans.\n\nState Rep. Steve Miller, R-Fairfield, said the political shake-down could be the wake-up call for both sides to reflect on the need for compromise.\n\n\u201cEverybody is locked into their deals but driving home, maybe they\u2019ll have time to think about what happened,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Idaho Republicans failed to elect a party chairman or pass a platform as political infighting drowned out party leaders' pleas for unity at the state GOP convention that wrapped up Saturday.", "Author": "KIMBERLEE KRUESI", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Idaho Republicans failed to elect a party chairman or pass a platform as political infighting drowned out party leaders\u2019 pleas for unity at the state GOP convention that wrapped up Saturday.", "title": "Infighting bogs down Idaho Republican convention", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/14/infighting-stalls-final-day-of-gop-convention/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/14/f0cd2592605b1917570f6a706700ffd2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/14/f0cd2592605b1917570f6a706700ffd2.jpg", "title": "Infighting bogs down Idaho Republican convention", "description": "Idaho Republicans failed to elect a party chairman or pass a platform as political infighting drowned out party leaders' pleas for unity at the state GOP convention that wrapped up Saturday.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e44\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is as low as the party can go,\u201d said Idaho Congressman Raul Labrador, who was appointed convention chairman.\nMOSCOW, Idaho (AP) - Idaho Republicans failed to elect a party chairman or pass a platform as political infighting drowned out party leaders\u2019 pleas for unity at the state GOP convention that wrapped up Saturday.\n\u201cAnd that adjournment vote was a mercy killing.\u201dMike Duff, a candidate for party chair, said he was also disappointed in how the convention ended.\nThe theme of the three-day convention was \u201cFreedom and Unity,\u201d but the only measures delegates voted on Saturday were efforts to kick out contentiously elected delegates.\n\u201cEverybody is locked into their deals but driving home, maybe they\u2019ll have time to think about what happened,\u201d he said."}
