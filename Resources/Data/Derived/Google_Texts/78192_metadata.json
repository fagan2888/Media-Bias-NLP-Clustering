International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, which was set up to investigate and prosecute organized crime and its pernicious influence over the government and judicial system.\n\nThe unprecedented U.N. body\u2019s future is uncertain, however. President Otto Perez Molina says he will decide soon whether Guatemala will continue cooperating with the commission or hand its responsibilities over to local law enforcement.\n\nAnalysts say it is far from clear Guatemala is ready to tackle corruption on its own and warn that a \u201cno\u201d from Perez Molina could imperil efforts to bolster the rule of law in a country plagued by endemic graft, gangs and a homicide rate of around 34 per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest in the world.\n\n\u201cThe institutions still need CICIG,\u201d said Guatemalan law professor Alejandro Balsells, using the commission\u2019s Spanish initials. \u201cThose who are against the commission staying are the ones who are upset that real justice could flourish in the country.\u201d\n\nThe commission has recently received support from influential international voices, including U.S. senators and Vice President Joe Biden, who earlier this year visited Guatemala for talks with Central American leaders about $1 billion in U.S. aid requested for the region by President Barack Obama.\n\nPerez Molina has said he will not be pressured on the matter and intends to announce a decision this month after he gets a recommendation from a panel named to evaluate the U.N. commission\u2019s work. While acknowledging the commission has achieved some results, he suggested its presence cannot be permanent.\n\n\u201cEven if it remained for 10 more years, it is not the commission that will solve the justice situation,\u201d Perez Molina told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cIt is us, the Guatemalans, who must see if we truly want to fix our institutions, strengthen them and move forward.\u201d\n\nCreated in 2007 after Guatemala asked for help in investigating serious crimes, the commission\u2019s staff of police and prosecutors from 25 nations has helped bring 161 public officials to trial for corruption, although it hasn\u2019t said how many of those were convicted. Its work also has incriminated two directors of the National Police, prompted the firing of hundreds of police officers with links to graft, drug trafficking and extrajudicial killings, and identified 33 criminal organizations operating in Guatemala.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UN anti-crime commission\u2019s future uncertain in Guatemala", "author": "Sonia Perez D.", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "UN anti-crime commission\u2019s future uncertain in Guatemala", "title": "UN anti-crime commission\u2019s future uncertain in Guatemala", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/19/un_anti_crime_commissions_future_uncertain_in_guatemala/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/guatemala-corruption.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UN anti-crime commission\u2019s future uncertain in Guatemala", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/guatemala-corruption.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "UN anti-crime commission\u2019s future uncertain in Guatemala", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "UN anti-crime commission\u2019s future uncertain in Guatemala", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9d1\"", "article_summary": "President Otto Perez Molina says he will decide soon whether Guatemala will continue cooperating with the commission or hand its responsibilities over to local law enforcement.\nPerez Molina has said he will not be pressured on the matter and intends to announce a decision this month after he gets a recommendation from a panel named to evaluate the U.N. commission\u2019s work.\n\u201cThe institutions still need CICIG,\u201d said Guatemalan law professor Alejandro Balsells, using the commission\u2019s Spanish initials.\n\u201cEven if it remained for 10 more years, it is not the commission that will solve the justice situation,\u201d Perez Molina told The Associated Press in an interview.\nThe unprecedented U.N. body\u2019s future is uncertain, however."}
