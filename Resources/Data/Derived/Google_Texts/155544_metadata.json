As of Saturday evening, the campaign had brought in $1,000 from 17 different donors.\n\n\"Remember any amount helps,\" Buchmann wrote in his email, which linked to the fundraising page. \"Your one time gift will go a long way to preserve our budget for educational purposes.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuchmann also asked parents to share the page link on social media, and encouraged the use of the hashtag \"#BelieveTPCA\".\n\nThe principal has not responded to numerous interview requests by the Camera, so further details on what, exactly, \"legal and other\" means in this context remain fuzzy.\n\nHowever, Young's family has already stated its disinterest in pursuing legal action against the school. \"No, we would never go there,\" Don Young said last week.\n\nOut Boulder and One Colorado, the two local advocacy organizations most closely involved in supporting Young, have also stated no plans to file lawsuits.\n\nAnd while U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, D-Boulder \u2014 the first openly gay parent in Congressional history \u2014 has criticized the school and called for third party to investigate Young's silencing, there's no indication that his office will bring forth a suit.\n\nSurely, some of the $50,000 Twin Peaks hopes to raise would go toward fees charged by Denver attorney Barry Arrington, who is representing the school. Arrington has said that the school is hiring a law firm to look into the case, a step Polis feels isn't sufficient.\n\nPolis has also recommended the ousting of Arrington, who is the former head of the Rocky Mountain Family Council, a group that champions \"family values\", and the former treasurer of Michele Bachmann's political action committee.\n\nIn a 2014 blog post, Arrington wrote that \"A man's body is designed to be complementary with a woman's body and vice versa. All of the confusion about whether same-sex relations are illicit would be swept away in an instant if everyone acknowledged this obvious truth.\"\n\nArrington isn't keen on Polis, either, and asked the Congressman to back off in a fiery exchange last week.\n\n\"What's next, a Maoist-style thought reform camp for everyone who has the temerity to disagree with you?\" Arrington wrote.\n\n\"In this instance it appears as if some political agenda that I don't understand might be clouding the quality of your advice to the Twin Peaks board,\" Polis wrote back.\n\nAt Wednesday's St. Vrain Valley School District board of education meeting, a vote is expected on whether to send a letter to Twin Peaks affirming the school's choice to hire \"an outside independent law firm\" to investigate the action against Young.\n\nThe proposed letter notes that the district board has limited legal authority over the school's internal operations, but is obligated to weed out discriminatory practices.\n\n\"This Board commends TPCA for taking prompt action on this matter,\" the letter reads. \"We hope that the investigation will be sufficiently broad to determine if there is a pattern or practice of discrimination towards students or faculty based upon sexual preference.\"\n\nAlex Burness: 303-473-1389, burnessa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/alex_burness", "article_metadata":
