Look up your state here.\n\nDeductibles, separate from insurance premiums paid to an insurer, are the amount a consumer owes for health care services before health insurance coverage kicks in. For example, a $1,000 deductible means that under some health care plans, the insurer will not pay for covered services until the consumer has paid that $1,000 out-of-pocket cost.\n\nAmericans in 17 states face deductibles increasing by double-digit percentages. In many states, deductible costs are now $3,000 or more.\n\nFreedom Partners analyzed gold, silver, and bronze plans under Obamacare, formally called the Affordable Care Act. Deductibles across these levels in the Obamacare health exchanges increased this year at an average of 8.4 percent (or $265). Some states saw increases over $1,000.\n\n\u201cDeductibles increasing in the exchanges is expected, as we have observed already that deductibles have been increasing at a vigorous rate in the majority of insurance markets,\u201d Drew Gonshorowski, a senior policy analyst in the Center for Data Analysis at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe average general annual deductible among all covered workers on employer-sponsored health insurance in 2015 was $1,077 for single coverage, compared to $303 in 2006, according to a survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust.\n\nThe same survey found that since 2010, deductibles for all workers have increased by 67 percent, almost three times as fast as premiums and about seven times as fast as wages and inflation.\n\nIn Obamacare marketplace plans with combined medical and prescription drug deductibles, sold to individuals in the 38 states that are facilitated through the federal marketplace, an average medical deductible in 2016 for gold plans is $1,247, for silver plans $3,064 (up from $2,556), and $5,765 for bronze plans (up from $5,328), according to analysis from Kaiser.\n\nThe District of Columbia and the states of Illinois, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Texas were the only jurisdictions to see an average decrease in deductible costs across Obamacare health plans.\n\nOther states saw a decrease in deductibles in some of their plans but had an overall average increase.\n\nPremiums under Obamacare also increased this year. A premium increase tracker by Freedom Partners found that premiums for individual health care plans in all 50 states increased by an average of 14.9 percent this year.\n\n\u201cAfter enduring double-digit premium increases and canceled plans under the Affordable Care Act, surging out-of-pocket costs\u2014specifically deductibles\u2014are making it difficult for Americans across the country to access the health care plans they were mandated to purchase,\u201d Freedom Partners says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cObamacare regulations and mandates continue to drive up these costs and make quality care less accessible,\u201d a policy adviser for Freedom Partners says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cObamacare regulations and mandates continue to drive up these costs and make quality care less accessible,\u201d a policy adviser for Freedom Partners says.", "title": "How Much Are Obamacare Deductibles Up in Your State?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160304_ObamacareDeductibles_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-17T11:56:25+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1R3VPk4"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cObamacare regulations and mandates continue to drive up these costs and make quality care less accessible,\u201d a policy adviser for Freedom Partners says.", "title": "How Much Are Obamacare Deductibles Up in Your State?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160304_ObamacareDeductibles_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2016-03-07T20:35:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-17T11:56:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health care, deductibles, insurance, premiums, Freedom Partners, Kaiser Family Foundation, Affordable Care Act, ACA"}, "article_summary": "Americans across the country are paying higher health care deductibles under Obamacare.\nDeductibles across these levels in the Obamacare health exchanges increased this year at an average of 8.4 percent (or $265).\nFreedom Partners, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting freedom and expanding opportunity, released an analysis of data tracking the weighted average of 2016 Obamacare deductibles in all 50 states.\nDeductibles, separate from insurance premiums paid to an insurer, are the amount a consumer owes for health care services before health insurance coverage kicks in.\n\u201cHigher Obamacare deductibles increase, by hundreds of dollars, what families must pay out of pocket to access their health insurance,\u201d Nathan Nascimento, senior policy adviser at Freedom Partners, said in a prepared statement."}
