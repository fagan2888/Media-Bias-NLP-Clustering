Health insurance giant Anthem unveiled its intention to absorb competitor Cigna, while Aetna put in a bid for Humana \u2014 mergers that, if approved, will cut the country\u2019s big insurers down from five to just three. Add to these proposals Centene\u2019s plan to scoop up Health Net, and it looks like a feeding frenzy.\n\nThe bad news is that we\u2019re the bait.\n\nOn Sept. 29, the House Judiciary Committee brought company CEOs into a hearing on the deals. There, committee members raised questions not only about competition, but also about the impact of such mergers on both affordability and quality of care.\n\nMeanwhile, the health insurance companies have put their PR in high gear.\n\nIn prepared testimony, Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish claimed the merger is about \u201ccomplementary platforms\u201d and \u201cbetter value.\u201d But this kind of lingo can\u2019t hide what the proposals are really about: They are not about making quality care more affordable, but about amassing profits in an industry where companies such as Anthem boast profits of $2.5 billion or more a year.\n\nWe certainly shouldn\u2019t buy the argument that bigger-than-ever health insurance companies will make our health insurance better or more affordable. If insurance giants grow even larger, we can expect premiums to rise \u2014 not go down. Take the example of UnitedHealth\u2019s purchase of Nevada\u2019s Sierra Health Group, triggering premium increases 13.7 percent greater than they would have been without the merger.\n\nThere\u2019s also the risk that insurers will squeeze more doctors, hospitals and other providers out of their networks, adding extra hassles and costs for patients. This danger is even higher for those living in low-income communities or rural areas where it\u2019s already hard to find doctors.\n\nAs the Sierra example shows, there\u2019s nothing new about insurance company mergers. Anthem attained \u201cmegaplan\u201d status 11 years ago when it snapped up WellPoint.\n\nAs a result, in many of our cities and towns, a small group of insurers \u2014 or even just one \u2014 has a real grip on the market. A recent American Medical Association report found a high concentration of insurance markets in 72 percent of metropolitan areas studied, with a single insurer claiming 30 percent of more of market share in 90 of these areas.\n\nYet, neither the House nor the Senate has a say in these deals. That\u2019s why we need the Department of Justice and our state watchdogs \u2014 whether attorneys general or insurance regulators \u2014 to take action against these proposals.\n\nHalting the mergers would be consistent with the Affordable Care Act, which gives us the tools to change the terms of competition among health insurance companies. Before the ACA, insurers competed for \u201cgood risk\u201d \u2014 meaning covering people who were young and healthy and dumping anyone with higher health care needs. Now they can\u2019t turn you down or charge you more for a pre-existing condition. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not still driven by the quest for profits and will try to bend or mold the rules to bolster those profits.\n\nThe DOJ and state regulators are our first line of defense in protecting the gains we\u2019ve made under the ACA. As the former head of DOJ\u2019s Antitrust Division Christine Varney said in 2010, \u201cif health care reform is to harness the power of competitive markets,\u201d antitrust enforcers \u201cmust be up to the challenge of ensuring that our health care markets are, in fact, as competitive as possible.\u201d\n\nBut strong antitrust enforcement alone isn\u2019t enough. Nationally and in each of our states, we also need to use all the tools the ACA gives us to make health insurance truly affordable and accountable. Right now, we\u2019re leaving too many of these options and others on the table.\n\nUsing those tools would mean adopting vigorous rate review and setting high standards for insurers that want to sell coverage through the new state and federally-sponsored marketplaces. Most of all, it would mean adding public coverage as an alternative for people shopping in these marketplaces.\n\nOur experience with too-big-to-fail banks taught us a powerful lesson: The worst course of action is to put our fate in the hands of an industry that protects its bottom line above its customers and the country as a whole.\n\nThe good news is that we have the tools to fight back against too-big-to-fail health insurance companies. Let\u2019s put those tools to use.\n\nLeeAnn Hall is the executive director of the Alliance for a Just Society. Wendell Potter is a senior analyst at the Center for Public Integrity.
