No, seriously, at DePaul University, the Black Student Union accused the school's College Republican chapter of a \u201chate crime\u201d after a chalking event was organized earlier this month, showing Trump-like slogans, along with others showing support of law enforcement and Israel. Oh, the horror \u2026 the horror (via College Fix):\n\nChalk messages triggered not just students but faculty and staff at the nation\u2019s largest Catholic university. DePaul University\u2019s Black Student Union accused its College Republicans (CRs) of a hate crime because they organized the April 4 chalking outside the Student Center, with messages that alluded to Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump and praised police and Israel. Though BSU representative Michael Lynch told The College Fix that he filed a hate-crime report against the CRs, both the DePaul administration and Public Safety department told The Fix they had not received any such report from Lynch. In a campus wide email Monday obtained by The Fix, Vice President for Student Affairs Eugene Zdziarski said \u201cmany students, faculty and staff found the chalk messages offensive, hurtful and divisive.\u201d They also violated campus regulations by endangering DePaul\u2019s tax-exempt status, he said \u2013 a claim that has been repeatedly challenged by a free-speech legal advocacy group.\n\nThe Fix added that DePaul BSU wanted to meet with the CR chapter, but backed out when they reportedly suggested a time. BSU representative said in an email that they would be withdrawing their invitation for a sit-down, saying they\u2019re going to \u201cfollow DePaul procedure regarding hate speech incidents on campus.\u201d If you\u2019ve seen the chalkings, there isn\u2019t any swastikas or overtly racist slogans. It says \u201cMake DePaul Great Again.\u201d Only the weakest of the weak of humanity could be offended by this, let along consider it hate speech. This is a concerted anti-First Amendment effort. Full stop. College students can\u2019t stand that some of their peers are pro-Trump. Again, I\u2019m not a fan of the billionaire magnate, but his supporters have a right to voice their opinions, whether that be attending rallies, making signs, wearing campaign swag, or drawing innocuous Trump-esque slogans on campus. This country is full of differing opinions. We\u2019re not North Korea, though I feel some students want to recreate that atmosphere here, where only one opinion (left-leaning of course) is accepted. I\u2019m sure these same students would change their minds after being hung upside down and tortured for days, but, alas, we\u2019re not an authoritarian dictatorship, though these social justice warriors are in many ways just too dumb to see that they support the ethos of it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seriously? .05/26/2016 19:15:17PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Seriously?", "title": "Oh My: DePaul's College Republican Chapter Accused of Committing A Hate Crime Over Trump-like Chalkings", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/17/oh-my-depauls-college-republican-chapter-accused-of-hate-crimes-for-trump-chalkings-n2149279", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/4/17/0.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Seriously?", "title": "Oh My: DePaul's College Republican Chapter Accused of Committing A Hate Crime Over Trump-like Chalkings", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/17/oh-my-depauls-college-republican-chapter-accused-of-hate-crimes-for-trump-chalkings-n2149279", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/4/17/0.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Oh My: DePaul's College Republican Chapter Accused of Committing A Hate Crime Over Trump-like Chalkings  , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "College students can\u2019t stand that some of their peers are pro-Trump.\nOh, the horror \u2026 the horror (via College Fix):Chalk messages triggered not just students but faculty and staff at the nation\u2019s largest Catholic university.\nNo, seriously, at DePaul University, the Black Student Union accused the school's College Republican chapter of a \u201chate crime\u201d after a chalking event was organized earlier this month, showing Trump-like slogans, along with others showing support of law enforcement and Israel.\nThe Fix added that DePaul BSU wanted to meet with the CR chapter, but backed out when they reportedly suggested a time.\nWell, the chalkings that have been popping up across college campuses, mostly drawn to show support for Donald Trump, has reached a new level of idiocy: they\u2019re hate crimes."}
