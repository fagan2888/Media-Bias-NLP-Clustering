It boggles the mind. Why not go through the motions of hearings, then shake their heads sadly while saying \u201ctsk tsk he\u2019s too liberal\u201d before shooting him down? Why let his nomination hang there?\n\nApparently, it\u2019s because they want to keep Garland in their back pocket in case Hillary Clinton wins the White House. (Let\u2019s put \u201cin case\u201d in scare quotes, actually.) This is the GOP trying to have it both ways\u2014try to hold on to that conservative seat in the off-chance that Donald Trump wins, but preventing Clinton from nominating someone more liberal when she ends up winning.\n\n(And if you think Clinton won\u2019t nominate someone more liberal, you are probably someone who tries to tar her for every bad thing her husband did during his eight years in the White House, right? If so, good for you! But you don\u2019t get to then ignore that it was Bill who nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer.)\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: The GOP is sitting on Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination. They WILL lose control of the Supreme Court, but they can get a lot worse than Garland. So they can either confirm him now, before the GOP convention in July, or they might as well shut the fuck up and look on helplessly as Clinton and a Democratic fliibuster-free Senate fill the seat.\n\nThe last thing we need is for Republicans to think they have a safety valve, that they can come in during the lame duck session, after having lost the White House and Senate, and then confirm an inferior candidate to the High Court.\n\nIt needs to be Garland now, or forever hold your peace. Republicans don\u2019t deserve any safety valves. They sure as hell haven\u2019t earned them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Following on the footsteps of Sen. Orin Hatch, Arizona Sen.
