Rand Paul on Monday continued to draw attention to Donald Trump\u2019s past liberal stances on a variety of issues.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a valid question to ask whether or not we can believe the sincerity of Mr. Trump,\u201d Paul said during a conference call with reporters on Monday evening about Trump\u2019s stances.\n\nPaul said there\u2019s \u201cconcern over whether or not Donald Trump is a fake conservative, or whether he\u2019s conservative at all.\u201d\n\nThe New York businessman, Paul said, has been \u201cfor the bank bailouts, been for Democrats running government, think [Democrats] run the economy better, been for gun control before he was against gun control, been for a single payer system before he was against a single payer system, for Obamacare before he was against Obamacare.\u201d\n\nPaul compared Trump to the big government Republicans the tea party movement targeted in 2010.\n\n\u201cI started out\u2026as being part of the tea party movement and one of our concerns really was about fake conservatives,\u201d he said. \u201cOur concern was that many Republicans said that they were for smaller government, yet government was getting bigger under Republicans.\u201d\n\nPaul and Trump have been feuding since last week\u2019s debate. Facing falling polling numbers and trying to inject some fresh enthusiasm into his campaign, Paul went on the offense against Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say that he\u2019s already hedging his bets because he\u2019s used to buying politicians,\u201d Paul said at the beginning of the debate, injecting himself into the conversation when Trump wouldn\u2019t commit to supporting the Republican nominee in the general election.\n\nTrump, in the debate, defended his past contributions to Democrats as a smart business move.\n\n\u201cBefore two months ago, I was a businessman,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI give to everybody. When they call, I give.\u201d\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "Rand Paul on Monday continued to draw attention to Donald Trump\u2019s past liberal stances on a variety of issues.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Kentucky Sen.
