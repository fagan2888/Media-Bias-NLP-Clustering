Between now and Christmas Day, chances are very low of getting any kind of precipitation, Koopmeiners said.\n\nThe National Weather Service defines a white Christmas as having 1 inch of snow on the ground on Christmas Day.\n\nFor those who live by the glass-half-full standard, they may want to cling to the service\u2019s bleak prediction of a 10 percent chance of snow on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.\n\n\u201cIt does not look good,\u201d Koopmeiners said.\n\nThe slightly better chance for snow exists on Christmas night heading into Saturday, he said, but even then the likelihood is small.\n\n\u201cThere is a low pressure trough over the northern part of the country, but I don\u2019t see a lot of energy with it,\u201d Koopmeiners said.\n\nSnow-lovers shouldn\u2019t feel too bad about the lack of white predicted for Friday. Only 44 Christmases in the past 115 years \u2014 or 38 percent \u2014 have qualified as white Christmases.\n\nThat percentage drops to 14 percent if you seek measurable snow actually falling from the sky.\n\nThe freshest snow to fall for Christmas morning was just three years ago, when nearly 3 inches of the stuff fell at Denver International Airport overnight on Christmas Eve. Last year saw even more snow on Christmas, but the storm didn\u2019t start until the afternoon.\n\nJohn Aguilar: 303-954-1695, jaguilar@denverpost.com or @abuvthefold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver weather: chance for a white Christmas \u201cdoes not look good\u201d", "title": "Denver weather: chance for a white Christmas \u201cdoes not look good\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/20/denver-weather-chance-for-a-white-christmas-does-not-look-good/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151220__Denver_parade_of_lightsp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151220__Denver_parade_of_lightsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-20T09:56:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:33:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The National Weather Service defines a white Christmas as having 1 inch of snow on the ground on Christmas Day.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re jonesing for a white Christmas, look to the north side of buildings,\u201d Robert Koopmeiners, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder, said Sunday morning.\nThose in search of Front Range snow on Christmas Day might want to get out a compass before peering out the window.\nFor those who live by the glass-half-full standard, they may want to cling to the service\u2019s bleak prediction of a 10 percent chance of snow on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.\nThe slightly better chance for snow exists on Christmas night heading into Saturday, he said, but even then the likelihood is small."}
