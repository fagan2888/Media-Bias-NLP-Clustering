His ears stuck out, and he wanted to get them fixed.\n\nHe\u2019s glad he didn\u2019t.\n\nA former Verizon worker from the Bronx, Ortiz has parlayed an eerie likeness to Barack Obama into a lucrative career traveling around the world as a presidential impersonator.\n\nOrtiz, 43, counts his blessings \u2014 although even he admits it\u2019s sometimes just a little too strange.\n\nLouis Ortiz works an average of two to three times a week as a Barack Obama impersonator. (Pearl Gabel/New York Daily News)\n\n\u201cI look at myself a lot in the mirror, and I start speaking like Barack,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like Barack is speaking through me, to me. . . . It\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\nOrtiz, who bills himself as Bronx Obama, works an average of two or three times a week as the President. His bookings, arranged through an agency, include parties and corporate conferences, an occasional television ad overseas \u2014 and even appearing as an unannounced guest at weddings.\n\n\u201cReal big Obama fans want me to come and say a surprise speech for the bride and groom,\u201d he explained in an interview with the Daily News, sandwiched between trips to Norway and Poland. \u201cIt\u2019s entertainment while everyone\u2019s all liquored up.\u201d\n\nThe presidential impersonator once dreamed about having plastic surgery. (Pearl Gabel/New York Daily News)\n\nHe\u2019s a strange barometer of President Obama\u2019s popularity.\n\nWhen Obama\u2019s approval numbers are high, Ortiz lands more gigs and when the President's popularity sinks, Ortiz feels the pain.\n\nPut another way, the killing of Osama Bin Laden was good for business. The fight over Obamacare, not so much.\n\nIn 2013, Ortiz made about $60,000, he says, which was down from 2012.\n\nLouis Ortiz seen before his \"Barack Obama\" transformation. (Pearl Gabel/New York Daily News) Louis Ortiz poses as Barack Obama after putting on makeup and a suit. (Pearl Gabel/New York Daily News)\n\nA spike in business may be on the horizon, however.\n\nA documentary on Ortiz, \u201cBronx Obama,\u201d by filmmaker Ryan Murdock, goes live for sale on iTunes, Vimeo and Amazon on Tuesday, and airs on Showtime at the end of the month.\n\nBorn in Manhattan, Ortiz grew up at 172nd St. and Commonwealth Ave. in the Bronx, and has two kids, a daughter, 19, and a son 14.\n\nAn Army veteran, Ortiz worked for the phone company for 13 years as a field technician. He was out of work in 2008 when people kept telling him, \u201cYou know who you look like?\u201d And so his new life as an Obama Doppelganger was born.\n\nTo make the impersonation more believable, Ortiz covers his face with primer, followed by concealer, foundation, powder, a bit of lipstick to darken his mouth, and a spot of eyeliner to re-create Obama\u2019s mole. (Pearl Gabel/New York Daily News)\n\nOrtiz relies on more than his standout ears to be an Obama double. Extensive makeup completes the transition.\n\nOrtiz, who\u2019s Puerto Rican by heritage, covers his face with primer, followed by concealer, foundation, powder, a bit of lipstick to darken his mouth, and a spot of eyeliner to re-create Obama\u2019s mole.\n\nHe puts on a black suit and a crisp white shirt with American flag cuff links, a dark suit, a preknotted red tie and, yes, a flag lapel pin. He\u2019s able to mimic Obama\u2019s gestures, grin and voice.\n\nLouis Ortiz occasionally messes with people into thinking he's Barack Obama. (Pearl Gabel/New York Daily News)\n\nBut it\u2019s the visual likeness that\u2019s the most stunning, which was made clear when Ortiz \u2014 in his Obama suit and makeup \u2014 walked with a Daily News reporter and Murdock in lower Manhattan one day last week.\n\nImmediately, a tourist\u2019s eyes strayed from a map and opened wide. Car windows slid down. A young woman reported on her cell phone, \u201cI just saw a pseudo-Barack Obama!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. . . . Every gesture \u2014 the way he moves, the way his hair\u2019s cut, his ears, the smile,\u201d Herby Aristide, 33, a bus-tour guide from Brooklyn, said as he snapped photos for his Facebook page. \u201cGuy looks like Obama. Wow!\u201d\n\nPeople crowd around Ortiz for photos outside the Bowling Green station. (Pearl Gabel/New York Daily News)\n\nOutside the Bowling Green subway station, so many people crowded around for pictures, Murdock implored them to form a line \u2014 and they did. Visitors from China and Italy rushed over. People brought their children.\n\nHe\u2019s a hit. And it\u2019s obvious Ortiz enjoys it, too.\n\nYes, Ortiz does mess with people on occasion \u2014 a favorite trick is to stroll into a restaurant, glance around and walk out, leaving customers boggled. And it does get scary sometimes \u2014 he once was accosted by a homeless guy who \u201crecognized\u201d him in Toronto.\n\nLouis Ortiz is a hit with the crowd and he enjoys it too. (Pearl Gabel/New York Daily News)\n\nThat\u2019s why even though Obama can see retirement in 2017, Ortiz thinks he will still be handing out his business cards, which feature him posing as the President on the front and say, \u201cHIRE ME NOW\u201d on the back.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the first African-American President. He\u2019s going to be around for a long time. He\u2019s history,\u201d Ortiz said confidently. \u201cHence, I\u2019m going to be around for a long time.\u201d\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
