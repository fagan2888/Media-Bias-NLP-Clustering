Having grown up in a busy commercial district in Chicago, we were used to not having parking in front of our building. We lived in the third floor apartments over the family restaurant.

We carried the groceries home in our arms. My parents owned one car for a family of six. We walked or used public transportation. My father rented a garage space to store the car that he drove to his second job in the suburbs. The street was for public transport.

I also lived in California near the beach. We rented a spot for our one car for a family of four. I usually took public transportation or walked. We chose to live there and pay extra for the parking place.

I suggest that individuals who want parking near their place of residence build a garage or parking space, rent a spot, or walk.

City government cannot solve every issue and should not be expected to do so. Preferences sometimes come with a price tag. We need better public transportation for all, and that is where government can play a role.

There are many other areas where attention is needed to provide better quality of life and to ensue a brighter future for Boulder. Use of insecticides, polluting wood burning, noisy, polluting gas-powered leaf blowers and the like. Ordinances and enforcement are weak in these areas.

Let's look beyond our own immediate desires to work to make the community a better place to live. Future generations will thank us.
