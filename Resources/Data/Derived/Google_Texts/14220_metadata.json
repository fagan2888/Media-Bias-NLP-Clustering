Even Santa, himself, came out to listen to the Christmas wishes of all the good boys and girls. Kids played on bouncy toys and fished for presents. Vice Wing Commander Eric Bratu says this is a great way to show gratitude to both service members and their families.\n\n\"it's an opportunity for them to come out and intermingle with other areas of the base that they might not get to see,\" he says. \"It's a chance to fellowship. It's a chance for the wing leadership and others to move around, so if the families do have questions we're available to ask. It just puts it in a more relaxed environment. \"\n\nOrganizers say it's the support of these military families that helps to make such a difference in the Air National Guard.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Key Field Air National Guard Base invited military families out for its annual Family Day.", "language": "english", "author": "Candace Barnette", "og": {"description": "Key Field Air National Guard Base invited military families out for its annual Family Day.", "title": "Military Families Celebrate Family Day at Key Field", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Military-Families-Celebrate-Family-Day-at-Key-Field-284995911.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/E3D/C13/E3DC13A86FEA4859A336B0189520CE3E", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/474/F11/474F111E69924D5C96279B08B8747C53.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Key Field Air National Guard Base invited military families out for its annual Family Day.", "title": "Military Families Celebrate Family Day at Key Field", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Military-Families-Celebrate-Family-Day-at-Key-Field-284995911.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/family+day1.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Military Families Celebrate Family Day at Key Field", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Military Families Celebrate Family Day"}, "article_summary": "The Key Field Air National Guard base had an extra big crowd on hand Saturday for its annual Family Day.\nEach year, Key Field invites all military spouses, children and family members to come out to the hangar for food, fellowship and games.\nOrganizers say it's the support of these military families that helps to make such a difference in the Air National Guard.\nVice Wing Commander Eric Bratu says this is a great way to show gratitude to both service members and their families.\nIt's a chance for the wing leadership and others to move around, so if the families do have questions we're available to ask."}
