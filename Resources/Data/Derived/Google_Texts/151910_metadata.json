Instead, hospitals and health systems large and small have adopted it as framework for major provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn a recent assessment of the approach, the architects of the idea looked back over the past seven years and concluded that, \"the Triple Aim became part of the US national strategy for tackling health care issues,\" especially in the implementation of the PPACA.\n\nJohn Whittington, one of the authors of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement study, Pursuing the Triple Aim: The First Seven Years, put it this way last week: \"We were very fortunate in the timing of this idea.\"\n\nOthers agree, noting that the Triple Aim, along with the financial incentives built into the healthcare reform law, is generating meaningful changes in the way health care is delivered.\n\nAt the same time, the IHI study suggests that one of the aims, cost reduction, is going to be more challenging than the other two. Published in the June issue of the Milbank Quarterly, the study notes that \"Although several communities have made improvements for their populations for a particular health issue, few have been able to address the difficult challenge of obtaining the healthcare cooperation needed to improve per capita spending in a competitive health care environment in their community.\"\n\nStill, even veterans of health reform efforts have been surprised by how fast the concept has spread and the changes it has enabled.\n\nThe Triple Aim offers a much-needed \"soundbite\" for those pushing health reforms, says Michael Millenson, a patient safety expert and author.\n\n\"The most important part of the Triple Aim is that it takes the ideas of improving safety and quality and puts them into a readily understandable context that resonates with clinicians and the general public, particularly with politicians,\" he says. \"It puts the cost issue into a perspective that isn't radioactive politically.\"\n\nThat served Donald Berwick, MD, well when he left IHI in 2010 to run the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. According to the IHI study, Berwick announced at an insurance industry conference that he was directing CMS \"toward the Triple Aim as our highest-level goal.\" The authors also note that in 2011, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality incorporated the Triple Aim into its National Strategy for Quality Improvement in Health Care.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Fueled by the financial incentives built into the healthcare reform law, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's concept is generating meaningful changes in the way healthcare is delivered, research finds.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "article_summary": "The Triple Aim, an approach to health delivery that targets quality, cost and population health, could have been just another piece of healthcare jargon.\n7 Years In, Triple Aim Transcends JargonFueled by the financial incentives built into the healthcare reform law, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's concept is generating meaningful changes in the way healthcare is delivered, research finds.\nThe Triple Aim offers a much-needed \"soundbite\" for those pushing health reforms, says Michael Millenson, a patient safety expert and author.\nAccording to the IHI study, Berwick announced at an insurance industry conference that he was directing CMS \"toward the Triple Aim as our highest-level goal.\"\nOthers agree, noting that the Triple Aim, along with the financial incentives built into the healthcare reform law, is generating meaningful changes in the way health care is delivered."}
