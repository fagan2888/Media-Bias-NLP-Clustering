And I think people forget that.\u201d\n\nMiddleman is featured in an upcoming NOVA film, \u201cVaccines \u2014 Calling the Shots,\u201d which takes viewers around the world to track epidemics, explore the science behind vaccinations, hear from parents wrestling with vaccine-related questions and weigh the risks of vaccinating versus the risks of opting out, according to the show\u2019s website.\n\nShe answered questions about the film, which airs Wednesday on PBS.\n\nWhat should people anticipate from this film?\n\nMiddleman said viewers will learn a lot about the biology of vaccines, what vaccines are and what they aren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to get a nice discourse on what makes vaccines so safe, but also, there\u2019s a respectful discussion of how there can be some confusion and concern when things go wrong,\u201d Middleman said.\n\nPeople mistakenly connect children who develop certain disorders, such as autism, with the alleged affects of vaccines, although that\u2019s been found repeatedly in published peer-reviewed scientific articles to not be true, she said.\n\n\u201cThe critical piece is, vaccines are incredibly safe and incredibly effective and unfortunately victims of their own success because now anything that happens after a vaccine is unfortunately attributed to the vaccine when in fact the relationship may be in time only, not in cause,\u201d Middleman said.\n\nHow have you seen the conversation around vaccines evolve?\n\nThe discussion over the safety of vaccines became an increasingly popular one around the early 2000s, Middleman said.\n\nThis came around the same time that two papers by former physician Andrew Wakefield and colleagues were published that allegedly claimed connections between the MMR vaccine and autism, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. These papers were later found to have critical flaws.\n\n\u201cThe connection has now been completely debunked for the most part,\u201d Middleman said. \u201cThere is no connection between autism and vaccines, and I think the film clearly explains that and presents new data indicating autism has fetal origin and also has a genetic basis primarily, so this film really helps debunk that myth in a way that I think is really satisfying.\u201d\n\nWhat got you interested in studying vaccines?\n\nDuring her medical training fellowship, Middleman started researching the Hepatitis B vaccine. This first got her interested in vaccines.\n\n\u201cThat was a really exciting time because the Hepatitis B vaccine was one of the first vaccines that, at the time, targeted adolescents and really looked to protect that age group as well,\u201d Middleman said.\n\nDuring \u201cVaccines: Calling the Shots,\u201d Middleman assesses the safety and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine, among other things.\n\n\u201cThis vaccine prevents cancer \u2014 we\u2019ve been waiting for that for years \u2014 it\u2019s such an exciting time and yet people are expressing fear about this vaccine, and it doesn't make sense because the science reports it as one of the safest vaccines available,\u201d Middleman said.\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some types of HPV can cause health problems, including genital warts and cancers, according to the CDC.\n\nThe low rates of girls and boys who have gotten the HPV vaccine can be somewhat attributed to the association the vaccine has with sex and sexuality, she said.\n\nThe CDC has documented a continually low rate of youths who receive the vaccine.\n\nMeanwhile, the Vaccines for Children program and insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act both generally cover the HPV vaccine, she said.\n\n\u201cMy role as a mother is to protect my children from everything I can before I let them out in the world, and I\u2019m going to protect them from HPV and related cancer,\u201d Middleman said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for and hopefully I can protect as many patients as I possibly can.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Amy Middleman, adolescent medicine chief in the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine\u2019s pediatrics department, is featured in an upcoming NOVA film, \u201cVaccines \u2014 Calling the Shots.\u201d", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
