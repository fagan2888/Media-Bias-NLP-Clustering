A Fort Worth house fire sent an elderly couple to the hospital Thursday morning.

Fort Worth firefighters responded to a fire in the 4400 block of Carmel Avenue around 10:30 a.m. and found an 80-year-old woman who had broken a window to escape. But she told firefighters that her husband was still inside, said Fort Worth Fire Department spokesman Kyle Clay.

He said firefighters found the 79-year-old man in bed trapped under smoke and suffering from cardiac arrest. They took him to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth.

His condition was unknown.

His wife was also taken to a separate hospital for treatment of hand and arm injuries from breaking the window to escape.

Clay said the couple had lived in the home for more than 30 years.

“It’s always bad, especially when you have people hurt or worse in a fire, but when it’s on a holiday, it’s a little bit more tragic,” he said.
