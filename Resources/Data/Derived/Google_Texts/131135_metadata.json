Grandma scratched her head and thought about her pills. Have I taken all of my pills? The ones for the high blood pressure, dizziness, and all my other problems?\u201d\n\nShe stopped and faced Toby. \u201cDo you remember if I took all my pills today?\u201d\n\nThe child smiled as he looked into her brown eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know Gram, I think you did. But I don\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\nSometimes Toby worried about Grandma. She was getting older and he was more than happy to go along with her just to help. But if Toby knew the truth, she also worried about him because that is what Grandmothers do, too.\n\nGrandma shook her head and muttered to Toby and herself at the same time, \u201cThank goodness I retired from teaching years ago. I just wouldn\u2019t have the energy for it these days. No way.\u201d\n\nThey kept on walking and just before the line to the counter formed, Toby\u2019s eyes got real big and he stared. Boy, oh boy, he thought, I hope this isn\u2019t going to be a problem. He had spotted a man and woman struggling with four children. The kids fidgeted and whined. But it was the man that put a little fear in Toby. Toby put his finger on it immediately. Well, I guess he looks rough and mean. Toby moved closer to grandma. It was a move meant to make Toby feel safer. He gently nudged his grandma.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she enquired peering down at him with a concerned look.\n\n\u201cLook at the man\u2019s neck,\u201d Toby whispered nervously.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Grandma.\n\nToby didn\u2019t dare point directly, he slowly faced the man as he clung near the safety of his grandmother. Bit by bit he raised his finger to indicate the direction she needed to look in.\n\n\u201cHmmm, Yes, I do see,\u201d she said with a soft voice. Grandma also noticed what Toby had seen \u2013 the tattoo. A big black spider tattoo on the man\u2019s neck. Grandma took in a long breath and continued watching the man and his family. She tried not to stare or at least not to be noticed by him. His white T-shirt, shaved head and baggy blacks pants confirmed her suspicions.\n\nHe\u2019s probably a gang member, I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s been to jail. Lord only knows what he\u2019s been up to. She also regretted the thought once it popped in her head. But now a conflict arose. Both groups of people \u2013 Grandma and Toby, and the man and his family \u2013 arrived at the counter at about the same time. The smallest child cried. The man gave the child a stern look and the child immediately stopped crying.\n\nWow, thought the grandmother, he has power, too. A chill went up her back and she clung a little more tightly to Toby. She decided she\u2019d avoid any problem by letting the man and his group go ahead.\n\n\u201cYou go first,\u201d she meekly offered and she stood her ground, waiting for him to pass ahead of her.\n\n\u201cNo, you go first,\u201d he insisted and he halted his children and wife with an outstretched arm.\n\n\u201cYou have more people with you.\u201d Grandmother answered, \u201cand we don\u2019t mind waiting. We\u2019re used to waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should respect our elders,\u201d he replied and with a gentle sweeping motion indicated the way for grandma and Toby.\n\nWell, I guess we better go first. No sense in having a problem over this. A nervous smile crossed her lips as she hobbled in front of the man. She scooted Toby along with her.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said as she almost pushed Toby in front of her.\n\n\u201cYou are most welcome,\u201d the man replied and a small smile flickered on his face.\n\nToby placed their small plastic bag of items on the counter and waited. He was still a little tense and wanted to look back and see what would happen next, if anything, but he didn\u2019t dare.\n\nHowever, his grandmother had turned to face the man and Toby twisted his head just enough to peer up and behind her. Toby knew what was going to happen next \u2013 the teacher in her just had to ask a question, just one simple question. And Toby was right because he knew his grandma well. He wasn\u2019t shocked when she turned and faced the man. But Toby did have to admit he was still a little frightened.\n\nGrandma saw the tattoo, his muscles, the bald head, and the white sleeveless T-shirt. But she looked past them into his dark black eyes and said.\n\n\u201cI have to ask you. Who taught you your good manners?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is very simple, Mrs. Simpson, you did. You did, way back in the third grade.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://bit.ly/1NRTiX4", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "She tried not to stare ...
