Conboy said that D.C. will issue decisions on concealed carry applications. However, he reiterated that the city had \u201cnot approved any right now.\u201d\n\nThere is still confusion about how people will complete the required 16 hours of classroom training and two hours of range training. Conboy said that the city is still working to officially license a trainer, and could not confirm reports from other police officials that such a trainer had been selected for training.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While applying for my own DC concealed carry permit last week, I was told the city has yet to approve any applicants. Now, it had only been about 3 weeks since the police department began accepting applications and many states take more than a month to complete the process. However, DC allows people to apply before they've completed the required training in order to see whether or not they qualify for a permit under the city's highly restrictive law. So, I thought the process might be expedited. I spoke with DC police Lieutenant Sean Conboy this afternoon to get a better understanding of exactly how the process works.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "It has been exactly one month since the city of Washington, D.C., began accepting applications for its new concealed carry permit, and the city does not know\u00a0how long it will take to process those re", "title": "D.C.
