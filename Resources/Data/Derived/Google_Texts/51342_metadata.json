Political scientists began tracking formal veto threats in 1985.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton in 1997 came closest to Mr. Obama\u2019s pace, issuing 19 veto threats between the start of a new Congress and May 3 of that year.\n\nSEE ALSO: Bobby Jindal: GOP needs Obamacare replacement \u2018today\u2019\n\nRepublicans have taken aim at the president\u2019s reliance on veto threats, which usually are spelled out in official White House documents known as \u201cstatements of administration policy.\u201d GOP leaders say Mr. Obama has proved he\u2019s not interested in working with them on bipartisan goals and instead is intent on blocking Republicans\u2019 agenda at every turn.\n\n\u201cDespite Republicans reaching across the aisle to pass good legislation, the president has responded with veto threats President Obama has shown time and again that he is unwilling to work with Congress by threatening to veto bills before they even get a chance to reach his desk,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, wrote on his website last week. \u201cThe American people don\u2019t want vetoes. They want Washington to work. But it can only work if the President stops his obstruction and starts cooperating with Congress.\u201d\n\nOver just the past week, Mr. Obama has issued four veto threats. On April 28, he vowed to veto two House appropriations bills, one to fund veterans\u2019 programs and the other to provide money for energy programs, to safely guard the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons and other priorities.\n\nOn April 29, he said he would veto House legislation requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to clarify its jurisdictional authority under federal law. And most recently, on April 30, he promised to block a bill to overturn the District of Columbia\u2019s Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Act.\n\nRepublicans say the bill would force pro-life organizations to hire pro-choice employees and may require employers to pay for abortions.\n\nThe White House took a much different view and, as is usually the case, spelled out its specific objections to the legislation in a statement of policy.\n\n\u201cThis legislation would give employers cover to fire employees for the personal decisions they make about birth control and their reproductive health. These personal decisions should not jeopardize anyone\u2019s job or terms of employment,\u201d the administration said. \u201cThe act preserves the current exception in the District\u2019s Human Rights Law for religious entities and does not impose additional requirements on employers, contrary to their personal beliefs, to provide insurance coverage related to reproductive health decisions.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Obama has been quick to issue veto threats, he actually has vetoed just three bills during his time in office. Most recently he vetoed legislation approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline, saying the State Department needs more time to conduct environmental studies and other reviews of the project.\n\nPolitical analysts say the president\u2019s frequent veto threats \u2014 and Republican complaints about them \u2014 usually are of little interest to average voters.\n\nBut the practice could rally Democrats in the House and the Senate. Democrats may become emboldened by the supposedly lame-duck president standing up for their positions, according to Matthew Dallek, a political science professor at George Washington University.\n\n\u201cIt sends a signal to his party about where he stands and where his red lines are on any particular piece of legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vast majority of these veto threats go far over the heads of most voters. But occasionally there are issues that rise to prominence and narratives that get formed. If Democrats are able to paint Republican majorities as extreme or obstructionist, or both, that is to their political advantage. That can be a theme that can certainly take hold.\u201d\n\nThe flip side, Mr. Dallek said, is that Republicans could paint Mr. Obama as the main roadblock to progress if the president frequently is seen vetoing bills the voting public supports.\n\n\u201cThe public can also, as a broad matter, see that Obama isn\u2019t signing much or doing much. What\u2019s getting done in Washington?\u201d Mr. Dallek said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama this year has taken veto threats to unprecedented heights, setting a new record while vowing to block a host of GOP-backed bills that span the political spectrum.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama this year has taken veto threats to unprecedented heights, setting a new record while vowing to block a host of GOP-backed bills that span the political spectrum.", "title": "Obama veto threats irk GOP", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/3/obama-veto-threats-irk-gop/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/04/30/obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/04/30/obama.jpg", "description": "President Obama this year has taken veto threats to unprecedented heights, setting a new record while vowing to block a host of GOP-backed bills that span the political spectrum.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama veto threats irk GOP"}, "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, House, Congress, Washington"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34d6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe vast majority of these veto threats go far over the heads of most voters.\nOn April 29, he said he would veto House legislation requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to clarify its jurisdictional authority under federal law.\nPolitical analysts say the president\u2019s frequent veto threats \u2014 and Republican complaints about them \u2014 usually are of little interest to average voters.\nBut it can only work if the President stops his obstruction and starts cooperating with Congress.\u201dOver just the past week, Mr. Obama has issued four veto threats.\nPresident Obama this year has taken veto threats to unprecedented heights, setting a new record while vowing to block a host of GOP-backed bills that span the political spectrum."}
