Governor Deval Patrick has also contracted the technology firm Optum to serve as an advisor as the Bay State continues work to fix the Massachusetts Health Connector website. The state will not immediately cut ties with its primary website vendor, CGI Group, but has transferred the handling of its contract with the company to the Executive Office of Administration and Finance, therein relieving the UMass Medical School of its duties. Iselin is taking on the role for the next four months.\n\n\u201cWhen you are doing a project this big and one that gets off track, you really need a single point of accountability,\u201d said Iselin.\n\nThe shakeup is a result of recommendations from the MITRE Corporation. In January, the state brought in the non-profit research group to conduct an independent review of the Connector and the website. A four-day assessment found a lack of organization, communication and leadership among the commonwealth\u2019s team and CGI. MITRE\u2019s findings also show CGI did not adequately apply resources and indicated \u201cit had taken on more work than it could accomplish within the timeframe available.\u201d The governor says ending things with CGI crossed his mind, but Iselin says it was decided the firm was needed for the time being.\n\n\u201cCutting off a relationship with a vendor who is providing such incredibly technical services is significant,\u201d Iselin said. \u201cSo we are going to take this one day at a time, one week at a week and we\u2019re really holding their feet to the fire.\u201d\n\nWhile most other states had the task of enrolling thousands if not millions of people in Affordable Care Act plans, Massachusetts\u2019 primary focus was moving 300,000 people already covered under long-standing state insurance to federal plans. Patrick says on January 1st the Connector smoothly transitioned 130,000 of those people. But, due to a lack of total website functionality, the Connector set up manual workaround methods like mailing out applications and tripling staffing at call centers to get 30,000 new applicants temporarily covered. Iselin says the most challenging part was that the state\u2019s previous website, set up under its groundbreaking 2006 law, allowed people who weren\u2019t getting government subsidized plans to shop, but the national law expands coverage to more people.\n\n\u201cThose were folks who might be self-employed or for other reasons buying coverage on their own,\u201d Iselin explained. \u201cThat\u2019s really the community of people that our old website was designed to serve. We\u2019re now, under the requirements of national reform, creating a website that actually is able to support eligibility determination for subsidies across the entire population. It\u2019s just a completely different system requirement. So we had to start over.\u201d\n\nSo far, Massachusetts has paid $15 million of its $69 million deliverable-based contract with CGI, a company that was also a contractor for the problem-plagued federal website. Jean Yang heads the state\u2019s Health Connector.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to be making additional payments until key milestones are delivered,\u201d said Yang.\n\nIselin says Optum will stay on while the state continues to assess its plans moving forward. She says potential payment sources include federal and state funds as well as money remaining from the CGI contract. The state faces a March 31 deadline to fully transition the 97 percent of its citizens covered under its health-care law to the federal Affordable Care Act. A recent Boston Globe article reports state health officials knew of potential website problems in July, citing a memo from UMass Medical School.
