Sworn in on November 11 to serve out Cantor\u2019s term, the economist will now be able to vote during the \u201clame duck\u201d 113th Congress.\n\nIn this exclusive Daily Caller video interview, Brat was asked whether the Congress should fight or fund President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty when Congress has some leverage when the government funding bill expires on December 11.\n\nHe said he hopes the Republican leadership doesn\u2019t \u201cabandon the power of the purse\u201d by saying there would never be a government shutdown. \u201cI don\u2019t think our leadership would want to give up their leverage over the entire U.S. economy. I hope that\u2019s not where they are moving.\u201d\n\nIf President Obama shuts down the government instead of accepting a short term government funding bill that bridges to the new Congress in January, Brat says Republicans will need to improve their messaging efforts to speak to America.\n\nTo Brat, the mandate of the November election was simple. It was to stop President Obama\u2019s fundamental transformation of the country. In discussing a talk by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to freshmen last week, Brat says, \u201c[Political leaders] are not taking charge of the country and the people feel ill at ease. They are frustrated, they are not at peace.\u201d\n\nBrat ran for office on six Republican principles, he tells us \u2013 \u201cfree market, equal treatment under the law, fiscal responsibility, adherence to the Constitution, strong national defense and belief in God.\u201d He suggests what is missing in Washington to make the right decisions come down to \u201cpolitical courage.\u201d\n\nCommenting on Obamacare and the infamous economist, Jonathan Gruber, whose recently exposed videos demonstrate fraudulent packaging to market Obamacare, Brat says as a fellow economist it\u2019s \u201ca sad day for the profession\u201d since Gruber \u201creverse engineered\u201d economics to sell central planning. Brat says the economic term is \u201cfatal conceit\u201d \u2014 that government can plan for 300 million people better than they can plan for themselves.\n\nBrat hopes Congress will rein in welfare fraud as they end the corporate version in coming months. On Common Core, he found that both parents and teachers object to the top-down curriculum. Brat says, Common Core \u201cviolates the teacher-pupil relationship, just as Obamacare violated the doctor-patient relationship.\u201d\n\nFor more on Congressman Dave Brat, go to his website.\n\nMrs. Thomas does not necessarily support or endorse the products, services or positions promoted in any advertisement contained herein, and does not have control over or receive compensation from any advertiser.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ginni Thomas", "description": "He hopes the Republican leadership doesn\u2019t 'abandon the power of the purse'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's Virginia constituents surprised the entire Republican establishment by dumping Cantor and voting in an economist in last June\u2019s primary with a compellingly", "title": "Meet The Freshman Congressman Who Defeated Eric Cantor [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/23/meet-the-freshman-congressman-who-defeated-eric-cantor-video/", "image": {"width": 1173, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rep-Dave-Brat-VA-Grae-Stafford-Daily-Caller-e1461359488777.jpg", "height": 477}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He hopes the Republican leadership doesn\u2019t 'abandon the power of the purse'", "title": "Meet The Freshman Congressman Who Defeated Eric Cantor [VIDEO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/23/meet-the-freshman-congressman-who-defeated-eric-cantor-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rep-Dave-Brat-VA-Grae-Stafford-Daily-Caller-e1461359488777.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-23 10:30:03", "sailthru.title": "Meet The Freshman Congressman Who Defeated Eric Cantor [VIDEO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "dave brat", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "ginni-thomas", "sailthru.description": "Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's Virginia constituents surprised the entire Republican establishment by dumping Cantor and voting in an economist in last June\u2019s primary with a compellingly", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rep-Dave-Brat-VA-Grae-Stafford-Daily-Caller-e1461359488777.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf01d\"", "article_summary": "It was to stop President Obama\u2019s fundamental transformation of the country.\nBrat says, Common Core \u201cviolates the teacher-pupil relationship, just as Obamacare violated the doctor-patient relationship.\u201dFor more on Congressman Dave Brat, go to his website.\nSworn in on November 11 to serve out Cantor\u2019s term, the economist will now be able to vote during the \u201clame duck\u201d 113th Congress.\nBrat hopes Congress will rein in welfare fraud as they end the corporate version in coming months.\n4389520Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s Virginia constituents surprised the entire Republican establishment by dumping Cantor and voting in an economist in last June\u2019s primary with a compellingly principled message."}
