Pundits explain which ads worked, which didn\u2019t, and who won because he raised more money and spent more on negative ads.\n\nAmong Republicans this year, says Ad Age, Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign and supporters spent the most, $80 million, followed by Marco Rubio\u2019s at $70 million. It didn\u2019t seem to help.\n\nDemocrats spent even more. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and backers spent $153 million and Bernie Sanders\u2019 $76 million.\n\nDonald Trump, of course, was the brunt of much of that negative advertising. Clinton, Sanders, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Bush, the Club for Growth, Our Principles, New Day for America, Correct the Record and Keep the Promise super PACs ran commercials that I thought would devastate the Trump campaign.\n\nSome replayed his crude comments: \u201cDoes she have a good body? No! Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nSome replayed flip-flops. After Trump complained about China \u201cstealing our jobs,\u201d David Letterman asked Trump where his ties came from. \u201cChina,\u201d admitted Trump.\n\n\u201cWhere are your shirts made?\u201d asked Letterman.\n\n\u201cWe employ people in Bangladesh,\u201d said Trump. And in a debate, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re doing many, many deals outside of the United States.\u201d\n\nPolitical commercials showed that Trump once pushed for forms of Obamacare that most Republicans hate. In one ad, a reporter asked Trump about health care:\n\nReporter: Universal health care?\n\nTrump: I am going to take care of everybody.\n\nReporter: Who pays for it?\n\nTrump: The government is going to pay for it.\n\nOther ads played a sound bite of Trump saying, \u201cI probably identify more as a Democrat.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s opponents spent millions to reveal Trump in his own words, caught contradicting himself on TV. Pundits called the ads \u201cdevastating.\u201d Most Republican primary voters didn\u2019t care.\n\nSoon, the ads may get still nastier.\n\nEvery election season pundits complain about \u201cnegative campaigning.\u201d When President Obama last ran, he said, \u201cIt can seem like a return to civility is not possible.\u201d Four years before, reporters claimed \u201ccandidates have taken dirty to a whole new level.\u201d\n\nPeople say they long for a return to politeness in politics \u2014 but politics was never polite.\n\nThomas Jefferson\u2019s supporters printed handbills that said: \u201cJohn Adams is a blind, bald, crippled, toothless man who secretly wants to start a war with France. When he is not busy importing mistresses from Europe, he\u2019s trying to marry one of his sons to a daughter of King George III.\u201d\n\nAdams supporters came back with: \u201cIf Thomas Jefferson wins, murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will be openly taught and practiced. Are you prepared to see your dwellings in flames? Female chastity violated? Children writhing on the pike?\u201c\n\nHad TV existed then, those would have been powerful commercials.\n\nOne hundred sixty-eight years later, when Barry Goldwater ran against Lyndon Johnson, Johnson supporters claimed Goldwater was a John Birch Society member and a schizophrenic. A magazine called \u201cFact\u201d got a thousand psychiatrists to sign a statement that said Goldwater was insane. None of it was true, and Goldwater later won a defamation suit against Fact. But by then, the election was over.\n\nDespite such deceit, we\u2019re probably better off with negative ads.\n\nEvery year some candidates say, \u201cI will run a positive campaign.\u201d\n\nPart of my brain says, \u201cThat would be nice; maybe we\u2019ll learn more about their plans.\u201d But research shows that\u2019s rarely true. Fluffy \u201cpositive\u201d ads don\u2019t tell us much.\n\nThis year Bernie Sanders ran ads showing him hugging people while cheering crowds surrounded him and singers sang \u201cAll come to look for America.\u201d\n\nWhat does that even mean?\n\nThe beauty of negative ads is that the accusations at least purport to be facts. Vanderbilt University political scientist John Geer found that three-quarters of negative political ads from 1960 to 2004 attacked real statements of policy from the opposing candidate. Such policy statements can be checked.\n\nEven if those statements turn out to be based on lies, those lies force the other side to reply with facts. Voters actually learn something. And usually, eventually, the truth comes out.\n\nSo two cheers for negative ads \u2014 something good comes from nasty. I\u2019ll play some of the worst ads on my show this week. The messages are mean, but truth often is.\n\nJohn Stossel is host of \u201cStossel\u201d on Fox News and author of \u201cNo They Can\u2019t!
