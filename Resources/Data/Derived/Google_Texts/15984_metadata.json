Climate change hit the headlines repeatedly. President Obama rejected the Keystone XL pipeline. New York put fossil-fuel companies on notice with an investigation into Exxon Mobil\u2019s dealings with global warming research and its handling of profit risks for investors. And Michael Bloomberg started a pricey TV ad campaign against officials in four states who are suing over new power-plant emissions rules.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n2. Security at Egyptian airports was being scrutinized as the F.B.I. agreed to join in the investigation of the crash of a Russian jet last weekend. Officials focused on a sound in the last second of a 23-minute cockpit voice recording that might indicate some sort of explosion. Egypt has dismissed any suggestion of a bomb, though President Obama said he took the theory \u201cvery seriously.\u201d\n\n_______\n\nVideo\n\n3. The first ever handshake between the presidents of China and Taiwan went on for more than a minute on Saturday, giving reporters plenty of time to document the moment. The event carefully avoided titles and symbols of state, and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, said the meeting showed that China and Taiwan were \u201cone family with blood that is thicker than water.\u201d But voters in Taiwan are increasingly wary of Beijing\u2019s embrace.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n4. More than a year of protests over police brutality have pushed police forces to crack down against officers. This week, these two Louisiana officers were charged with second-degree murder in the death of a 6-year-old. The boy was killed during a car chase as they pursued his father for an undisclosed offense. \u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve to die like that and that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d a police official said.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n5. Parents across the nation got a crash course in controlling their children\u2019s cellphones after students at a Colorado school were caught trading nude pictures using smartphone apps that camouflage troves of photos behind a calculator screen. The principal said sexting was rampant. \u201cI hope no other school has it at the level we have it at,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I fear we aren\u2019t the only ones.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n6. A biography of George H.W. Bush coming out this week rattled his family and members of his son\u2019s administration. The 41st president asserts in the book that Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld undercut George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. Perhaps no one was put in a more uncomfortable position than Jeb Bush, who once again found himself talking about his family rather than his plans for the country.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n7. One of our best-read stories this week was \u201cStressed, Tired, Rushed: A Portrait of the American Family.\u201d It looked at a new survey revealing the exhaustion in two-parent families juggling careers and a host of other demands. \u201cThis is creating a stress for working parents that is affecting life at home and for children, and we need a societal-wide response,\u201d a sociologist said.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n8. Good news: This toddler in London may prove to be a breakthrough case in cancer treatment. Her blood cancer is in remission after an experimental cell therapy. She received an infusion of T cells \u2014 the immune system\u2019s warriors \u2014 that were \u201cedited\u201d to attack cancer but leave healthy cells alone. That \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach had never been tested in humans before.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n9. An Iranian backlash intensified against the international nuclear deal, engineered by hard-line adversaries within the government. The president, who backs the deal, criticized roundups of fellow proponents. \u201cLet us not go and arrest one person here, another there, based on an excuse and without any reason,\u201d he said. Anti-U.S. symbols proliferated, including this billboard of a photoshopped World War II photo that shows bloodied Marines raising the U.S. flag over corpses and rubble.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n10. On Monday, Benjamin Netanyahu meets with President Obama for the first time since the Iran deal was closed. The Israeli prime minister appears to be trying to mend relations ravaged by his pitched battle to defeat the pact. \u201cThe problem is the campaign was so intense that it has left scars that are difficult to heal,\u201d said one American Jewish leader.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n11. On the presidential campaign front, Ben Carson finally showed a theatrical side, fiercely defending himself from reporters questioning accounts of his past. And Marco Rubio had to confront more revelations of messy finances. The Republican candidates head to their next debate on Tuesday (Fox Business Network, 6 p.m. Eastern for the \u201cundercard\u201d and 9 p.m. for the main event). The next Democratic debate is Saturday on CBS (9 p.m. Eastern).\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n12. The list of delays plaguing the construction of the World Trade Center Transportation Hub grew yet again. This time, the problem is a persistent water leak around the base of an office tower abutting the complex. Our reporter suggests that, once Salvatore Santiago Calatrava\u2019s terminal does open, \u201can awe-struck public may forget the tribulations.\u201d\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n13. And lastly, again with the good news! An Australian island has restored a population of this tiny penguin that had been nearly eradicated by foxes. The local government is using a breed of Italian sheepdog, the Maremma, to keep the predators at bay. They got the idea from a resourceful chicken farmer known as Swampy Marsh (birth name Alan).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHave a great week.\n\n_______\n\nKaren Workman contributed reporting.\n\nYour Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.\n\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Evening Briefing, weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern.\n\nWant to look back?
