Dustin R. Lukasiewicz, a native of Nebraska. His wife, who is pregnant, lives in Fallbrook.\n\nCapt. Christopher L. Norgren, also a pilot, from Wichita, Kan.\n\nSgt. Ward M. Johnson IV, a crew chief, from Altamonte Springs, Fla.\n\nSgt. Eric M. Seaman, a crew chief, from southern Riverside County in Southern California.\n\nCpl. Sara A. Medina, a combat photographer, from Illinois, who was assigned to Marine forces in Okinawa, Japan.\n\nLance Cpl. Jacob A. Hug, a combat videographer, from Arizona.\n\nThe helicopter, based at Camp Pendleton and attached to Marine Light Helicopter Squadron 469, disappeared over the town of Charikot on a steep Himalayan mountainside hours after a magnitude-7.3 earthquake struck the region earlier this week.\n\nMarine Lt. Gen. John Wissler, Commanding General, III Marine Expeditionary Force, Joint Task Force 505 and Marine Forces Japan, said during a news conference in Nepal that the wreckage of the UH-1Y Huey was found about 8 miles north of Charikot shortly before 2 p.m. Friday Nepal Standard Time in \u201cexceptionally rugged terrain\u201d in a dense forest at an altitude of about 11,000 feet.\n\nThe UH-1Y Huey was on a disaster-relief mission called \u201cOperation Sahayogi Haat\u201d when it was reported missing Tuesday morning, approximately nine hours after Nepal was struck by a magnitude-7.3 aftershock to the magnitude-7.8 temblor of April 25. The initial earthquake killed more than 8,200 people while the big aftershock claimed another 117 lives.\n\nThe helicopter and squadron were diverted from a joint task force exercise in the Philippines to assist with search and rescue.\n\nAircraft from the United States, India and Nepal had searched for the missing helicopter before it was found.\n\nU.S. Army Maj. Dave Eastburn, spokesman for U.S. Pacific Command, said an assessment of the site was ongoing and a thorough investigation would be conducted.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, speaking in Washington, D.C., at the National Peace Officers Memorial ceremony, said his \u201cprayers remain with the families of our Marines and two Nepalese soldiers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey went to that remote land to help people who suffered devastating losses in a terrible earthquake,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThey represent a truth that guides our work around the world \u2014 when our friends are in need, America helps.\n\n\u201cSometimes those in uniform only get attention when there\u2019s a battle,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they do so much more than that, looking out for folks who are vulnerable or having a tough time, experienced a disaster. And it can involve great risk, great sacrifice. And we give thank to all our fellow Americans, military and civilian, who reflect the very best of American leadership around the world. The world is better for them.\u201d\n\nAdm. Samuel Locklear III, of the U.S. Pacific Command, said the men proudly served their countries as Nepalese soldiers and U.S. Marines.\n\n\u201cTogether we mourn as our nation and the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal have lost eight courageous men who put the needs of others ahead of their own,\u201d Locklear said. \u201cThese men were professionals, committed to the mission, and it is their dedication and sacrifice that helps define both our militaries.\u201d\n\nThe Navy and Marine Corps will continue the relief mission in Nepal, Locklear said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The bodies of six U.S. Marines who were aboard a Marine helicopter that crashed in earthquake-ravaged Nepal were identified Sunday.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "FOX5 San Diego - San Diego News, Weather, Traffic and Sports | KSWB", "description": "The bodies of six U.S. Marines who were aboard a Marine helicopter that crashed in earthquake-ravaged Nepal were identified Sunday.", "title": "Marines killed during disaster aid mission in Nepal identified", "url": "http://fox5sandiego.com/2015/05/17/marines-killed-during-disaster-aid-mission-in-nepal-identified/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://tribkswb.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/nepal-search-cnn.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribkswb.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/nepal-search-cnn.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox5sandiego", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox5sandiego"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Get the latest San Diego news, breaking news, weather, traffic, sports, entertainment and video from fox5sandiego.com.
