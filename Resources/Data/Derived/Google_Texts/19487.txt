KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia —Emil Hegle Svendsen of Norway edged Martin Fourcade of France in a sprint finish to win gold in the men’s 15-kilometer mass start biathlon race Tuesday.

Svendsen and Fourcade both finished in 42 minutes, 29.1 seconds, with Svendsen’s ski crossing the line a fraction earlier.

Ondrej Moravec of Czech Republic was 13.8 behind to take bronze for his second medal of the games after winning silver in the 12.5K pursuit.

It was Svendsen’s fourth career Olympic medal but first of the Sochi Games. He also won gold in the 20K individual race and the men’s relay, and bronze in the 10K sprint in Vancouver.

Fourcade was seeking his third straight gold after winning the pursuit and the individual race last week.
