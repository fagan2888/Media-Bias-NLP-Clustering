They go through databases that are maintained by D.H.S., the Department of Defense and the intelligence community. There is biographical and biometric information that is collected about these individuals.\u201d\n\nThese measures did not stop Boston Marathon bombers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from perpetrating terror here at home.\n\nBut biometric data compiled on incoming jihadists will at least enable the FBI to identify the remains of the \u201cmartyrs.\u201d\n\nCan there be peace with Islam?\n\nAfter all, French authorities identified one of the seven dead Parisian attackers by running tests on his severed finger. He fragmented after detonating his suicide belt.\n\nWhen New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nomination last June, he was roundly criticized for saying, \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people [to America], they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you\u2026 They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems to us.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle died in her father\u2019s arms, shot by an illegal alien allowed to walk free in a California Sanctuary City, with a handgun lost by a blundering federal agent sworn to maintain public safety.\n\nThat incident propelled the illegal immigration issue and the Trump candidacy front and center in the American mind.\n\nDuring Saturday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa, CBS debate moderator John Dickerson asked Hillary Clinton if America was at war with \u201cradical Islam.\u201d\n\nThe West\u2019s mutton-headed crusaders\n\nWhile not blaming the Paris attacks on an American-made, anti-Muslim video, Hillary provided this convoluted offering:\n\n\u201cI think you can talk about Islamists who are clearly also jihadists, but I think it\u2019s, it\u2019s not particularly helpful \u2013 to make the case that Sen. Sanders was just making, that I agree with, that we\u2019ve got to reach out to Muslim countries, we\u2019ve got to have them be part of our coalition \u2013 if they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam.\u201d\n\nBenghazi Hillary is nothing if not forward thinking. She speaks as though Obama\u2019s 100,000 Syrian refugees are already settled in America and receiving federal assistance, taxpayer subsidized health care under Obamacare and are happy, card-carrying members of a heavily dependent and favored Democratic Party voting bloc.\n\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, said, \u201cI\u2019m putting people on notice that are coming here from Syria as part of this mass migration, that if I win\u2026 they\u2019re going back.\u201d\n\nIf an ISIS attack occurs on American soil between now and November 2016, Donald Trump will be the next President of the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If an ISIS attack occurs on American soil between now and November 2016, Donald Trump will be the next President of the United States.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Stephen Z.
