Claim: There is natural gas fracking in the Delta now

• Is there a tie-in to the BDCP and twin tunnels? • It is happening right now • WITH VIDEO

by Gene Beley Delta CorrespondentCLARKSBURGNovember 16, 2014 9:01pmNicki Suard, owner of SnugHarbor Resort on Steamboat Slough in the California Delta and a retired attorney, contends there is fracking occurring in the Delta.

It is happening right now, she said at a meeting of North Delta Community Area Residents for Environmental Stability of Clarksburg, better known by its acronym, North Delta CARES.

She shocked some in the audience by telling them that the nonprofit FracTracker Alliance reports a Class II (toxins) injection well was installed on Staten Island. It is well known that the Delta has a lot of natural gas reserves, but use of fracking as a drilling method in the estuary is not known.

Fracking is formally known as hydraulic fracturing in which chemical solutions are injected in wells to fracture underground rock formations to draws out oil and natural gas.

Mrs. Suard began by showing a photo of one drilling derrick now operating across the road from one of the Deltas icon restaurants, Guistis Place, on Walnut Grove and Thornton Roads. The derrick is less than two blocks distance from Guistis. The rig almost hugs the Mokelumne River  a major source of drinking water. It appears to be on Tyler Island separated from the sandhill crane Staten Island nature conservancy only by the river. The bartender at Guistis said it is too big of a derrick for just drilling drinking water. Signs on the road leading to the derrick say John Perez & Sons, and Ensign Rig #582. The internet lists John Perez & Sons Trucking in Walnut Grove and there is a ranch house near the rig.

Mrs. Suard told the Clarksburg audience that todays fracking methods trace back to 1997, but the first patent for the concept was actually issued April 25, 1865 when Civil War veteran Col. Edward Roberts got a patent for an exploding torpedo that used dynamite and nitroglycerin. That method, which had the drawback of killing many of its users, was used until May 1990 when the last well was shot. Back on March 17, 1949, the first commercial hydraulic fracking began by using liquid materials to extricate oil and gas from the ground. By 2012 there were at least one million hydraulic fracturing operations in the U.S.

Tired oil fields nationwide sprang back to life when hydraulic fracturing using a combination of fresh water mixed with chemicals became more popular among the oil and gas companies. As they go down through the different layers of soil and water, said Mrs. Suard, they are using toxins to do their drilling.

Oil and gas companies have refused to divulge exactly what chemicals they use and are calling them proprietary information. In May the Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposed rule to make reporting and disclosures of fracking materials necessary, but it is not yet law.

Mrs. Suard lives in Napa and feels the August earthquake there may have been related to fracking in that area, because studies are showing in nearly every area of the U.S. where fracking is taking place, fracking is suspected of causing seismic activities.

Impacts to drinking water

If you are a Delta farmer, you are on drinking water wells, said Mrs. Suard. In the past farmers here leased their subsurface water. That was for a normal drought. The wells were just straight up and down. These leases may have had some sort of exemption or could have said there couldnt be any contaminants to the surface of the land.

But she added, the Environmental Protection Agency has been granting exemptions to use deep-water aquifers despite the potential risk to drinking water and agricultural water resources.

Gov. Edmund Brown Jr., wealthy after he and his siblings inherited their fathers oil company that includes a franchise on Indonesia oil to California, derailed efforts to put teeth in a statewide bill banning fracking.

The Bay Delta Conservation Plan forgot to account for the impacts of reduced river flows in the Delta, continued Mrs. Suard. The aquifer does not replenish (after fracking), the water quality declines due to fracking residue, and there is an increase in salinity of groundwater due to horizontal fracking  not just the salt water encroachment from the Bay.

California Department of Water Resources doesnt recognize the location of deep groundwater, which is where horizontal fracking impacts the water quality. The fracking process creates higher salinity than sea water.

Mrs. Suard went so far to say she believes a hidden reason for the BDCP to use eminent domain for obtaining more than 100,000 acres for restoration is so the land can be resold for energy exploration. That might just help balance their budget as the potential cost of the BDCPs twin tunnels hits $55 billion and could top $100 billion, according to a paper released last week by the office of the state Treasurer that argued taxpayers and rate payers can afford the higher water rates and possibly higher taxes that building the tunnels could mean.

Mrs. Suard showed slides proving two approved fracking applications in the California Delta from Royale Energy and Stream Energy Inc. The Royal Energy application document was obtained through FrackTracker.org and was signed by Dale Hoffman for 25.6 acres of a subsurface oil and gas lease. Oil and gas resources under state lands can be developed and protected pursuant to the California State Lands Commissions negotiated subsurface (no surface use) oil and gas lease.

The State Lands Commission approved this by a 3-0 vote at their Oct. 15, 2004 meeting. Back then when Mr. Hoffman worked for Royale Energy, he was responsible for land, transactional matters related to Royales assets in California, Texas and the Rockies according to his LinkedIn biography profile. Today he is manager of land and external affairs for Caelus Energy Alaska LLC.

Stream Energy Inc.s address is in Bakersfield and drilled their Walnut Grove 34-1 well APO 0406720415 from a site south of the Sacramento River. The document says the well was on a private land lease and completed as a natural gas well. The document added that two more wells named Kay Dix 35-1 and 35-2 had also been drilled and the document was signed by Paul Mount II, chief of mineral resources management for the California Lands Commission.

Mrs. Suard had a few rhetorical questions:

 Why a deep hole under the Steamboat Slough Bridge is now making the private Steamboat Slough beach by the bridge disappear?

 What is the purpose of the deep hole in the Georgiana Slough?

 Is there a bottom intake plant there?

Another theory she put forward is her observation that the tules being planted in the Delta areas as Department of Water Resources' restoration projects may be helping to filter toxic chemicals from fracking activities. She said a DWR-contracted tule project near her resort on Steamboat Slough has reduced that slough's width by more than 150 feet.

Mrs. Suard mentioned a UCLA study by Jonathan Stewart and Scott Brandenberg done on Sherman Island where they had a machine that was supposed to see if they could make a levy fail in a simulated earthquake. The earthquake test did not make the levee fail, said Bill Wells, executive director for the California Delta Chamber of Commerce, who was sitting in the Clarksburg Husicks Country Store audience. Mr. Wells said the machine broke down before the levy showed any stress.

Another byproduct of fracking, some claim, are sink holes like those in Florida that have swallowed trees, homes and cars and have reached the size of four football fields, Mrs. Suard added.

Mrs. Suard said the BDCP ignored the impacts to the area in their EIR/EIS reports from the fracking or increase in natural gas wells in the area." Barbara Daly from CARES response was she had once heard a Brattle Group consultant talk about the potential income for each county from natural gas income in the Delta.

Another audience comment was by Barbara Daly, who said the BDCP consultant Brattle Group had talked about the potential income for each county from natural gas income.

Mr. Wells added that fracking came up at one of the BDCP meetings. I think it was Burt Wilson who raised the issue. Jerry Meral [the controversial deputy secretary for Natural Resources who was the governors point man pushing the BDCP before he retired from his state job] said it was nothing to worry about because each well only used a total of 5,000 gallons that year. Three months ago I was at a presentation in Stockton where they said it uses hundreds of thousands of gallons per well. Obviously the state and BDCP people are liars as we all know.

Argonne National Laboratory's Robert Horner, a policy analyst, energy/environmental systems specialist in its Washington, D.C., office, says fracking of a shale formation for oil or natural gas can take between 2.5 million and 5.5 million gallons of clean water. Andrew Bunger, assistant professor in the Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, offers a more specific number: Approximately 4 million gallons for one typical horizontal well (similar to growing 40 acres of irrigated crops for one year), he says.
