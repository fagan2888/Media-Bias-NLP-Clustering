Bill and asking for $12 billion over the next decade to reform and strengthen two-year colleges.\n\nHe called it \u201ca historic step on behalf of community colleges in America.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut the colleges never got the money.\n\nThough the American Graduation Initiative never got off the ground, a combination of Obama administration cheerleading and economic shifts over the past six years has lifted community colleges to new levels of status, significance and public consciousness in the U.S.\n\nIn the 2011 economic stimulus bill, the president allocated $5 billion to improving community colleges. Through reconciliation legislation that amended the Affordable Care Act in 2010 \u2014 the same bill from which the American Graduation Initiative funding was cut \u2014 Obama secured $2 billion to authorize and fund the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training Grant Program. There\u2019s also Obama\u2019s oft-touted investment in Pell grants: Since 2008, the maximum award has risen nearly $1,000, hitting $5,730 this academic year. And of course, in January, the president proposed making two years of community college tuition free.\n\nBoth White House and community college officials recognize that the free-tuition proposal \u2014 which requires approval from a Republican-led Congress \u2014 is dead on arrival. Yet Obama hasn\u2019t let up, and there\u2019s no indication he will. To the contrary, on Friday, he\u2019ll tout the plan in a graduation speech at Lake Area Technical Institute.\n\nObservers say \u201cAmerica\u2019s College Promise,\u201d the $60-billion-a-decade tuition plan, represents the peak of a long climb.\n\n\u201cLike most political gestures that offer something for nothing, this one is not all it\u2019s cracked up to be,\u201d House education committee leaders said April 13, after Vice President Joe Biden, filling in for Obama, discussed the plan at length in the president\u2019s weekly address. \u201cThere are better ways to help individuals pursue the dream of a college degree and learn new skills to succeed in today\u2019s workforce.\u201d\n\nBut America\u2019s College Promise secures the standing of community colleges as a legacy issue for Obama.\n\n\u201cIt is, without a question, a common thread through the administration so far, and I think the president thinks that community colleges are really essential institutions to the goal of building a stronger middle class,\u201d a White House official said. \u201cOur hope is to not only get some much-needed resources to help strengthen these institutions, but also to make sure they get the recognition they deserve for opening up opportunities.\u201d\n\nAt one of several local events following the unveiling of America\u2019s College Promise, Biden told students and staff at a campus in Iowa that the administration has been working to raise awareness of the two-year colleges to the perhaps-unprecedented level it\u2019s at now.\n\n\u201cWhat we had to change was the perception of the quality of community colleges,\u201d he said.\n\nHis wife Jill, a long-time English professor at Northern Virginia Community College, put it this way at a recent summit of the two biggest community college associations: \u201cCommunity colleges have entered a new day in America.\u201d\n\nEarly bipartisanship didn\u2019t last\n\nSector officials are quick to note Obama\u2019s successes.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d asked me 20 years ago did I believe that we\u2019d have a Pell grant program of $36, $37 billion per year I\u2019d have said you were crazy,\u201d said J. Noah Brown, president and chief executive officer of the Association of Community College Trustees.\n\nThe plan for free community college came as an equally shocking \u2014 if more abrupt \u2014 surprise. Community college leaders say they weren\u2019t consulted. The White House declines to elaborate on who or what went into the plan\u2019s development \u2014 other than to say it was based on similar, smaller-scale efforts in Tennessee (by Republican Gov. Bill Haslam) and Chicago (by Democratic Mayor \u2014 and former White House chief of staff to Obama \u2014 Rahm Emanuel).\n\nIn Obama\u2019s many speeches promoting America\u2019s College Promise this year, he\u2019s repeatedly pointed to the idea\u2019s bipartisan beginnings, while jabbing at congressional Republicans who won\u2019t fund it. Although the Volunteer State\u2019s GOP Sens. Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander, who chairs the Senate education committee, flanked Obama when he announced the plan at Pellissippi State Community College in January, they also stated their opposition to such a federal initiative.\n\nBrown worries bipartisan progress on workforce and education issues \u2014 consider reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \u2014 could be threatened by political jockeying over a lofty and arguably unrealistic idea.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want that to be lost because right now Republicans and Democrats don\u2019t want to talk to each other and are looking to score points at each other\u2019s expense,\u201d Brown said.\n\nWhile Obama and Biden play up the idea to the campus crowds, administration officials have been providing a dose of reality at home. At the same summit where Jill Biden recently spoke, Domestic Policy Council Deputy Director James Kvaal said officials would work on the proposal \u201cover a period of time.\u201d He recalled the rocky road to funding the TAACCCT program, noting that \u201cthis is the way the legislative process works.\u201d\n\nAt that meeting, one sector official said she was frustrated the administration didn\u2019t come to colleges first, and she was skeptical the plan would ever materialize. Another said later that a more feasible approach would be to request a significantly smaller chunk of federal funding to launch pilot programs in just a few states.\n\nMore recently, the White House convened an exclusive meeting of a few dozen organizations to drum up public support for the initiative. Jill Biden has said officials are forming a coalition of experts in business, law, philanthropy and higher education \u201cto support our efforts to strengthen community colleges.\u201d\n\nIt may have worked: ACCT and American Association of Community Colleges are in the \u201cearly stages\u201d of building a coalition of partners in higher education, business, philanthropy and other sectors to maintain the conversation on college affordability and educational attainment issues, Brown said.\n\nA question of priorities\n\nBut the idea still \u201chasn\u2019t gotten much traction\u201d on Capitol Hill, said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of government and public affairs at the American Council on Education \u2014 and not just because Republicans want local governments handling this sort of thing and Obama would fund it by raising taxes on banks and the wealthy.\n\nIt\u2019s also expensive.\n\nEven if the funding did suddenly turn up, Alexander and others would probably rather spend it on Pell grants, which are facing impending cuts, Hartle said at a recent meeting of lieutenant governors.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that federal assistance has become more important to our colleges,\u201d said David Baime, senior vice president for government relations and research at the AACC. Like all public colleges, two-years have been hit hard be state disinvestment triggered by the recession, making it harder to educate more students, better, like Obama wants.\n\nStephen G. Katsinas, director of the University of Alabama Educational Policy Center, believes that by partnering with influential foundations like Gates and Lumina, the Obama administration has, to a degree, taken on private goals that may irk certain lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThere appears to be a strong urban tilt in the Gates Foundation agenda and to some extent Lumina\u2019s agenda, and that in turn gets reflected in the federal initiatives,\u201d Katsinas said. \u201cI think that is part of the problem why the administration has trouble building broad-based support across the political aisle.\u201d\n\nJackson Sasser is the president of Santa Fe College in Florida, which last month won the $800,000 Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence. The award is high-profile \u2014 Jill Biden plugged America\u2019s College Promise at this year\u2019s ceremony \u2014 and is based on a college\u2019s success in improving learning and workforce outcomes for all students, regardless of race or income. Sasser likes Obama\u2019s idea but believes there should be an income limit to the proposal, so the money goes to the neediest students.\n\nBut it won\u2019t matter, he said, because lawmakers still don\u2019t recognize the huge role community colleges play in the workforce, nor do they fund higher education accordingly.\n\n\u201cIf you took them out, the economy would collapse,\u201d Sasser said. \u201cThere\u2019s a disconnect there, and that\u2019s partly our fault. The community colleges have just been doing the work, and haven\u2019t really organized on what to say.\u201d\n\n\u2018A well-tread path to the White House\u2019\n\nCommunity colleges do have a presence on Capitol Hill, though. In addition to the AACC and the ACCT, there\u2019s Rebuilding America\u2019s Middle Class, a three-year old coalition of about three dozen community colleges from seven states. ACT, the College Board and Pearson are also members.\n\n\u201cEvery Congressman has a community college in their district,\u201d said Tom Snyder, president of the 32-campus Ivy Tech Community College, which is a RAMC member. The coalition spent $70,000 on lobbying in 2014. Snyder said the group has influenced lawmakers to take up issues like year-round Pell grants, which appear poised to return during reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. He called Haslam\u2019s Tennessee Promise \u201ca big, big deal.\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether lawmakers have gotten the message, the administration has certainly been advertising community colleges as an economic accelerator that will boost everything from America\u2019s degree attainment to its global competitiveness.\n\nPeople like White House Domestic Policy Council Director Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Labor Secretary Tom Perez, and of course the Bidens, are at the end of \u201ca well-tread path to the White House\u201d that community colleges enjoy, a White House official said.\n\n\u201cI do think that our prominence has been elevated,\u201d Baime said, \u201cand I think that the administration is responsible in part for that.\u201d\n\nBut timing had something to do with it, too. When the economy goes bad, two-year colleges tend to see enrollment influxes. That was the case in Obama\u2019s first term \u2014 during a three-year period at the height of the recession, community college enrollments rose nearly 22 percent. (Now they\u2019re back on the decline, falling 3.5 percent in fall 2014.)\n\nRegardless of where the moment came from, Brown wants to seize it.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity that we have to get some things done by virtue of the administration putting us out there is huge,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t take advantage of this and work across the aisle on a number of things we care about, then shame on us.\u201d\n\nIf Democrats maintain their hold on the White House in 2016, the spotlight may not dim for a while.\n\n\u201cI fully support President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to make community college free,\u201d Hillary Clinton said last month during her first official White House campaign stop \u2014 at a two-year college in Iowa. \u201cI\u2019ve spent years telling people around the world, \u2018look at our community colleges.\u2019 But a lot of them haven\u2019t caught on.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "A combination of Obama administration cheerleading and economic shifts over the past six years has lifted community colleges to new levels of status, significance and public consciousness in the U.S.", "title": "Community colleges lifted via Obama", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/community-colleges-lifted-via-obama-118077.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/05/22/150522_barack_obama_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Community College", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "A combination of Obama administration cheerleading and economic shifts over the past six years has lifted community colleges to new levels of status, significance and public consciousness in the U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc65f\"", "article_summary": "He called it \u201ca historic step on behalf of community colleges in America.\u201dStory Continued BelowBut the colleges never got the money.\nHis wife Jill, a long-time English professor at Northern Virginia Community College, put it this way at a recent summit of the two biggest community college associations: \u201cCommunity colleges have entered a new day in America.\u201dEarly bipartisanship didn\u2019t lastSector officials are quick to note Obama\u2019s successes.\nCommunity colleges lifted via ObamaSix years before he proposed making community college free for students, President Barack Obama called for 5 million additional college graduates by 2020, invoking President Franklin Roosevelt and the G.I.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent years telling people around the world, \u2018look at our community colleges.\u2019 But a lot of them haven\u2019t caught on.\u201dAuthors:\n\u201cEvery Congressman has a community college in their district,\u201d said Tom Snyder, president of the 32-campus Ivy Tech Community College, which is a RAMC member."}
