Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative appointed by President George W. Bush, was the key swing vote, siding with the court's four liberals to uphold the law on constitutional grounds.\n\nRoberts and fellow conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy are the most likely swing votes in the new case.\n\nThe court will be focusing on whether a four-word phrase in the law has been correctly interpreted by the administration to allow subsidies to be available nationwide.\n\nThat provision says subsidies are available to those buying insurance on exchanges \"established by the state.\" The challengers, financed by a libertarian Washington group called the Competitive Enterprise Institute, say the government should lose based on the plain meaning of that phrase.\n\nThe government, backed by the healthcare industry, says other provisions make clear Congress intended the subsidies to be available nationwide regardless of whether states set up their own exchanges or leave the task to the federal government.\n\nThe case is King v. Burwell, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-114.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Lawrence Hurley", "Author": "Lawrence Hurley", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. Supreme Court will weigh a second major case targeting President Barack Obama's healthcare law on Wednesday when it considers a conservative challenge to tax subsidies critical to the measure's implementation.", "title": "Supreme Court set to hear second major Obamacare challenge", "image": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150303&t=2&i=1029270244&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEB220ND", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, USA, COURT, HEALTHCARE", "sailthru.title": "Supreme Court set to hear second major Obamacare challenge", "keywords": "US,USA,COURT,HEALTHCARE,United States", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;USA;COURT;HEALTHCARE;United States", "WT.cg_n": "World", "DCSext.ContentID_domesticNews": "USKBN0LZ1H320150303", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "domesticNews", "sailthru.date": "2015-03-03T19:37:02+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "topNews;newsOne;domesticNews;gc05;SustainabilityGreen;everything;Deals;ShellEnergy;AllianzRetirement;AllianzInsurance;AllianzInvestments;Allianz;newsproHome;verizonmm;audib2b;barack-obama;supreme-court;cfaglobal;aa48hours;nonegative;healthcare;MBenz;ubs;Intel;PFG;Fidelity2014;TCS_IN;ABG_IN;CathayPacific_US;GCA-NewsPro", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Supreme+Court+set+to+hear+second+major+Obamacare+challenge", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKBN0LZ1H320150303", "WT.cg_s": "U.S", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150303&t=2&i=1029270244&w=&fh=50&fw=50&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEB220ND", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court will weigh a second major case targeting President Barack Obama's healthcare law on Wednesday when it considers a conservative challenge to tax subsidies critical to the measure's implementation.", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "sailthru.description": "The U.S. Supreme Court will weigh a second major case targeting President Barack Obama's healthcare law on Wednesday when it considers a conservative challenge to tax subsidies critical to the measure's implementation.", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "DCSext.rAuthor": "Lawrence Hurley", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/us/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "WT.z_inlinetype": "Video", "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-domesticNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court will weigh a second major case targeting President Barack Obama's healthcare law on Wednesday when it considers a conservative challenge to tax subsidies critical to the measure's implementation.", "title": "Supreme Court set to hear second major Obamacare challenge", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150303&t=2&i=1029270244&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEB220ND", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-healthcare-idUSKBN0LZ1H320150303", "article": {"section": "World", "tag": "US,USA,COURT,HEALTHCARE,United States", "published_time": "2015-03-03T19:37:02+0000", "modified_time": "2015-03-03T19:37:02+0000", "author": "Lawrence Hurley"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Mar 03 19:37:02 UTC 2015", "DCSext.contentversion": "original", "sailthru.image.full": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150303&t=2&i=1029270244&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEB220ND"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb8c\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court will weigh a second major case targeting President Barack Obama's healthcare law on Wednesday when it considers a conservative challenge to tax subsidies critical to the measure's implementation.\nThe Democratic-backed law, narrowly passed by Congress over unified Republican opposition, aimed to help millions of Americans who lacked any health insurance afford coverage.\nThe case does not affect people who obtain health insurance through their employer.\nThe case is set for a one-hour oral argument starting just after 10 a.m. (1500 GMT), with a ruling due by the end of June.\nThe first time the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, came before the justices three years ago, the court was split 5-4."}
