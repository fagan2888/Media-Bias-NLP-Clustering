Nelson of the Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nAdvocates for Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s Insure Tennessee plan say the cost of not passing it is high \u2014 in both human life, and money.\n\nThe Tennessee Justice Center and the Tennessee Health Care Campaign, which both support Medicaid expansion, are making Knoxville the 11th stop on their \u201cCounting the Cost for Tennessee Communities\u201d tour of the state.\n\nIn conjunction with a new Knoxville Coalition for Insure Tennessee, the two groups will have a public meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 1, at Concord United Methodist Church, 11020 Roane Drive.\n\nThe coalition will provide what it says is information on the economic impact of the state Legislature declining to pass Insure Tennessee, citing federal matching dollars already lost, the number of people who continue to lack health care, and the effect on the economic health of the state\u2019s hospitals (the Tennessee Hospital Association supports the plan).\n\n\u201cMany Tennesseans who have insurance don\u2019t realize the cost to them, as well as (to) Tennessee communities, for not having Insure Tennessee implemented,\u201d said coalition member and local activist Todd Shelton. \u201cWe feel that when people realize these facts, an even larger majority of Tennesseans will ask that Insure Tennessee be voted on by the full state Legislature.\u201d\n\nA poll by Vanderbilt University this past spring suggested about 64 percent of Tennesseans support Insure Tennessee, Haslam\u2019s individualized plan to substitute for a Medicaid expansion. About 19 percent oppose it \u2014 but 78 percent want the full Legislature to vote on the proposal. (One Senate committee voted against the plan in a special session, and then a second committee voted against it in the regular session, which stopped it from moving forward.)\n\nAn estimated 280,000 Tennesseans would be covered by the plan, which would draw $2.7 million a day in federal funds. Last month, the White House Council of Economic Advisers released a report that said if Tennessee had expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, as the federal government originally planned, it could have received $1.77 billion of federal money.\n\nAt the Sept. 1 meeting and others on the tour, the Tennessee Justice Center wants to \u201ccollect information\u201d about how the lack of a Medicaid expansion \u201caffects individual residents in the Knoxville area,\u201d Shelton said.\n\nPeople who originally would have been covered under the Medicaid expansion are now in a coverage \u201cgap,\u201d where they don\u2019t qualify for TennCare but make too money to purchase an Affordable Care Act insurance policy through the federal marketplace. They don\u2019t quality for federal subsidies to help them pay for health insurance, since the ACA assumed they would have Medicaid coverage. But the Supreme Court ruled it is unconstitutional for the federal government to force states to expand their Medicaid programs, and Tennessee is among 19 states that so far have opted not to expand.\n\nUnder Medicaid expansion, the federal government would pick up the entire cost of new, previously ineligible enrollees for the first three years, phasing to 90 percent by 2020. At that point, the state would be responsible for the 10 percent balance.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Insure Tenn. advocacy tour to hit Knoxville Sept. 1", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/insure-tenn-advocacy-tour-to-hit-knoxville-sept-1-ep-1242202866-362033801.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/flag_23085606_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 384}, "type": "article", "description": "Advocacy groups Tennessee Justice Center and Tennessee Health Care Campaign will stop in Knoxville Sept. 1 on its \"Counting the Cost for Tennessee Communities\" tour to urge the passing of Insure Tennessee.", "title": "Insure Tenn. advocacy tour to hit Knoxville Sept. 1"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/flag_23085606_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Advocacy groups Tennessee Justice Center and Tennessee Health Care Campaign will stop in Knoxville Sept. 1 on its \"Counting the Cost for Tennessee Communities\" tour to urge the passing of Insure Tennessee.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Insure Tenn. advocacy tour to hit Knoxville Sept. 1"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Bill Haslam\u2019s Insure Tennessee plan say the cost of not passing it is high \u2014 in both human life, and money.\nIn conjunction with a new Knoxville Coalition for Insure Tennessee, the two groups will have a public meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 1, at Concord United Methodist Church, 11020 Roane Drive.\nThe Tennessee Justice Center and the Tennessee Health Care Campaign, which both support Medicaid expansion, are making Knoxville the 11th stop on their \u201cCounting the Cost for Tennessee Communities\u201d tour of the state.\nAt the Sept. 1 meeting and others on the tour, the Tennessee Justice Center wants to \u201ccollect information\u201d about how the lack of a Medicaid expansion \u201caffects individual residents in the Knoxville area,\u201d Shelton said.\nUnder Medicaid expansion, the federal government would pick up the entire cost of new, previously ineligible enrollees for the first three years, phasing to 90 percent by 2020."}
