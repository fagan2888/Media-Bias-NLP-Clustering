If this isn’t considered “failing,” I’d really hate to see what actual failure looks like…

Via the Washington Examiner:

White House press secretary Jay Carney on Monday said Obamacare is “not failing” in the face of criticism that the administration botched the rollout of the new website responsible for enrolling consumers in the insurance exchanges.

“This system is not failing. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are submitting their applications successfully to get into the system and enroll in Obamacare, and they are doing it through a variety of means, through state exchanges and through the call-in centers and that’s going to continue,” said Carney in an interview on CNN’s “Piers Morgan Live.”
