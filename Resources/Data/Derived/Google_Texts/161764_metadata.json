That seems to be where a lot of the media and people are pushing him hard on -- I don't think what they say is actually what he has said,\" said Charles Akron of Masonville.\n\nAnd before Cruz's campaign event -- he addressed the media and KWWL's Shirley Descorbeth asked him about this. \"Senator...last week Governor Terry Branstad said Iowans shouldn't vote for you...you're against mandates. What's your response to this?\"\n\nCruz said, \"I'll tell you what I'm hearing from the women and men of Iowa. It's not that we need a deal maker to surrender more on our principles...its rather we want and deserve a consistent conservative.\"\n\nWhile addressing supporters -- he was more direct. \"So , I think there should be no subsidies, no mandates...no nothing. It should be a fair and level playing field.\"\n\nCruz ended with his plea asking for everyone's support. Even cracking a joke -- saying vote for him 10 times, as in bring out nine other people to vote on caucus night.\n\nCruz also made campaign stops Monday in Maquoketa and Independence.\n\nJust today -- former Texas Governor Rick Perry today came out with his endorsement of Cruz. Glenn Beck also endorsed Cruz over the weekend.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Eastern Iowans are trying to decide who should be their next president,\u00a0and Ted Cruz is trying to gain their support.", "author": "Shirley Descorbeth", "og": {"url": "http://www.kwwl.com/story/31053279/2016/01/25/ted-cruz-campaigns-in-eastern-iowa", "image": "http://kwwl.images.worldnow.com/images/9728192_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Eastern Iowans are trying to decide who should be their next president,\u00a0and Ted Cruz is trying to gain their support.", "title": "Ted Cruz campaigns in Eastern Iowa"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://kwwl.images.worldnow.com/images/9728192_G.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz campaigns in Eastern Iowa", "description": "Eastern Iowans are trying to decide who should be their next president,\u00a0and Ted Cruz is trying to gain their support.", "card": "summary", "creator": "https://twitter.com/ShirleyKWWL"}, "wnreadableurl": "ted-cruz-campaigns-in-eastern-iowa", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWWL", "wnreadabledate": "2016/01/25", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "date": "2016/01/25", "google-site-verification": "pX8abn_VxHh6mCRV8Ah_vUg3rcpyuKp89Kn0fIevoHM", "verify-v1": "nEGUfzol0MwvDOqAZGQhyDoSI3xHKqmsxyY8MaAblp0=", "wn-base": "IIS05"}, "article_summary": "Eastern Iowans are trying to decide who should be their next president, and Ted Cruz is trying to gain their support.\nJust today -- former Texas Governor Rick Perry today came out with his endorsement of Cruz.\nCruz says if elected president -- his two main goals will be repealing Obamacare and pushing tax reform.\nCruz said, \"I'll tell you what I'm hearing from the women and men of Iowa.\nThe Republican Texas Senator addressed a full room of supporters at Manchester's Fireside Pub and Steakhouse."}
