You won't even have to get out of your vehicle on Ash Wednesday this week to receive blessed ashes on your forehead.

Unable or unwilling to get to a church service that day? Don't fret - just drive up in front of Trinity Episcopal Church, 203 Algoma Blvd., in downtown Oshkosh and they will come to you and impose ashes. Or just bicyle up to the front of the church, or walk up, and you will see the signs for "Ashes to Go."

Fr. Marcus Cunningham, rector of Trinity, said they will offer drive-up distribution of ashes from 3 to 4:30 p.m. in front of the church. "We will impose ashes and give them a card - on one side inviting them to a holy Lent and then on the other side listing our service dates and times."

Cunningham said Bishop Matthew Gunter of the Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac sent a letter to all parishes, inviting them to consider doing this. "To my knowledge," the Oshkosh priest said, "this hasn't been done in our diocese, but it has been done in many other dioceses." In fact, Bishop Matt, when he was a priest at St. Barnabas parish in Glen Ellyn, IL, offered "Ashes to Go."

In his letter to diocesan parishes, Bishop Matt summarized: "All in all, I did not get the sense that anyone was receiving ashes trivially. No doubt the ideal place to receive ashes is with the gathered community in the full liturgy of Ash Wednesday with the scripture read and expounded, the invitation to a holy Lent, the Liturgy of Penitence, etc. The fullest of its meaning is best communicated there."

But then the Bishop continues, "Still, given that many will not or will be unable to attend, I am persuaded that it is meet and right to offer folk the opportunity to remember their need to whet their appetite for more." In fact, when the bishop offered this at his parish in Illinois "we had a couple of visitors at St. Barnabas on Sunday as a result."

"Ashes to Go/taking worship to the streets" went viral and national in 2012, with more than 80 churches in 21 states participating. It began in 2006-2007 among an ecumenical group of clergy in St. Louis, then on to Chicago in 2010. Its website states that the intent is to make the church "come out from behind comfortable pews and doors to be in the places where the rubber meets the road. Ashes to Go is about bringing spirit, belief, and belonging out from behind church doors and into the places where we go every day."

"Ashes to Go" has taken its blessings to train stations, coffee shops, campuses, transit stops, street corners, libraries, post offices, convention centers, downtown parks, shopping centers and outside of courthouses - "to God's people where they work and live." In 2013 "Ashes to Go" went international - in Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa. This Ash Wednesday close to 30 congregations (of various faith traditions and denominations), ecumenical groups and other Christian organizations - and several foreign countries - will take Lenten ashes and prayers to the streets. More information is available at the website "Ashes to Go/taking worship to the streets." Emily Mellott, an Ashes to Go Evanglist, is the webmaster of the site.
