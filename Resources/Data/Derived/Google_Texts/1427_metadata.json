In an earnings call barely a month after executives assured investors that all was going swimmingly, they confessed they were losing a ton of money on their Obamacare policies and described a pattern that sounded as though consumers were gaming the system \u2014 signing up for a few months, using a ton of services, then canceling their policies. If this continued, they said, they would have no choice but to pull out of the exchange business.\n\nAll Obamacare news is a sort of Rorschach test upon which viewers project their own deepest hopes and fears about the program, and the UnitedHealth news was no exception. Supporters of the law saw a company that had come late to the exchanges; offered a high-cost, high-value product; and consequently experienced losses as the sickest people rushed to buy their policies. The law\u2019s detractors saw the canary in the coal mine, a view that gained some credence as other companies made similar statements.\n\nMy view fell in the middle. Widespread gaming of the insurance rules would pose an existential threat to the exchanges, because it would require enormous premium hikes, which would in turn force more people to game the system as the premiums became less affordable. However, there were steps the administration could take to control the gaming, such as demanding documentation of the \u201cqualifying life events,\u201d such as marriage or job loss, that allowed people to buy policies outside of the open-enrollment period.\n\nMoreover, there was reason to take UnitedHealth\u2019s grim forecast with a pinch of salt. Every time a highly regulated firm makes a public statement, it\u2019s likely to be part of a multidimensional game of political chess the firm is playing with regulators. So you can\u2019t quite take their more fearsome predictions at face value. As with so much about this law, we\u2019d have to wait and see. When I was asked on a panel a couple of months back to estimate the probability UnitedHealth would pull out this year, I put it at about a third.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure how to score that prediction now: It is pulling out but not everywhere. The two state markets it\u2019s leaving are probably especially unprofitable \u2014 UnitedHealth had only 544 customers in Arkansas, which left it vulnerable to cost overruns from a few very sick patients. But so far, it\u2019s staying in other markets, which means it must have some hope of turning a profit there.\n\nSo is this a case for optimism or pessimism?\n\nWell, other companies haven\u2019t announced they\u2019re pulling out, which is a case for mild optimism \u2014 though they still have a few weeks left to pull the trigger. However, no one has yet proven to be able to reliably make money on exchange policies, and certain local markets seem to be in deep trouble, with few insurers and high premiums. So some mild pessimism is due.\n\nThat local element is important. Areas with deep markets and lots of insurers seem to be able to deliver a product at a reasonable premium \u2014 maybe without all the choice of doctors and hospitals patients would like, maybe with high deductibles but with premiums you can fit into a family budget, especially when subsidies are included. On the other hand, some states \u2014 particularly rural ones, because there\u2019s not much scope to offer \u201cnarrow networks\u201d in communities served by a single hospital \u2014 are seeing a worrying combination of premium increases and insurer exits.\n\nFor example, Alaska\u2019s exchange seems to be tumbling toward collapse, with essentially 1\u00bd insurers. (Moda Health, the second insurer, has had financial troubles that leave its future uncertain.) Rates rose nearly 40 percent last year, putting the benchmark silver plan at around $720 per month for a 40-year-old nonsmoker in Anchorage. Wyoming is down to a single insurer, and the uninsured rate actually has increased since 2013, presumably in part because the state has some of the highest premiums in the country. So does Vermont, which is down to two insurers. Mapping a one-size-fits-all national policy onto low-population rural states seems to be a recipe for some problems.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t yet know is how things will evolve in other states. Will tighter regulations on special enrollment periods reduce the amount of gaming going on? Will the bigger mandate penalties mean younger and healthier people finally buy insurance \u2014 or will the end of the temporary risk corridor program that has been defraying insurer losses mean premiums soar still higher? Will insurers ever manage to make money on the exchanges?\n\nIf insurers can\u2019t figure out a way to make money, more will probably pull out, and the exchanges will be in a parlous state. If they can, things will stabilize. Unfortunately there\u2019s no way to know what will happen \u2014 or where \u2014 except to wait and see.\n\nMegan McArdle is a Bloomberg View columnist writing on economics, business and public policy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OpEd: Well, the hammer has fallen: The largest health insurer in the U.S. has started pulling out of select Obamacare exchanges.
