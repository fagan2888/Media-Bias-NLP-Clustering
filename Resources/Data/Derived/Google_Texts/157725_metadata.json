Traffic will be squeezed onto one lane.\n\nRoad crews are not expected to work during weekends, park spokeswoman Kyle Patterson said.\n\nThe road workers planned to perform \u201cfog sealing\u201d at the end of August to increase durability of the road. The Timber Creek Campground will close Aug. 17- 20, park officials said. And a parking lot in the tundra at Lava Cliffs will be closed temporarily for storage of construction materials.\n\nTrail Ridge Road cuts through the heart of the park, reaching an elevation of 12,183 feet \u2014 the highest continuous road in the United States.
