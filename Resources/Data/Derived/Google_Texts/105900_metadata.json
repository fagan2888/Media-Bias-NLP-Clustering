(Chimera) has been flying and getting some big goals for us.\u201d\n\nWashington had been 0-4 when Ovechkin, who entered Friday second in the league with 10 goals, didn\u2019t score.\n\n\u201cWe worked as a team,\u201d Backstrom said. \u201cWe scored on our chances. That\u2019s what you have to do, especially when you have a good goal-scorer out of the lineup.\n\n\u201cLots of guys stepped up, and that\u2019s exactly what we needed.\u201d\n\nBraden Holtby coasted to a shutout, making 30 saves.\n\nWard\u2019s third-period goal that made it 7-0 sparked a brawl. Just 9 seconds later, Philadelphia\u2019s Wayne Simmonds fought Washington\u2019s Tom Wilson. Flyers goalie Ray Emery then took on Holtby in another bout.\n\n\u201cAs a group, I think it\u2019s a frustrating night,\u201d Emery said. \u201cFans are frustrated, and we don\u2019t accept that. I think frustration sometimes shows that way.\u201d\n\nEmery received the highest total of 29 penalty minutes. He was charged with leaving the goal crease, instigating a fight, and fighting. He was also ejected from the game.\n\nDuring the fight, he knocked Holtby off his feet and landed several hits before an official broke it up.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to fight, but I basically said, \u2018Protect yourself,\u2019\u201d Emery said.\n\nIn the melee, a total of 114 penalty minutes were handed out. Overall, Philadelphia racked up 99 penalty minutes, and Washington received 65.\n\n\u201cThey play that type of game,\u201d Capitals coach Adam Oates said. \u201cThey like five, seven power plays a night, both sides. We don\u2019t. We want to roll four lines. We want to get everybody involved.\u201d\n\nHoltby was perfect in handing the Flyers their first shutout loss of the season. Philadelphia (3-9) entered tied for last in the league with just 20 goals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to be playing in front of our fans and losing 7-0,\u201d Flyers captain Claude Giroux said. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable and we need to figure it out.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals didn\u2019t register their first shot until 4:56 remained in the first period. A little over two minutes later, Backstrom gave them the lead.\n\nNate Schmidt saved a Flyers clearing attempt and shuffled the puck to Martin Erat, who quickly passed it to Backstrom at the top of the right circle for a wrist shot over Steve Mason\u2019s glove.\n\nWard made it a two-goal advantage 1:24 into the second period on an assist from Chimera.\n\n\u201cTheir line has been playing very well,\u201d Oates said. \u201cA lot of good things are happening because they\u2019re playing very well, playing together. Then you\u2019re in the right spot, good things happen, you get chances and sometimes the puck goes in for you.\u201d\n\nLess than a minute later, Chimera beat Mason on a breakaway. That prompted Flyers coach Craig Berube to pull Mason and replace him with Emery.\n\nThat made little difference as Emery allowed another goal to Backstrom just 65 seconds after the goalie entered the game.\n\nAfter Ward made it 5-0 at 16:25 of the second period, new Flyers forward Steve Downie \u2014 perhaps trying to spark his team in his debut \u2014 fought Aaron Volpatti.\n\nWhile it earned applause from the crowd, Downie was handed an instigation penalty and a 10-minute misconduct. The Capitals took advantage, making it 6-0 on Troy Brouwer\u2019s power-play goal. It ended a streak of 15 straight penalties killed by the Flyers.\n\nWashington, however, extended its penalty-killing streak to 30. Philadelphia was 0 for 5 with the man advantage.\n\nBackstrom has 35 points, including 11 goals, in 22 career games against Philadelphia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joel Ward scored three goals for his first NHL hat trick in the fight-filled outburst.
