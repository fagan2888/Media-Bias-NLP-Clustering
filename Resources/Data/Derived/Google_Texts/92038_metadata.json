The 42 kindergartenish anti-ACA House votes are but one example of the inmates running the asylum. Try to imagine any organizational parallel in your own lives of those opposed to an issue voting 42 times to continuously express that opposition when they know it will never be approved.\n\nThis will be the first part of my two-part contribution on the question of the ACA. This submission will reflect the extraordinary propaganda campaign being waged in one specific media; the print media. Its singular purpose is to convince readers to go along with right-wing state efforts to eviscerate Obamacare to the point of irrelevance. For now I\u2019m excluding radio and TV talk shows, other electronic media, town hall meetings and assorted additional propaganda venues that are just as heavy with anti-ASA Rhetoric and apocryphal BS.\n\nThere are various paths in newspapers to cultivate a point of view through lies, deception, deceit and pure repetition. My local Southern paper pursues all. It\u2019s owned by Halifax Media Group. Halifax is headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida and claims to be the 12th largest media group in the United States.\n\nOn the print and electronic side Halifax owns 33 newspapers and affiliated websites. They also include specialty Sports, Lifestyle, Tourism and \u201cFor Moms\u201d publications. But if my local Halifax property is any indicator, their true specialty seems to be pushing the Republican anti-Obama health care agenda. In print, this is done through cherry-picking AP stories, running snide cartoons in opposition to ACA, printing editorials from other newspapers, carrying the predictable right-wing columns pillorying Obamacare from the likes of George Will and Michelle Malkin and, of course, the local paper\u2019s own editorial position and the quoting of extremists politicians on the subject whenever possible.\n\nHere are some (not all) examples of headlines that my local readers have eyeballed in some prominent spot of their Upstate South Carolina Halifax property over the last year. My paper\u2019s anti-Obamacare campaign started off with one of a number of cartoons. The most recent was headed \u2018Obamacare Options.\u2019 A character dressed in shirt, tie and slacks with a Democratic donkey head was depicted as thinking \u201cDefend it.\u201d A similarly dressed Republican elephant opted for \u201cDefund it.\u201d The cartoonist included a middle-age man reading a newspaper \u201cLet it collapse under its own weight.\u201d On the newspaper page was printed \u201cHigher Premiums, Less Access and Employers Ending Coverage.\u201d That\u2019s one form of print propaganda quite popular with my paper.\n\nBelow the \u00bd page cartoon panel was a feature called \u201cother voices.\u201d Today\u2019s \u2018other voice\u2019 was from an inevitable right-wing editorial page from an inevitable right-wing paper. This effort was entitled \u201cMore bad news. Obamacare subsidies aren\u2019t panning out as advertised.\u201d The piece is from the pages of The Colorado Springs Gazette. The Gazette was recently sold to the Anschutz Corporation, owned by oil billionaire, fracking-loving Philip Anschutz. Anshutz is another one of those old right-wing farts who want to leave a legacy of a mangled country when they finally pass on to you know where. This religious wing-nut, homophobe owns the uber-right Weekly Standard and has supported extremists candidates like former Congressman and immigrant-hater Tom Trancedo. \u2018Other voices\u2019 is virtually always far right, no, make that far, far, far right and a worthless read. But it does its job of negatively propagandizing everything the administration supports.\n\nHere\u2019s another cartoon example. Under the heading \u201cGood news we\u2019re going to delay your part\u201d, a speeding locomotive, bearing the lettering \u201cObamacare\u201d, is about to plunge off a train trestle while pulling a caboose with \u2018Employer Mandate\u2019 written on the side.\n\nAgain, right below it is an \u201cother voices\u201d feature, \u201cObama\u2019s future. Latest delay puts health care reform on shaky ground.\u201d Here\u2019s another \u2018other voices\u2019 sample: \u201cHealth care chaos. President\u2019s selective changes to ACA are reason for concern.\u201d Well, you get the idea. One of the ending lines call it an \u201cill-conceived law.\u201d Or how about this one? \u201cHealth care fallout. Businesses are feeling the bite of Obamacare.\u201d BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM it home.\n\nOne more cartoon: An Obama figure waving and declaring \u201cI\u2019ve got a puppy.\u201d The president is leading an enormous, vicious looking dog with a mean scowl and teeth bared with \u2018Obamacare\u2019 adorning his massive body. This absurd effort is from the pen of one Marshall Ramsey, a youngish Obama-hater from the Creators Syndicate. Another of his \u201ccartoons\u201d has Obama at a podium casting a shadow of a disgraced Richard Nixon while holding a speech sheet labeled AP and IRS scandals.\n\nLet\u2019s get to some headlines. Bear in mind the Managing Editor or \u2018spot\u2019 editor picks the stories from a huge AP selection including many positive ACA stories. Here we go with quotation marks at the beginning of the first headline and the end of the last one. \u201cAffordability glitch. Low-wage workers could get left out in health overhaul. Health insurance policies face cancellation. Overhaul surprise Some plans won\u2019t meet requirements. Health reforms pressure primary care doctors. Patient load to rise for overworked physicians. Health law\u2019s rule delay could harm enforcement.\u201d\n\nIt continues: \u201cObamacare divisions may hit poor. Exchanges under health law create confusion for Medicare recipients. Poor to be stuck in health care gap. President\u2019s big plan already starting to fail. New health law poses security concerns. Small businesses rush to renew health policies. Firms trying to avoid higher prices under \u2018Obamacare\u2019. Health plan worries Democratic governors. Insurance for employees\u2019 families in jeopardy at small companies. Insurers worry young people will opt out of health insurance. State should forego health insurance exchange, Keck says. Senator sees \u2018train wreck\u2019 for health overhaul. Physicians are fleeing new system.\u201d\n\nThese are just a fraction of the print renunciations of ACA. For those conversant with history, it\u2019s instructive to remember the final outcomes of those actions mentioned in the first line of this submission.\n\nIn a few days, I\u2019ll utilize facts (whatta concept) to make all the pro-Obamacare adherents feel much better.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right-wing print media is doing everything in its power to renounce Obamacare and turn the citizenry against it.
