As of this week, Google faces the very real prospect of having to break up its operations in Europe.\n\nThat\u2019s the biggest news, but there\u2019s more. Uber, the ride-sharing service intent on revolutionizing not just taxi industries but the whole of transportation, is now banned in Germany and mired in squabbles from London to Singapore. Whisper, a hot social-media platform that promises to disguise identities, has just been caught tracking its customers\u2019 whereabouts even when they decline the app\u2019s \u201cgeolocation\u201d option.\n\nIt starts to look as if Big Data, America\u2019s latest export, may come packaged with a freebie called Big Trouble. The Europeans, in particular, are sketching out red lines limiting the immense power of companies trading in digital connectivity, the \u201csharing economy,\u201d and everything-about-everybody oceans of stored information.\n\nRelated: Google Hosts Meetings Across Europe on Privacy Rights\n\nInvestors are so far sanguine about Silicon Valley\u2019s legal problems, ethical transgressions, and executive pratfalls, but watch this space. Valuations are certain to drop if Google is forced to separate its search engine from its other lines of business. Its databases will be less complete and its search engines potentially less effective. Uber now operates in 229 cities, up from one (San Francisco) when in launched in mid-2010, and a round of financing last summer valued it at $18.2 billion. What\u2019ll happen to that (and the IPO the markets chatter about) if the growth slows?\n\nGoogle\u2019s case could prove a larger corporate calamity than Microsoft\u2019s 16-year war with European regulators, which ended up costing the company fines of \u20ac2 billion ($2.48 billion). This is the opinion of Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the European Union\u2019s outgoing competition commissioner, who has been investigating Google for four years now.\n\nThe running gripes against Google are two. One concerns data protection and privacy\u2014the \u201cright to be forgotten,\u201d as Europeans call their claim that Google cannot store all the data it amasses on individuals indefinitely. The other concerns antitrust law and how Google manages search results. The allegation is that it manipulates results to favor companies in which it has interests to the detriment of others. The search engine, in other words, is not \u201cneutral,\u201d in E.U. terminology.\n\nOnce Edward Snowden revealed Silicon Valley\u2019s collaborations with the National Security Agency and its mass surveillance programs, Google had little chance of prevailing on the privacy question. In May, the European Court of Justice ruled against Google, ordering it to delete references to a user\u2019s past if the user requests it. Google now braces for a tidal wave of requests.\n\nRelated: Google Needs Removal Experts After EU Ruling\n\nThe European Parliament is about to get very tough on the antitrust issue. It just signaled it will agree on a text recommending Google\u2019s breakup early this week and vote on it Thursday. The recommendation then goes to the European Commission to be considered by Almunia\u2019s successor, Margrethe Vestager.\n\nThe Germans, out to halt Big Data\u2019s advance since Snowden told them the NSA was tapping Chancellor Merkel\u2019s cellular telephone, appear to be the principal force driving this offensive. Vestager will work alongside G\u00fcnther Oettinger, the new digital economy and society commissioner, a Merkel ally, and a hawk on the privacy question. Thursday, to put the point mildly, is unlikely to be a happy Thanksgiving Day for Google in Europe.\n\nAs to other zippy Silicon Valley companies, well, Uber seems to be hitting walls or bouncing off them so often it seems to be on purpose. After taxi drivers staged summer protests in cities across Europe, German courts banned Uber from the German market in September.\n\nAnd Ubergeddon, as The Wall Street Journal calls it, now goes global. Last Friday, Singapore announced that it would begin restricting the service\u2019s activities early next year.\n\nRelated: The $375 Billion Europe Wants to Invest But Doesn\u2019t Have\n\nApart from the bans and restrictions, Uber executives have had a three-year run of sexist, tasteless, unethical remarks in public places. The latest: Emil Michael, Uber\u2019s VP for business, suggested publicly that the company should hire investigators to expose the private lives of critical journalists. Then it transpires that the New York office used Uber\u2019s \u201cGod View\u201d to monitor a journalist\u2019s cross-town journey to a meeting with Uber executives.\n\nThat was last week alone. We already knew of CEO Travis Kalanick\u2019s threat to punish potential investors in an upcoming round of financing if they put money into competing car-sharing services.\n\nYou are forgiven if you\u2019ve never heard of Whisper, but millions of social-media users have. Last month the Guardian reported that the app, launched in 2012, tracks users, stores information on them in searchable databases, shares data on users in the military with the Defense Department, is developing a version of the app to meet Chinese censorship standards\u2014and lied about most of this when the British daily questioned its executives. Nice.\n\nRelated: Google Faces Antitrust Lawsuit on U.S. Mobile Internet Search\n\nAll this is reported in European media more prominently than in the U.S., reflecting more rigorous traditions of corporate regulation and protections for individuals and interest groups.\n\nThe regulatory and legal blockages are not all that is at issue with these companies. As The New York Times\u2019 Farhad Manjoo noted last week, \u201cTechnology companies live and die by culture\u2026. A company\u2019s ultimate success or failure is determined less by anodyne technological prowess than by the values and behavior of people who work there.\u201d\n\nAll too true. I see a couple of problems at work here.\n\nFirst, images of enlightened good intent may be de rigueur in Silicon Valley\u2014Uber\u2019s Kalanick uses a picture of Jefferson on his Twitter account\u2014but they are images and no more. The culture projected is Big Data and corporate revenue at any cost\u2014neither of which go down as quietly in Europe as among Americans.\n\nSecond, some of Silicon Valley\u2019s stars are turning out to be idiots savant\u2014immensely gifted in the lab and around the open-plan office, proven clods in circumstances requiring social and political sophistication, notably in what we call public space\u2014and again, Europeans tend to value this more than Americans.\n\nA hundred years ago Thorsten Veblen, the noted social critic, termed the then-emerging class of corporate engineers \u201ca somewhat fantastic brotherhood of over-specialized cranks, not to be trusted.\u201d It\u2019s worth thinking about this as Silicon Valley collides with European sensibilities.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Things aren\u2019t looking too good across the pond lately for the innovators and entrepren", "title": "Why Google and Uber Are Playing Badly in Europe", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/11/24/Why-Google-and-Uber-Are-Playing-Badly-Europe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01232012_Google_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/11/24/Why-Google-and-Uber-Are-Playing-Badly-Europe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01232012_Google_article.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Things aren\u2019t looking too good across the pond lately for the innovators and entrepren", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b96\"", "article_summary": "As of this week, Google faces the very real prospect of having to break up its operations in Europe.\nThursday, to put the point mildly, is unlikely to be a happy Thanksgiving Day for Google in Europe.\nAfter taxi drivers staged summer protests in cities across Europe, German courts banned Uber from the German market in September.\nValuations are certain to drop if Google is forced to separate its search engine from its other lines of business.\nRelated: Google Hosts Meetings Across Europe on Privacy RightsInvestors are so far sanguine about Silicon Valley\u2019s legal problems, ethical transgressions, and executive pratfalls, but watch this space."}
