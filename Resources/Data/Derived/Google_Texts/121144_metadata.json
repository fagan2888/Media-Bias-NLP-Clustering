His objective is to impact Google rankings for Terra Tech.\"\n\nBorn May 22, 1978, Gates may have three brothers, and although the report doesn't note whether Gates himself has been arrested, it does state that his assumed older brother Frank has been accused and convicted of multiple drug offenses and possessing a firearm.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "The Twitter bully @laughinpaulryan, who has been tweeting negative information about marijuana companies and investors, has been positively identified.", "author": "Juliette Fairley", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "The Twitter bully @laughinpaulryan, who has been tweeting negative information about marijuana companies and investors, has been positively identified.", "title": "Marijuana Twitter Bully Exposed By Terra Tech Private Investigator", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/marijuana-twitter-bully-exposed-by-terra-tech-private-investigator", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marijuana911-1-1.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marijuana911-1-1.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "twitter bully, marijuana short sellers, personal finance, derek peterson, marijuana industry, marijuana stocks, terra tech, @laughinpaulryan, norman gate, the anson funds, sunny puri", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "sunny puri", "published_time": "2014-10-15T17:33Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1598405"}, "date": "2014-10-15T17:33Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 12915893, "twitter": {"description": "The Twitter bully @laughinpaulryan, who has been tweeting negative information about marijuana companies and investors, has been positively identified.", "title": "Marijuana Twitter Bully Exposed By Terra Tech Private Investigator", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/marijuana-twitter-bully-exposed-by-terra-tech-private-investigator", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marijuana911-1-1.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marijuana911-1-1.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "twitter bully, marijuana short sellers, personal finance, derek peterson, marijuana industry, marijuana stocks, terra tech, @laughinpaulryan, norman gate, the anson funds, sunny puri"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1751\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe does a lot of harassing people who defend Terra Tech on twitter,\u201d said Derek Peterson, CEO with Terra Tech.\n\u201cWhen potential investors 'google' Terra Tech, they want negative information to appear, which deters them from looking further into the company.\nHis objective is to impact Google rankings for Terra Tech.\"\nADVERTISEMENTNEW YORK (MainStreet) \u2014 The Twitter bully @laughinpaulryan, who has been tweeting negative information about marijuana companies and investors, has been positively identified as a 36-year-old New Jersey resident named Norman Gates.\nGates allegedly tweeted that a Terra Tech board member was sentenced to jail and wrote disparaging statements about 420 Investor Founder Alan Brochstein, who now has Gates\u2019s twitter handle @LaughinPaulRyan on ignore."}
