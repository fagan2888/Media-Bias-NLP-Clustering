I have been really blessed so i really have no reason to complain.\u201d Cara said. It ts not in her genes to complain.

Everybody was there to celebrate my last chemo it was more overwhelming the more I saw the different people in my life even my surgeon was there. I get emotional talking about it.\u201d\n\nCara also describes a flood of emotions about losing her hair. \u201cYou look in the mirror and you are looking at someone you don\u2019t know\u201d, Cara said. Family and friends remind her of her beauty\u2013but for the woman who lost her hair to cancer, what is on her head is still a daily battle. \u201cI wear a scarf, I wear a wig, I wear a baseball caps. Baseball caps are my \u2018go to\u2019 \u201d Cara said.\n\nRadiation and reconstruction are still in the future for Cara. She says she is read because she has a powerful team of supporters: family, friends and physicians. \u201cWe appreciate all the prayers because it\u2019s the power of prayers that is helping me.\u201d\n\nAlmost everyone has been touched by breast cancer in some way, so Cara is participating in the \u201cMaking Strides Against Breast Cancer\u201d event.\n\nJoin Cara and WCBD on Saturday, October 31st at 9:30 am at North Charleston Riverfront Park.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The spotlight turned toward Cara Fowler as she publicly talked about finding a malignant tumor in her breast and her current treatment.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398494424", "og": {"site_name": "WCBD News 2", "description": "The spotlight turned toward Cara Fowler as she publicly  talked about finding a malignant tumor in her breast and her current treatment.", "title": "2 Your Health: Diagnosis Breast Cancer: Cara\u2019s journey", "url": "http://counton2.com/2015/10/22/2-your-health-diagnosisbreast-cancer-caras-journey/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://mgtvwcbd.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/cr8b6psuwaehtws.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The spotlight turned toward Cara Fowler as she publicly  talked about finding a malignant tumor in her breast and her current treatment.", "title": "2 Your Health: Diagnosis Breast Cancer: Cara\u2019s journey", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwcbd.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/cr8b6psuwaehtws.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WCBD", "site": "WCBD", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "breast cancer, Cara Fowler, Rob Fowler, metastatic, mammogram, Triple negative, Meghan Baker", "msapplication-tooltip": "Charleston News, Weather and Sports | Summerville, Goose Creek, Mt.
