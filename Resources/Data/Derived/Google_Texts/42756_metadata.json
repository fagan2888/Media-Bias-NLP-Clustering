In the cobblestone street below, I enjoy a cigar and watch a teenage girl introduce her boyfriend to her parents as they sit on a bench and pass a cigarette back and forth.\n\nEveryone moves in slow motion.\n\nThe area is greener than I imagined, with trees sprouting sideways from oblong squares. Women stand guard in impossibly narrow doorways. Men play handball in the hollowed-out courtyard of one of the city\u2019s countless crumbled edifices. Tapas bars fill in the cracks.\n\nFor a foreigner who isn\u2019t coming with predetermined notions of Cuba as global boogeyman or socialist paradise, each alley and avenue, each conversation with a Cuban, complicates the picture. I\u2019m nowhere near the first Westerner, American or journalist to visit Havana \u2014 and I know it. But I want to make sense of the place.\n\nMany more like me could embark on this voyage soon. Although hundreds of thousands of Cuban-Americans make the trip each year and the intrepid traveler always finds a way in, the U.S. embargo has blocked countless more from visiting a country just 90 miles south of Florida.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s decision last month to improve relations with Cuba and ease trade and travel rules to the island has changed all of that. The U.S. government insists only certain groups of Americans may visit Cuba, but the elimination of a pre-authorization process means just about anyone can come.\n\nSome of Cuba\u2019s contradictions are immediately apparent.\n\nIn the Plaza Vieja, a Paul & Shark boutique sells sweaters for as much as a doctor here makes in months. The city offers new bars and restaurants. Some of the best, I\u2019m told, belong to people with connections to the communist government or access to expatriate cash, or both.\n\nPropaganda is pervasive, though tame. The murals are worn and sometimes entirely rubbed out, leaving tones of delicate ochre across building walls where more of Fidel Castro\u2019s citations and Che Guevara\u2019s portraits once stood.\n\nIn the 16th century Plaza de Armas, an elderly man offers me Associated Press Wirephoto prints from the 1950s along with other relics of Fulgencio Batista\u2019s period in power, along with the usual knick-knacks of the revolution. A minute later, a young man approaches and tells me has \u201cnice girls\u201d for sale.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For first-time visitor, Havana is charming \u2013 and complicated", "author": "Bradley Klapper", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "For first-time visitor, Havana is charming \u2013 and complicated", "title": "For first-time visitor, Havana is charming \u2013 and complicated", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/24/for_first_time_visitor_havana_is_charming_and_complicated/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/cuba-american-in-havana.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For first-time visitor, Havana is charming \u2013 and complicated", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/cuba-american-in-havana.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "For first-time visitor, Havana is charming \u2013 and complicated", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "For first-time visitor, Havana is charming \u2013 and complicated", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca9b\"", "article_summary": "A minute later, a young man approaches and tells me has \u201cnice girls\u201d for sale.\nI\u2019m nowhere near the first Westerner, American or journalist to visit Havana \u2014 and I know it.\nThe U.S. government insists only certain groups of Americans may visit Cuba, but the elimination of a pre-authorization process means just about anyone can come.\nTopics: From the Wires, News, Politics NewsHAVANA (AP) \u2014 Everyone warns you Old Havana is a facade, but it\u2019s impossible not to be taken by its charms.\nIn the Plaza Vieja, a Paul & Shark boutique sells sweaters for as much as a doctor here makes in months."}
