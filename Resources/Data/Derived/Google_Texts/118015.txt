Norman North High School alum Kalen Ryden scored his first goal as a member of Energy FC, lifting OKC to its first win of the 2016 season, 1-0 over the Swope Park Rangers, Saturday night at Taft Stadium.

In the 78th minute, OKC’s Sebastian Dalgaard sent a high cross into the left corner of the Swope Park six, where Ryden placed an uncontested header past Rangers keeper Jon Kempin and into the upper-right corner of the Swope Park net.

Energy FC keeper C.J. Cochran registered his first win and clean sheet of his Energy FC career, turning away three Swope Park shots in the game.

Kempin, a former OKC keeper, stopped five shots for Swope Park, including two on diving saves in the second half.

Energy FC next travels to Tukwila, Wash., where they’ll face Seattle Sounders FC 2 in a 9 p.m. CST kickoff on Sunday, May 1 at Starfire Sports Complex.

OKC’s next home match is Sunday, May 15, when they welcome San Antonio FC in a 6 p.m. start at Taft Stadium.
