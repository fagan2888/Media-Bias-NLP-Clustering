No doubt he is. His expressions of care and concern for the poor overflow with compassion and his sense of social justice. If those were the only variables, his prescriptions and pronouncements would be beyond debate. But they\u2019re not.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church recognizes its pope as the supreme apostolic authority on matters of Catholic doctrine, dogma and faith. But the pope\u2019s infallibility doesn\u2019t extend to politics, economics, foreign policy, national defense or climate science. When he strays into those areas, he\u2019s certainly entitled to his opinion but not to unquestioned agreement.\n\nAs the religious leader of the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Catholics, the pope\u2019s influence is substantial. But, apparently, less so with others, like a significant faction of the world\u2019s 1.6 billion Muslims given the propensity of its jihadist terrorists to slaughter what they regard as Christian infidels.\n\nIt should also be noted that the pope is himself the creation of a Vatican political process through his election by the College of Cardinals. Pope Francis is a man, not a deity, and a man whose political views were forged by his life experiences. He\u2019s a Jesuit, the very first Jesuit pope. Jesuits have long been regarded as the intellectual elitists of the church with a distinctly leftist ideological bent.\n\nJohn Lehman, former secretary of the Navy, once compared a public policy pronouncement to \u201cthe sex education I received from the Jesuits: intellectually brilliant, analytical and useful but yet lacking that certain wisdom derived from first-hand experience.\u201d\n\nAs a young man, Pope Francis \u2014 born Jorge Mario Bergoglio \u2014 was influenced by Juan Peron, Argentina\u2019s populist socialist president who talked the talk but governed as an autocrat. While archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio wrote \u201cDialogues Between John Paul II and Fidel Castro,\u201d which expressed his undisguised disdain for capitalism. His attacks on capitalism have continued since becoming pope. To describe them as simplistic and uninformed is being kind.\n\nIn his recent speech to Congress, Pope Francis invoked the welfare of thousands of Latin Americans heading north to the United States \u201cin search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of better opportunities.\u201d He urged Congress to take them all in.\n\nThe irony of this is striking. The U.S., the world icon of capitalism, should take them all in? Why aren\u2019t these refugees from poverty and government oppression flocking instead to Argentina, Venezuela, Bolivia or other bastions of socialism and government control of personal freedom?\n\nThe pope\u2019s criticism of \u201cunfettered\u201d capitalism is a straw-man argument. Unfettered capitalism doesn\u2019t exist in any real-world society, and certainly not in the U.S. government. Regulations and mandates on business continue to escalate, especially in the energy sector, as we labor under an increasing national debt driven overwhelmingly by the soaring cost of social spending \u201centitlements.\u201d Those nations of the European Union flirting with bankruptcy aren\u2019t suffering from an excess of capitalism; it\u2019s their creeping socialism that\u2019s doing them in.\n\nWhen the pope decries \u201ccompetition and the survival of the fittest\u201d in capitalist systems, he seems unaware that competition protects consumers, offering them choices and forcing competing suppliers to hold prices down. It\u2019s unfit competitors that rightly perish, what political scientist Joseph Schumpeter called the \u201ccreative destruction of capitalism.\u201d\n\nAs columnist Irving Kristol noted, capitalism isn\u2019t the best of all imaginable systems, just the best of all possible ones. Capitalism is the economic dimension of liberty. The track record of government-controlled economies is dismal by comparison.\n\nThe pope\u2019s narrow focus on the redistribution of wealth cavalierly takes the creation of it for granted. A now prominent secular carrier of this misguided philosophy is Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\n\nFreelance columnist Mike Rosen\u2019s radio show airs weekdays from 1 to 3 p.m. on 850-KOA.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rosen: The limits of papal infallibility", "title": "Rosen: The limits of papal infallibility", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/09/rosen-the-limits-of-papal-infallibility/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151009__20151011_Z00_OP11C_ROSENp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151009__20151011_Z00_OP11C_ROSENp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-09T13:08:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T11:57:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Pope Francis is a man, not a deity, and a man whose political views were forged by his life experiences.\nUnfettered capitalism doesn\u2019t exist in any real-world society, and certainly not in the U.S. government.\nPresident Obama has described Pope Francis as a good and warm-hearted man.\nThe pope\u2019s criticism of \u201cunfettered\u201d capitalism is a straw-man argument.\nBut the pope\u2019s infallibility doesn\u2019t extend to politics, economics, foreign policy, national defense or climate science."}
