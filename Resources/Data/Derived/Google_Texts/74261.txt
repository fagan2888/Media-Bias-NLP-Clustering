A group of kayakers is demanding that the Obama administration put an end to offshore oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean.

The "kayaktivists" will protest in front of the White House on Saturday. They are calling for President Obama to revoke oil and gas exploration leases in the Chukchi Sea, which surrounds Alaska.

At the White House protest, the kayaktivists will stage an Arctic marine scene and show up with their kayaks and inflatable boats to raise awareness about the issue.

"The kayak has become this symbol of resistance to drilling in the Arctic,” said Marissa Knodel, spokesperson for Friends of the Earth.

They will be joined by kayaktivists in 13 other states, as well as environmental groups such as 350.org, Alaska Wilderness League, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club, in protesting the deep sea drilling activities.

The kayaktivists are protesting as part of “Shell No Day.” They say Shell Oil is close to drilling in the Chukchi Sea and fear it could lead to a major oil spill.
