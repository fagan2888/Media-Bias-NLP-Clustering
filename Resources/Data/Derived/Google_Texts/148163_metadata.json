Now, after two nights of what network and cable stations call \u201cadult programming\u201d \u2014 I\u2019d choose \u201cseptic tank sludge\u201d \u2014 my eyes have popped, my eardrums have melted and my disbelief has escalated as I\u2019ve heard and seen stuff that would drive Masters and Johnson into a convent and seminary \u2014 not together, I hope.\n\nWhat on Earth has happened to our once pure \u2014 somewhat, at least \u2014 and precious culture and standards that sap/crap and licentiously loose lips have been allowed to dump such sewage?\n\nI\u2019m so distraught at this steady deterioration that I\u2019m actually a bit unsteady \u2014 I mean \u201cphysically,\u201d not \u201cemotionally,\u201d but you can decide that for yourselves, I guess \u2014 and have had to put training wheels back onto my bike.\n\nBut there\u2019s hope. Some of the nicest people I could ever hope to know \u2014 Cathy, Mary, Vicki, Marilynn, Lynn, Gary and Bruce \u2014 have come to the rescue and are bringing new meaning and happiness into my life this week.\n\nWill you please come to \u201cSHOWTIME\u201d to thank them?\n\nTom Drill\n\nManitowoc\n\nRead or Share this story: http://htrne.ws/1T6elcm", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "I\u2019m so distraught at this steady deterioration that I\u2019m actually a bit unsteady.", "og": {"site_name": "HTR Media", "description": "I\u2019m so distraught at this steady deterioration that I\u2019m actually a bit unsteady.", "title": "Letter: Today\u2019s television shows in poor taste", "url": "http://www.htrnews.com/story/opinion/2015/08/08/drill-letter/31340505/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/htrnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I\u2019m so distraught at this steady deterioration that I\u2019m actually a bit unsteady.", "title": "Today\u2019s television shows in poor taste", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0ceda2f384714ab48c0a807ca02d899664ef4532/c=0-30-1704-1734&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/08/Manitowoc/B9318374985Z.1_20150808142639_000_G6KBIK4H1.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@htrnews", "site": "@htrnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883325026", "fb": {"app_id": 179306802094584}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "TV poor taste"}, "article_summary": "Old TV (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)Some years ago, after I was thrown out of preschool for insider-trading, I had a real epiphany.\nWill you please come to \u201cSHOWTIME\u201d to thank them?\nWhat on Earth has happened to our once pure \u2014 somewhat, at least \u2014 and precious culture and standards that sap/crap and licentiously loose lips have been allowed to dump such sewage?\nBut there\u2019s hope.\nTom DrillManitowocRead or Share this story: http://htrne.ws/1T6elcm"}
