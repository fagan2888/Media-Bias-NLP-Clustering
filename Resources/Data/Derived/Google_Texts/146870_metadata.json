After the network cancelled his talk show in March, Morgan remained under contract until September and then returned to his native Britain, where he writes a Daily Mail column.\n\nMorgan has never been a man of integrity; his entire career has been built upon a relentless quest for personal publicity and a willingness to promote any political agenda, if it pleases whomever happens to be signing his paychecks at the time. Thus, he was a perfect fit for CNN, a network that slavishly praises President Obama\u2019s every breath and encourages it\u2019s show hosts and reporters to denigrate the Constitution at every opportunity. The network\u2019s Progressive, anti-American agenda \u2013 which almost puts MSNBC to shame \u2013 has assured it two things; firstly, that its remain in the gutter, where they have been for years and, secondly, that there is no shortage of unprincipled publicity-hounds who need to make a buck and are willing to shoot their mouths off in front of the CNN audience, which can basically be calculated as everyone in the country who isn\u2019t watching Fox News, minus a handful of people who are so delusional that they are watching MSNBC.\n\nThat, in a nut-shell, is the story of how Piers Morgan ended up working as a host at CNN. Morgan can be eloquent, sarcastic and quite the wordsmith, but he will say whatever his paymaster du jour wants him to say, even if he knows that it\u2019s all lies. Even for Morgan, however, the cheap deceptions coming from the White House were, at times, so blatant as to be beyond the pale. In November 2013, while hosting his show, Morgan took the President to task for lying about what Obamacare would do for ordinary Americans. \u201cI find it very difficult, this ObamaCare thing,\u201d said Morgan, \u201cwhen I see the repeated footage of him [Obama] standing there saying \u2018you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan,\u2019 just telling an outright porky pie to the American public. I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s not the Barack Obama that I expected.\u201d Morgan, being from the United Kingdom, knows better; when the government controls the healthcare system and, therefore, the cost of healthcare, the ordinary person does not get to make any choices about doctors, plans, what hospital to visit or anything else.\n\nNever before, however, has Piers Morgan actually trashed Obama. In his October 1 column for the Daily Mail, however, that is exactly what the former CNN host did. The main focus of Morgan\u2019s ire appears to be Obama\u2019s recent attempt to shift the blame for a major policy failure. The President has built a much-deserved reputation for blaming everyone and everything else for every setback, scandal, lie and spectacular failure that has frequently originated directly from the White House. Indeed, it was beginning to look as if George W. Bush had actually continued to run the country for some three years after the end of his second term, since he was still, apparently, responsible for every problem \u2013 even after Obama\u2019s nearly 800 trillion-dollar \u2018stimulus\u2019 and two years of a Congress completely controlled by the President\u2019s own party.\n\nRecently, the President used a 60 Minutes interview to attempt to shift the blame for his failure to address the threat of the Islamic State onto his intelligence services. Having ignored warnings about ISIS for a year \u2013 during which time the President attended less than half of his daily security briefings \u2013 Obama had the audacity to lay the blame squarely at the feet of his intelligence chief. When asked if the swift gains made by ISIS had come as a surprise, the Commander-in-Chief responded \u201cWell, I think the head of our intelligence community Jim Clapper has acknowledged that, I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.\u201d His use of the word \u201cthey,\u201d rather than what would have been the correct word \u2013 \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 is what stood out for many observers, including Piers Morgan, who described Obama\u2019s words as \u201cA more shameless, reprehensible display of buck-passing it would be hard to find from a sitting President.\u201d\n\nMorgan went on to slam the President for his lack of resolve in dealing with the Jihadists, emboldening them to \u201cthink they can behead American citizens with impunity in glossy snuff movies.\u201d He went on to say Imagine how emboldened they must have felt when Obama made his \u2018heartfelt\u2019 speech about journalist James Foley\u2019s execution, and was then seen laughing and joking on the golf course SEVEN MINUTES later.\u201d\n\nWhatever one\u2019s opinion of Morgan, there can be no doubt that he makes a good point; it is probably true to say that never, in the history of this country, has President displayed such callous lack of regard for the murder, by terrorists, of an American citizen. The former CNN host concluded by stating, in no uncertain terms, what Obama should do, were he a real leader: \u201cIt\u2019s time he got off the damn golf course, got up to speed with his intelligence briefings and focused on wiping out ISIS.\u201d\n\nIt is truly a wake-up call to the American people when a British journalist \u2013 himself a staunch defender of the President \u2013 is the one to so succinctly point out the colossal failure to lead. The nation deserves better and, when even Piers Morgan can see that whilst so many Americans still worship Obama almost as a god, the situation has become dire enough to warrant immediate change \u2013 by any means and at any cost, since the cost of allowing Barack Obama and his party to remain in power is far higher than any other imaginable.\n\nOpinion by Graham J Noble\n\nSources:\n\nDaily Mail\n\nUSA Today\n\nNewsbusters\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Piers Morgan, the former CNN host who once appeared to be truly in love with President Obama, recently trashed the President in column for the British Daily Mail newspaper.
