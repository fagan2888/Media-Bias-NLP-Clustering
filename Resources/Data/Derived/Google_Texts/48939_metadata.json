It also had to be flexible to respond to the ever-changing nature of his business; one that facilitated collaboration and one that did not impose itself on their open and transparent culture. This is the building that we created for him. It is not a grand design statement and it has a toughness and a rawness that reminds me of the work I was doing in the early part of my career. I am very proud of the collaboration and I hope that it facilitates innovation and invention of the highest level.\"\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page, \"The building itself is pretty simple and isn't fancy. That's on purpose. We want our space to feel like a work in progress. When you enter our buildings, we want you to feel how much there is to be done in our mission to connect the world.\"\n\nZuckerberg may not deem it fancy, but it does have some fancy amenities, including a nine-acre green rooftop park designed by CMG Landscape Architects with more than 400 trees and the work of 15 artists exploring Facebook-relevant themes like systems, networks and communities.\n\nAccording to San Francisco Business Times, Gehry Partners will design the next phase of the MPK20 campus, which will include two new buildings totaling 985,000 square feet, a 200-room hotel, and a five acre public space. Menlo Park economic development manager Jim Cogan told the publication that these plans are in the early development stage.\n\nCopyright NBC Owned Television Stations", "article_metadata": {"description": "Facebook's new Menlo Park office, which was designed by Frank Gehry, already has ambitious expansion plans.", "title": "Facebook's Frank Gehry-Designed MPK20 Campus Will Further Expand", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Bay Area", "description": "Facebook's new Menlo Park office, which was designed by Frank Gehry, already has ambitious expansion plans.", "title": "Facebook Expands Gehry-Designed Campus", "url": "http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Facebooks-Frank-Gehry-Designed-MPK20-Campus-Will-Further-Expand-298979291.html", "image": "http://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/1200*860/facebook27.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Facebook's new Menlo Park office, which was designed by Frank Gehry, already has ambitious expansion plans.", "title": "Facebook Expands Gehry-Designed Campus", "url": "http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Facebooks-Frank-Gehry-Designed-MPK20-Campus-Will-Further-Expand-298979291.html", "image": "http://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/1200*860/facebook27.JPG?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcbayarea", "site": "@nbcbayarea", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 75829892837}, "keywords": "local news, bay area news, san franscisco news, breaking news, local news, bay area, san francisco, oakland, berkeley, san jose, sf", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCBayArea"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd22\"", "article_summary": "Facebook's brand new Menlo Park campus MPK20, which was designed by Frank Gehry, already has ambitious expansion plans.\nDesigned by Frank Gehry, the 430,000 square foot LEED gold certified building has a large open floor plan and multi-story windows.\n\"From the start, Mark wanted a space that was unassuming, matter-of-fact and cost effective,\" Gehry said in a statement.\nMenlo Park economic development manager Jim Cogan told the publication that these plans are in the early development stage.\nI am very proud of the collaboration and I hope that it facilitates innovation and invention of the highest level.\""}
