The list is split almost evenly between fruits/vegetables and junk food (\u201chow many calories in a Big Mac?\u201d alongside \u201chow many calories in an apple?\u201d) suggesting a binge-and-restrict approach that can\u2019t be good for our national health. But it\u2019s the diet searches that reveal America\u2019s love for a good lifestyle hack. While some old chestnuts won\u2019t die\u2014the cheeseburger-no-bun Atkins Diet, the sensible and slightly romantic Mediterranean Diet\u2014many of 2014\u2019s trendiest diets prove Americans love junk science almost as much as they love junk food. From co-opting Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s gluten sensitivity to injecting themselves with hormones, here are the most trendy ways we tried to reduce ourselves in 2014.\n\nThe Paleo Diet\n\nThis diet continued to have legs\u2014strong, swift CrossFitted legs\u2014this year because it promises that you can think like a lady (get that bikini body!) and eat like a caveman (all of the lard!). Paleo eaters get to eliminate dairy along with a lot of unnamed toxins and nebulously harmful contaminants (found in, I guess, beans?) while sounding virile, not fussy\u2014all thanks to \u201cevolutionary biology.\u201d The Paleo Diet claims to be a lifestyle diet that works with our genetics, not against them. \u201cPaleo looks to ancestral wisdom\u2014whether from cave-dwelling Paleolithic ancestors or remote native populations untouched by Western disease\u2014for guidance on what to eat and how to live,\u201d says a basics article in Paleo Magazine. It\u2019s food spirituality for the recreational Krav Maga set, a way to give up gluten without taking up meditation.\n\nGluten-Free Diet\n\nIn the recent horse race of food sensitivities, real and imagined, gluten retained its lead this year. The practice of avoiding it has been co-opted from people with awful and inconvenient gastrointestinal disorders and severe allergies by those looking for a trendy yet science-y reason to avoid the bread basket in restaurants. While celiac disease patients are actually allergic to the wheat proteins, for trend-followers it\u2019s also the next step in emulating Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s super-sensitive lifestyle brand.\n\nThe Military Diet\n\nThe Military Diet claims to be \u201cdesigned by top secret nutritionists at the U.S. military to get soldiers into tip top shape,\u201d which it does through a one-two punch of interval fasting and shame. According to the website, \u201cThe people that fail on the Military Diet simply don\u2019t have the drive and determination that you do. They complain about hunger or low energy because they are used to eating way more calories in a day. That\u2019s how they gained weight in the first place.\u201d The Military Diet involves eating the bare minimum of sad foods like hot dogs, cottage cheese, saltines and canned tuna for three days, then eating a reasonable amount of tasty foods on the four days off. In the interest of national security, top secret military nutritionists\u2019 comments on the nutritional validity of hot dogs have been redacted.\n\nThe HCG Diet\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know where to start with this one. Named after a hormone the female body produces during pregnancy, the space-agey hCG Diet demands severe calorie restriction and daily injections of the hormone hCG, under the super-legit claim that it\u2019ll help you\u2019ll lose fat but not muscle. Who would have thought that if you restrict yourself to 500 calories a day, you\u2019d lose weight? You\u2019ll probably lose your hair, too. The pregnancy hormones are supposed to take care of those inconvenient pangs of hunger while you starve yourself. Thank the geniuses over at the Dr. Oz Show for publicizing it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From top-secret military nutritionists to butter coffee, Americans proved we have no idea how to eat", "author": "Erin Keane", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From top-secret military nutritionists to butter coffee, Americans proved we have no idea how to eat", "title": "2014: Our year in trendy diets", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/27/2014_our_year_in_trendy_diets/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/feet_scale.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From top-secret military nutritionists to butter coffee, Americans proved we have no idea how to eat", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/feet_scale.jpg", "title": "2014: Our year in trendy diets", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "2014: Our year in trendy diets", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014, Diet, Gluten-free, Google, Paleo diet, year-end", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe14a3\"", "article_summary": "While some old chestnuts won\u2019t die\u2014the cheeseburger-no-bun Atkins Diet, the sensible and slightly romantic Mediterranean Diet\u2014many of 2014\u2019s trendiest diets prove Americans love junk science almost as much as they love junk food.\nwhile sounding virile, not fussy\u2014all thanks to \u201cevolutionary biology.\u201d The Paleo Diet claims to be a lifestyle diet that works with our genetics, not against them.\nAccording to the website, \u201cThe people that fail on the Military Diet simply don\u2019t have the drive and determination that you do.\nFrom co-opting Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s gluten sensitivity to injecting themselves with hormones, here are the most trendy ways we tried to reduce ourselves in 2014.\nBut it\u2019s the diet searches that reveal America\u2019s love for a good lifestyle hack."}
