And nowhere in the campaign will the ads mention the health-care program for the poor.\n\nThe announcement coincided with the release of census numbers that show Virginia\u2019s neighboring states have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of uninsured residents after expanding Medicaid.\n\nVirginia\u2019s Republican-controlled House has fought expansion to the frustration of Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who made the issue the centerpiece of his first year in office.\n\nDespite the apparent deadlock on the issue at the capitol, supporters hope the pricey campaign \u2014 with ads on TV, radio and online, as well as on buses and billboards \u2014 will ramp up the pressure on lawmakers ahead of the November election and next year\u2019s session. \u201cDon\u2019t let government inaction threaten our hospitals,\u201d one ad warns. \u201cGovernment mandates and funding cuts threaten jobs, our economy and your health. Virginia hospitals: our lifeline,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice intones in a TV spot.\n\n[In Southwest Va., health needs, poverty collide with Affordable Care Act]\n\nHospitals throughout the state said they struggle with inadequate state and federal reimbursement rates and the threat of across-the-board cuts associated with sequestration.\n\nAlthough many hospital officials do not expect the ACA to be repealed, they said Medicaid expansion should not be the only way to address the problem of the uninsured.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet,\u201d James B. Cole, president and CEO of Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington, said during a news conference. \u201cThe only way to get to something that will work in Virginia over the long term is, yes, to engage in a very serious dialogue. But even before that, . . . there is a problem and that problem is going to get worse.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) has called blocking Medicaid expansion part of his legacy in the legislature, and he showed no signs of budging Wednesday. In fact, he doubled down on the idea that the ACA has been bad for hospitals.\n\n\u201cThe speaker is happy to have a dialogue about the role hospitals play, the impact Obamacare has had on them and how the legislature can work with hospitals in the future, but Medicaid expansion is not part of that conversation,\u201d Howell\u2019s spokesman, Matt Moran, said in a statement.\n\nSen. John C. Watkins (Powhatan), one of three moderate Senate Republicans who supported an alternative to traditional expansion in 2014, said there is still a way to use federal money to buy private insurance for enrollees.\n\n\u201cI hope that the voters of Virginia in November will make their preferences known with regard to coming up with a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always maintained that expanding government doesn\u2019t necessarily bode well for the taxpayer, but if you\u2019re already paying taxes to cover particular services, if there is a private sector mechanism by which that can be done, then we sure ought to be looking at it.\u201d\n\nVirginia is one of 21 states that have not expanded Medicaid.\n\nStates that have \u2014 including Kentucky, West Virginia and Maryland \u2014 saw dips in the number of uninsured residents from 2013 to 2014, according to a Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis look at new census data.\n\nMichael Cassidy, president of the institute, called Virginia\u2019s performance \u201cdismal\u201d because \u201cstate lawmakers have refused to be creative in reducing coverage gap.\u201d\n\nArkansas, Pennsylvania and Iowa \u2014 all states with Republican governors \u2014 worked with the federal government to get permission to adjust the program, he said.\n\nThe hospital association also cited grim statistics: One-third of Virginia\u2019s acute care hospitals operated in the red in 2013, according to Health Information data.\n\nBillboards will be focused in a rural swath from far southwestern Virginia to Lynchburg \u2014 a region that has seen drastic cuts in health-care services in recent years and has a disproportionate share of the state\u2019s uninsured. One hospital has closed.\n\nThe area is represented almost exclusively by Republicans opposed to expansion.\n\nBut if the view of Del. John M. O\u2019Bannon III, a Republican neurologist from Henrico on the other side of the state, is any guide, little is likely to change.\n\n\u201cI welcome dialogue,\u201d he said. \u201cI remain convinced that not expanding Medicaid is the right way for Virginia to go.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "vapolitics, Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, Terry McAuliffe, Bill Howell, hospitals.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Republicans won\u2019t touch Medicaid expansion, but struggling hospitals say there must be another way.", "title": "Va. hospitals pressure state lawmakers in ad campaign for ACA money", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-hospitals-pressure-lawmakers-with-new-push-for-federal-healthcare-money/2015/09/16/11c2c69e-5c9c-11e5-9757-e49273f05f65_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/11/Interactivity/Images/andrews1028.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jennaportnoy"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "vapolitics, Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, Terry McAuliffe, Bill Howell, hospitals.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "11c2c69e-5c9c-11e5-9757-e49273f05f65", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Republicans won\u2019t touch Medicaid expansion, but struggling hospitals say there must be another way."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet,\u201d James B.
