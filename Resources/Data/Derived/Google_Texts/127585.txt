On Thursday, Louisville Cardinals senior Shoni Schimmel, Umatilla, was nothing but clutch in the Buick three-point contest. After winning the women's title, she bested the men's contest winner to earn top all-around honors.

Just two days earlier, Schimmel had poured in 31 points, including three 3-pointers in the last 30 seconds, in a heartbreaking loss to Maryland that denied the Cardinals a spot in the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament.

Schimmel looked lackluster in the first round of the shootout, scoring just 14 points (out of a possible 30) and moving on to the semifinals tied with Nebraska's Jordan Hooper for lowest score. There she put up 22 points, at one point dropping 11 bombs in a row, good for a slot against Duke's Tricia Liston (who scored 24). In the final, Schimmel made her last eight consecutive threes to defeat Liston 22-16.

Then the Umatilla Thrilla beat the men's winner, Brady Heslip of Baylor, in similar fashion, notching 22 and sinking her final seven shots. Here's the video:
