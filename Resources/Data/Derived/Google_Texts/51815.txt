Despite Mayor Bill de Blasio and other city leaders declining to march in the St. Patrick’s Day Parade–and another corporate sponsor dropping out because of the organizers’ policy effectively banning gay groups–the parade was nonetheless a vibrant spectacle as it moved along Fifth Avenue.

The streets of Midtown were a sea of green crowds cheering on the horses, bagpipers and other groups celebrating their Irish heritage. Some protesters also lined the route–and though Mr. de Blasio was absent from the parade, he took part in several other festivities marking the day, including a Mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral.
