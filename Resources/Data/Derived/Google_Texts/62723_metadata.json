Vermont\u2019s law goes into effect next year, while Connecticut and Maine have both signed similar laws that go into effect if surrounding states also pass their own GMO labelling laws. But the DARK Act could undo all the hard work of food safety activists, according to Anna Roth, senior editor of Civil Eats, a news source for \u201ccritical thought about the American food system.\u201d In a report published last week, Roth writes:\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cH.R. 1599 would negate all of these laws, and more\u2013according to the Center for Food Safety. The preemption language in the bill would nullify over a hundred local laws that, directly or indirectly, regulate genetically engineered crops.\u201d\n\nWenonah Hauter, executive director of the nonprofit Food & Water Watch, has called it \u201cMonsanto\u2019s Dream Bill\u201d because it affects agricultural production as well as labelling, expands the definition of the word \u201cnatural\u201d to include GMO ingredients, and would weaken efforts by nonprofits like Non-GMO Project to establish strict guidelines for labelling of \u201cGMO Free\u201d products.\n\nRoth continues:\n\n\u201cH.R. 1599 would put the system of voluntary non-GMO certification under the jurisdiction of the USDA. The USDA already has its own (new) certification program, which is much less rigorous than the Non-GMO Projects \u2026 If the bill passes, however, independent verifiers would essentially use the USDA\u2019s standards and process (much like with the federal organic standards). No one knows whether the new USDA verification process will take longer, cost more, or be more onerous than independent verifications.\u201d\n\nRoth speculates that the DARK Act is \u201cunlikely to pass\u201d the Senate, but according to The Fifth Column\u2019s Jennifer Long, the bill is maintaining its \u201cmomentum,\u201d passing the House Agriculture Committee earlier this month and potentially coming up for vote soon. While the DARK Act may never become law, the fight over this bill may prove meaningless if the TPP is approved.\n\n\u201cThe Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a Free Trade agreement that would take away national sovereignty of all countries, opens the door to companies, such as Monsanto, to sue countries that do not implement GMO\u2019s for loss of profit through the Investor State Dispute Settlement Tribunals (ISDS),\u201d Long wrote on July 22.\n\nLong is not the first to raise the alarm about this issue. Back in April, a Democratic Congressman shared his concerns about the TPP-Monsanto connection with Caracas-based Telesur:\n\n\u201c\u2018Call it the smoking gun,\u2019 said Oregon Congressman Peter DeFazio. \u2018Proof that fast track and massive free trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership are written by and for multinational corporations such as agriculture giant Monsanto. Instead of using trade deals as an opportunity to protect and strengthen consumer rights by joining the countries which require genetically engineered food to be labeled, this administration wants to benefit wealthy corporations at the expense of the public.\u2019\u201d\n\nCongress made its final vote in support of fast-track authority for the TPP on June 24, meaning legislators will vote on the massive trade deal without being able to modify it. The contents of the bulk of the TPP remain secret, despite a $100,000 \u201cbounty\u201d on its release offered by WikiLeaks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018Monsanto\u2019s Dream Bill\u2019: DARK Act And Trans-Pacific Partnership Will Keep Consumers Ignorant", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "MintPress News Desk", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "\u2018Monsanto\u2019s Dream Bill\u2019: DARK Act And Trans-Pacific Partnership Will Keep Consumers Ignorant", "title": "\u2018Monsanto\u2019s Dream Bill\u2019: DARK Act And Trans-Pacific Partnership Will Keep Consumers Ignorant", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/monsantos-dream-bill-dark-act-and-trans-pacific-partnership-will-keep-consumers-ignorant/207996/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Untitled-design.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-28T09:42:53-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u2018Monsanto\u2019s Dream Bill\u2019: DARK Act And Trans-Pacific Partnership Will Keep Consumers Ignorant", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AP_398326488760.jpg", "title": "\u2018Monsanto\u2019s Dream Bill\u2019: DARK Act And Trans-Pacific Partnership Will Keep Consumers Ignorant", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Health & Lifestyle", "tag": "Wikileaks", "published_time": "2015-07-28T07:48:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-28T09:42:53-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf4d9\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s called the Safe and Accurate Food Labelling Act of 2015, or H.R.\n\u2018Monsanto\u2019s Dream Bill\u2019: DARK Act And Trans-Pacific Partnership Will Keep Consumers IgnorantThe controversial TPP trade deal could destroy the efforts of some states to mandate labelling of foods with GMO ingredients, while a bill moving through Congress has a similar goal.\nWhile the DARK Act may never become law, the fight over this bill may prove meaningless if the TPP is approved.\nAnd even if the DARK Act is defeated, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the controversial international trade deal recently granted fast-track authority to pass Congress, accomplishes much the same goal.\nVermont\u2019s law goes into effect next year, while Connecticut and Maine have both signed similar laws that go into effect if surrounding states also pass their own GMO labelling laws."}
