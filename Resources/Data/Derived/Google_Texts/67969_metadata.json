And it returned to the organization for another two part-time employees when it expanded the operation.\n\n\u201cThey're great at the job,\u201d Piazza said. \u201cAnd around here their special need isn't even a consideration. They've become just another part of the team.\u201d\n\nFor a small business that doesn't have a big HR department \u2014 or, in some cases, an HR department at all \u2014 it's crucial to have organizations that ease any potential misgivings involved with hiring individuals with disabilities.\n\nBut it's those uncertainties that these organizations hope to preemptively erase.\n\nAnd so groups, such as Employment Horizons in Cedar Knolls, are both promoting a message and giving small business owners a hands-on experience with hiring from this untapped labor pool.\n\n\u201cThrough (our job sampling) program, individuals with disabilities come in a business with a job coach and start doing work as if they were hired, with the understanding that they're not employed yet,\u201d said Lisa Montalbano, business development manager of Employment Horizons.\n\nGrants from foundations pay that person's wage while they do that job sample, which can last for multiple weeks. Then business owners can decide for themselves whether the individual fits the job.\n\nMontalbano said her organization does around 80 placements annually during better years, half of which are with small businesses.\n\nBesides the effect of a slow-to-rebound economy, there's still much misinformation and vagueness about this population that lingers among business owners that Montalbano's organization is having to confront to improve that rate.\n\nShe explained that even saying \u201cindividuals with disabilities\u201d can be somewhat imprecise, given that the definition of a disability has broadened over the years.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunities Commission issued revisions to that definition back in 2011. The new provisions may allow former cancer patients whose illnesses are in remission to claim a disability as well as those who cope with hearing loss by wearing a hearing aid.\n\nAnd there's all manner of physical disabilities and other cognitive disabilities, between someone who needs a hearing aid and those with the most severe developmental or intellectual disabilities.\n\nTaken as a whole, individuals with disabilities are a population with enough college degrees and professional certifications to recommend them in a job market.\n\nBut one group that's especially at risk to be left out of the employment equation is persons with autism.\n\nAccording to a 2012 study in \u201cPediatrics,\u201d only about half of young adults with autism had a job during the first six years after high school. Overall, they faced a greater than 50 percent chance of being unemployed or not attending college when compared to those with other disabilities.\n\nPeter Bell, CEO and president of Eden Autism Services in Princeton, said his organization has made it a goal for its young adults to have them in paying jobs by the time they graduate high school.\n\nAnd there's a few perks to hiring these individuals that he wants others to know.\n\n\u201cThey have need for sameness as part of the diagnosis, so they don't mind repetitive tasks in the workplace, whereas an individual who doesn't have autism may get bored with a repetitive task quickly,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThat's a valuable skill.\u201d\n\nA new area of employment that Bell said is ramping up in popularity for these individuals is testing software code.\n\n\u201cThat's because they have a tendency to be extremely detail-oriented, so they can find errors in code more readily than people who perhaps don't have autism,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThat area has been popular for developing job opportunities for this population.\u201d\n\nBell added that hiring any individual with a disability seems to have a halo effect on employee morale.\n\n\u201cIt makes the employer seem more human when they figure out a way to have an individual with disabilities work side-by-side with colleagues without disabilities,\u201d he said.\n\nLeigh Visual Imaging, a printing and photography company that has been involved for 15 years with Eden, has found that true. It has two men with autism from Eden who do janitorial work for the small Princeton business.\n\n\u201cThey're just a joy to have around,\u201d said Janice Ford, senior customer service specialist at Leigh Visual Imaging.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe're a small company, and we've found fellow employees respond very positively to the fact that they are working here and our customers as well.\n\n\u201cAnd we've even had some customers that have then contacted Eden themselves to (outsource) some office work and cleaning.\u201d\n\nBarbara Otto said there's a definite public relations benefit to hiring individuals with disabilities. That's one of the many benefits she'll tout as principal of Think Beyond the Label, a public-private partnership that delivers information, outreach and resources to businesses on a national level.\n\n\u201cYou have to be aware of reflecting the market you're (selling to),\u201d she said, \u201cOne in five Americans has some form of disability, so, between family and friends, that's a trillion-dollar marketplace that you are making yourself appealing to.\u201d\n\nAnd Otto said companies should be quick to avoid a common misconception about the bottom line, especially small business that survive on thin margins.\n\n\u201cIt's really key for us to speak about worries like health care costs going up,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the Affordable Care Act, there's no discrimination for people with pre-existing conditions, so a small business can't be charged more for hiring an individual with a disability.\u201d\n\nThat was a huge barrier for many small businesses, Otto said. Even still, it was historically the smaller businesses that hired individuals with disabilities.\n\n\u201cThese were employers who hired who they knew,\u201d Bell said. \u201cAnd large competitors shied away from it for a long time.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, Bell pretty well summarized the message all of these organizations have for businesses still apprehensive about this sort of hiring activity:\n\n\u201cThe goal is to have them understand this as good business practice, not as something that's just about charity.\n\n\u201cIt's about doing the right thing \u2014 the right thing for their business.\u201d\n\nE-mail to: brettj@njbiz.com\n\nOn Twitter: @reporterbrett\n\nRules of special engagement\n\nWhether you\u2019re hiring someone with a physical or mental disability or you\u2019re just working alongside an individual with a disability, it\u2019s good to know some basic etiquette rules.\n\nSuzanne Robitaille, founder of the news and media platform abledbody.com, shared some of her expertise with NJBIZ:\n\n1 Say hello\n\n\u201cTreat the person as any other individual, not someone who needs pity or special treatment. If you can, orient yourself to their specific needs.\u201d\n\n2 Refer to the person first\n\n\u201cIn conversation, say, \u2018the person who is deaf\u2019 instead of saying, \u2018the deaf person.\u2019\u201d\n\n3 Use everyday expressions\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely acceptable to say things like \u2018It was good to see you\u2019 and \u2018See you soon\u2019 to a person who is blind.\u201d\n\n4 Ask first\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch a wheelchair user\u2019s chair or grab a visually impaired person\u2019s arm without asking if they want assistance first. Let a person who is visually impaired take your arm, not the other way around.\u201d\n\n5 Give cues\n\n\u201cWave your hands to get the attention of a person who is deaf. You also can facilitate a conversation with a person who is blind by giving verbal cues and asking questions.\u201d\n\n6 Be considerate\n\n\u201cSit down so you can meet a person who uses a wheelchair at eye level. Give someone with a speech impairment extra time to finish a sentence \u2014 don\u2019t do it for them.\u201d\n\n7 Don\u2019t be shy\n\n\u201cOffer your handshake to a person with a limb impairment; he or she may shake your hand differently. Or ask to take notes at a meeting for a person who is deaf.\u201d\n\n8 Think logistically\n\n\u201cMobility-impaired people are prone to slips and falls, so keep floors clear when possible. Make a note of accessible routes.\u201d\n\n9 Get the facts first\n\n\u201cSomeone who at first may seem drunk or disorderly may in fact have a disability that causes involuntary body movements and slurred speech, such as cerebral palsy.\u201d\n\n10 Encourage participation\n\n\u201cLike anyone else, a person with a disability is more likely to succeed at work if he or she is socially involved. Most likely, he or she can tell you what accommodations will be necessary to make the situation work.\u201d\n\nHiring (and firing)\n\nOnce you hire an employee with a disability, you can never fire them \u2014 so say regulations.\n\nBarbara Otto is tired of hearing that myth.\n\n\u201cA job is a job,\u201d she said. \u201cIf someone can\u2019t perform the job they\u2019ve been hired for, they can\u2019t claim that you have to keep someone around if you\u2019ve done everything you can to reasonably accommodate them.\u201d\n\nEmployers can fire workers with disabilities under one of the following three conditions:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "Bon Venture Services printed plenty of bulletins each week \u2014 and it had just as many inserts for those bulletins \u2014 but it had no one on staff available to combine the two.", "title": "Filling a need: Businesses finding hiring those with disabilities is good for population, productivity | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20150420/NJBIZ01/304179991/filling-a-need-businesses-finding-hiring-those-with-disabilities-is-good-for-population-productivity", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20150420/NJBIZ01/304179991/AR/0/AR-304179991.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "Bon Venture Services printed plenty of bulletins each week \u2014 and it had just as many inserts for those bulletins \u2014 but it had no one on staff available to combine the two.", "title": "Filling a need: Businesses finding hiring those with disabilities is good for population, productivity | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20150420/NJBIZ01/304179991/AR/0/AR-304179991.jpg"}, "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Bon Venture Services printed plenty of bulletins each week \u2014 and it had just as many inserts for those bulletins \u2014 but it had no one on staff available to combine the two.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt makes the employer seem more human when they figure out a way to have an individual with disabilities work side-by-side with colleagues without disabilities,\u201d he said.\nAnd so groups, such as Employment Horizons in Cedar Knolls, are both promoting a message and giving small business owners a hands-on experience with hiring from this untapped labor pool.\nThe Flanders-based church publication company turned to Employment Horizons, which helped facilitate the hiring of an individual with a disability for the job.\nTaken as a whole, individuals with disabilities are a population with enough college degrees and professional certifications to recommend them in a job market.\nAnd there's all manner of physical disabilities and other cognitive disabilities, between someone who needs a hearing aid and those with the most severe developmental or intellectual disabilities."}
