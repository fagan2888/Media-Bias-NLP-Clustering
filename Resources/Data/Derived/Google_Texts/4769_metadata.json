This was perhaps the most consequential shift in Internet policy in nearly two decades, and it was put in place without full public access.\n\nAnd yet even though the rules are now available for all to see, it remains somewhat unclear how exactly they will work in practice. As The New York Times notes today, the FCC is \u201cset to decide what is acceptable on a case-by-case basis. The regulations include a subjective catchall provision, requiring \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 conduct.\u201d\n\nWhat counts as \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 will, naturally, be up to the whims of the FCC.\n\nIn some ways, this is the worst part of the agency\u2019s net neutrality push: It\u2019s not even that it puts in place bad rules; it\u2019s that it installs potentially strict but ultimately vague rules, and leaves the FCC as the final arbiter of what is and isn\u2019t acceptable, with little to constrain its decisions. The FCC will have some guidelines, of course, but Wheeler\u2019s book-length bureaucratic proposal will surely provide legal ammunition for whatever creative interpretation the agency settles on (or desires) at any given time.\n\nWheeler\u2019s description of how this will play out is flawed but also instructive. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know. We don\u2019t know where things go next,\u201d he said, according to The New York Times. \u201cWe have created a playing field where there are known rules, and the F.C.C. will sit there as a referee and will throw the flag.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, under the standard set by the order, the FCC isn\u2019t enforcing known rules; it is roaming the field making the rules up on the spot. Imagine a game in which the referee was authorized to throw a flag for \u201cunjust\u201d or \u201cunreasonable\u201d conduct any time players attempted a new strategy or innovative style of play. Players might have some general sense of what would trigger a ref\u2019s particular sensibility, but wouldn\u2019t ever know for sure.\n\nAs a result, you\u2019d expect two things to happen: Players would deploy new moves more cautiously, and teams would spend more time pressuring the refs to use their wide discretion to allow certain types of plays\u2014probably while arguing that their opponents\u2019 signature plays were out of bounds.\n\nThis is more or less what to expect in the wake of the FCC\u2019s rules: ISPs will probably invest and innovate more cautiously, knowing that the FCC has veto power over their decisions. And armies of expensive telecom lawyers will spend their days arguing about what, exactly, constitutes \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d in a wide variety of circumstances.\n\nAs telecom analyst Roger Entner told the Times, \u201cTelecom lawyers in Washington popped the corks on the champagne,\u201d when the rules were passed last month. \u201cIt will be at a least a hundred million in billable hours for them. This will go on for a while.\u201d\n\nCritics sometimes describe net neutrality as a government takeover of the Internet. This is in most ways an exaggeration; the Net will remain for the most part privately operated, with competing though heavily regulated firms continuing to own and operate the infrastructure. But though this line is an exaggeration, it has a grain of truth, in that the FCC has now inserted itself in a potentially prominent into the decision-making of these private Internet service providers. ISPs will now need the FCC\u2019s permission, at least tacitly, to innovate and to invest, and they will inevitably make major business decisions with the FCC\u2019s veto power in mind. The agency, and its murky \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard, will be a shadow presence whenever any major move is contemplated. The publication of the FCC\u2019s order, in other words, mostly serves to confirm that the rules will mean whatever the agency wants them to mean.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "New net neutrality rules give the agency veto power over ISP innovations.", "title": "The FCC\u2019s New Internet Rules Put the FCC in Charge of the Internet", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/03/12/the-fccs-new-internet-rules-put-the-fcc", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14261802651792.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New net neutrality rules give the agency veto power over ISP innovations.", "title": "The FCC\u2019s New Internet Rules Put the FCC in Charge of the Internet", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14261802651792.jpg", "creator": "@petersuderman", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-03-12T17:31:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/peter-suderman"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "The publication of the FCC\u2019s order, in other words, mostly serves to confirm that the rules will mean whatever the agency wants them to mean.\nThis is more or less what to expect in the wake of the FCC\u2019s rules: ISPs will probably invest and innovate more cautiously, knowing that the FCC has veto power over their decisions.\nAs telecom analyst Roger Entner told the Times, \u201cTelecom lawyers in Washington popped the corks on the champagne,\u201d when the rules were passed last month.\nAs The New York Times notes today, the FCC is \u201cset to decide what is acceptable on a case-by-case basis.\n\u201cWe have created a playing field where there are known rules, and the F.C.C."}
