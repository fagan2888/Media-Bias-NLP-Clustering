The event was organized by Simon Conway, drive time host on WHO Radio, and Jenifer Bowen, the executive director of Iowa Right to Life.\n\n\u201cOn a beautiful summer day, on the first weekend of the Iowa State Fair, I think (turnout) was remarkable,\u201d Conway told Caffeinated Thoughts.\n\n\u201cWe put together a coalition, this was a coalition. There were some people who really dislike each other who shared a microphone for one reason, and one reason alone because we are united that we have to stop the trafficking in dead baby parts,\u201d Conway added.\n\n\u201cWe are very, very pleased with the turnout (Saturday) for pulling something together, I got a text message from Simon Conway less than a week-and-a-half ago, saying we need to put this rally together, we need everybody to stand together in unity. In a week-and-a-half we pulled together 19 speakers, all on different sides of different issues, and different sides of this issue,\u201d Bowen told Caffeinated Thoughts.\n\n\u201cVery pleased with the results, very pleased with the messaging, I think people left encouraged by the event, they left inspired, hopefully, to go back and do more.
