However, the slopes there don\u2019t open until Nov. 27.\n\nAspen could get about 7 inches, and Telluride could pick up 8 inches, according to the Weather Service.\n\nColorado has enjoyed an extended fall foliage season, which normally peaks between Oct. 5 and Oct. 14, according to the Farmer\u2019s Almanac.\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wind, snow could strip Colorado\u2019s fall foliage this week, forecaster says", "title": "Wind, snow could strip Colorado\u2019s fall foliage this week, forecaster says", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/03/wind-snow-could-strip-colorados-fall-foliage-this-week-forecaster-says/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131103__colorado-fall-weather-foliagep1.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131103__colorado-fall-weather-foliagep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-03T15:33:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:23:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Aspen could get about 7 inches, and Telluride could pick up 8 inches, according to the Weather Service.\nThe mountains, however, could get up to 8 inches, and the northeast plains could see up to 4 inches, according to the forecast.\nSnow chances will linger until Tuesday night, but not much accumulation is expected in the Denver area.\nForecasters expected Steamboat Springs to pick up about 2 inches Sunday night, an inch Monday and up to 4 inches Monday night.\nColorado has enjoyed an extended fall foliage season, which normally peaks between Oct. 5 and Oct. 14, according to the Farmer\u2019s Almanac."}
