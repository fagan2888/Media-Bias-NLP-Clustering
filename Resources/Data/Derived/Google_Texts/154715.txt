A man wearing only his thong in his front yard Saturday is now in the Bay County Jail.

Bay County Deputies arrested 66 year old Paul Francis Nett after a Panama City Beach mother called to complain about his attire.

Apparently she was walking by Nett's home at 105 Dana Way with children when Nett pulled his thong aside and bared all.

Nett was arrested and charged with lewd and lascivious exhibition.
