A bear cub has been wandering around a shopping center parking lot in Parker Sunday evening, officials said.

The cub was spotted in a Wal-Mart and Home Depot parking lot at 11101 South Parker Road around 7:30 p.m. and retreated into nearby Sulphur Gulch once the Department of Wildlife and Parker Police Department officers responded to the scene, said Parker Police Department spokeswoman Sherry Corcoran.

Corcoran said the cub reappeared and is now in a tree behind a UPS Store at 10940 South Parker Road.

The Department of Wildlife is on scene dealing with the bear in the tree, Corcoran said.

Parker Police warned not to approach the cub in case the mother was nearby, although there have been no signs of the mama bear.
