Today, team cohesion is sometimes thought to be threatened by technology: teams are no longer limited to face-to-face meetings thanks to the development of various forms of communication tools, and many question whether or not a group can work effectively in an online setting. A recent study has provided evidence to suggest that teams can work just as well online as they do in person \u2014 as long as they possess one important psychological skill.\n\nAnita Woolley from Carnegie University\u2019s Tepper School of Business recently studied interaction between workers and the influence of the communications on the group\u2019s overall performance. Woolley and her colleague observed the interactions of 68 different teams, some of which worked in an online setting and some of which worked face-to-face.\n\n\u201cOur findings reveal that the same key factors predict collective intelligence in both face-to-face and online teams,\u201d concluded Woollen in a university press release.\n\nCollective intelligence is a term originally developed by Woolley as a way to measure the general effectiveness of a group. The general intelligence of a group is largely unrelated to the intelligence of the individual workers. \u201cFor instance, we found that having a lot of smart people in a group does not necessarily make the group smarter,\u201d explained Woolley.\n\nThe team noted that working in an online setting had little influence on the team\u2019s collective intelligence but did point out one factor which did: the team members' Theory of Mind.\n\nTheory of Mind refers to the ability of an individual to predict the mental states of others. For example, those with a strong Theory of Mind are able to pick up on the emotions, desires, and even motivations behind the actions of others. It is a skill possessed in different degrees by nearly all adults humans and have even been observed in the animal world.\n\nWoolley and her team found a \u201csignificant correlation\u201d between the Theory of Mind of individuals and the collective intelligence of a group. This finding remained true, even in online environments \u2014 which surprised the team because it was originally believed that Theory of Mind was closely tied with the ability to read the facial expressions of others. However, their results suggest that this aspect of social interaction is rooted in other aspects of communication.\n\nThe team hopes that this psychological insight can help give a boost to those in the business world and \u201cgive organizational managers a new tool in predicting the success of online teams.\u201d\n\nSource: Woolley AW, Engel D, Jing LX, et al.
