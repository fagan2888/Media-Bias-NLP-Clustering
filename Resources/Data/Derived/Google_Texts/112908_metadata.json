[In Mrs. Doubtfire-like voice] Hello! I'm running for president. [APPLAUSE] You don't have to. You don't have to.\"\n\nTurning his attention to the Democratic presidential primary field, Fallon brought up former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley as one of the few Democrats who could run alongside Clinton. While the competition for the former First Lady is considered by many to be weak, Fallon provided a note of caution for her:\n\nYeah, Hillary's not worried. I mean, who's going to go from being totally unknown to beating her for the presidency? [ON-SCREEN: Image of President Obama] [LAUGHTER] You know what I'm saying? I mean that's \u2013 how would that ever happen? [APPLAUSE]\n\nThursday\u2019s jokes made about two top figures in the Democratic Party come a day after he went after the Democrats who skipped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nBiden and Clinton weren\u2019t the only figures in the world of politics that he went after in his monologue. Concerning the oral arguments heard on Wednesday concerning the constitutionality of the ObamaCare subsidies, Fallon humorously laid out the scene in terms of where the justices stand [with the punchline being Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg]:\n\nThe Supreme Court spent over an hour listening to arguments on whether ObamaCare is unconstitutional. It's pretty close right now. Looks like four opposed, four in favor, and one asleep and [LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE] \u2013 yeah, [in Ruth Bader Ginsburg-like voice] just taking a little nap. Taking a little power nap.\n\nAdditionally, Fallon mocked a Republican presidential contender on the subject of Clinton\u2019s appearance at the EMILY\u2019s List gala (as he did for Biden): \u201cThen Chris Christie said, \u201cWould you settle for just someone who wears a bra?\u201d [APPLAUSE] And you go, \u201cno, that's not what we're saying Chris, but thank you for asking.\u201d\n\nThe relevant portions of the transcript from NBC\u2019s The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on March 5 are transcribed below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "During his opening monologue on Thursday\u2019s Tonight Show, host Jimmy Fallon made a few jests toward Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and each of their chances of winning the 2016 presidential election.
