WPA noted that \u201cObamacare has seen its public support drop as the unadvertised consequences of the law have become clear. The mandated coverage of drugs that can destroy a human embryo, are just another instance of this.\u201d\n\nFRC President Tony Perkins made the following comments regarding the survey and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision today to accept the Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood cases and decide the fate of Obamacare\u2019s HHS mandate:\n\n\u201cAmericans increasingly oppose this mandate because it puts the jobs, livelihoods, and healthcare of millions of Americans at risk. It forces those who stand up for their conscience to choose between paying crippling fines that could shut down their business or dropping the healthcare of all their employees. This frankly is an unacceptable non-choice.\n\n\u201cRespecting freedom of conscience is a long held American tradition and the government should not impose mandates or laws that force individuals and businesses to violate these beliefs just to hold a job, own a business, or have health insurance.\n\n\u201cThis is a flawed mandate within a flawed law. The reality is that employers may choose to drop healthcare coverage for their employees and their families altogether rather than submit to this intrusive federal mandate.\n\n\u201cAmericans should not be forced to violate their religious beliefs to purchase health insurance, hold a job, or operate a business in their country. Freedom of religion, the American people believe, extends to the freedom to practice your religion in your healthcare plan, as outlined by the First Amendment of the Constitution and illustrated in these poll results.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\n\u201cThe American people are turning their backs not only on this oppressive health care law but also on the law\u2019s mandate that for the first time in American history requires individuals to violate their moral beliefs and require them to pay for items and services they oppose in their health care plans.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Supreme Court has agreed to hear this case, Congress should listen to the American people and act to protect the livelihoods of Americans that are now at risk. Congress must fulfill its constitutional duty to protect employers and individuals who do not want to be punished for standing up for their rights,\u201d concluded Perkins.\n\nTo view the results of the survey, click here: http://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF13K71.pdf", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Poll: 59 Percent Oppose Obamacare's HHS Abortion-Birth Control Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "On the same day the Supreme Court announced it would take Hobby lobby's case to dismantle the HHS mandate that forces religious companies and groups to pay for", "title": "New Poll: 59 Percent Oppose Obamacare\u2019s HHS Abortion-Birth Control Mandate", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2013/11/26/new-poll-59-percent-oppose-obamacares-hhs-abortion-birth-control-mandate/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pichealth39b-190x98.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "poll,obamacare,hhs,mandate,birth control,pro-life", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc69\"", "article_summary": "The poll, conducted by WPA Opinion Research from November 18-20, sought to determine how likely voters feel about Obamacare overall, and their opinion regarding the HHS mandate.\nOn the same day the Supreme Court announced it would take Hobby lobby\u2019s case to dismantle the HHS mandate that forces religious companies and groups to pay for birth control and abortion-causing drugs, two pro-life organizations released a new poll showing 59 percent of Americans oppose the mandate.\nWPA noted that \u201cObamacare has seen its public support drop as the unadvertised consequences of the law have become clear.\nThe reality is that employers may choose to drop healthcare coverage for their employees and their families altogether rather than submit to this intrusive federal mandate.\n\u201cAmericans should not be forced to violate their religious beliefs to purchase health insurance, hold a job, or operate a business in their country."}
