Vice President Biden has tapped Georgetown University professor Colin Kahl as his top national security adviser, the White House said Friday.



Kahl, who worked during the first two years of the Obama administration as the top Middle East adviser in the Middle East, will replace Jake Sullivan, who announced last month he planned to leave the White House.

The vice president has served as the White House's point man for conversations with allied leaders in Ukraine and Iraq.“I’m honored that Colin Kahl will serve as my new National Security Advisor,” Biden said in a statement. “As both a scholar and experienced public servant, Colin has a unique perspective on a number of national security issues that our country faces today, particularly in the Middle East."
