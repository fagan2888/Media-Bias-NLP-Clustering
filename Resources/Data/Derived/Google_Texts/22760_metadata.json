Exercises encourages more mature vessel growth and increases oxygen, he said.\n\n\u201cIt sounds counterintuitive, like why would you want to increase blood vessel growth and oxygen delivery, but it makes the treatments that we give such as chemotherapy and radiation more effective,\u201d Dewhirst said.\n\nExercise is as effective as chemotherapy drugs, but when combined, both are most effective, said Dewhirst, who recommends 75 minutes of intense exercise and 150 minutes of less intensive exercise per week.\n\nPreventing a cancer reoccurrence has motived Holbrook to exercise regularly.\n\n\u201cThe more you exercise you exercise, the less chance of recurrence that you have, and the more weight you lose, the less chance of recurrence you have,\u201d she said.\n\nDuke is now moving forward with human studies on exercise and breast cancer tumors.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-04-02 17:26:34", "description": "A Duke University study recently published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that exercise doubles blood flow and oxygen to tumors, which Dr. Mark Dewhirst, a Duke cancer researcher, says is a good thing.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-04-02 17:26:34", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14556579|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Duke University study recently published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that exercise doubles blood flow and oxygen to tumors, which Dr. Mark Dewhirst, a Duke cancer researcher, says is a good thing.", "title": "Duke study finds exercise helps with treating breast cancer :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/duke-study-finds-exercise-helps-with-treating-breast-cancer/14556579/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2007/08/05/1671842/1671842-1428009223-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-02T17:26:34-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "A Duke University study recently published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that exercise doubles blood flow and oxygen to tumors, which Dr. Mark Dewhirst, a Duke cancer researcher, says is a good thing.", "title": "Duke study finds exercise helps with treating breast cancer :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/duke-study-finds-exercise-helps-with-treating-breast-cancer/14556579/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2007/08/05/1671842/1671842-1428009223-646x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcace9\"", "article_summary": "Duke is now moving forward with human studies on exercise and breast cancer tumors.\nBlood vessel growth in tumors is immature and jumbled, which limits oxygen and shields the tumor from treatments, Dewhirst said.\nA Duke University study recently published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute used mice to find that exercise doubles blood flow and oxygen to tumors, which Dr. Mark Dewhirst, a Duke cancer researcher, says is a good thing.\n\u201cThe more you exercise you exercise, the less chance of recurrence that you have, and the more weight you lose, the less chance of recurrence you have,\u201d she said.\nExercise is as effective as chemotherapy drugs, but when combined, both are most effective, said Dewhirst, who recommends 75 minutes of intense exercise and 150 minutes of less intensive exercise per week."}
