And the \u201cstrong concerns\u201d turned out to be\u2026well, the board asked for even more money. \u201cWe would be amenable to the $50 million as a form of down payment to start this process,\u201d the board wrote. \u201cHowever, the provision of this money is only a first step.\u201d If building 55 \u201cunits\u201d of affordable housing costs more, \u201cthen Collegiate must be held responsible for providing the balance of the funding required.\u201d (Though if the housing comes in for less than $50 million, there\u2019s no refund to Collegiate.)\n\nThe longer it takes to build the \u201caffordable\u201d apartments, and the farther away they are from the site of the new school building, the more money, in addition to $50 million, that the community board\u2014a city government body\u2014demands.\n\nJust to put this in context, the Collegiate School\u2019s entire endowment, according to its website, is $77 million. On a percentage of endowment basis, that\u2019s as if Columbia University came to the city asking to expand its campus, and the city asked the university for $6 billion to fund city courthouses, libraries, playgrounds, and prisons as \u201ca first step.\u201d\n\nEven as a percentage of the overall Collegiate building project, the $50 million affordable housing contribution is staggering. The school sold its old site for $97 million, and the new building, on West 62nd St., will cost about $118 million, according to a report in the Daily News.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that each of the Collegiate School\u2019s 653 students (or their parents) will now have to pay an affordable housing fee of $76,570 in addition to tuition. That\u2019s $50 million divided by 653. If the Community Board\u2019s warning that $50 million is just a \u201cdown payment\u201d holds true, the Collegiate families could be on the hook for untold more.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if the independent school isn\u2019t already providing a service to the city. Its teachers and other employees pay taxes, as do its parents and alumni. By educating the students at private expense, Collegiate is relieving the city\u2019s public schools, and the taxpayers, of a cost of more than $10 million a year.\n\nIt\u2019s not that \u201caffordable\u201d housing isn\u2019t a worthy cause. But why not pursue it by some more logical means? Consider, say, eliminating the rent stabilization and control laws that keep elderly widows and widowers hanging on to cheap three-bedroom apartments. What about reviewing the landmark historic district laws that restrict new construction in vast swathes of the city? Or how about reconsidering obsolete building codes and comparable-wage laws that drive up the cost of construction? Holding up new projects with unreasonable demands on an ad hoc basis is no way to add affordable housing to the city, unless the point is to render New York so hostile to private institutions that anyone who cares about them, or about a rule of law, is driven elsewhere, making New York housing affordable in the style of contemporary Detroit.\n\nIf you think I am exaggerating, consider that the framework of \u201cexit, voice and loyalty\u201d outlined by the economist Albert Hirschman\u2014and much in the news lately in the context of European Jewry\u2014isn\u2019t exactly new to Collegiate, which was founded centuries ago by Dutch Protestants who left the Netherlands by ship for New Amsterdam, which became New York, and eventually part of a new country, the United States of America.\n\nFor $50 million, one could reprise the journey by endowing a high-speed water-ferry service to a Collegiate campus outside of Mayor de Blasio\u2019s jurisdiction. Collegiate is the sort of durable institution that makes people loyal to New York and deters them from taking the \u201cexit\u201d option of packing their bags and going somewhere else. But even loyalty has its limits, a point that city officials just might want to remember as they go about trying to wring ever more dollars from Collegiate and the backers of other institutions trying to build in New York.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The latest economic nonsense from the mayor of New York City.", "title": "Bill De Blasio's Affordable Housing Shakedown", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/03/16/bill-de-blasios-affordable-housing-shake", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14265353565498.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14265353565498.jpg", "description": "The latest economic nonsense from the mayor of New York City.", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Bill De Blasio's Affordable Housing Shakedown"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-03-16T20:30:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ira-stoll"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccccf\"", "article_summary": "Alas, this isn\u2019t a sane world; it\u2019s Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s New York City.\nThe price of getting a new private school building built in Manhattan these days apparently includes a payoff of $50 million for \u201caffordable\u201d housing.\nIt\u2019s not that \u201caffordable\u201d housing isn\u2019t a worthy cause.\n\u201cWe would be amenable to the $50 million as a form of down payment to start this process,\u201d the board wrote.\nIn a letter issued earlier this month, the Manhattan community board with jurisdiction over the construction site expressed \u201cstrong concerns\u201d about the $50 million payoff."}
