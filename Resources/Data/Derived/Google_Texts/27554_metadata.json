They were limited in Monday\u2019s practice as a concession to an undisclosed medical issue that surfaced last Thursday. They required medical attention and returned to Denver last Saturday, delayed by a day because they didn\u2019t have proper identification to travel.\n\nOffensive guard Ben Garland missed his second consecutive practice with a minor ankle injury. He suffered the injury last Thursday against the Cowboys.\n\nHillman and Webster create depth at critical positions. Hillman figures to see plenty of snaps as Montee Ball\u2019s backup. Ball played one series in the preseason because of an appendectomy, so it\u2019s unrealistic to think he won\u2019t be spelled against the Colts. Webster functions as a top corner in nickel packages. He lost traction, however, in the preseason, suffering a sprained ankle followed by missing Thursday\u2019s game with his illness. He required help from a teammate to leave the locker room in Dallas after the game.\n\nWebster and rookie Bradley Roby are the Broncos\u2019 top reserve cornerbacks behind Aqib Talib and Chris Harris, who likely will need rest while playing his first game since Jan. 12 after tearing the ACL in his left knee.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ben Garland,Kayvon Webster,Ronnie Hillman", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Ronnie Hillman and Kayvon Webster inched toward availability for the season opener, participating in individual drills on Wednesday.", "title": "Ronnie Hillman, Kayvon Webster at Broncos practice; Ben Garland out", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/09/03/ronnie-hillman-kayvon-webster-particpating-practice-ben-garland-sidelined/29212/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/09/Bgarland090314wp.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Ronnie Hillman and Kayvon Webster inched toward availability for the season opener, participating in individual drills on Wednesday.", "title": "Ronnie Hillman, Kayvon Webster particpating at practice; Ben Garland sidelined", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/09/03/ronnie-hillman-kayvon-webster-particpating-practice-ben-garland-sidelined/29212/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/09/Bgarland090314wp.jpg", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Ronnie Hillman and Kayvon Webster inched toward availability for the season opener, participating in individual drills on Wednesday."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d36\"", "article_summary": "Offensive guard Ben Garland missed his second consecutive practice with a minor ankle injury.\nRonnie Hillman and Kayvon Webster inched toward availability for the season opener, participating in individual drills on Wednesday.\nThey required medical attention and returned to Denver last Saturday, delayed by a day because they didn\u2019t have proper identification to travel.\nThey were limited in Monday\u2019s practice as a concession to an undisclosed medical issue that surfaced last Thursday.\nHillman and Webster create depth at critical positions."}
