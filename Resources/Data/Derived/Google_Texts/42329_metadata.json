As part of the expansion initiative, SCL Health entered into a joint venture agreement with Emerus, a nationally recognized innovator in the delivery of efficient medical care, to build and manage these smaller inpatient facilities.\n\nThe new smaller community hospitals will offer the same high quality services including emergency medical care, inpatient care, surgical procedures and other comprehensive health services that are found throughout SCL Health's larger campus facilities. Furthermore, each location will feature on-site diagnostics, such as a laboratory and radiology services such as X-ray, CT scan and ultrasound capabilities. The new facilities will be equipped to respond to almost any medical issue, including those that may be life threatening and require complex, critical care or surgical intervention.\n\n\"We are evolving our health ministry to best meet the needs of our patients where they live, work and play,\" said Michael Slubowski, FACHE, FACMPE, president and CEO of SCL Health System. \"By placing access to care closer to our patients, we are extending our quality, compassionate care beyond our hospital doors and deeper into our communities.\"\n\n\"We are honored to partner with SCL Health System as they begin to expand their footprint throughout the Denver metro area. As we see changes coming under the Affordable Care Act, SCL Health's strategy represents a new, innovative approach to providing quality, accessible medicine,\" said Dr. Toby Hamilton, MD, FACEP, and CEO of Emerus. \"The evolution that is taking place at SCL Health will position them as the region's cutting-edge leader in the delivery of efficient, cost effective, community-based health care.\"\n\nThe hospitals will be staffed by board-certified physicians, experienced nurses and other clinical specialists dedicated to providing the same level of compassionate, patient-focused care found at SCL Health System's existing Denver area hospitals. These hospitals include: Exempla Good Samaritan Medical Center in Lafayette, Exempla Lutheran Medical Center in Wheat Ridge and Exempla Saint Joseph Hospital in Denver. All of the new community hospitals will operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, offering patients the highest level of care and convenience close to home.\n\nConstruction is expected to begin next year with the first community hospital projected to open in the last quarter of 2014 in Westminster, Colo. The initiative is expected to create more than 200 permanent, new jobs in the Denver area.\n\nABOUT SCL HEALTH SYSTEM\n\nSCL Health System (SCLHS) is a faith-based, nonprofit health care organization that operates nine hospitals, four safety net clinics, one children's mental health center and more than 190 ambulatory service centers in four states \u2014 Colorado, Kansas, Montana and California.
