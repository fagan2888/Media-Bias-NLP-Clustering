Christie, who dropped out of the race following the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9, said Trump \u201cwill do exactly what needs to be done to make America a leader around the world again,\u201d at a joint press conference with the New York businessman.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Christie eventually lined up with the Trump campaign. Both men are loud, northeastern, urban, populist Republicans who appeal to conservative white ethnics, union members, and other blue collar voters.\n\nBoth have relatively liberal instincts on social policy, at least on health care and pensions. As governor of New Jersey, Christie expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act; meanwhile, Trump doubled down on his promise to \u201cnot let Americans die in the streets\u201d due to a lack of health care during the Feb. 26 debate.\n\nBoth, of course, have been heavily criticized for their \u201cbullying\u201d public presence, and embrace traditional displays of masculinity. Each man has suggested that various ideological opponents could do with a \u201cpunch in the face.\u201d\n\nAnd despite protestations to the contrary, neither man is overtly religious.\n\n\u201cI heard this from a media member before,\u201d Christie said during a press conference ahead of his doomed New Hampshire campaign. \u201cThey think the fight between me and Donald Trump would be King Kong vs. Godzilla. And quite frankly, I don\u2019t know which one I am.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the New Jersey governor argued why Trump\u2014never mentioned by name but clearly the target of Christie\u2019s remarks\u2014 should not be president\n\n\u201cShowtime is over. We are not electing an entertainer in chief,\u201d he said in a high-profile speech. \u201cShowmanship is fun, but it is not the kind of leadership that will change America.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Jersey governor Chris Christie has endorsed Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.
