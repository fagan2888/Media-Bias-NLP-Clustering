One professor actually called McCue (who is a minority) a racist in front of a lecture hall full of students.\n\nIn fact, every school year the national media is inundated with stories of liberal bias from campuses around the nation. Whether professors are railing against free enterprise, teaching students wildly inaccurate lessons on President Reagan, or just telling young people \u201cit\u2019s okay to hate\u201d conservatives, leftist educators seem to be getting more biased every year.\n\nThese experiences have left conservative students, like Lauren McCue, desperate for arguments to use when professors attempt to slip these progressive clich\u00e9s into lectures without being challenged.\n\n\u201cThe situation on my campus has gotten so bad, I\u2019m spending my summer break learning how to defend conservative values from professors who routinely trash them in class,\u201d McCue said.\n\nOne way she plans to prepare: Reading Excuse Me, Professor, a new book released this month by Young America\u2019s Foundation and the Foundation for Economic Education.\n\nThe book tackles 52 clich\u00e9s of progressivism that students are most likely to encounter in their college classrooms and debunks them with quick and easy-to-understand essays. Clich\u00e9s addressed by the book include everything from, \u201cThe Minimum Wage Helps the Poor,\u201d to \u201cStatistical Disparities Between Races Prove Discrimination,\u201d to \u201cFree Markets Exploit Women.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are arguments I hear all of the time from my professors and peers,\u201d said McCue. \u201cI need to have the right arguments on the tip of my tongue to combat these myths that are being pushed on students.\u201d\n\nLawrence W. Reed, president of the Foundation for Economic Education and the book\u2019s editor, said, \u201cCollege students today are regularly taught incomplete or even skewed accounts of history, economics, and the role of government in a free society.\u201d\n\nReed continued, \u201cExcuse Me, Professor debunks the myths and half-truths taught in many classrooms, allowing curious students to erect intellectual immune systems to guard against insidious progressive indoctrination.\u201d\n\nEven if your students\u2019 back-to-school shopping carts are overflowing with Ramen noodles and mechanical pencils, they won\u2019t be fully prepared for the fall semester until they\u2019re able to recognize and argue against the progressive clich\u00e9s they are sure to encounter on their campuses.\n\n\u201cI know this is the one time of year I don\u2019t have homework and I should be relaxing, but I need to be ready to defend my values and beliefs this fall,\u201d said McCue. \u201cI can always read on the beach.\u201d\n\nJashinsky is the program officer at Young America\u2019s Foundation, the principal outreach organization of the Conservative Movement committed to America\u2019s youth.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Every school year the national media is inundated with stories of liberal bias from campuses around the nation.", "description": "Every school year the national media is inundated with stories of liberal bias from campuses around the nation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Every school year the national media is inundated with stories of liberal bias from campuses around the nation.", "title": "Back to bias", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/248279-back-to-bias", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/248279-back-to-bias", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-17T11:30-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Emily Jashinsky", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-17T11:30:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/248279-back-to-bias", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Every school year the national media is inundated with stories of liberal bias from campuses around the nation.", "card": "summary", "title": "Back to bias"}, "dcterms.title": "Back to bias"}, "article_summary": "In fact, every school year the national media is inundated with stories of liberal bias from campuses around the nation.\nThis year, students across the country are adding a new school supply to their lists\u2014intellectual ammunition against their progressive professors.\nOne professor actually called McCue (who is a minority) a racist in front of a lecture hall full of students.\nThese experiences have left conservative students, like Lauren McCue, desperate for arguments to use when professors attempt to slip these progressive clich\u00e9s into lectures without being challenged.\nOne way she plans to prepare: Reading Excuse Me, Professor, a new book released this month by Young America\u2019s Foundation and the Foundation for Economic Education."}
