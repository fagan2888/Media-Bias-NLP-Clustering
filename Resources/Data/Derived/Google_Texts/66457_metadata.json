She said the volume of people coming to the site \u201ccaused some problems but it also exposed some additional problems.\u201d\n\nSebelius would not answer questions about reports of prelaunch testing that may have signaled problems with the site before it opened to the public, nor would she give specifics on how many people have signed up for health insurance through the HealthCare.gov portal. \u201cWhat we can tell you is that thousands of people have signed up,\u201d she said, offering that more than half a million accounts have been created on the site. She declined to say if there is a possibility that the individual mandate requiring Americans to buy insurance or face a penalty might be postponed because of the technical problems many have faced in purchasing insurance through the federal Web portal.\n\nSebelius said the President was not aware of glitches on the site until after the Oct. 1 launch. She would not say if she had discussed calls for her resignation with the President.\n\n\u201cWe have a product and the product really works.
