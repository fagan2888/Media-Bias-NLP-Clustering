NIU’s student health insurance cost will increase from $744 per semester to $1,052 in Fiscal Year 2016 — pending Board of Trustees approval — because of the addition of benefits in accordance with the Affordable Care Act.

Here’s a look at those benefits:

• Lab services

• Outpatient care

• Hospitalizations

• Maternity services

• Emergency services

• Pediatric services

• Rehabilitation services

• Prescription drugs (full coverage)

• Preventive wellness and chronic disease treatment

• Mental health and substance use disorder services

NIU will soon try to negotiate a lower cost with provider Academic HealthPlans, said Eric Weldy, vice president of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management. The university was able to negotiate a $15 decrease from Fiscal year 2015’s $759 semester premium.

The Board of Trustees will vote on whether to approve the cost increase at its March 12 meeting.
