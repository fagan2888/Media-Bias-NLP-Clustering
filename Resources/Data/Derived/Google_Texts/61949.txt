George Will is tired of Donald Trump‘s fake presidential runs, and on Fox News today he said he really hope Trump does run so we can all watch him crash and burn.

Bret Baier asked all three Special Report panelists to place their bets in the “candidate casino” on the odds of which candidates will get their respective party’s nominations. Will threw most of his chips (a total of $100) at Scott Walker and Jeb Bush, with enough left over for Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, John Kasich, and Bobby Jindal.

And then Will said this:

“One dollar on Donald Trump in the hope that he will be tempted to run, be predictably shellacked, and we will be spared evermore this quadrennial charade of his.”

In a totally unrelated story, Trump today quote-tweeted a follower’s message that Hillary Clinton “can’t satisfy her husband” before quickly taking it down.
