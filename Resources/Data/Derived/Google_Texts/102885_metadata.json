Chris Christie has repeatedly made in recent weeks \u2014 yet which no one really seems to have noticed.\n\nHe wants to end federal flood insurance.\n\nNew Jersey is home to 243,649 property owners who get their flood insurance through the FEMA-run National Flood Insurance Program, a number expected to grow as maps are updated, widening the flood zones where banks require coverage.\n\nAmid widespread complaints by Hurricane Sandy victims over lower-than-expected damage settlements, Christie has repeatedly \u2014 and in classic Christie fashion \u2014 said the federal government should stop selling flood insurance to them.\n\n\u201cFEMA is the new F-word,\u201d he told a crowd at a Port Monmouth town hall meeting last month.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has to get out of the flood insurance business,\u201d he told a crowd in Berkeley Township two weeks later. \u201cIt\u2019s no good at it.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s got an excellent point.\n\nAnd the crowds in Monmouth and Ocean counties \u2014 both heavily Republican areas devastated by Hurricane Sandy flooding \u2014 cheered wildly when he said it.\n\nI, however, stood there slack-jawed in amazement.\n\nThis was a display of political cognitive dissonance rivaled only by the infamous South Carolinian who five years ago implored U.S. Rep. Robert Inglis, \u201cKeep your government hands off my Medicare.\u201d\n\nSee, the federal government is the only entity that offers flood insurance. Why? Because private companies long ago concluded the risk of insuring properties near the water was too high. Insuring houses built on filled-in salt marshes is something so illogical only the government can be called on to do it.\n\nWhat those crowds might be cheering for, in the end, is their own move to the hills of Bergen County.\n\nThat retreat from the Shore, as environmentalists and libertarians have been telling us for years, might be the most sensible option.\n\nBut for middle- and working-class families and businesses \u2014 and the very character of the Jersey Shore and cities such as Hoboken and Jersey City \u2014 it would be devastating.\n\nSo what would Christie replace the NFIP with? So far, he\u2019s not saying. His office did not return repeated phone calls after his town hall statements.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons folks would cheer NFIP\u2019s demise. Environmentalists have argued for years that the program encourages building in areas that should never have been developed. Fiscal conservatives say inland taxpayers should not be subsidizing people who choose to live in areas likely to flood.\n\nBy all accounts, NFIP is in bad shape. Largely self-sustaining from its creation in 1969 through the mid 1990s, it has racked up $24 billion in debt in the wake of storms such as Hurricane Katrina and Sandy.\n\nTWOFOLD PROBLEM\n\nWalk through the streets of Sandy-ravaged areas of New Jersey and the most common complaint you hear is that flood insurance settlements almost never come close to covering the cost of rebuilding.\n\nScott Knowles, a history professor at Drexel University and author of \u201cThe Disaster Experts: Mastering Risk in Modern America\u201d (University of Pennsylvania, 2013), said where the NFIP has fallen down is not in shortchanging victims after the storm \u2014 but by failing to keep them out of harm\u2019s way in the first place.\n\nThe subsidized flood insurance rates were designed to be coupled with strict flood-plain management practices: towns limiting development and requiring buildings to be elevated; FEMA revising flood maps with the latest science; and the real estate industry being cutthroat about everyone being insured.\n\nDue to FEMA budget shortfalls and pressure from the real estate and development industries, much of NFIP\u2019s enforcement fell by the wayside, Knowles said. But the subsidies rolled on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s politically expedient to claim that it\u2019s big government\u2019s fault that Sandy relief hasn\u2019t worked out,\u201d Knowles said. \u201cBut it\u2019s much more complicated than that.\u201d\n\nThe most common idea floated by NFIP abolitionists is to open the flood market to private insurers.\n\nGOING PRIVATE?\n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to find an expert who believes that private flood insurance, lacking the NFIP\u2019s subsidies, wouldn\u2019t be far more expensive. A 100 percent private insurance market would transform the Jersey Shore into a place only the truly wealthy could afford.\n\n\u201cNFIP is really about covering the average Joe \u2014 lower- to middle-class property owners\u201d said Nicholas Pinter, a geology professor at Southern Illinois University.\n\nIf Sandy victims feel like they\u2019re being nickel-and-dimed by FEMA in their settlement, they\u2019d likely find the going even tougher against a company that needs to turn a profit \u2014 and can\u2019t turn to taxpayers when it runs into the red.\n\n\u201cI guess if I were to try and find some sympathy for the governor\u2019s view,\u201d Knowles said, \u201cit\u2019s that we do need to reform the program so that the premiums people pay reflect the actual risk.\u201d\n\nThat, however, is precisely the last thing the cheering crowds in Monmouth and Ocean counties want.\n\nOn Friday, President Obama signed bipartisan legislation that scales back premium increases meant to stabilize the NFIP.\n\nThe bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), rolls back changes made in the 2012 Biggert-Waters Act that withdrew subsidies for homes built up to code but later found to be in flood-prone areas.\n\nMenendez was spurred into action by grassroots groups such as Toms River-based Stop FEMA Now, which rode a wave of outrage by home\u00adown\u00aders fearing that higher premiums under Biggert-Waters would drive them from their homes. What the home\u00adown\u00aders who flocked to Stop FEMA Now really wanted, it seems, was to stop FEMA from halting their subsidies.\n\nNO REAL SOLUTION\n\nYet, even now, after a massive victory that ensures the continuation of NFIP subsidies that will keep him in his home, Stop FEMA Now founder George Kosimos holds fast to Christie\u2019s idea that the program should one day be wiped out forever.\n\nFrom Kosimos\u2019 front yard, in a lagoon community built on a filled-in former salt marsh, it\u2019s hard to imagine private insurance agents doing anything but hitting the dead end, turning around and hightailing it out of there. Or at least requiring him to raise his house even higher than FEMA wanted him to raise it.\n\nHe points to other models he said make sense, such as the state-administered cooperative run by California for earthquake insurance.\n\nAnother option, Kosimos said, is for private insurers to step in and begin issuing policies, with the federal government as a \u201cbackstop\u201d to bail them out with loans after disasters, as it did after the failure of insurance giant AIG in the 2008 crash.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll pay it back with interest like all those companies did,\u201d he said of the AIG bailouts.\n\nThat hardly seems like an ideal solution.\n\nRailing against the system might sound great, until you try to actually replace it with a new one. And, as Pinter said, if we want to build homes in places Mother Ocean thinks are hers, there will never be a perfect system.\n\n\u201cThere is widespread frustration out there, but what I would suggest is it is largely misplaced,\u2019\u2019 the Southern Illinois professor said. \u201cWhat people are dealing with is the frustration of dealing with flooding. These are limits imposed by nature.\u201d\n\nBrian Donohue is host/producer of Ledger Live, a Star-Ledger video blog at NJ.com/ledgerlive.
