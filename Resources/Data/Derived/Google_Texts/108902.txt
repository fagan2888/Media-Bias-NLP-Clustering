Will Ferrell, an Olympic gold medalist in the sport of making people laugh, appeared on “The Tonight Show” Thursday night to debut his impressive figure skating/prancing routine. Donning a spandex butler outfit, Ferrell swayed and skipped and twirled to the airy “Downton Abbey” theme song.

“Are you Carson [the butler]?” asked host Jimmy Fallon, regarding the period drama. “I don’t know, I’ve never seen the show,” Ferrell deadpanned.

Though whimsical, the routine was arguably far less controversial than Russia’s recent gold medal in women’s figure skating.
