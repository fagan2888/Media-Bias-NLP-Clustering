Burwell announced 16.4 million uninsured people have gained health care coverage since the passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the largest reduction of the uninsured in 40 years.\n\nLast week, government data indicated that as of Feb. 22, 28,127 Delaware County residents had enrolled in federal Health Insurance Marketplace plans, said Julia Cusick, spokesperson for Enroll America, a nonprofit coalition aimed at getting Americans enrolled in and retaining health care coverage. However a McKinsey report issued in March showed that 41 percent of the uninsured were unaware of the fine, which means that there are still a lot of people throughout the state who can still benefit from this tax filing special-enrollment period, she noted.\n\nAlthough the deadline for the second enrollment was Feb. 15, Health and Human Services officials extended it to April 30.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe penalty for not having health insurance in 2014 was 1 percent of an individual\u2019s yearly household income or $95 per adult and $47.50 per child under 18, whichever is higher. The maximum penalty per family is $285.\n\nThe penalty for not having health care coverage in 2015 will be 2 percent of an individual\u2019s annual household income or $325 per adult and $162.50 per child, whichever is higher. The maximum penalty per household is $975. Individuals without health insurance can avoid the 2015 penalty by acquiring health insurance during the extended enrollment period that ends April 30.\n\nCusick noted many consumers in search of health insurance don\u2019t realize financial help is available.\n\nAssistance in navigating the marketplace is still available at Crozer-Keystone Health System\u2019s five hospitals and through ChesPenn Health Services at its Chester, Upper Darby and Coatesville, Chester County offices. Local counselors can also be located through the Pennsylvania Health Access Network helpline at 1-877-570-3642 or accessing http://www.getcoveredamerica.org/connector. Assistance is also available by going online to HealthCare.gov or calling the marketplace hotline at 1-800-318-2596.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf is also dismantling former Gov. Tom Corbett\u2019s Healthy PA plan and accepting federal Medicaid Expansion funds to provide health insurance for an estimated 300,000 working Pennsylvanians who earn too much for traditional Medical Assistance but not enough to purchase insurance through the marketplace. Wolf assured those already enrolled in Healthy PA that they will be transitioned to the simpler, less restrictive program.\n\nAttorney General Kathleen Kane announced that a court ruling will prevent about $126 million from being reduced from annual payments made to Pennsylvania from the 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, the result of tobacco-related lawsuits in the 1990s regarding the states\u2019 incurrence of health care costs for tobacco-related illnesses.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s decision ensures Pennsylvania receives the funding its needs to forward the important goals of smoking cessation and to invest in medical research and health programs,\u201d said Kane.\n\nUp until 2011, the bulk of Pennsylvania\u2019s tobacco settlement funding went to adultBasic, which was established by law in June 2001 to provide health insurance for low-income state residents ages 19 through 64. It was built on the investment of the state\u2019s tobacco settlement from which Pennsylvania expected to receive $11 billion, or $400 million annually, over 25 years. But the demand outpaced the funding, which was supplemented by heath reinvestment funds from four Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans. By January 2011, the adultBasic program covered 41,953 state residents. The waiting list included 478,735 Pennsylvanians.\n\nIn 2011, Corbett allowed funding for adultBasic to expire leaving working Pennsylvanians who couldn\u2019t afford health insurance, in the lurch.\n\nNow, the working poor are finally getting a break.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Opinion, Opinion news, West Chester Opinion news, PA Opinion news, US Opinion news, world Opinion news.", "title": "Working poor finally get health insurance break", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailylocal.com/article/DL/20150412/LOCAL1/150419946", "image": {"width": "1958px", "identifier": "http://local.dailylocal.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailylocal.png?052016", "height": "1025px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Working poor finally get health insurance break"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailylocal.com", "description": "As we approach the 11th hour for filing income taxes, it is important to note that the deadline for avoiding a fine on 2016 taxes for lack of health insurance is only two weeks away.", "title": "Working poor finally get health insurance break", "url": "http://www.dailylocal.com/article/DL/20150412/LOCAL1/150419946", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailylocal.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailylocal.png?052016"}, "site": "@wcdailylocal", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563329788", "iphone": "id525116294", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.dailylocalnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Opinion, Opinion news, West Chester Opinion news, PA Opinion news, US Opinion news, world Opinion news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "As we approach the 11th hour for filing income taxes, it is important to note that the deadline for avoiding a fine on 2016 taxes for lack of health insurance is only two weeks away."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0991\"", "article_summary": "Individuals without health insurance can avoid the 2015 penalty by acquiring health insurance during the extended enrollment period that ends April 30.\nIn 2011, Corbett allowed funding for adultBasic to expire leaving working Pennsylvanians who couldn\u2019t afford health insurance, in the lurch.\nCusick noted many consumers in search of health insurance don\u2019t realize financial help is available.\nLocal counselors can also be located through the Pennsylvania Health Access Network helpline at 1-877-570-3642 or accessing http://www.getcoveredamerica.org/connector.\nLast week, government data indicated that as of Feb. 22, 28,127 Delaware County residents had enrolled in federal Health Insurance Marketplace plans, said Julia Cusick, spokesperson for Enroll America, a nonprofit coalition aimed at getting Americans enrolled in and retaining health care coverage."}
