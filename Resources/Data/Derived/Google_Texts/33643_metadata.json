It\u2019s Monday evening here in Washington and it\u2019s gearing up to be a busy week with only a few days for lawmakers to avoid a government shutdown. http://bit.ly/1locQaL\n\nHere\u2019s the latest.\n\nTHE BIG STORY\n\nHouse lawmakers voted Monday to ban plastic microbeads from bath products like soaps and body washes.\n\nThe bill, introduced by Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) earlier this year in an effort to protect the nation's lakes and streams from piling up with the little pieces of plastic, passed by a voice vote.\n\nBecause the beads, which are often used to exfoliate the skin, are less than five millimeters in size, they escape water filtration systems and end up in bodies of water where they are mistaken as food by fish and wildlife.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSimply put, microbeads are causing mega-problems,\u201d said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.). \"Once they\u2019re flushed down the drain, that\u2019s when the problem really begins.\"\n\n\"We must put a stop to this unnecessary and avoidable pollution,\" added Pallone, the ranking Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe bill would preempt states from issuing their own laws to regulate microbeads. Last month, Pallone said the provision was added because the federal law would phase out products faster than any state law now in place.\n\nThe legislation applies to any non-prescription rinse-off cosmetics, including toothpaste.\n\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC) praised the House for passing the legislation Monday.\n\n\u201cPlastics play a vital role in our economy\u2014from helping build and maintain homes to advancing new technologies,\u201d the industry group said. \"H.R. 1321 is an important step to ensure we have one sensible, national standard for phasing out the use of solid plastic microbeads in personal care products across America.\"\n\nCristina Marcos contributed to this report.\n\nON TAP FOR TUESDAY\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights will hold a hearing to examine the AB InBev/SABMiller merger and the state of competition in the beer industry. http://1.usa.gov/1XGcbSM\n\nThe Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will hold a hearing to examine opioid abuse in America. http://1.usa.gov/1NvkoCR\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hold a hearing to examine the stream protection rule. http://1.usa.gov/1IAzy9q\n\nThe House Science, Space and Technology\u2019s Subcommittee on Research and Technology will hold a hearing to discuss the future of biotechnology. http://1.usa.gov/1QZDOlC\n\nTOMORROW\u2019S REGS TODAY\n\nThe Obama administration will publish 132 new regulations, proposed rules, notices and other administrative actions in Tuesday\u2019s edition of the Federal Register.\n\n--The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) will issue a final rule to remove the Modoc sucker from the federal list of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.
