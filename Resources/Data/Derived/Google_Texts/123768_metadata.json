M.B. Brady St., will open two exhibits in conjunction with First Friday. One is \u201cHarmless,\u201d a video installation by University of Arkansas art instructor John Kelley that deconstructs the familiar story structure of film to, Kelley\u2019s words, \u201ccreate works that live between narrative and abstraction.\u201d\n\nThe other exhibit, curated by Living Arts director Steve Liggett, is titled \u201cChandeliers and Other Luminous Objects.\u201d\n\nThirty-six Oklahoma artists were challenged to take the basic form of the chandelier \u2014 a branched, decorative fixture designed to hold a number of illuminating objects that is suspended from a ceiling \u2014 and use it to explore the whole concept of light.\n\nThe works included in the exhibit range from ceiling, wall and floor-mounted objects, to pieces that will be incorporated into a dance work by Rachel Bruce Johnson that will be performed during the First Friday event.\n\n\u201cChandeliers\u201d will be on display through Sept. 25.\n\nTulsa artist John Bryant, one of the seven artists featured in a recent Tulsa World Weekend cover story, will open his exhibit, \u201cAn Exhortation and a Revelation,\u201d at the TAC Gallery Friday.\n\nOf his work, Bryant said, \u201cMy artistic practice is driven by two intertwined desires: the need to make things, and the impulse to use the things I have crafted to communicate.\n\n\u201cArt is a chance to get inside someone\u2019s head, for an image I\u2019ve made, or a situation I\u2019ve created, to change someone, to persuade them to see things my way, to see or feel differently than they have before.\u201d\n\nBryant\u2019s exhibit will be on display through Aug. 30.\n\nMost galleries and shops in the Brady Arts District will be open to 9 p.m. Friday, with the restaurants and bars staying open later.\n\nFor more information: thebradyartsdistrict.com\n\nTULSA COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\n\u2018The Little Mermaid Jr.\u2019\n\nTulsa Community College will present its first Tulsa Children\u2019s Summer Theater program, when it performs Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Little Mermaid Jr.,\u201d this week at the VanTrease PACE.\n\nMark Frank, director of TCC\u2019s Theater Department, said, \u201cThere is something magical about a child getting to sing and act on stage, and there are so many benefits to help them develop as young adults.\n\n\u201cWe let the children explore their creative minds on stage, learn movement and characterization, and have seen terrific results as children flourish and gain self-confidence,\u201d Frank said.\n\nThe cast for this stage musical adaptation of the popular animated film is made up of 40 area youngsters ages 5 to 14, selected from auditions.\n\nThe show itself is a version designed especially for young performers.\n\nProceeds from ticket sales will go toward theater scholarships for TCC students.\n\nPerformances: 7 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday, 2 p.m. Aug. 3, at the VanTrease PACE, 10300 E. 81st St.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "\u201cShe Kills Monsters,\u201d which uses the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons as a starting point for a story about sisterhood, identity and dealing with all sorts of demons, will return to the ATC Studios for three additional performances.", "title": "Arts Scene: \"She Kills Monsters\"", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/artsandentertainment/arts-scene-she-kills-monsters/article_ed428f80-fccc-5d5a-bc98-ba4c4e8236eb.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/31/63159311-4441-54b3-aeb4-f9c3c2772cf7/53d8066f5e378.preview-500.jpg?resize=421%2C630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@WatzWorld"}, "description": "\u201cShe Kills Monsters,\u201d which uses the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons &amp; Dragons as a starting point for a story about sisterhood, identity and dealing with all sorts of demons, will return to the ATC Studios for three additional performances.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "artsandentertainment,jamesdwattsjr,scene", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/jamesdwattsjr"}, "news_keywords": "artsandentertainment,jamesdwattsjr,scene"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2985\"", "article_summary": "Most galleries and shops in the Brady Arts District will be open to 9 p.m. Friday, with the restaurants and bars staying open later.\nAmerican Theatre Company debuted its production of Qui Nguyen\u2019s play earlier this month at the company\u2019s new headquarters, ATC Studios.\nLiving Arts of Tulsa, 307 E.
