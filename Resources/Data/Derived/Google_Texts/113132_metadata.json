To reduce what Medicare has to pay for seniors\u2019 healthcare, the Obama administration is paying bonuses to the hospitals that spend the least per senior.The result? Hundreds of hospitals are skimping on care to win bonuses, and seniors are dying needlessly.Seniors at these hospitals aren\u2019t getting the right antibiotic or other treatments they need. They\u2019re dying from pneumonia, heart attacks and heart failure at higher rates than patients in other hospitals that provide more care.So much for Obama\u2019s promise that cutting Medicare wouldn\u2019t harm seniors.News of the deaths at low spending hospitals,in Health Affairs, comes just as GOP front runner Donald Trump meets with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Medicare cuts are on the long list of policy disagreements between the two Republicans.Trump pledges not to cut Medicare. Ryan and GOP members of Congress are pushing to repeal Obamacare but want to keep Obama\u2019s Medicare cuts. Trump is right on this one.The report found that 231 hospitals rewarded with Medicare bonuses for low spending per senior provide inferior care. Seniors having heart attacks wait too long for angioplasties, for example.They\u2019re dying when they would survive at a higher-spending hospital.Sec. 3001 of The Affordable Care Act claims to tie these bonuses to \u201cquality\u201d but hospitals can win the most points \u2014 and biggest Medicare bonuses \u2014 by spending the least. Never mind who perishes.The fallout from this scheme was predictable.Would you send your child to the school that spends the least per pupil? Of course not. Would you take your beloved pet to the vet that spends the least per animal? No way. So why would you take your grandma to the hospital that spends the least per senior?The Obama administration was warned that rewarding low spending hospitals could be dangerous to seniors\u2019 health. Reports in theCirculation and in the Archives of Internal Medicinemore deaths at low spending hospitals.In fact, 17,822 seniors who died over four years in the lowest spending hospitals in California would have survived with more care.Bonuses aren\u2019t the only dangerous incentives built into the president\u2019s health law. Obamacare overhauls how Medicare pays doctors and hospitals. Providers keep more for themselves when their patients get fewer tests, see fewer specialists, and go directly home from the hospital without recuperating at rehab.More money for less care. It sets up a conflict of interest between patients and doctors.When Medicare was enacted in 1965, the law barred the government from interfering in how doctors treated patients. Over the decades, that protection eroded slightly, but Obamacare guts it entirely, turning the financial screws on doctors and hospitals to limit care.Ignoring this reality, the Clinton campaign is road-testing a new scaremongering attack against Trump, calling him a \u201cheartless tycoon\u201d who would put Medicare at risk.The truth is, Trump vows to undo Obamacare\u2019s Medicare cuts. The heartless ones are the Democrats, who are willing to slash Medicare to pay for Obamacare.Subsidies for health plan buyers on the exchanges will cost $800 billion in the next decade.And to pay the tab, Medicare will be cut by precisely that amount over the same period, says the Congressional Budget Office. The Democrats\u2019 agenda is clear: Robbing Grandma to pay for a new entitlement for younger constituents.Republicans should repeal all of Obamacare, including the Medicare cuts, so seniors will get the care they need.Unfortunately, that is not Ryan\u2019s plan. His GOP replacement for Obamacare \u2014 soon to be unveiled \u2013 will include subsidies for consumers to buy health plans. It\u2019s Obamacare lite \u2014a new entitlement paid for by continuing the Medicare cuts.That\u2019s morally wrong.No Republican health bill should be paid for on the backs of seniors.As for Medicare\u2019s finances, they\u2019re in trouble. Medicare Trustees predict the Hospital Fund will go dry by 2030. Obama\u2019s Medicare cuts didn\u2019t help, because he spent the \u201csavings\u201d on his costly health law.Republican proposals like raising the eligibility age, asking wealthier seniors for higher premiums, and adding private plan options would help keep Medicare solvent.Trump and Ryan probably won\u2019t discuss these details on Thursday.But one lesson they must take away from the grim report on hospital skimping: Medicare reform should not cost seniors their lives.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cuts, Obamacare", "pubdate": "2016-05-11T10:37:41", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "The Clinton campaign is testing a new attack against Trump, calling him a heartless tycoon who would put Medicare at risk.
