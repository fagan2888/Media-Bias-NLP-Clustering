Researchers compared data collected in 2011 with metrics from 2014. They also compared the data on doctors with American adults working in other fields.\n\nMore physicians in almost every specialty are feeling this way and that's not good for them, their families, the medical profession, or patients. Dr. Tait Shanafelt, Mayo Clinic\n\n\u201cBurnout manifests as emotional exhaustion, loss of meaning in work, and feelings of ineffectiveness,\u201d Dr. Tait Shanafelt, a hematologist at the Mayo Clinic, said in a statement. \u201cMore physicians in almost every specialty are feeling this way and that's not good for them, their families, the medical profession, or patients.\u201d\n\nIn the 2011 survey, 45 percent of doctors met the burnout criteria. The highest rates were in general internal medicine, emergency medicine, and family medicine.\n\nIn 2014, that number rose to 54 percent of doctors reporting at least one burnout symptom. Their sense of work-life balance was down while work hours were up. Rates of depression remained about the same as in 2011.\n\nPhysicians in private practice were 33 percent more likely to experience burnout than professionals in academia. Doctors in emergency medicine, neurology, orthopedic surgery, physical/rehabilitation medicine, radiology, and urology were at greater risk of burning out, Shanafelt said.\n\nNurses Are Overworked and Understaffed on the Front Lines \u00bb\n\nIt Will Take a Team Effort\n\nShanafelt told Healthline that the drivers of burnout include excessive workload, inefficiency, loss of control over work, problems with work-life integration, and a lack of meaning in work.\n\nHe said burnout is a systemic problem and doctors and health organizations will have to work together to solve it. Although individual remedies such as stress-management programs mean well, he said they aren\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cHealthcare organizations should focus on improving efficiency in the practice environment, delegate clerical tasks to support staff, and nurture a practice environment that cultivates flexibility and control,\u201d he said.\n\nRead More: This is What Your Doctor\u2019s Office Will Look Like in Five Years \u00bb\n\nLong Hours, Red Tape, and Infuriating Technology\n\nShanafelt noted that more than 40 percent of doctors in the 2014 survey reported working more than 60 hours a week while only about 7 percent of workers in other fields worked as many hours.\n\nThe medical field continues to go through unprecedented changes that include higher productivity expectations, consolidation of medical practices, narrowing of insurance networks, and shrinking reimbursements. These all play a role in burnout, Shanafelt said.\n\n\u201cNew legislation and associated regulations have increased the clerical burden associated with every patient encounter,\u201d he added. Technology intended to centralize and streamline processes is often more trouble than it is worth. The use of electronic systems and patient portals has \u201cmagnified rather than reduced clerical burden,\u201d and are a \u201cfrequent source of interruptions and inefficiencies that detract from our interactions with patients.\u201d\n\nDr. Clif Knight, senior vice president of medical education at the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), agrees.\n\nKnight hears constantly from physicians who say technology has contributed to frustration on the job. Some systems designed around billing and are not very user-friendly. They also require doctors to spend more time on administrative tasks and add to the hours they spend working.\n\nKnight said there is not standardization in medical technology, so different systems may not work well with one another. That creates more work for doctors trying to access patient information from multiple sources and platforms.\n\n\u201cIt becomes an obstacle between them and the patient,\u201d Knight told Healthline. \u201cIt makes them feel like they\u2019re actually providing lower-quality care than they used to. It really erodes their satisfaction.\u201d\n\nKnight and others said Obamacare doesn\u2019t appear to be that big a factor in doctor burnout despite the fact some surveys show a majority of physicians don\u2019t like the Affordable Care Act. He said the electronic records is a major factor and those were introduced before Obamacare was enacted.\n\nKnight is concerned that burnout will contribute to the existing doctor shortage. \u201cIt\u2019s potentially a big problem moving forward,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s no single solution to overcoming burnout but simplifying some of these technology platforms may help. The AAFP communicates with software vendors to hold them responsible for meeting \u201cmeaningful use\u201d requirements while making platforms more efficient for doctors.\n\nRead More: We May Need an Additional 90,000 Physicians by 2025 \u00bb\n\nFocusing on Physician Satisfaction\n\nAnother issue is the physician culture, where feeling burned out is seen as weak, Knight noted. Doctors are humans, so they need to recharge like the rest of us. Remedies may include more vacation time and integrating self-care strategies in a way that fits into the doctor\u2019s schedule.\n\n\u201cPart of it is helping physicians with feeling OK with taking care of themselves,\u201d Knight said.\n\nDr. Christine A. Sinsky, an Iowa-based doctor who serves on the AMA\u2019s advisory panel on physician satisfaction, cited a RAND Corporation and AMA study that found the most important driver of satisfaction for doctors is the ability to deliver quality care and spending enough time with patients.\n\nWe have to transform the environment so health professionals can do the work they have trained for and dedicated their lives to\u2014caring for patients. Dr. Christine A. Sinsky, American Medical Association\u2019s Advisory Panel on Physician Satisfaction\n\n\u201cI think we need to recognize that clinical excellence depends on operational efficiency and care team well-being. The women and men in healthcare are running out of reserve,\u201d she told Healthline. \u201cWe have to transform the environment so health professionals can do the work they have trained for and dedicated their lives to\u2014caring for patients.\u201d\n\nAt Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, Dr. Jo Shapiro, leads an initiative that is trying to do just that. She is the director of the Center for Professionalism and Peer Support, whichpromotes clinician resilience and well-being.\n\n\u201cI have personally witnessed the devastating consequences to colleagues when things go wrong in caring for a patient, including feelings of shame, incompetence, fear, anger, sadness, and isolation,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cBy not helping each other deal with this emotional fallout, we risk leaving our colleagues in a state of isolation and pain that can lead to many negative consequences including emotional burnout.\u201d\n\nAt some point we are going to get to a tipping point. We\u2019ve got to really look at this as a significant warning sign. Dr. Clif Knight, American Academy of Family Physicians\n\nHer team also works to support professional behavior between all healthcare workers that fosters a more positive environment.\n\nSolutions like the one at Shapiro\u2019s facility are just some ways to prevent and alleviate burnout, something the survey has put in the spotlight.\n\n\u201cIn the three-year period 2011 to 2014, we\u2019ve lost ground,\u201d Knight said. \u201cAt some point we are going to get to a tipping point. We\u2019ve got to really look at this as a significant warning sign.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "doctors, doctor burnout, doctors getting burned out, doctor job satisfaction", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "A research team at the Mayo Clinic said doctors are getting more burned out at their jobs, and that\u2019s bad for the profession and for patients.", "title": "Long Hours, Short Visits, Red Tape Are Making Doctors Burn Out", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/long-hours-short-visits-red-tape-are-making-doctors-burn-out-120315", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/mental-health/120415_burnout_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/mental-health/120415_burnout_THUMB.jpg", "description": "A research team at the Mayo Clinic said doctors are getting more burned out at their jobs, and that\u2019s bad for the profession and for patients.", "card": "summary", "title": "Long Hours, Short Visits, Red Tape Are Making Doctors Burn Out"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-03", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A research team at the Mayo Clinic said doctors are getting more burned out at their jobs, and that\u2019s bad for the profession and for patients."}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt becomes an obstacle between them and the patient,\u201d Knight told Healthline.\nHe said burnout is a systemic problem and doctors and health organizations will have to work together to solve it.\nThey also require doctors to spend more time on administrative tasks and add to the hours they spend working.\nIn 2014, that number rose to 54 percent of doctors reporting at least one burnout symptom.\nThat creates more work for doctors trying to access patient information from multiple sources and platforms."}
