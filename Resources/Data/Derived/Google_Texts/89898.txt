The freeway just reopened, but San Diego-bound travelers and travelers on I-10 between Tucson and Phoenix are in for extended delays following a rollover crash near I-8 at milepost 199 that included a medical evacuation. Traffic is backed up for miles in both directions, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation.

ADOT suggests eastbound I-10 travelers take State Route 287 east to State Route 87, then south to I-10 to get around the snafu. They say doing the reverse will work for westbound traffic.

The multi-vehicle collision happened a little after 10 a.m. on eastbound I-10, according to the Department of Public Safety's public information office. There are multiple serious injuries, and the eastbound lanes of I-10 were closed for nearly two hours. State troopers and fire department responded to the scene.
