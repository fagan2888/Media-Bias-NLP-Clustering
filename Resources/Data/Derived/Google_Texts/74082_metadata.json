I talked to a major hospital in L.A. County recently and they told me last year they had 50 new grad positions and \u2026 over 1,900 people applied,\u201d Furnanz said. \u201cWe hear about all these jobs that are coming, but we also hear stories about people with R.N. licenses waiting tables at Chili\u2019s.\u201d\n\nExperts say jobs in the healthcare industry are indeed growing much faster than other sectors, and will continue to do so with millions more people insured. But opportunities may be easier to find in some parts of the country than others. And the types of jobs may not be what seekers expect.\n\nReasons for optimism\n\nHealthcare jobs are generally divided into two types: professional and technical jobs such as doctors and nurses that earn high wages and require at least a college degree, and low-wage, low-skill support jobs.\n\nBoth sectors are growing quickly.\n\nProfessional and technical occupations will add 1 million jobs by 2018, according to a 2012 report by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Nursing will see the largest growth, at 26 percent.\n\nPart of the boost in nursing comes from efforts to increase efficiency and tame healthcare spending by shifting the distribution of workers toward nurses and other support personnel. The idea is not to have a costly doctor doing what less expensive staff could be doing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor health care to become more efficient, doctors, nurses \u2014 everyone \u2014 has to practice toward the higher end of their training,\u201d said Ralph Henderson, president of healthcare staffing for AMN Healthcare Services, a San Diego-based healthcare staffing company.\n\n\u201cIf nurses can provide a certain treatment, it doesn\u2019t make sense to have a doctor do it.\u201d\n\nNurses, particularly those with more education, will increasingly be allowed to write prescriptions and make referrals.\n\n\u201cWe know there is going to be less doctors, and if we are going to require less doctors, we are going to need more nurses,\u201d said economist Nicole Smith, one of the authors of the Georgetown report.\n\nEven before the effects of the Affordable Care Act are felt, the healthcare workforce has seen growing demand for years. As baby boomers get older, demand for health care is growing. New government requirements for digital records means new jobs in that field. And the population of doctors and nurses is aging, meaning many are close to retirement.\n\nHealthcare-related employment has been growing steadily at around 2 percent a year for many years, even during the recession, according to Ani Turner, deputy director of the Altarum Institute\u2019s Center for Studying Health Spending, a research and consulting organization.\n\nConflicting forces\n\nBut in 2013, that growth started to slow, particularly in hospitals and nursing homes, Turner said.\n\nThe slowdown is a response to a drop in use of hospital services during the recession and a result of lower reimbursement rates paid through Medicare for services, Turner said.\n\n\u201cThere is a general trend toward needing to constrain the growth in healthcare costs,\u201d she said.\n\nThose pressures could impact the longer-term healthcare job market.\n\n\u201cThere are forces moving in both directions. I think there is a difference between a short-term bump and a long-term ongoing trend after that,\u201d Turner said. \u201cCertainly in the next few years \u2026 there will be an increased demand with the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nBut it won\u2019t be as big a demand as some may think, Turner said. Approximately 32 million more people are expected to be insured under ACA, including people who signed up for private coverage and people newly covered by Medicaid or their employer, under the law\u2019s new requirements. Though that amounts to about 10 percent of the U.S. population, they won\u2019t use 10 percent of the services. People over age 65 and people who are disabled \u2014 populations that use more health services \u2014 already have government coverage.\n\n\u201cThese are mostly adults, mostly young men. They don\u2019t require as many services. So research suggests a bump in demand of between 2 and 3 percent, spread out over a couple of years,\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd it will be felt in some parts of the country more than others.\u201d\n\nFurnanz and other students say, so far, it doesn\u2019t look good for L.A.\n\n\u201cL.A. County and its surrounding areas are saturated. There are a lot of nursing schools here and it has some of the highest pay in the country,\u201d Furnanz said.\n\nLike her classmate, Cal State L.A. student Cheyanne Punsal said she has heard of many students who graduated last year but still don\u2019t have jobs.\n\n\u201cThere are too many nurses and the actual availability of jobs is not enough,\u201d said Punsal, who is president of the Student Nurses Association.\n\nBoth Furnanz and Punsal said recent grads have to be open to jobs outside of traditional hospitals.\n\nFinding opportunities\n\nJobs in home health care are growing particularly fast.\n\n\u201cCare in the home is preferable in a lot of situations. It is so expensive to treat a patient in a hospital. And in the long-term, more patients at home means you don\u2019t have to build a hospital. Patients at home are more comfortable, they get healthier feaster,\u201d Henderson said.\n\nThis means more positions for not only skilled nurses willing to work in home health care, but also less skilled aides. Job growth for home health aides is expected to reach 49 percent in the coming years, Henderson said.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the easier careers to get into,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are on the lower end of the pay scale, but they pay better than your average admin or childcare-type jobs.\u201d\n\nHome health aides, like nurse assistants, typically have to go through a certification process, but they are not required to have extensive college-level training. The average home health aide in California makes $10.52 an hour. The average nursing assistant makes $13.42, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nHenderson says the push to contain healthcare costs doesn\u2019t mean fewer jobs, but it does mean where the jobs are could shift.\n\n\u201cAnd the ACA calls for better diagnosis of disease, so there will be growth in jobs in diagnostic and lab testing,\u201d he added. \u201cIt calls for electronic medical records, so there is growth in IT jobs, as well as jobs in medical coding and billing.\u201d\n\nHenderson also sees fast job growth for nurse practitioners, physician\u2019s assistants and primary care doctors.\n\nThe biggest demand for additional services will likely be in primary care and addressing chronic conditions that have gone untreated, Turner said.\n\nWhere to begin\n\nThe first hurdle facing healthcare job seekers, particularly those seeking higher wage positions, is finding a program.\n\nWhile medical schools have expanded their capacity in recent years, responding to a threatened doctor shortage, there is still a severe lack of residency programs for them to continue their training in, according to Turner\n\nMeanwhile, nursing schools across L.A. are overwhelmed with applicants.\n\nSan Bernardino Valley College has one student who has been on the waiting list for its nursing program for seven years, and she still won\u2019t get into the program until next year, according to Associate Dean Carol Wells, director of the nursing program.\n\nThe school is phasing out its wait list and switching to a point system. Last year it has 90 applicants for 10 spots in the point system.\n\nMount St. Mary\u2019s College in Los Angeles sees three applicants for every position in its nursing program, according to Dean of Nursing Diane Vines.\n\nPart of the problem is that nursing schools have had a hard time finding professors to teach nursing students because working in nursing pays much more than teaching it, Vines and others said.\n\nAnd training nurses doesn\u2019t come cheap.\n\n\u201cIt costs a lot to create a nurse, for the training, the equipment. It\u2019s a lot more expensive than educating a literature major,\u201d Smith said.\n\nFinding training for lower-wage health-care positions is easier \u2014 technical schools, vocational high schools, the Red Cross and other organizations offer certification programs, which are approved by the state.\n\nBut Smith warns aspiring nurses against starting in low-wage healthcare support jobs with the hope of moving up.\n\n\u201cIt is rare to find a lot of upward mobility in health care. There is no vertical ladder,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd two-year nursing programs aren\u2019t cutting it anymore, the experts said. Hospitals are increasingly requiring their nurses to have four-year bachelor\u2019s degrees.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of movement in upscaling, in requiring more education,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWells recommends students interested in careers in health care start on the career path in high school.\n\n\u201cThey should work hard in their sciences, in math. And they should be persistent. They\u2019ll get into a program, eventually,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pasadena resident Nathaniel Furnanz knows the statistic well: the number of nursing jobs in the U.S. is expected to grow by 19 percent over the next 10 years, nearly twice the average of other occupations, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statist", "title": "Healthcare jobs still growing, but L.A. market faces saturation", "og": {"url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/business/20140406/healthcare-jobs-still-growing-but-la-market-faces-saturation", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.sgvtribune.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sgvtribune_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Healthcare jobs still growing, but L.A. market faces saturation"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sgvtribune.com", "description": "Pasadena resident Nathaniel Furnanz knows the statistic well: the number of nursing jobs in the U.S. is expected to grow by 19 percent over the next 10 years, nearly twice the average of other occupations, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statist", "title": "Healthcare jobs still growing, but L.A. market faces saturation", "url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/business/20140406/healthcare-jobs-still-growing-but-la-market-faces-saturation", "image": {"src": "http://local.sgvtribune.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sgvtribune.png?052016"}, "site": "@SGVTribune", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551759403", "iphone": "id503025528", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sangabrielvalleytribune"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Obamacare, Health care industry", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Obamacare, Health care industry"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf492\"", "article_summary": "Wells recommends students interested in careers in health care start on the career path in high school.\nPeople over age 65 and people who are disabled \u2014 populations that use more health services \u2014 already have government coverage.\nAs baby boomers get older, demand for health care is growing.\nFinding opportunitiesJobs in home health care are growing particularly fast.\nHenderson says the push to contain healthcare costs doesn\u2019t mean fewer jobs, but it does mean where the jobs are could shift."}
