And for his boots.\n\nDoing absolutely nothing to remedy Bush\u2019s reputation for being stiff and awkward, the ad uses a 50-year-old Nancy Sinatra song, \u201cThese Boots Were Made for Walkin\u2019\u201d and features a man, visible from the waist down, wearing a business suit and black cowboy boots dancing across the screen.\n\nRelated: Marco Rubio Calls for a Constitutional Convention \u2013 That\u2019s Problematic\n\nThe boots are an obvious reference to Rubio\u2019s shiny black leather boots (to our eyes they\u2019re clearly Chelsea boots not cowboy boots) and were the subject of an oddly large number of stories in the media last week, including at least four articles in The New York Times alone.\n\nWith a design and color scheme meant to invoke the 1960s go-go era of mini dresses and tall leather boots, the modified lyrics scroll across the bottom of the stage, with a bouncing black boot helpfully jumping from word to word.\n\nThe ad contains such memorable lines as \u201cOne of these days young Marco\u2019s gonna flip, flop, flip on you\u201d and \u201cYou keep flippin\u2019 when you shoulda not flop.\u201d In the background, quotations from headlines suggesting that Rubio has changed position on a variety of issues flash on and off.\n\nRelated: Insider or Outside?
