Ted Cruz is the brash, ambitious bomb-thrower.\n\nThe GOP takeover of the Senate last week puts the two Texas Republicans in a white-hot spotlight \u2014 and potentially a collision course.\n\nAs deputy majority leader, Cornyn\u2019s main task will be to keep the party unified behind an agenda and strategy set by the incoming majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Cruz, by contrast, wouldn\u2019t even pledge to support McConnell for the leadership post, before or after Tuesday night\u2019s sweeping victory.\n\n\u201cTed\u2019s going to be a leader. He\u2019s not just going to be an agitator,\u201d said Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom coalition and a longtime Cruz friend. \u201cBut sometimes to become a leader, you\u2019ve got to rattle the cage.\u201d\n\nThe friction Cruz has caused in the Senate has been so overt, McConnell made light of it the day after the elections. Speaking in Louisville, Ky., he mentioned four people who\u2019d called with congratulations. Apart from House Speaker John Boehner, it sounded like a list of adversaries, including a chastened president, a deposed majority leader, and an unruly backbencher.\n\n\u201cI got a call from the president. Also Senator [Harry] Reid, and the speaker, and Ted Cruz, too. I thought you\u2019d be interested,\u201d McConnell told reporters, drawing chuckles. \u201cAll of them have the view that we ought to see what areas of agreement there are and see if we can make some progress for the country.\u201d\n\nCruz has made efforts in recent months to ingratiate himself with colleagues he irritated in the first 18 months of his tenure. He stumped for Senate nominees in key races in Iowa, Georgia and Kansas, all of whom won. He made a long trip last weekend to Alaska to stump for Republican Dan Sullivan, who has a healthy lead with absentee ballots still being counted.\n\nCruz also donated generously to the party\u2019s Senate campaign arm. And he steered clear of states where his presence might inflame Democrats more than it would help fellow Republicans.\n\nStill, he could pose some of the biggest headaches in coming months for McConnell and Cornyn.\n\nFormer Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who held the No. 4 spot in GOP leadership for a time, sees a big set of challenges for Cornyn. Cruz\u2019s role in the Senate could require attention, along with corporate tax changes, energy issues and other legislative priorities.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to be productive and keep the trust of the American people, we need to be an effective team, and that\u2019s going to be Senator Cornyn\u2019s responsibility,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for Cruz, who won the seat she gave up in 2012, Hutchison said: \u201cHe\u2019s going to set his own course. \u2026 What he\u2019s done so far has been what he said he would do. I hope that Senator Cruz will work with Senator Cornyn. When your senators are divided, it really lessens the clout that your state has than when they\u2019re united.\u201d\n\nCornyn and Cruz are surely the highest wattage Senate duo from Texas since Phil Gramm and Lloyd Bentsen, or maybe even Sam Houston and Thomas Rusk.\n\nBoth are lawyers, deeply conservative with agendas that largely overlap. Stylistically, they are opposites.\n\nCruz, a 44-year-old tea party icon, crushed Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the 2012 primary.\n\nHis efforts to remove funding for Obamacare included an overnight talkathon. He\u2019s broken with Senate tradition by huddling regularly with House conservatives, encouraging them to buck Boehner at key moments; he engineered the 16-day government shutdown by goading allies into quashing a budget deal.\n\nCornyn, along with other GOP leaders, continues to regard that tactic as unwise and damaging.\n\n\u201cYou cannot just defund Obamacare. That may have been a difficult lesson to learn,\u201d said House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions of Dallas, a Boehner ally and member of House leadership.\n\nCruz \u201ccan work well within the system,\u201d Sessions predicted. \u201cHe will see that we get more together than we do apart.\u201d\n\nCornyn, 62, coasted to a third term Tuesday. He\u2019s worked his way up. He spent four years as the party\u2019s chief campaign strategist and the last two as minority whip \u2014 a job that revolved around stymieing the Obama agenda.\n\nAs majority whip, he will be the second most powerful member of the Senate \u2014 and the most powerful Texan in the chamber since Democrat Lyndon Johnson\u2019s stint as majority leader in the 1950s.\n\n\u201cThe responsibility is enormous and Senator Cornyn is definitely up to the task,\u201d said GOP strategist Ron Bonjean, a former top aide to a Senate majority leader and a House speaker.\n\nHe predicted occasional run-ins with Cruz and predicted Cornyn would respond with the \u201cstatesmanlike and classy\u201d approach of a senator who prefers operating in \u201ca senatorial, closed-door sort of way.\u201d Unlike Cruz, he said, Cornyn is \u201cnot a flame thrower. \u2026 But he also has a strong backbone and can stand up with Mitch McConnell to President Obama.\u201d\n\nBoth senators declined interview requests last week.\n\nWhile GOP leaders and the White House have offered olive branches in recent days, Cruz has struck something other than a conciliatory tone. At the Texas Republicans\u2019 Election Night party in Austin, he reiterated his no-compromise stance.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to go after and do everything humanly possible to repeal Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time to stand up to the president. \u2026 The era of Obama lawlessness is over.\u201d\n\nDemocrats see Cruz as polarizing and will exploit any hint of division he causes. After McConnell renewed his commitment to repealing Obamacare, Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson taunted that \u201cMcConnell is already letting Senator Cruz set the agenda.\u201d\n\nReince Priebus, the GOP national chairman, said Friday that Cruz\u2019s demands that Republicans push back against Obama are entirely appropriate. \u201cThe American people \u2026 are sick and tired of the abuse, as well. They want answers on the IRS. They want answers on Benghazi,\u201d he said.\n\nIf he remains an agitator, Cruz could risk being shunned and marginalized just as the GOP is positioned to actually legislate. But the more accommodating he is, the less authentic he might look to staunchly conservative Republican primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire who are shopping for a champion.\n\n\u201cAmong the base, there\u2019s a sense that we give up too easily,\u201d said Steve Munisteri, the Texas Republican chairman. \u201cHe is not reluctant to buck Senate leadership. \u2026 That really makes Senator Cruz a folk hero.\u201d\n\nCornyn\u2019s path is different.\n\nFor him, it\u2019s \u201cnot about being a national leader of the conservative movement. His course is to get government to move in a more conservative direction,\u201d Munisteri said. That makes the Texans a \u201cyin and yang,\u201d with complementary roles.\n\nWhile Cruz was refusing to pledge his leadership vote to McConnell, a tea party rival for the presidential nomination \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul \u2014 was stumping with his fellow Kentuckian. Paul and another 2016 contender, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, have generally distanced themselves from Cruz and his tactics.\n\n\u201cMitch [McConnell] has very carefully, very methodically, very much under the radar isolated Ted Cruz,\u201d said Bob Bennett, a Utah conservative ousted from the Senate by Cruz\u2019s closest ally, Mike Lee, in the tea party wave of 2010. \u201cCruz is going to look around, and there aren\u2019t going to be that many people with him.\u201d\n\nMartin Frost, a former Dallas congressman who served in Democratic leadership for years, agreed.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz can\u2019t be the tail wagging the dog,\u201d he said. \u201cThe test for Senator McConnell will be whether he is willing to\u201d stand up to Cruz.\n\nReed, who worked with Cruz on the 2000 Bush campaign, sees him evolving as a senator. He noted that Sen. Pat Roberts, hardly a tea partier, \u201csure wanted him to stand by his side\u201d in Kansas as he struggled for re-election, and Cruz obliged.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the most brilliant guys I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Reed said. \u201cHe\u2019ll have a big impact on the Senate, as he already has. And if he decides to run for president he\u2019s going to have a big impact on the race.\u201d\n\nStaff writers Kimberly Railey and Michael Marks contributed to this report.\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@toddgillman", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas\u2019 junior senator\u2019s conservative agitation could create headaches for the senior lawmaker, who\u2019s in leadership.", "og": {"description": "Texas\u2019 junior senator\u2019s conservative agitation could create headaches for the senior lawmaker, who\u2019s in leadership.", "title": "Influence of Sens.
