Some worried their home states will become \u201corgan farms\u201d for states along the coast.\n\nA bipartisan group of 52 members of Congress signed a letter Friday condemning the plan, which will be discussed by the national organ-sharing network Tuesday. Lawmakers from Texas, Tennessee, Kansas, Mississippi, Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana all signed the letter.\n\nRep. Kevin Yoder Kevin YoderOvernight Cybersecurity: FBI won't tell Apple how it hacked iPhone House unanimously passes email privacy bill House to take up email privacy bill this month MORE, (R-Kan.), who spearheaded the effort, said in a statement that the solution to the nation\u2019s organ shortage isn\u2019t shipping them out of the Midwest or South.\n\n\u201c[The United Network for Organ Sharing] should not adopt proposals that punish successful programs and decrease access to organs where donation rates are highest,\u201d Yoder wrote in a statement Monday. Instead, he said, officials should increase donations in areas of the country \u201cwhere disparities in wait times are the greatest.\u201d\n\nThe rates of organ donation vary widely across geographic regions. Rates are highest in the Southeast and Midwest, which also experienced the nation\u2019s highest death rates.\n\nThat disparity can lead to vastly different outcomes for patients. Death rates for people awaiting liver transplants range from 14 percent to 82 percent depending on their state, according to a 2013 report by the American Journal of Transplantation.\n\nEleven Georgia congressman raised alarm about the remapping plan in April. In a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the lawmakers warned that the plan \u201cwould single out the state of Georgia, making it the only southern state in a region comprised of northeastern states.\u201d\n\nThe new boundaries would hike up the average travel time for a liver to eight hours from five hours, which Georgia lawmakers cautioned would increase risks and transportation costs for each transplant.\n\nBut David Mulligan, chairman of the organ-sharing network\u2019s liver committee, said the plan would ensure that people with the greatest need are first to receive new organs. Livers only last outside the body about 12 hours before a transplant.\n\nIf people with less-urgent needs \u201cjust wait a little longer, they\u2019ll be a hero and literally save the life of someone who doesn\u2019t have that extra day,\u201d Mulligan told the Hill. Mulligan, a liver transplant surgeon, is also the chief of transplantation at Yale University.\n\nAbout 15,600 people are currently waiting for a liver transplant, including 3,000 in California and 1,300 in New York, according to HHS data. There are just 129 people on the wait-list in Kansas and 252 in Georgia.\n\nThe ethics of organ transplants grabbed national attention in 2009 when then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs traveled to Tennessee from California to receive a liver transplant, raising concerns that he had \u201ccut the line.\u201d\n\nWhen choosing transplant recipients, health officials already consider medical urgency as well as geographic distribution. The organ network is currently split into 11 districts, and could soon be turned into as few as four.\n\nNearly 50 transplant doctors, mostly in the Southeast and Midwest, also oppose the plan. The group sent a sharply worded letter to the HHS this summer that describes the plan as \u201cthe most drastic change in liver allocation ever.\u201d\n\nMulligan, who will lead Tuesday\u2019s discussion with more than a dozen other transplant doctors, stressed that the group is far from making a final decision. He added that each day the group continues to weigh the options, people across the country die awaiting transplants.\n\nHe fought back against criticism from some Midwestern and Southern officials that the organization should instead focus on driving up donation rates in states along the coast. Donation rates in those areas have remained flat for about a decade.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of nice to say, 'Oh, all we\u2019ve got to do is make them donate more in the Northeast or Northwest.' But I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to do more than what we\u2019re already doing,\u201d Mulligan said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "States with larger supplies of livers might have to share them with California, New York.", "description": "States with larger supplies of livers might have to share them with California, New York.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "States with larger supplies of livers might have to share them with California, New York.", "title": "Liver battle pits Midwest, South against California, New York", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/217746-liver-battle-pits-midwest-south-vs-california-new-york", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-15T17:25:46-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-09-15T17:25-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/217746-liver-battle-pits-midwest-south-vs-california-new-york", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-15T14:52-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "organ donations, organ sharing,Kevin Yoder,Health and Human Services Department", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-15T14:52:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-15T17:25:46-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/217746-liver-battle-pits-midwest-south-vs-california-new-york", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "States with larger supplies of livers might have to share them with California, New York.", "card": "summary", "title": "Liver battle pits Midwest, South against California, New York"}, "dcterms.title": "Liver battle pits Midwest, South against California, New York"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb0a\"", "article_summary": "About 15,600 people are currently waiting for a liver transplant, including 3,000 in California and 1,300 in New York, according to HHS data.\nThe organ network is currently split into 11 districts, and could soon be turned into as few as four.\nADVERTISEMENTUnder the \u201credistricting\u201d plan, states with larger supplies of livers \u2014 such as Kansas and Tennessee \u2014 would share their donations with states like California or New York, where organ donation is less common.\nMulligan, a liver transplant surgeon, is also the chief of transplantation at Yale University.\nDonation rates in those areas have remained flat for about a decade."}
