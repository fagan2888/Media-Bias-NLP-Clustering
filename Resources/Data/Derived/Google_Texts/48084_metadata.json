That\u2019s roughly 1 in 3 state residents. By comparison, about 1.4 million Californians are enrolled in Covered California.\n\nGiven its size, Medi-Cal\u2019s annual renewal process is now one of its greatest challenges.\n\nLast year\u2019s process was new, messy and confusing, and many Californians \u2013 we\u2019re not being told how many \u2013 got dropped from the program.\n\nThis year, Medi-Cal has changed the process again. Already, people are complaining that they\u2019re getting dropped when they shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nQ: I never received the Medi-Cal renewal application, but I just got a notice saying I\u2019m getting kicked off because I didn\u2019t turn it in. What should I do?\n\nA: Michael Gong, an Oakland graduate student, joined Medi-Cal last year when California expanded Medi-Cal eligibility (through the Affordable Care Act) to childless adults and those with higher incomes than before.\n\nWhen Gong got the letter in late January, he began a month long quest to get reinstated.\n\nHe submitted his renewal materials, which is allowed within a grace period. But in response, he received another termination letter in mid-February saying that he could not be in Medi-Cal because he\u2019s not a California resident. (Oakland is generally considered to be within our borders.)\n\nAt that point, Gong and his mother, Judyth Collin, made dozens of unanswered calls to county workers \u2013 who handle Medi-Cal applications \u2013 and they visited county offices.\n\nFinally, Collin says, she reached a supervisor by phone who helped Gong get back on Medi-Cal in early March.\n\nHer problems aren\u2019t isolated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hearing from people who have been cut off who have turned in their forms,\u201d says Jen Flory, senior attorney at the Western Center on Law and Poverty. \u201cAnd we\u2019re hearing from people who are trying to contact their county workers and are having trouble getting through.\u201d\n\nTheoretically, this year\u2019s renewal process should be easier than last year\u2019s. If you enrolled in Medi-Cal or completed renewal forms last year and your county can determine that your eligibility hasn\u2019t changed, you should receive a letter this year confirming your enrollment for another year.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, we\u2019re not sending out an enormous blank packet for people to fill out,\u201d says Cathy Senderling-McDonald, deputy executive director of the County Welfare Directors Association.\n\nSome people may not qualify for auto-renewal and will receive a notice that requests additional information, such as proof of income or state residency. If you receive that, you will have at least 30 days to respond, Senderling-McDonald says.\n\nRoughly 1 million Californians will be asked to renew each month, according to the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers Medi-Cal.\n\nThe stakes are high, but it\u2019s hard to gauge the impact because Medi-Cal officials decline to say how many people have been dropped from the program as a result of the renewal process this year and last.\n\n\u201cThese data are not available currently,\u201d says Tony Cava, a spokesman for the DHCS.\n\nHere\u2019s my advice: If you\u2019re in Gong\u2019s situation and get a termination notice because you didn\u2019t submit renewal information \u2013 whether or not it was your fault \u2013 get the paperwork in as soon as possible.\n\nYou have 90 days from the date of termination to submit that information. If you do and you\u2019re still eligible for the program, you will be reinstated retroactive to the date you were kicked out, Flory says.\n\nNext, reach out to your county caseworker. I know, easier said than done.\n\nThe roughly 15,000 county workers dedicated to Medi-Cal are overwhelmed. They\u2019re juggling an onslaught of new applications, the renewal process (some of last year\u2019s load was pushed into this year), plus persistent computer problems.\n\nFor instance, the state computer system won\u2019t allow county workers to deny applications themselves or drop people who are ineligible, Senderling-McDonald says.\n\nThat leads to backlogs and mistakes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of manual work that counties are still doing to get around the issues in the computer system,\u201d she says.\n\nBut there\u2019s hope. The state is working on the technical problems. By July, county workers are scheduled to have the ability to deny applications on their own, Senderling-McDonald says.\n\nThere\u2019s also $150 million in the current-year state budget to beef up county Medi-Cal resources, including money for overtime pay, she says.\n\nUntil things get better:\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t ignore letters you receive from Medi-Cal. Because the forms are changing, your annual renewal probably won\u2019t look like it has in the past.\n\n\u2022 Ask for a supervisor if you\u2019re having trouble reaching someone at your county human services agency. Be persistent.\n\n\u2022 Request an eligibility hearing by calling 800-952-5253 if you receive a notice saying that you\u2019ll be losing your benefits. Doing this will flag your case for attention and it may get resolved before your hearing date.\n\nThe CHCF Center for Health Reporting partners with news organizations to cover California health policy.
