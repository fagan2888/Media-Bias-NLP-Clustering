(AP) - With clear majorities in both chambers of the Legislature, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson easily won support for his plan to keep and rework the state\u2019s hybrid Medicaid expansion. His reward? The type of protracted, divisive fight over the program he\u2019s sought to avoid and the prospect of an unprecedented shutdown of state government.\n\nThe Legislature\u2019s approval of bills outlining Hutchinson\u2019s proposed restrictions for the hybrid expansion are a preview of the debate he\u2019s about to face with fellow Republicans who have vowed to block its funding.\n\nHutchinson and supporters of his plan are warning its opponents to not jeopardize the state\u2019s Medicaid program, and potentially the overall state budget, over a proposal that less than a third of the Legislature opposes. The proposal passed with large majorities in the House and Senate last week, but still a handful of votes shy of the three-fourths support that the Medicaid budget bill funding it will need in the fiscal session starting this week.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental principle of government that we need to deal with, and that is that a minority should not derail the expressed will of the majority,\u201d Hutchinson said as he signed the measures into law last week.\n\nHistory offers Hutchinson and supporters of his expansion plan, dubbed \u201cArkansas Works,\u201d plenty of encouragement. Ever since Arkansas\u2019 hybrid expansion was created three years ago, the program has sharply divided Republicans and has led to threats of defunding from opponents who call it an embrace of the health overhaul.\n\nBut there are signs that, this time around, the fight could be tougher for Hutchinson, who successfully convinced lawmakers last year to reauthorize the program another year while a task force looked at its future. Hutchinson is hoping to sway a wing of his party that\u2019s benefited from the anti-\u201cObamacare\u201d message that\u2019s made the GOP the majority, including several who made killing the hybrid expansion their central issue.\n\nThey\u2019re also not shy about floating the possibility of a Washington-style government shutdown.\n\nRepublican Sen. Bart Hester, an outspoken opponent of the expanded coverage, said he doesn\u2019t believe a shutdown will happen but said: \u201cIf that was the only way (to stop the program), and let me be clear I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the only way, but I would.\u201d\n\nHester and other opponents are pushing for a separate vote on the program, which uses federal funds to purchase private insurance for more than 250,000 people. But Hutchinson and other backers are rejecting that idea, noting it\u2019s historically been considered within the larger Medicaid budget and that lawmakers have already supported the program by large majorities in both chambers.\n\nThe prospect of being asked to vote against other Medicaid programs, including insurance for children and assistance for the disabled, is giving several opponents pause.\n\n\u201cIt is a concern for those most-needy populations that we serve, no matter what decision we make on this expanded population,\u201d said Republican Sen. Blake Johnson, who voted against the expansion plan.\n\nThe potential for a funding showdown comes more than a year after Hutchinson said he hoped to move beyond the divisive fights that marked the \u201cprivate option\u201d hybrid expansion that he inherited.\n\n\u201cThe phrase \u2018private option\u2019 itself has become politically toxic, so much so that it\u2019s almost impossible to have a constructive conversation about health care reform without passions rising and folks taking sides,\u201d Hutchinson said shortly after taking office last year.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly the type of scenario laid out by Hutchinson, who noted that supporters of his program are just as unlikely to support a Medicaid budget without the expanded coverage as opponents are likely to push for it being stripped out.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what leads to government shutdowns in Washington. We\u2019ve never had that in Arkansas,\u201d Hutchinson said last week. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to have that under my watch. But those are the consequences that are real, and it\u2019s real to tens of thousands of people in Arkansas who are dependent upon these services.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAndrew DeMillo has followed Arkansas government and politics for The Associated Press since 2005.
