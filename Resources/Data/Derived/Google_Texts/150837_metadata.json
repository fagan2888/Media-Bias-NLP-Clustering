It harkened back to Isner\u2019s record 70-68 fifth-set victory spread over three days in 2010, but he and Cilic have a long way to go to equal that marathon.\n\nNothing in that match, or any other Friday, offered up the tension and drama provided by Williams vs. Watson. Especially once Watson \u2014 playing steadily, if unspectacularly \u2014 appeared on the verge of a significant upset.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Serena Williams rallies to defeat Heather Watson at Wimbledon", "title": "Serena Williams rallies to defeat Heather Watson at Wimbledon", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/03/serena-williams-rallies-to-defeat-heather-watson-at-wimbledon/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150703__serena-williams-wimbledonp1.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150703__serena-williams-wimbledonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-03T18:54:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T00:33:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Nothing in that match, or any other Friday, offered up the tension and drama provided by Williams vs. Watson.\nLONDON \u2014 Twice, Serena Williams stood merely two points from a stunning loss at Wimbledon against a British opponent buoyed by a roaring, flag-waving Centre Court crowd.\nMen\u2019s matchups: defending champion Novak Djokovic vs. Kevin Anderson, French Open champion Stan Wawrinka vs. David Goffin and Richard Gasquet vs. Nick Kyrgios.\nThis will be the 26th all-Williams matchup, and first at a major since Serena beat Venus in the 2009 Wimbledon final.\n1-seeded Williams overcame a surprisingly staunch challenge from 59th-ranked Heather Watson and emerged with a 6-2, 4-6, 7-5 victory in the third round Friday."}
