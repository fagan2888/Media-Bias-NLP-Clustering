Kelly Atkins tells them just to stand there for now, gently shifting their balance.\n\n\u201cImagine that you\u2019re absorbing some of that space underneath you,\u201d she says.\n\nThen she invites them to take a seat.\n\n\u201cThe action of getting down to the floor is one of the healthiest things you can do,\u201d she notes. Once she has brought them back to their feet, she has them lower their bodies yet again: \u201cNow, do it with pleasure.\u201d\n\nLeading her class through gradually intensified steps, to music that ranges from ethereal to pulsing, Atkins displays an ability to paint word-pictures that helps her students feel what\u2019s happening inside them.\n\n\u201cOur hips have a natural tendency to like dancing.\n\n\u201cLet the muscles shrink-wrap around the bones.\n\n\u201cOpen up the front of your hips like windows. ... Maybe you grew a little taller, opening that up.\u201d\n\nAtkins melded years of fitness training with her studies of the brain into a mind-body-spirit dance exercise she calls Kai. Since creating it three years ago, she\u2019s had it trademarked, written two manuals, and trained 40 instructors in local and online classes.\n\n\u201cI feel that Kai has a life of its own,\u201d she says, in an interview at Soul Studios on Sarasota\u2019s Bahia Vista Street, where she teaches daily classes. \u201cMy sense is that Kai wants to be all over the world.\u201d\n\nKai involves 21 movements designed to stimulate the legs and feet, the core of the body, and the arms and hands. They\u2019re blended with Authentic Movement, a free-style form that pioneer dance therapist Mary Starks Whitehouse originated in the 1950s.\n\nAtkins says each hour-long Kai class is about half choreographed and half improvisational. She\u2019s drawing a wide range of students, but most are 35 to 50.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to get a great sweaty workout that feels good on their joints and delivers a mind-body connection, providing a balanced state of wellbeing. And it\u2019s fun,\u201d she says.\n\nAtkins traces her interest in how the brain works to her senior year in college, when she dropped out to care for her father \u2014 who had a brain tumor \u2014 during his last six weeks.\n\nShe changed majors from physical therapy and graduated from Empire State College with a degree in health and wellness, with a strong science background. She moved from Watertown, New York, to Sarasota in 2000, and had taught Nia, which blends dance with martial arts, for 13 years before launching Kai.\n\nThe more she learned about the anatomy of the brain, she says, the more she connected that into how to stimulate exact areas to enhance specific aspects, including focus, emotional stability, coordination and creativity.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very accessible, and it\u2019s open to both men and women. You don\u2019t have to have any dance background. We start with walking,\u201d Atkins says.\n\nA safe place\n\nPatsy Westover\u2019s husband of 30 years, Richard, was sick and then died in December 2011. That was a time, she says, when her own health was poor.\n\nShe had a transient ischemic attack, commonly known as TIA, a temporary disruption of the nervous system considered a warning for stroke risk. She had a spot on her lungs; had arthritis so severe \u201cI couldn\u2019t get on my knees on my bed,\u201d and dropped 30 pounds.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t feel like eating, depressed, all of that, because of losing him,\u201d Westover says. \u201cI decided \u2018I\u2019ve just got to take care of myself.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe started taking classes from Atkins in April 2012, when Atkins was teaching Nia, and now every week takes Kai classes three days a week and walks nine holes of golf.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m as healthy as can be,\u201d Westover says. She says her doctor has been reducing her medications for blood pressure and cholesterol. She no longer needs physical therapy for her arthritis. She enjoys the community she\u2019s found in Kai and looks forward to Atkins\u2019s classes.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most amazing teacher I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s fun, we dance, she makes it such a safe place,\u201d Westover says. \u201d I don\u2019t have any rhythm. I\u2019m so not a good dancer. But it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t feel self-conscious. I just do what I do.\u201d\n\nChris Martin moved to Sarasota five years ago from Indiana because she struggles with a neurological disease and needed to be out of cold weather.\n\n\u201cAt the time I couldn\u2019t walk, so it was very serious,\u201d Martin says She was back on her feet, but not with fluidity, by last spring when she began taking Kai from Atkins.\n\n\u201cWhen I started with her I had some serious pain and balance problems,\u201d Martin says. \u201cMost of them are gone.\u201d In addition to massage, acupuncture and eating a healthy diet, Martin tries to go to Kai twice a week. She says the moves she practices with Atkins are improving her coordination.\n\n\u201cHer choreography involves patterns and movements that challenge my brain, so as I learn different movements my balance and body are getting stronger,\u201d Martin says. She sees a difference in how she walks, sits and gets through her day.\n\nKai is \u201ca whole new way to move your body,\u201d Martin says. \u201cIt encourages flexibility, it encourages strength, it encourages movement. But what I think Kelly does different is she honors an individual person\u2019s ability and place within the class.\u201d\n\nAtkins has come far on her own journey. In college, she was diagnosed with bulimia \u2014 eating large amounts of food and exercising it off \u2014 and worked to recover. She\u2019s taught aerobics, step class, kickboxing and powerlifting.\n\nIn the time since she created Kai, she\u2019s gained a new appreciation for herself and her own body.\n\nShe\u2019s also trained 40 Kai teachers around the United States and in Canada, Russia, the Czech Republic, and Turkey.\n\n\u201cKai appeals to students who are well-traveled, intellectual, who want more for their time, and are interested in mind-body practices such as yoga and meditation,\u201d she says. \u201cThe average person who comes doesn\u2019t like gyms or traditional fitness. But they come here, and they like it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2016/03/ATKINS.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdcfc\"", "article_summary": "In the time since she created Kai, she\u2019s gained a new appreciation for herself and her own body.\nI don\u2019t feel self-conscious.\nBy Juli Cragg Hilliard, correspondentAbout a dozen women form a circle in a darkened dance studio, but they don\u2019t start moving right off the bat.\n...
