That his policies are popular, they\u2019re common sense, they\u2019re constitutional, and that the only thing that\u2019s preventing them from going through is the intransigence of the Republicans and the gun lobby or some other effect \u2014 there\u2019s actually a problem with that.\n\nBecause when this president came to office, he had the House. He had the Senate. He had his own party there. He could have had any gun legislation that he wanted at that point that he was willing to push through. And so when it actually comes time to assess what sort of gun policy we have in this country, the president needs to look in the mirror. He\u2019s making this about him, but it really is about him. He chose instead to go after health care \u2014 to pass Obamacare \u2014 to use his political capitol in different ways.
