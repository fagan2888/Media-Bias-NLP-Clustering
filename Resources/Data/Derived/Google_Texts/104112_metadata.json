But it\u2019s also a big political issue, as well,\u201d Gregory asked. \u201cIs your party prepared to move with the president on this?\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama has requested $3.7 billion in aid for the border, but has not supported any changes to the current laws to stem the flow of immigrants flocking to the border. Graham had a different take than his fellow Republican Ted Cruz, but he believes the GOP vote on immigration will be crucial to the party\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cThere will be no money for supplemental without changes to the 2008 law.
