Kaiser Permanente does not have a facility in Santa Barbara County.\n\nThe new mileage requirement was established this year by each campus and depends on the accessibility of providers in the area local to campus, according to a statement from the UC Office of the President.\n\nThe mileage varies for each campus, from 175 miles at UC Davis, the widest radius, to 30 at UCSB, UC Berekley, UC Santa Cruz and UC Hastings College of the Law.\n\nMacias said she has questions about how that radius was decided upon, because the closest Kaiser primary-care facility from UCSB is 40 miles away in Ventura, just 10 miles outside of the radius.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not consistent across the board,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy is it set to 30 when it\u2019s only 40 miles away for Kaiser?\u201d\n\nMany people from the Bay Area have Kaiser insurance plans and Macias suspects many students and their parents might be surprised they\u2019ll be forced to buy the additional insurance this fall.\n\nDr. Mary Ferris, director of UCSB Student Health, sent a statement to Noozhawk about the plan, saying the distance requirements had been established by individual campuses based on medical resources available locally.\n\n\u201cAt UCSB, we have found it to be vitally important that students\u2019 health insurance be available for nonemergency local care, and not restricted to a distant county or another state,\u201d she said.\n\nBecause UCSB offers the Gaucho Health Insurance at a competitive price, Ferris said, \u201cthere is no profit for the university, and every attempt is made to control costs through continuous utilization evaluation and benefit design, based on the advice of students and other campus officials.\u201d\n\nDecisions about the Gaucho insurance plan at UCSB are made by an advisory committee that includes undergraduate and graduate students, deans and campus officials from various departments as members.\n\n\u201cThis committee strongly advocated for the mileage requirement based on past experiences with students who had inadequate local health insurance,\u201d Ferris said.\n\nMacias counters that her daughter has a car and would be able to drive to Ventura for primary-care visits, she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what all the pushback is,\u201d she said.\n\nLooking at the rates for the non-Gaucho Health Insurance costs, Macias said she\u2019s found it\u2019s $50 to see a doctor on campus.\n\n\u201cThat I can afford,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong what they\u2019re doing ... It\u2019s sort of a cash cow. If she never gets sick, they keep all that money.\u201d\n\nMacias has submitted a form asking UCSB to waive her daughter\u2019s need to purchase the insurance but has yet to hear back on whether school officials will approve it.\n\nShe suspects she\u2019ll probably have to change providers to avoid the costs, because the family is about $30,000 short for the costs of college, \u201cbut now I\u2019m $40,000 short.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk staff writer Lara Cooper can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .
