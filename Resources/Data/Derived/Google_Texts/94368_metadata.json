The ACA passed in 2010 and it\u2019s time to move people to better coverage,\u201d Mr. Plymell told Health News Colorado.\n\nThose holding non-compliant health-care policies will have 90 days\u2019 notice to switch plans, he said, but Republicans were nonetheless furious to learn of the cancellations.\n\nSen. Cory Gardner, Colorado Republican, urged state officials to reconsider and allow the non-compliant policies to stay in effect for another year, pointing out that \u201cColoradans were promised by supporters of this healthcare law that if they liked their plans, they could keep their plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am utterly appalled by this announcement. After all of the glitches, the increased costs and premiums, and the plan cancellations that Coloradans have already endured, the idea that the Division of Insurance would choose to cancel the healthcare plans of hundreds of thousands more people is unconscionable,\u201d Mr. Gardner said in a statement.\n\nMore than 340,000 Coloradans have seen their policies cancelled since the glitch-ridden Obamacare rollout in 2013. The cancellations dogged Democrats in the 2014 election, contributing to the defeat of former Democratic Sen. Mark Udall by Mr. Gardner.\n\nDemocratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, who won reelection in November, was consulted on the decision, Ms. Salazar told 9News in Denver.\n\nThe Democrat-led state House gave preliminary approval Friday to a bill for a comprehensive audit of Connect for Health Colorado. The Republican-controlled state Senate has already approved the bill, which follows a scathing limited audit released in December that faulted the exchange for sloppy financial controls and oversight.\n\nRep. Mike Coffman, Colorado Republican, said he has a personal stake in the issue: He signed up for health insurance on the state exchange and knows \u201cfirsthand how terrible the Obamacare coverage is.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama lied to the American people when he said \u2018if you like your plan you can keep your plan\u2019 and now Colorado families are being forced to bear the burden of that lie,\u201d Mr. Coffman told 9News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly 200,000 insured Coloradans will lose their health-care plans next year under the state's embattled Obamacare exchange, Connect for Health Colorado.", "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Nearly 200,000 insured Coloradans will lose their health-care plans next year under the state\u2019s embattled Obamacare exchange, Connect for Health Colorado.", "title": "Obamacare cancellations feared for nearly 200,000 Coloradans in 2016", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/14/obamacare-cancellations-feared-nearly-200000-color/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/07/obama-hands-ap-image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/07/obama-hands-ap-image.jpg", "title": "Obamacare cancellations feared for nearly 200,000 Coloradans in 2016", "description": "Nearly 200,000 insured Coloradans will lose their health-care plans next year under the state's embattled Obamacare exchange, Connect for Health Colorado.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Health Medical Pharma, Marguerite Salazar, Denver"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e33\"", "article_summary": "DENVER\u2014Nearly 200,000 insured Coloradans will lose their health-care plans next year under the state\u2019s embattled Obamacare exchange, Connect for Health Colorado.\nThe ACA passed in 2010 and it\u2019s time to move people to better coverage,\u201d Mr. Plymell told Health News Colorado.\nThe Democrat-led state House gave preliminary approval Friday to a bill for a comprehensive audit of Connect for Health Colorado.\nThose holding non-compliant health-care policies will have 90 days\u2019 notice to switch plans, he said, but Republicans were nonetheless furious to learn of the cancellations.\nMore than 340,000 Coloradans have seen their policies cancelled since the glitch-ridden Obamacare rollout in 2013."}
