That\u2019s an order.\n\nThe military junta that seized power here last month has no plans to restore civilian rule any time soon. But it has launched an official campaign to bring back something else it says this divided nation desperately needs \u2014 happiness.\n\nThe project has involved free concerts, free food, alluring female dancers in suggestive camouflage miniskirts, even the chance to pet horses trucked into downtown Bangkok with makeshift stables and bales of hay. The fair-like events are supposed to pave the way for reconciliation after a decade of political upheaval and coups.\n\nBut critics point out the feel-good project is being carried out alongside an entirely different junta-led campaign \u2014 an effort to stifle all opposition to the army\u2019s May 22 putsch, which deposed a government elected by a majority of Thai voters three years ago.\n\n\u201cThe very first question you have to ask is, who\u2019s happiness are they talking about?\u201d said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a Thai professor of Southeast Asian studies at Kyoto University who has refused to respond to a junta summons ordering him to return home and report to the army.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure this is not happiness for Thais who want a civilian government, whose rights were taken away by the coup,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal. And it\u2019s ridiculous to believe this will create an environment conducive to reconciliation. That can\u2019t happen when the military is harassing, hunting and detaining its enemies.\u201d\n\nLast month\u2019s coup, the twelfth in Thailand since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, ousted a civilian government accused of abuse of power and corruption that had increasingly been corned by protesters, the courts, and finally the army.\n\nThe junta says it had to restore order after half a year of political turmoil left dozens dead and the government paralyzed. And it insists it will be a neutral arbiter. But since taking power, the army appears to be carrying on the fight of the anti-government protesters by mapping out a similar agenda to redraft the constitution and institute political reforms before elections, and going after politicians from the grassroots Red Shirts movement who had vowed to take action if there was a coup.\n\nAlthough the junta has censored partisan media on both sides, it has begun prosecuting opponents and summoned hundreds of politicians \u2014 mostly those who supported the former government or were perceived as critical. The moves have forced some of the nation\u2019s most prominent activists and scholars to flee or go into hiding.\n\nDeputy army spokesman Col. Weerachon Sukondhapatipak said the clampdown was necessary because \u201cif you let people talk at the moment, they will talk with emotion, they will be very critical.\u201d\n\nThe aim of the project, dubbed \u201cReturn Happiness to the People\u201d by the military, is to get people \u201cto relax,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create an atmosphere to gain trust and build confidence. That is the plan.\u201d\n\nAnd the junta is serious about it.\n\nThe weekly radio address of military ruler Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha is now titled, \u201cBringing Back Happiness to the Nation.\u201d It is also now prefaced with a new song Prayuth commissioned called \u201cReturn Happiness to Thailand.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cheer up, Thailand!
