The vast majority of all grandfathered plans sold in Maine were Anthem plans, according to bureau filings.\n\nIn most cases, the new plans will be less expensive than the grandfathered policies, said Anthem spokesman Rory Sheehan. Switching to the ACA plans will save the 3,800 on grandfathered plans a total of about $7.5 million in premiums, he said.\n\n\u201cFor many legacy policyholders, they can already get an ACA plan that is less expensive and has richer benefits,\u201d Sheehan said. That\u2019s because those few remaining on the grandfathered plans tend to be sicker, older and in smaller risk pools. Insurers were prohibited from selling non-ACA plans starting in 2010.\n\nThe cost of the grandfathered plans also has been increasing \u2013 by 18 percent for 2016, on top of 13 percent for 2015.\n\nSheehan provided several examples in which people could save money \u2013 as much as $300 to $400 per month in premiums \u2013 while still having similar or lower deductibles and co-pays.\n\nUnder one scenario, a 42-year-old in Cumberland County paying a $707 monthly premium with a $5,000 deductible would see her premiums fall to $302 while having a $5,150 deductible.\n\nAnother group of non-ACA individual plans, called \u201cgrandmothered plans,\u201d were those purchased between 2010 and Oct. 1, 2013, when people could first begin purchasing individual insurance on the marketplace at www.healthcare.gov. Federal law requires that those plans be phased out by 2017. About 3,150 people have an Anthem grandmothered plan.\n\nSheehan said that although Anthem will automatically switch the 7,000 or so with grandfathered and grandmothered plans to a similar, ACA-compliant individual plan, customers are encouraged to shop around and see what kind of plan best suits their needs, and to check if they qualify for premium subsidies. The subsidies are available for single people earning up to about $47,000 per year.\n\nSome may not realize they qualify for subsidies in the health insurance marketplace, Sheehan said.\n\nThe ACA marketplace is where people who have no insurance \u2013 often part-time or self-employed workers \u2013 can obtain benefits. About 87 percent of the 75,000 Mainers who have purchased plans on the exchange qualify for a subsidy.\n\nEmily Brostek, executive director of Consumers for Affordable Health Care, an Augusta-based health advocacy group, said the ACA outlawed high-deductible plans and plans that discouraged people from accessing preventive medicine \u2013 such as preventive screenings, primary care visits, and mental health and substance abuse treatment. Individual insurance plans often had high deductibles.\n\n\u201cThe ACA redefined what is considered health insurance,\u201d Brostek said. She said that before the ACA went into effect, people would purchase high-deductible plans thinking they had insurance coverage, only to find out that once they fell ill, most of the costs were borne by them and not the insurance company.\n\n\u201cPeople are not good at predicting what health needs they might have in the future,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Replacing the old policies, which pre-date Obamacare, will save most customers money on premiums, the insurer says.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Replacing the old policies, which pre-date Obamacare, will save most customers money on premiums, the insurer says.", "title": "Anthem to end individual health plans that don't comply with Affordable Care Act - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "updated_time": "2015-12-08T07:56:11-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/12/07/anthem-to-end-individual-health-plans-that-dont-comply-with-aca/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Replacing the old policies, which pre-date Obamacare, will save most customers money on premiums, the insurer says.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "title": "Anthem to end individual health plans that don't comply with Affordable Care Act - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-12-07T21:48:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-08T07:56:11-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba73\"", "article_summary": "The vast majority of all grandfathered plans sold in Maine were Anthem plans, according to bureau filings.\nAnthem Blue Cross Blue Shield aims to phase out its \u201cgrandfathered\u201d individual insurance plans that are not compliant with Affordable Care Act standards, company officials said Monday.\nSwitching to the ACA plans will save the 3,800 on grandfathered plans a total of about $7.5 million in premiums, he said.\nPeople with grandfathered individual plans would be automatically switched to a similar one by Jan. 1, 2017, if they don\u2019t purchase another plan.\nAnother group of non-ACA individual plans, called \u201cgrandmothered plans,\u201d were those purchased between 2010 and Oct. 1, 2013, when people could first begin purchasing individual insurance on the marketplace at www.healthcare.gov."}
