We\u2019ve become all too used to that now. Some of these things should probably be taken with a grain of salt \u2014 \u201cOnly Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u201d comes to mind \u2014 but some deserve to be analyzed more closely.\n\nHere\u2019s an example. Remember Trump\u2019s discussion about Supreme Court Justices back in August with Bloomberg Politics? Mark Halperin asked Trump, \u201cIs there someone out there today who isn\u2019t on the [Supreme Court], but say, this is the kind of person I would consider for the court? How about your sister? Think she\u2019d be a good Supreme Court Justice?\u201d\n\nTrump responded, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to mention names, I think it\u2019s inappropriate to mention names, certainly at this stage so early when we have a long way to go. Oh, my sister\u2019s great. I have a sister who\u2019s on the Court of Appeals and she\u2019s fantastic. I think she would be phenomenal. I think she would be one of the best. But frankly, uh, I think she \u2014 we\u2019ll have to rule that out now, at least temporarily. But I do have a sister who\u2019s very smart and a very good person.\u201d\n\nTrump has generally been coy about Supreme Court justices, avoiding specifics and certainly not giving any insight into his personal litmus test or whether he even has one. He has praised Justice Clarence Thomas as \u201cstrong and consistent,\u201d while calling Chief Justice John Roberts \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d He recently criticized Justice Antonin Scalia for his comments opposing affirmative action during a Supreme Court hearing.\n\nBut outside vague statements of support or opposition, he has said very little about case law. Would he appoint justices that would overturn Roe v. Wade? Does he believe the Obergefell v. Hodges case\u2019s radical finding of a constitutional right to gay marriage was based on sound jurisprudence? What about Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, or NFIB v. Sebelius?\n\nHonestly, we have no idea.\n\nSo let\u2019s go off of what we know \u2014 he loves his sister and thinks she would be a \u201cphenomenal\u201d Supreme Court Justice. Let\u2019s take a look at Judge Maryanne Trump Barry of the Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.\n\nBarry was appointed to the Third Circuit in 1999 by President Bill Clinton, even though she identified as a Republican. She was unanimously confirmed by the U.S Senate later that year.\n\nShe has been involved in hundreds of cases, but one of the first cases in her tenure sticks out the most: Planned Parenthood of Central New Jersey v. Farmer, which was argued in late 1999 and filed in July 2000.The Third Circuit struck down the New Jersey Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997, and Barry wrote in her majority opinion that the law \u201cplaces an undue burden on a woman\u2019s constitutional right to obtain an abortion.\u201d\n\nBarry didn\u2019t stop there. She continued by giving a full-throated defense for legalizing infanticide:\n\n\u201cThe Legislature\u2019s argument that Roe and Casey are inapplicable to \u2018partial-birth\u201d abortion procedures because such procedures are infanticide rather than abortion is based on semantic machinations, irrational line-drawing, and an obvious attempt to inflame public opinion instead of logic or medical evidence,\u201d Barry wrote.\n\n\u201c\u2026In what can only be described as a desperate attempt to circumvent over twenty-five years of abortion jurisprudence, the Legislature would draw a line based upon the location in the woman\u2019s body where the fetus expires,\u201d Barry continued. \u201cEstablishing the cervix as the demarcation line between abortion and infanticide is nonsensical on its face as well as inaccurate because that line may be crossed in any number of abortion procedures which the Legislature concedes are constitutionally protected.\u2026 The Legislature\u2019s attempt to label the Act a birth, instead of an abortion, regulation is nothing more than an effort to cloud the issues and avoid clear precedent.\u201d\n\nWow \u2014 all that coming from a \u201cRepublican\u201d judge! Barry\u2019s argument was essentially a legal defense of a birth not being a birth unless the person giving birth desires it to be a birth. According to Judge Barry, there should be no other considerations \u2014 and none whatsoever for the living, breathing child itself.\n\nAnd this is who Donald Trump thinks of first for a Supreme Court Justice nominee?\n\nClarity is sorely needed. Donald Trump is the Republican frontrunner, and Iowa is a little more than a month away. Is Maryanne Trump Barry the type of Supreme Court justice he plans on appointing? Someone who will hand down constitutional rulings to protect infanticide \u2014 the literal murder of living, breathing children outside the womb?\n\nThis is very important. The Republican Party has had a rough history with appointing Supreme Court Justices. While Democratic Presidents have done a good job at appointing sure votes for liberal causes, Republican Presidents have had mixed results \u2014 Anthony Kennedy (Reagan) has always been a shaky vote, and John Roberts (George W. Bush) helped make Obamacare the law of the land. We would do well, if we get a Republican President in 2017, to nominate justices that will defend life, respect religious liberty, and adhere to the constitutional principles that helped make America so great.\n\nDonald Trump may very well be that nominee. But will he appoint Supreme Court Justices in the same vein as his sister, who has defended abortion as a judge up to the moment of birth and beyond? Or will he appoint a more conservative voice like Justice Thomas, who Trump has gone out of his way to praise repeatedly?\n\nWe don\u2019t know. And we need to know.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And this is who Donald Trump thinks of first for a Supreme Court Justice nominee?\nIs Maryanne Trump Barry the type of Supreme Court justice he plans on appointing?\nRemember Trump\u2019s discussion about Supreme Court Justices back in August with Bloomberg Politics?\nSo let\u2019s go off of what we know \u2014 he loves his sister and thinks she would be a \u201cphenomenal\u201d Supreme Court Justice.\nMark Halperin asked Trump, \u201cIs there someone out there today who isn\u2019t on the [Supreme Court], but say, this is the kind of person I would consider for the court?"}
