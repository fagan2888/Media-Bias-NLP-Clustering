Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., Yellen said the Fed will not be bound by set benchmarks or guidelines such as the Taylor rule that prescribes rates depending on economic milestones.\n\n\u201cWhat does the world have to look like in order for the Federal Reserve to start considering transitioning to a rules-based system,\u201d Mulvaney asked.\n\nThe Taylor Rule is a monetary-policy rule that stipulates how much the central bank should change the nominal interest rate in response to changes in inflation, output, or other economic conditions.\n\n\u201cI believe and I think most of my colleagues agree that we shouldn\u2019t mechanically follow (the Taylor Rule) or any rule,\u201d Yellen responded.\n\nRep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Tex., committee chairman, struck a combative tone from the start, telling Yellen that the economy is in a phony recovery that hasn\u2019t materialized for most Americans.\n\nHensarling blamed \u201cthe crushing regulatory onslaught\u201d of Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank and the EPA for hamstringing the economy. \u201cThe Fed cannot substantially help our economy, it can only hurt it,\u201d the chair added.\n\n\u201cI do feel compelled to demand that the Fed adopt a monetary policy that is predictable, transparent, sustainable and barring terribly exigent circumstances, to stick with it,\u201d Hensarling said.\n\nIn December, the Fed raised interest rates for the first time in about seven years, ending a lengthy run of a near-zero rate. At the time, speculation focused on four more hikes this year. That has since been downplayed amid the risks cited by Yellen and continued low inflation.\n\nInsuranceNewsNet Senior Editor John Hilton has covered business and other beats in more than 20 years of daily journalism.
