The ad shows the record-setting positive reaction to Cruz during the debate, and the robust favorable review on Twitter during and after the debate by nationally-known conservative radio hosts, television personalities, and writers of top-tier media outlets.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTitled, \u201cWhen the Media Attacks, Ted Fights Back!,\u201d the ad shows video where Senator Cruz goes on the offensive against the left media\u2019s bias on display during the CNBC debate between the Republican presidential candidates. One candidate after another was asked agenda-driven questions that were biased and demeaning. When the time came for Cruz\u2019s turn in the barrel, he turned the table and eviscerated the moderators from the CNBC panel.\n\nThe ad features Cruz\u2019s response to their line of questioning. \u201cLet me say something at the outset. The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don\u2019t trust the media. This is not a cage match,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, you look at the questions \u2013 Donald Trump, are you a comic book villain? Ben Carson, can you do math? John Kasich, will you insult two people over here? Marco Rubio, why don\u2019t you resign? Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen? How about talking about the substantive issues people care about?\u201d\n\nHe then compared the questions asked at this debate to those asked during the Democrat debate. \u201cThe contrast with the Democratic debate,\u201d Cruz described, \u201cwhere every fawning question from the media was \u2013 \u2018Which of you is more handsome and wise?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe ad then shows conservative media responses from nationally known conservatives including Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Hugh Hewitt, Mark R.

Ted Cruz Eviscerates Left Media in Debate,\u201d Shadwick tweeted, attaching her Breitbart Texas article bearing the same title as her tweet. Her tweet appears at about the 56 second mark in the ad video above.\n\nBeck tweeted, \u201cNow I know what a Cruz missile sounds like. (Ted takes on the MSM).\u201d Hannity tweeted at Laura Ingraham and Ted Cruz saying \u201c@tedcruz absolutely nailed it.\u201d Hugh Hewitt tweeted, \u201cI think @tedcruz is winning millions of votes right now.\u201d Bozell brought it home tweeting, \u201cCruz just hit it out of the park. CNBC has no idea what just hit it.\u201d Mark R. Levin retweeted an article titled \u201cTed Cruz Smacks Down Biased Moderators,\u201d adding \u201cAmen!\u201d\n\nDuring the Fox News Channel post-debate coverage, pollster Frank Luntz said Cruz\u2019s response to the moderators received a record-breaking 98 percent response.\n\nThe Cruz ad shows Luntz on CBS This Morning saying, \u201cIt did the best of anything that I have tested since I started doing debate testing in 1996.\u201d\n\nThe Cruz ad winds up with his quote from the debate where he praised his fellow Republican candidates. \u201cThe men and women on this stage,\u201d Cruz began, \u201chave more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks,\u201d Cruz concluded in a quote that sent many scrambling to Google for clarification.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new ad for Ted Cruz shows his epic woodshedding of the leftist media during the GOP debate and the record-setting positive reaction to it.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "A new ad for Ted Cruz shows his epic woodshedding of the leftist media during the GOP debate and the record-setting positive reaction to it.", "title": "New Ted Cruz Ad Highlights Reaction to His Debate Blast on Left Media", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Ted-Cruz-at-Debate-CNBC.png", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/01/new-ted-cruz-ad-highlights-reaction-debate-blast-left-media/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new ad for Ted Cruz shows his epic woodshedding of the leftist media during the GOP debate and the record-setting positive reaction to it.", "title": "New Ted Cruz Ad Highlights Reaction to His Debate Blast on Left Media", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Ted-Cruz-at-Debate-CNBC.png", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 Presidential Candidates, 2016 Republican Presidential Primary, Brent Bozell, CNBC, CNBC presidential debate, CNN Democratic debate, Frank Luntz, Hugh Hewitt, Lana Shadwick, Laura Ingraham, Mark Levin, Media Bias, Republican Presidential Candidates' Debate, Sean Hannity, Ted Cruz,Big Government, Big Journalism, Breitbart Texas,Cruz ad", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-11-01T09:19:48-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Big Journalism,Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Ted Cruz Eviscerates Left Media in Debate,\u201d Shadwick tweeted, attaching her Breitbart Texas article bearing the same title as her tweet.\nThe Cruz ad shows Luntz on CBS This Morning saying, \u201cIt did the best of anything that I have tested since I started doing debate testing in 1996.\u201dThe Cruz ad winds up with his quote from the debate where he praised his fellow Republican candidates.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA new advertisement for Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz highlights Cruz\u2019 epic woodshedding of the leftist media for its bias on display during the CNBC GOP Presidential Debate, and the CNN Democratic debate.\nHow about talking about the substantive issues people care about?\u201dHe then compared the questions asked at this debate to those asked during the Democrat debate.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTitled, \u201cWhen the Media Attacks, Ted Fights Back!,\u201d the ad shows video where Senator Cruz goes on the offensive against the left media\u2019s bias on display during the CNBC debate between the Republican presidential candidates."}
