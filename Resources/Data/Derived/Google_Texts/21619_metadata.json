The 2014 second-round pick played eight games last season but was targeted only four times and had two receptions that averaged out to 11.5 yards apiece.\n\nSo he found his reps elsewhere.\n\nLatimer joined Manning and some of his Broncos teammates at the quarterback\u2019s annual Duke workouts in early April. He absorbed the advice of veterans, including Emmanuel Sanders, throughout mini camp and organized team activities. And for the better part of the offseason, Latimer has been tabbed the Broncos\u2019 Player to Watch in 2015.\n\n\u201cStarting from Duke to here, OTAs \u2014 we never got to run with the ones,\u201d Latimer said. \u201cIt\u2019s been good. Time has been good. Like I said, there\u2019s always stuff we can work on. We\u2019re trying to get better every day.\u201d\n\nAlthough Latimer said he\u2019s striving for day-to-day improvements and is grateful for the reps with Manning and the first unit, those around him have seen potential for more.\n\nWith No. 1 receiver Demaryius Thomas absent from the team\u2019s offseason workouts because of contract negotiations, Sanders took the time to help bring up Latimer and some of the Broncos\u2019 younger wideouts. The Broncos may only be three days into camp, but Sanders has seen many more days of Latimer at work.\n\nHis assessment?\n\n\u201cYou want to talk about a guy who\u2019s a physical tool just like Demaryius Thomas? I feel like coming in with the rookie class of Odell Beckham, Jarvis Landry, Mike Evans and all those guys, he feels like he\u2019s kind of overlooked,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI\u2019m big on Cody. He\u2019s strong, he\u2019s fast and I think that\u2019s he\u2019s going to come in and he\u2019s going to have a big year for us. I\u2019m looking forward to him just taking off and showing everybody, \u2018Hey, look at (No.) 14 over here from the Denver Broncos.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cody Latimer,Demaryius Thomas,Denver Broncos,Emmanuel Sanders,Offseason,OTAs,Peyton Manning", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Broncos veteran Emmanuel Sanders believes second-year receiver Cody Latimer has been overlooked among the young, elite receivers in the NFL.", "title": "Cody Latimer overlooked?
