But do taxpayers realize exactly where their money is going?\n\nThe National Priorities Project\u2019s annual breakdown of income tax spending by the federal government showed that the average American paid nearly $13,000 in federal income taxes in 2015. However, it was less in Michigan, at about $10,500, according to Lindsay Koshgarian, the project\u2019s research director.\n\n\u201cA little over $3,000 of that went to health care and about $1,300 of that went to Medicaid. About $2,700 went to the military,\u201d she said, \u201cand if you look at education spending, about $88 went to elementary and secondary education.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analysis, health-care spending for the first time was more than military spending. Koshgarian said that\u2019s because the costs of health care keep rising.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s connected to things like the government\u2019s inability to negotiate drug prices through Medicaid, and it\u2019s also because there\u2019s been a big expansion in Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot more people are now receiving Medicaid, and right now this cost is being picked up by the federal government, and we\u2019re seeing that in our tax dollars.\u201d\n\nKoshgarian said it\u2019s important to keep in mind that these dollars are spent for the benefit of the taxpayers, with about $100 billion flowing back into Michigan.\n\n\u201cThat was for things like grants to the state government, federal employees who live in Michigan, federal contracts to Michigan businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cSo dollars that you\u2019re spending in your tax dollars really do come back and benefit your state and benefit your community in many ways, and I think that\u2019s something that we always think about at tax time.\u201d\n\nIncome taxes are the biggest source of federal revenue, which Koshgarian said essentially means taxpayers pay the federal government\u2019s bills. She said that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for anyone who pays taxes to know exactly how their dollars are being spent.\n\nMichigan\u2019s tax receipt is online at nationalpriorities.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "News/Talk 94.9 WSJM", "description": "Some Michiganders will be spending the weekend crunching the numbers on their tax returns ahead of Monday\u2019s deadline.
