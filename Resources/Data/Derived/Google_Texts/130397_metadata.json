The detention facility is located at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, which holds some 2,000 women and children from Central America who had entered the U.S. through Mexico seeking asylum.\n\nICE claims that there will likely be little to no side effects of the vaccine \u2014 even though it was the wrong amount. If anything, the officials said, it might cause a stronger immune response, according to the AP.\n\n\u201cParents at the facility were advised and counseled by medical professionals about potential side effects, with services made available in multiple languages,\u201d Richard Rocha, ICE spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nBut immigration advocates believe this mistake is yet another example of poor health care given to immigrants in detention facilities. \u201cVolunteer attorneys at Dilley, as well as those at similar detention centers in Karnes, TX, Berks, PA and the previous facility in Artesia, NM, have long noted disturbing patterns of what appears to be inadequate health care for the women and children,\u201d Crystal Williams, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said in a statement. \u201cThis latest permutation is beyond appalling \u2014 it is putting children at risk not just for short-term reactions but for unknown long-term risks.\u201d\n\nHepatitis A is a contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. Contaminated food or water, or close contact with an infected person, can get you sick with the virus. The vaccine is recommended by the CDC for all children at about age 1, though the doses prescribed to babies are different than those prescribed to adults.\n\nHere\u2019s why it\u2019s important that age is taken into consideration when it comes to vaccination doses: There\u2019s often a specific time period when it\u2019s best to give infants or young children vaccines. For example, for quite some time the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that rotavirus vaccines be given to children at age 6 to 15 weeks, and the maximum age for the last dose of the vaccine should be 32 weeks. There is some flexibility with the age restriction for the rotavirus vaccine, especially since many kids in developing countries don\u2019t have access to the vaccine that early in life \u2014 or specifically between 6 to 35 weeks. Even though getting the vaccine outside of that 6- to 32-week time frame creates a higher risk of intussusception \u2014 one section of the intestine sliding into another \u2014 WHO health officials deemed the risks smaller than the benefits of extending the age restriction.\n\nThe CDC has recommendations for other types of vaccines, including diphtheria, Hepatitis B, HPV, flu, and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR). In general, these guidelines are in place to ensure the vaccine works most effectively and with the least side effects. Adults have different guidelines, doses, and intervals between doses than children.\n\nIn the case of the immigrant children receiving adult doses, while many side effects will likely not occur, it\u2019s important to remember that these guidelines are in place for a reason.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hepatitis a, vaccine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Immigrant children being held at a detention facility in Texas were given adult doses of a hepatitis A vaccine, but officials claim none have had adverse effects from the mistake.", "title": "250 Kids Receive Adult Dose Of Hepatitis A Vaccine", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/immigrant-kids-texas-receive-adult-dose-hepatitis-vaccine-why-vaccine-age-341372", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/06/vaccination.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Immigrant children being held at a detention facility in Texas were given adult doses of a hepatitis A vaccine, but officials claim none have had adverse effects from the mistake.", "title": "250 Kids Receive Adult Dose Of Hepatitis A Vaccine", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/immigrant-kids-texas-receive-adult-dose-hepatitis-vaccine-why-vaccine-age-341372", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/06/vaccination.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/06/vaccination.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-06T15:13:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T15:13:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Immigrant children being held at a detention facility in Texas were given adult doses of a hepatitis A vaccine, but officials claim none have had adverse effects from the mistake."}, "article_summary": "Some 250 immigrant children at a Texas detention facility were given adult doses of a hepatitis A vaccine, when the prescribed amount for adults is about twice the amount typically prescribed for children.\nICE claims that there will likely be little to no side effects of the vaccine \u2014 even though it was the wrong amount.\nThe vaccine is recommended by the CDC for all children at about age 1, though the doses prescribed to babies are different than those prescribed to adults.\nThe detention facility is located at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, which holds some 2,000 women and children from Central America who had entered the U.S. through Mexico seeking asylum.\nIn general, these guidelines are in place to ensure the vaccine works most effectively and with the least side effects."}
