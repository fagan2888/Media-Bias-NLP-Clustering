The clinic is part of Ellis Medical Group. ED BURKE \u2014 THE SARATOGIAN\n\nmalta >> Price Chopper, QuickCare and Ellis Medicine have partnered to open in-store clinics at the supermarket chain\u2019s Malta and Latham locations.\n\nThe three organizations created this first-of-its-kind collaboration in the Capital Region to offer residents access to more efficient healthcare. QuickCare centers, staffed by an Ellis Medicine nurse practitioner, physician or physician\u2019s assistant, are walk-in health clinics that offer patients immediate help for common illnesses and provide some well-care and screening services.\n\nThe healthcare centers are adjacent to the pharmacy departments in the Malta and Latham Price Choppers. No appointments are necessary to be seen by a healthcare provider.\n\n\u201cHelping people get access to health care in a place close to them and a part of their regular routines just makes sense in this new age of healthcare delivery,\u201d wrote Dr. David Liebers, medical director of QuickCare, in a press release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIllnesses and ailments that can be diagnosed and treated at QuickCare include allergies, congestion, coughs, earaches, flu-like symptoms, muscle aches and pains, motion sickness, pink eye or styes, respiratory and sinus infections, sore or strep throat and urinary tract infections. QuickCare also offers sports physicals. Both centers will be open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\n\u201cThe convenient hours and location next to full-service pharmacies make these QuickCare centers tremendously accessible for people who are already in our stores shopping for orange juice, cold medicine or chicken soup. We\u2019re very pleased to be offering our customers another convenience that will help them live healthier lives,\u201d Price Chopper Executive Chairman of the Board Neil Golub wrote.\n\nAfter seeing a healthcare professional at the clinic, patients who need a prescription filled are only steps away from Price Chopper\u2019s full-service pharmacy.\n\n\u201cQuickCare fits with the vision of the Affordable Care Act to break down barriers to health care by moving that care into communities \u2014 making it more accessible,\u201d wrote Ellis President and CEO James W. Connolly. \u201cThese centers will help meet the increased number of patients seeking healthcare resources.\u201d\n\nQuickCare currently accepts CDPHP insurance; co-pays are based on the member\u2019s plan. For patients who are not CDPHP members, a payment of $40 is due at time of service.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Business, Business news, Troy Business news, NY Business news, US Business news, world Business news.", "title": "Price Chopper opens clinics in Malta, Latham", "og": {"url": "http://www.troyrecord.com/article/TR/20140220/NEWS/140229941", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.troyrecord.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/TR/20140220/NEWS/140229941/AR/0/AR-140229941.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "968px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Price Chopper opens clinics in Malta, Latham"}, "twitter": {"domain": "troyrecord.com", "description": "malta >> Price Chopper, QuickCare and Ellis Medicine have partnered to open in-store clinics at the supermarket chain\u2019s Malta and Latham locations.", "title": "Price Chopper opens clinics in Malta, Latham", "url": "http://www.troyrecord.com/article/TR/20140220/NEWS/140229941", "image": {"src": "http://www.troyrecord.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/TR/20140220/NEWS/140229941/AR/0/AR-140229941.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@troyrecord", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id571785254", "iphone": "id520232370", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.record"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Business, Business news, Troy Business news, NY Business news, US Business news, world Business news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "malta >> Price Chopper, QuickCare and Ellis Medicine have partnered to open in-store clinics at the supermarket chain\u2019s Malta and Latham locations."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde2ad\"", "article_summary": "ED BURKE \u2014 THE SARATOGIANmalta >> Price Chopper, QuickCare and Ellis Medicine have partnered to open in-store clinics at the supermarket chain\u2019s Malta and Latham locations.\nThe healthcare centers are adjacent to the pharmacy departments in the Malta and Latham Price Choppers.\nNurse Practitioner Sandy Perdek, left, and Physician\u2019s Assistant Tatiana Mazur in the examination room within the Quickcare clinic at Price Chopper in Malta.\nQuickCare centers, staffed by an Ellis Medicine nurse practitioner, physician or physician\u2019s assistant, are walk-in health clinics that offer patients immediate help for common illnesses and provide some well-care and screening services.\n\u201cThese centers will help meet the increased number of patients seeking healthcare resources.\u201dQuickCare currently accepts CDPHP insurance; co-pays are based on the member\u2019s plan."}
