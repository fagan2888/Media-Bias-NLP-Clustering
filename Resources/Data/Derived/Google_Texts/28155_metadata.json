Her fath\u00ader was a star quar\u00adter\u00adback on the Uni\u00adversity of Alabama\u2019s foot\u00adball team. Her moth\u00ader was a cheer\u00adlead\u00ader. She is an elec\u00adted mem\u00adber of the state school board and is of\u00adten men\u00adtioned as a pos\u00adsible gubernat\u00adori\u00adal can\u00addid\u00adate.\n\nIf only she can sur\u00advive the tea party\u2019s quest to end her ca\u00adreer.\n\nThat wing of the party really doesn\u2019t like Hunter. Tea parti\u00aders use words like \u201cdim\u00adwit\u201d\u009d and \u201cli\u00adar\u201d\u009d to de\u00adscribe her. They\u2019ve pub\u00adlicly cen\u00adsured her. They tried to take her name off the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan primary bal\u00adlot. They say she talks down to them and her motives are sus\u00adpect. She doesn\u2019t even use her hus\u00adband\u2019s name, her crit\u00adics say, be\u00adcause she\u2019s try\u00ading to cash in on re\u00adcog\u00adni\u00adtion of her quar\u00adter\u00adback hero fath\u00ader. \u201cI could give a rat\u2019s bell who her fath\u00ader was,\u201d\u009d says Penny Melton, mem\u00adber of a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan wo\u00admen\u2019s group wa\u00adging a cam\u00adpaign against her.\n\nAll of this vit\u00adri\u00adol stems from Hunter\u2019s sup\u00adport for the Com\u00admon Core edu\u00adca\u00adtion stand\u00adards that tea-party con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives see as big-busi\u00adness and big-gov\u00adern\u00adment en\u00adcroach\u00adment. It al\u00admost doesn\u2019t mat\u00adter wheth\u00ader they are right.\n\nFrom Alabama and Ten\u00adness\u00adee to In\u00addi\u00adana and Wis\u00adcon\u00adsin, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans don\u2019t have much left to fight about. They con\u00adtrol the gov\u00adernors\u2019 of\u00adfices and the state le\u00adgis\u00adlatures. They all hate Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama. They all hate Obama\u00adcare. They all hate en\u00adti\u00adtle\u00adments and the wel\u00adfare state. They all hate the debt and gov\u00adern\u00adment spend\u00ading and uni\u00adons. That leaves Com\u00admon Core, unique as a state is\u00adsue among the typ\u00adic\u00adally fed\u00ader\u00adal dis\u00adputes that di\u00advide es\u00adtab\u00adlish\u00adment Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans and their tea-party in\u00adsur\u00adgents.\n\nIn Alabama \u2014 and oth\u00ader cen\u00adters of con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive ex\u00adtrem\u00adism around the coun\u00adtry \u2014 the stand\u00adards are part of a pur\u00adging from the loc\u00adal ranks of any per\u00adson who doesn\u2019t fall in line on every piece of the party plat\u00adform. For loc\u00adal politi\u00adcians throughout the na\u00adtion, Com\u00admon Core is the fi\u00adnal pur\u00adity test that some de\u00admand party mem\u00adbers meet if they want to avoid be\u00ading ex\u00adpelled.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Hunter who\u2019s been tar\u00adgeted in Alabama. Tea-party groups also des\u00adpise state Su\u00adper\u00adin\u00adtend\u00adent of Edu\u00adca\u00adtion Tommy Bice, de\u00adscribed as \u201cslick as glass\u201d\u009d by one tea parti\u00ader, as well as state Sen\u00adate Pres\u00adid\u00adent Pro Tem Del Marsh, who blocked an anti-Com\u00admon-Core bill from com\u00ading to the floor last year and earned the title \u201cThe Harry Re\u00adid of Alabama\u201d\u009d for it.\n\nIn Wis\u00adcon\u00adsin, even con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive Gov. Scott Walk\u00ader is a tar\u00adget. A tea-party phone-in cam\u00adpaign tried to pres\u00adsure the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan ex\u00adec\u00adut\u00adive to an\u00adnounce in his State of the State ad\u00address that he would stop im\u00adple\u00adment\u00ading Com\u00admon Core. He didn\u2019t, and now it\u2019s the Wis\u00adcon\u00adsin tea party\u2019s top pri\u00ador\u00adity.\n\nIn Ohio, a pub\u00adlic hear\u00ading on a state bill to re\u00adpeal Com\u00admon Core las\u00adted six hours, un\u00adtil 1 a.m., be\u00adcause angry tea parti\u00aders were lin\u00ading up to give House Edu\u00adca\u00adtion Com\u00admit\u00adtee Chair\u00adman Ger\u00adald Stebelton a piece of their minds. The Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan was dubbed \u201cStompy\u00adfeet Stebelton\u201d\u009d by the tea-party-af\u00adfil\u00adi\u00adated group Edu\u00adca\u00adtion Free\u00addom Ohio for his lack of en\u00adthu\u00adsi\u00adasm for re\u00adpeal\u00ading Com\u00admon Core.\n\nStebelton is term-lim\u00adited after this year, so tea-party groups are fo\u00adcus\u00ading on John Kasich, Ohio\u2019s GOP gov\u00adernor, who is up for reelec\u00adtion and has back\u00adtracked on his ini\u00adtial sup\u00adport for Com\u00admon Core. They are push\u00ading him to say he sup\u00adports le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion to re\u00adpeal it.\n\nIn Ten\u00adness\u00adee, sup\u00adport for Com\u00admon Core has got\u00adten Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Gov. Bill Haslam and state Edu\u00adca\u00adtion Com\u00admis\u00adsion\u00ader Kev\u00adin Huff\u00adman in trouble, and in In\u00addi\u00adana, state Su\u00adper\u00adin\u00adtend\u00adent Tony Ben\u00adnett lost his job.\n\nThis might all look like a fight over edu\u00adca\u00adtion stand\u00adards. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s a battle for con\u00adtrol of the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party. And in that fight, people like Hunter, Bice, Marsh, Walk\u00ader, Haslam, Huff\u00adman, and Ben\u00adnett are the cap\u00adtives.\n\nFER\u00adTILE GROUND\n\nThe Com\u00admon Core school stand\u00adards are an un\u00adusu\u00adally fer\u00adtile lit\u00admus test to as\u00adsess Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans\u2019 pur\u00adity. The stand\u00adards are massive. They are a series of grade-by-grade bench\u00admarks in math and read\u00ading that are meant to be stacked onto one an\u00adoth\u00ader such that achieve\u00adment of Grade 1 levels nat\u00adur\u00adally flow in\u00adto the tasks for Grade 2. In the\u00adory, all kids who learn along Com\u00admon Core lines will be ready for col\u00adlege or a ca\u00adreer by the time they gradu\u00adate from high school. But there\u2019s a thou\u00adsand things about them \u2014 some ac\u00adcur\u00adate, some wildly hy\u00adpo\u00adthet\u00adic\u00adal \u2014 that arouse sus\u00adpi\u00adcion. To wit, the stand\u00adards call for chil\u00addren to be trained and tested on com\u00adputers. Lo and be\u00adhold, a big back\u00ader of Com\u00admon Core is Mi\u00adcrosoft ty\u00adcoon Bill Gates.\n\n\u201cWhen you see that kind of thing, you\u2019re like, \u201c\u02dcWait a minute. You\u2019re go\u00ading to do away with text\u00adbooks,\u2019 \u201c\u009d says Ann Eu\u00adbank, the le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adive chair of the Rainy Day Pat\u00adri\u00adots, an Alabama tea-party group. She has com\u00adpiled \u201c3 feet of re\u00adsearch\u201d\u009d on the rot\u00adten\u00adness of Com\u00admon Core \u2014 show\u00ading, among oth\u00ader things, that the en\u00adtire sys\u00adtem is built to make com\u00adputer mag\u00adnates rich. \u201cFol\u00adlow the money,\u201d\u009d she in\u00adstructs.\n\nHunter be\u00adcame the sym\u00adbol of Alabama\u2019s GOP fric\u00adtion last Au\u00adgust, when the Madis\u00adon County Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans took the un\u00adusu\u00adal step of cen\u00adsur\u00ading her for \u201cderel\u00adic\u00adtion of duty.\u201d\u009d Her crime was re\u00adfus\u00ading to sup\u00adport le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion that would have re\u00adpealed Alabama\u2019s ad\u00adop\u00adtion of Com\u00admon Core. \u201cWe all were dog\u00adging her, and we thought she was go\u00ading to go down there and vote our way. No, she voted for Com\u00admon Core. She didn\u2019t stand up for us,\u201d\u009d says Dean John\u00adson, a Hunts\u00adville law\u00adyer who spear\u00adheaded the county party\u2019s ef\u00adfort to name Hunter in the cen\u00adsure.\n\nAnd now she has dug in. Us\u00ading her talk\u00ading points about Alabama\u2019s stand\u00adards, Hunter launched her cam\u00adpaign for reelec\u00adtion last Novem\u00adber in a race that her op\u00adpon\u00adents see as a ref\u00ader\u00aden\u00addum not just on Com\u00admon Core but also the es\u00adtab\u00adlish\u00adment Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans who sup\u00adport it. In her crit\u00adics\u2019 minds, it\u2019s a fight for Alabama\u2019s very soul. \u201cCivil\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion as we know it dur\u00ading our lives is com\u00ading to an end if we al\u00adlow the fed\u00ader\u00adal gov\u00adern\u00adment to tell us everything we\u2019re go\u00ading to do with our edu\u00adca\u00adtion sys\u00adtem,\u201d\u009d says John\u00adson, a chief nemes\u00adis of the school board mem\u00adber.\n\nIn Feb\u00adru\u00adary, John\u00adson en\u00adgin\u00adeered a chal\u00adlenge to Hunter\u2019s can\u00addid\u00adacy, ar\u00adguing that while she calls her\u00adself a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan, she ac\u00adtu\u00adally has taken up a \u201cDemo\u00adcrat and lib\u00ader\u00adal stand\u00adard,\u201d\u009d be\u00adcause of her sup\u00adport of Com\u00admon Core. The state GOP can\u00addid\u00adate com\u00admit\u00adtee voted not to hear the chal\u00adlenge.\n\nJohn\u00adson, the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Wo\u00admen of Madis\u00adon, and the Rainy Day Pat\u00adri\u00adots say they have tar\u00adgets in the state Le\u00adgis\u00adlature, too \u2014 state Rep. Mike Ball, a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan from Madis\u00adon who sup\u00adports Com\u00admon Core, and Sen. Bill Holtzclaw, an\u00adoth\u00ader Madis\u00adon Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan who has dis\u00admissed the tea party\u2019s fears about Com\u00admon Core as a \u201cbo\u00adgey\u00adman.\u201d\u009d\n\nIn these tea parti\u00aders\u2019 minds, their fel\u00adlow Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are as un\u00adtrust\u00adworthy as Obama. \u201cThey\u2019re all very slick, very smooth talk\u00aders; yes, very ar\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlate, all very smooth talk\u00aders,\u201d\u009d says Dee Voelkel, one of the Madis\u00adon County GOP mem\u00adbers who voted to cen\u00adsure Hunter. \u201cBill Holtzclaw, Mary Scott Hunter, Obama: You know they\u2019re very, very sim\u00adil\u00adar. They\u2019re very smooth.\u201d\u009d\n\nCLONED COM\u00adPLAINTS\n\nThere is a sim\u00adil\u00adar\u00adity across states in how Com\u00admon Core op\u00adpon\u00adents talk about their ad\u00adversar\u00adies. They all say these GOP elec\u00adted of\u00adfi\u00adcials \u2014 of\u00adten in power po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtions such as chair\u00adman of the edu\u00adca\u00adtion com\u00admit\u00adtee or school com\u00admis\u00adsion\u00ader \u2014 re\u00adfuse to listen to them. They all say they aren\u2019t as stu\u00adpid as their foes think they are. They all feel like money and in\u00adsider polit\u00adic\u00adal in\u00adflu\u00adence have over\u00adpowered them. And be\u00ading the un\u00adder\u00addogs makes them only more de\u00adterm\u00adined. They have no qualms about turn\u00ading against their own party in de\u00adfense of their prin\u00adciples.\n\nBen\u00adnett, In\u00addi\u00adana\u2019s former state schools su\u00adper\u00adin\u00adtend\u00adent, was an early vic\u00adtim of this kind of protest. He lost his reelec\u00adtion cam\u00adpaign in 2012 largely be\u00adcause of his un\u00adapo\u00adlo\u00adget\u00adic sup\u00adport for the Com\u00admon Core stand\u00adards, which promp\u00adted Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan voters to ditch him en masse. Even more amaz\u00ading in this ruby-red state, Ben\u00adnett\u2019s Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan de\u00adtract\u00adors were will\u00ading to ac\u00adcept that a mostly un\u00adknown Demo\u00adcrat, Gl\u00adenda Ritz, would win the post.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t vote for either one, and I didn\u2019t vote for either one. I know that\u2019s bad. I sit on the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan com\u00admit\u00adtee,\u201d\u009d says Pa\u00adtri\u00adcia Schneider, pres\u00adid\u00adent of the In\u00addi\u00adana Eagle For\u00adum, a tea-party group.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t alone. Heath\u00ader Crossin, a re\u00adgistered Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan who foun\u00added Hoo\u00adsiers Against Com\u00admon Core, also left her bal\u00adlot choice for state su\u00adper\u00adin\u00adtend\u00adent blank, know\u00ading full well that it could res\u00adult in a Demo\u00adcrat win\u00adning the of\u00adfice. There was no way she was vot\u00ading for Ben\u00adnett.\n\nIn oth\u00ader states, the fight is just get\u00adting star\u00adted. Mem\u00adbers of Ten\u00adness\u00adee Against Com\u00admon Core spent most of last spring vis\u00adit\u00ading in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal state le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adors to talk to them about the stand\u00adards. Its founder, Kar\u00aden Brack\u00aden, said most of them didn\u2019t know what she was talk\u00ading about. This year, her group and loc\u00adal tea-party al\u00adlies are try\u00ading to get a re\u00adpeal bill passed, and their list of Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan tar\u00adgets is long.\n\nIt starts with Gov. Haslam and Edu\u00adca\u00adtion Com\u00admis\u00adsion\u00ader Huff\u00adman, both Com\u00admon Core sup\u00adport\u00aders. Also on no\u00adtice are state Sen\u00adate Edu\u00adca\u00adtion Com\u00admit\u00adtee Chair\u00adwo\u00adman Dolores Gre\u00adsham and House Edu\u00adca\u00adtion Com\u00admit\u00adtee Chair\u00adman Harry Brooks. Brack\u00aden says the two are \u201cdef\u00adin\u00aditely not friends of our or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion.\u201d\u009d\n\n\u201cIf Com\u00admon Core does not get re\u00adpealed, we will go after them polit\u00adic\u00adally,\u201d\u009d she says.\n\n\u201cGov\u00adernor Haslam will be the No. 1 tar\u00adget. Even though he is a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan, he is not on the side of his con\u00adstitu\u00adents,\u201d\u009d Brack\u00aden said. \u201cWe are not go\u00ading to put our tail between our legs and go away. We will make sure that some of these people do not get reelec\u00adted.\u201d\u009d\n\nIn Wis\u00adcon\u00adsin, Ed\u00adward Per\u00adkins, pres\u00adid\u00adent of the tea-party group Fox Val\u00adley Ini\u00adti\u00adat\u00adive, had sim\u00adil\u00adar words of warn\u00ading for his state\u2019s of\u00adfi\u00adcials. \u201cIf you re\u00adfuse to ad\u00address this is\u00adsue, we\u2019ll say, \u201c\u02dcAll right. We now will take it in\u00adto your polit\u00adic\u00adal cam\u00adpaign,\u2019 \u201c\u009d he says. \u201cPrimar\u00adily, we will fo\u00adcus on Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans.\u201d\u009d\n\nPARTY PUR\u00adITY\n\nFor all of these groups, the aim is to weed out people who are not suf\u00adfi\u00adciently con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive. There\u2019s no place for mod\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion.\n\nBack in Alabama, Hugh McIn\u00adnish, a re\u00adtired en\u00adgin\u00adeer and a con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive act\u00adiv\u00adist who voted to cen\u00adsure school board mem\u00adber Hunter, wor\u00adries that people who in a more lib\u00ader\u00adal state would be Demo\u00adcrats are di\u00adlut\u00ading Alabama\u2019s Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that in Alabama, the Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Party is the black party and the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party is the white party,\u201d\u009d he says. \u201cAl\u00admost any\u00adone [white] who wants to seek polit\u00adic\u00adal of\u00adfice has got to run as a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan. We now have all of the old Demo\u00adcrats say\u00ading, \u201c\u02dcI want to be a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan,\u2019 and they are not.\u201d\u009d\n\nThere\u2019s some truth to this in his state, where for the first time since Re\u00adcon\u00adstruc\u00adtion, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans have a ma\u00adjor\u00adity \u2014 nay, a su\u00adper\u00adma\u00adjor\u00adity \u2014 in the state Le\u00adgis\u00adlature. The only Demo\u00adcrats left are Afric\u00adan-Amer\u00adic\u00adans.\n\nBut it\u2019s just this quest for con\u00adform\u00adity across is\u00adsues at the loc\u00adal level that is hurt\u00ading the GOP na\u00adtion\u00adally, leav\u00ading no space for people who might agree with the party on most but not all is\u00adsues.\n\nThis is the fun\u00adda\u00adment\u00adal battle that Hunter finds her\u00adself fight\u00ading. \u201cI see my\u00adself as a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan who is in\u00adter\u00adested in adding, and not sub\u00adtract\u00ading or di\u00advid\u00ading,\u201d\u009d she says. \u201cYou have a list of things that are plat\u00adform is\u00adsues in the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party, and for people that agree with more than half of them and want to be part of this party, my at\u00adti\u00adtude is, OK!\u201d\u009d\n\nMcIn\u00adnish, by con\u00adtrast, says he already is open to a third party. His wife, Martha, says one of her biggest fears is that New Jer\u00adsey Gov. Chris Christie will as\u00adcend to the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial bal\u00adlot in 2016, be\u00adcause he fa\u00advors abor\u00adtion rights and, in many ways, is pro-gov\u00adern\u00adment.\n\nHunter op\u00adposes abor\u00adtion rights (al\u00adthough she says she has nev\u00ader been asked be\u00adfore), but says she would be happy to see an abor\u00adtion-rights-sup\u00adport\u00ading Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan like Christie run for of\u00adfice. Par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly if he can win.\n\nTherein lies the dis\u00adtinc\u00adtion. McIn\u00adnish would rather be af\u00adfil\u00adi\u00adated with a fringe group that agrees with him com\u00adpletely, while Hunter wants her party to grow big\u00adger and win elec\u00adtions. And in pur\u00adsuit of win\u00adning, she is will\u00ading to see her party ac\u00adcept di\u00adver\u00adging views.\n\nUGLY POLIT\u00adICS\n\nThe Madis\u00adon County Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans\u2019 vote to cen\u00adsure Hunter was a de\u00adcis\u00adive 25-12. And sev\u00ader\u00adal mem\u00adbers who voted against it did so only be\u00adcause they did not ap\u00adprove of rep\u00adrim\u00adand\u00ading one of their own. It was an empty ges\u00adture, a slap on the wrist, with no prac\u00adtic\u00adal im\u00adpact oth\u00ader than to call at\u00adten\u00adtion to some ugly fis\u00adsures with\u00adin the party.\n\nThe rep\u00adrim\u00adand rat\u00adcheted up Hunter\u2019s pub\u00adlic pro\u00adfile as a fight\u00ader. One of her cam\u00adpaign aides privately joked that she should get cen\u00adsured again, prefer\u00adably a month or so be\u00adfore the primary elec\u00adtion in June. The state me\u00addia also took her side, with The An\u00adnis\u00adton Star ap\u00adplaud\u00ading her \u201cspunk\u201d\u009d in dis\u00adcard\u00ading a short\u00adsighted party line, and AL.com, a pop\u00adu\u00adlar on\u00adline news site, say\u00ading the cen\u00adsure showed \u201ca lack of com\u00admon sense\u201d\u009d with\u00adin the GOP.\n\nBut the dis\u00adpute comes with a price. Com\u00adplaints about Hunter have moved from the pro\u00adfes\u00adsion\u00adal realm to the per\u00adson\u00adal, as hap\u00adpens in polit\u00adic\u00adal purges. Her crit\u00adics shake their heads dis\u00adap\u00adprov\u00adingly be\u00adcause she doesn\u2019t use her mar\u00adried name. One of them says her hus\u00adband \u201cwalks 2 feet be\u00adhind her.\u201d\u009d\n\nThe per\u00adson\u00adal at\u00adtacks will be al\u00admost im\u00adpossible to smooth over, and Hunter hasn\u2019t yet mastered an iron-lady mask that walls off her feel\u00adings. She blinks back tears when she hears that the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Wo\u00admen of Madis\u00adon say she has de\u00adlib\u00ader\u00adately ig\u00adnored them. \u201cOh, my good\u00adness, they\u2019ve done such won\u00adder\u00adful work in\u00adflu\u00aden\u00adcing this board, and in\u00adflu\u00aden\u00adcing me,\u201d\u009d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this without them. They are so im\u00adport\u00adant to me.\u201d\u009d\n\nShe wor\u00adries about gaffes. \u201cI want to be elec\u00adted. I\u2019m just like every\u00adone else. I love my job,\u201d\u009d she con\u00adfides. \u201cBut I nev\u00ader want to value the po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtion over the op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity.\u201d\u009d\n\nHer dif\u00adfi\u00adculty in ab\u00adsorb\u00ading at\u00adtacks is palp\u00adable, a rare show of hu\u00adman\u00adity in polit\u00adics. It causes her friends to rush to her de\u00adfense. \u201cAre you writ\u00ading about how Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans treat their wo\u00admen like shit?\u201d\u009d one of them asks at her fun\u00addraiser.\n\nIn truth, Hunter has a lot of sup\u00adport\u00aders, and they say her crit\u00adics make up a vo\u00adcal minor\u00adity. The sup\u00adport\u00aders are a mix of busi\u00adness lead\u00aders, edu\u00adca\u00adtion groups, and even Demo\u00adcrats. There is no way to tell how power\u00adful her op\u00adpon\u00adents are, but they have proven that even if they are few in num\u00adber they can be ef\u00adfect\u00adive in stok\u00ading an angry fire.\n\nThere is a lot of an\u00adger in Alabama and in oth\u00ader red states where people feel the es\u00adtab\u00adlish\u00adment has sold them out. To cla\u00adri\u00adfy: They feel sold out by Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans, not Demo\u00adcrats. \u201cIt oc\u00adcurred to me one day it didn\u2019t do any good to save a ranch and lose the coun\u00adtry,\u201d\u009d says Ken Free\u00adman, a mem\u00adber of the Madis\u00adon County Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans.\n\nThese agit\u00adat\u00adors see their GOP tar\u00adgets as be\u00adtray\u00aders who are feed\u00ading at the trough of big busi\u00adness and in\u00adflu\u00aden\u00adtial polit\u00adic\u00adal in\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtions. \u201cPoliti\u00adcians be\u00ading what politi\u00adcians are, they only know two things \u2014 get\u00adting power and keep\u00ading power,\u201d\u009d says Ten\u00adness\u00adee\u2019s Brack\u00aden. \u201cBill Gates has bought off the cham\u00adber of com\u00admerce. He\u2019s bought off the PTA. His money has bought off every\u00adbody that he can.\u201d\u009d\n\nPeople like Alabama\u2019s Mary Scott Hunter and Ten\u00adness\u00adee\u2019s Bill Haslam are already the en\u00ademy. They have ir\u00adre\u00advoc\u00adably dirtied their hands by al\u00adly\u00ading them\u00adselves with an is\u00adsue that, their op\u00adpon\u00adents say, smacks of power and money.\n\nBut it\u2019s aw\u00adfully hard to climb the polit\u00adic\u00adal lad\u00adder without stum\u00adbling in\u00adto puddles of money and power. And it\u2019s just as hard to win gen\u00ader\u00adal elec\u00adtions by mold\u00ading your pub\u00adlic per\u00adsona to sat\u00adis\u00adfy every cri\u00adterion of an ar\u00addent act\u00adiv\u00adist base.\n\nHunter tries to keep calm amid the storm. She listens to more-seasoned politi\u00adcians who have en\u00addured this kind of ab\u00aduse and hopes to grow a thick\u00ader skin. Her friend Mike Ball, a state House mem\u00adber who also is on the tea party\u2019s black list, has told her to stay above the fray. \u201cA lot of times when people are jacked up about polit\u00adics, it\u2019s not about gov\u00adern\u00adment,\u201d\u009d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about them.\u201d\u009d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "While the national party talks about broadening the base, local activists are purging the ranks.", "title": "The Very Last Thing Republicans Have to Fight About", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/2014/03/04/very-last-thing-republicans-have-fight-about", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2014/02/27/D-CommonCore.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"site": "@nationaljournal", "image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2014/02/27/D-CommonCore.jpg"}, "description": "While the national party talks about broadening the base, local activists are purging the ranks.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Very Last Thing Republicans Have to Fight About"}, "description": "While the national party talks about broadening the base, local activists are purging the ranks.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb52a\"", "article_summary": "Bill Haslam and state Edu\u00adca\u00adtion Com\u00admis\u00adsion\u00ader Kev\u00adin Huff\u00adman in trouble, and in In\u00addi\u00adana, state Su\u00adper\u00adin\u00adtend\u00adent Tony Ben\u00adnett lost his job.\nThat leaves Com\u00admon Core, unique as a state is\u00adsue among the typ\u00adic\u00adally fed\u00ader\u00adal dis\u00adputes that di\u00advide es\u00adtab\u00adlish\u00adment Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans and their tea-party in\u00adsur\u00adgents.\nFER\u00adTILE GROUNDThe Com\u00admon Core school stand\u00adards are an un\u00adusu\u00adally fer\u00adtile lit\u00admus test to as\u00adsess Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans\u2019 pur\u00adity.\nFrom Alabama and Ten\u00adness\u00adee to In\u00addi\u00adana and Wis\u00adcon\u00adsin, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans don\u2019t have much left to fight about.\nThey\u2019re very smooth.\u201d\u009dCLONED COM\u00adPLAINTSThere is a sim\u00adil\u00adar\u00adity across states in how Com\u00admon Core op\u00adpon\u00adents talk about their ad\u00adversar\u00adies."}
