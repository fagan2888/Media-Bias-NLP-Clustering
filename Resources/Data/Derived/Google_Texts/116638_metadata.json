Even so, one strong supporter of the health care law, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R. I., good-naturedly told an administration official, \u201cGood luck getting through this mess.\u201d\n\nWhitehouse spoke to Marilyn Tavenner, the head of the agency deeply involved in implementing the law. She had assured lawmakers that initial flaws with the government\u2019s website were systematically yielding to around-the-clock repair effort.\n\n\u201cUsers can now successfully create an account and continue through the full application and enrollment process,\u201d said Tavenner, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \u201cWe are now able to process nearly 17,000 registrants per hour, or 5 per second, with almost no errors.\u201d\n\nShe encouraged consumers to log onto the site and check it out, and said the administration had estimated that enrollments will total 800,000 by the end of November.\n\nThe controversy over the ability of consumers to keep their existing plans flared last week, when insurance companies mailed out millions of cancellation notices, often citing the new health care law as the reason.\n\nHouse Republicans intend to vote as early as next week on legislation that permits insurers to reinstate the canceled plans, which fall short of the coverage requirement under the health care law. One Democrat, Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, has proposed requiring insurers to do so.\n\nBut the Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Democrats had voted unanimously against similar proposals in the past and were having \u201cfoxhole conversions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think what will be really interesting to see in the Senate is the number of Democrats in very red states who are up in \u201914 and what they start demanding \u2026 in terms of adjustments to this law,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the White House, press secretary Jay Carney refused repeatedly to state a position on the proposals, saying he hadn\u2019t \u201creviewed or seen an examination internally\u201d on any of them.\n\nShifting the focus away from what Obama has said repeatedly, the spokesman said, \u201cThe world back to which many critics want us to go, is a world in which insurers have that power to say that, you know, your relative, who has a pre-existing condition either has no chance of getting coverage or is going to be charged so much that he or she can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nIn words Republican critics cite frequently, Obama pledged in mid-2009: \u201cIf you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period\u201d and \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.\u201d\n\nMajority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., showed no enthusiasm for permitting a vote on the measure introduced by Landrieu, who is seeking a new term. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see,\u201d he said, noting that hundreds of bills are introduced in the Senate each week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Under growing pressure, the administration refused repeatedly to state a positi ...", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "David Espo | The Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/295097/dems-resist-law-to-keep-health-plans.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/a05_jd_06nov_tavenner.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Under growing pressure, the administration refused repeatedly to state a positi ...", "title": "Democrats resist law allowing people to keep health plans"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d76\"", "article_summary": "Even so, one strong supporter of the health care law, Sen.
