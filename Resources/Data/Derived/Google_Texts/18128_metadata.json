Richard Pan, a Democrat and pediatrician from Sacramento. \u201cWe should not wait for more children to sicken or die before we act.\u201d\n\nEarlier Wednesday, California\u2019s two U.S. senators issued a joint letter calling for a repeal of the state\u2019s \u201cpersonal belief exemption.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile a small number of children cannot be vaccinated due to an underlying medical condition, we believe there should be no such thing as a philosophical or personal belief exemption, since everyone uses public spaces,\u201d Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein wrote. \u201cAs we have learned in the past month, parents who refuse to vaccinate their children not only put their own family at risk, but they also endanger other families who choose to vaccinate.\u201d\n\nChildhood vaccine has become an emotionally charged topic and a national issue amid a measles outbreak that has sickened more than 100 people across the United States and in Mexico.\n\nLike most other states, California allows religious or personal belief exemptions. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, California is among 20 states that allow for personal belief exemptions and 48 that allow for religious exemptions.\n\nParents cite a variety of reasons for not immunizing their children, among them: religious values, concerns the shots could cause illness and a belief that allowing children to get sick helps them to build a stronger immune system.\n\nPublic health officials believe an immunization rate of at least 90 percent in all communities, including schools, is critical to minimizing the potential for a disease outbreak. Statistics reported recently by the state Department of Public Health show 89.4 percent of children in California child-care facilities \u2014 kids between age 2 and 5 \u2014 had received all required vaccinations at the start of the 2014-15 school year.\n\nThe report showed 2.67 percent of those children \u2014 about 12,500 statewide \u2014 were unvaccinated due to personal belief exemptions. About 2,500 students were unvaccinated due to permanent medical exemptions \u2014 the only group that would remain exempt under Pan\u2019s proposal.\n\nPan, who previously served in the Assembly, was the author of another vaccination bill that took effect last year. It requires parents who don\u2019t have their children vaccinated for non-religious reasons to get a note from the doctor\u2019s office before enrolling their children in school.\n\nA spokesman for Gov. Jerry Brown, who signed that bill, did not say if the governor would oppose efforts to end exemptions.\n\n\u201cThe Governor believes that vaccinations are profoundly important and a major public health benefit and any bill that reaches his desk will be closely considered,\u201d Spokesman Evan Westrup wrote in an e-mail.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid concern about measles outbreak, proposal would require shots for all kids unless their health is in danger.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"New Vaccination Bill Would End 'Personal Belief Exemption'\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/02\\/04\\/new-vaccination-bill-would-end-exemptions-for-personal-religious-beliefs\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-04 14:34:00\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-02-05 11:31:45\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":23816,\"author_id\":\"237\",\"author_name\":\"KQED News Staff and Wires\",\"author_display_name\":\"KQED News Staff and Wires\",\"tags\":[\"Measles\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/01\\/495311669-e1422076915312.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Amid concern about measles outbreak, proposal would require shots for all kids unless their health is in danger.", "title": "New Vaccination Bill Would End \u2018Personal Belief Exemption\u2019", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/02/04/new-vaccination-bill-would-end-exemptions-for-personal-religious-beliefs/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/01/495311669-640x456.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "measles,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b65\"", "article_summary": "Like most other states, California allows religious or personal belief exemptions.\nThe report showed 2.67 percent of those children \u2014 about 12,500 statewide \u2014 were unvaccinated due to personal belief exemptions.\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, California is among 20 states that allow for personal belief exemptions and 48 that allow for religious exemptions.\nJerry Brown, who signed that bill, did not say if the governor would oppose efforts to end exemptions.\nPan, who previously served in the Assembly, was the author of another vaccination bill that took effect last year."}
