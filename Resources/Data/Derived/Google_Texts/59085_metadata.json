Frana Mace and then-State Sen. Rob Hernandez sponsored a bill to establish the holiday in Colorado. Denver City Councilwoman Ramona Martinez then initiated the holiday in the city, to be celebrated the last Monday of March.\n\nIn 2014, President Barack Obama proclaimed March 31 a national holiday as well, encouraging citizens to observe the day with service, community and education programs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able to celebrate the rights we have now,\u201d said Belinda Blea, 34, who attended the march. \u201cIt inspires us to help each other, move forward and progress.
