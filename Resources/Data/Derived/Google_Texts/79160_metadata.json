It\u2019s not like we suddenly woke up and thought, \u2018Oh my gosh, we should have something ready here,'\u201d Dr. Francis Collins told HuffPo.\n\n\u201cFrankly, if we had not gone through our 10-year slide in research support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this that would\u2019ve gone through clinical trials and would have been ready.\u201d\n\nAnd what was the \u201c10-year slide\u201d Dr. Collins is bemoaning? According to the same article, the NIH\u2019s total budget between 2014 and 2013 rose from $28.03 billion to $29.31 billion.\n\nOnly in a government-funded bureaucrat world does an increase of more than $1 billion amount to some anti-science, barbaric budget slashing.\n\nBecause no government-funded agency has ever wasted a dime, right? This is the agency, remember, that announced a $1.5 million study in 2013 to determine why lesbians have a tendency to be overweight, while gay men do not. And who knows? All that money that got blown on the Obamacare website might have bought a damn fine vaccine by now, too.\n\nTo their credit, conservatives didn\u2019t take the late Sunday-release lying down, immediately accusing Collins of politicizing the issue for bureaucratic and budgetary gain.\n\nHere\u2019s a sampling:\n\nI do medical research. I would love NIH funding rates to be higher. But for the Dr. Francis Collins to politicize Ebola is unconscionable. \u2014 JDM (@sleepdoctorjoe) October 13, 2014\n\nPlenty of people agreed.\n\n@sleepdoctorjoe I am suprised he didn\u2019t pull a Kanye West\u2026.\u201dGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people.\u201d \u2014 STPOW22 (@STPOW22) October 13, 2014\n\n@sleepdoctorjoe no \u2013 its sadly typical \u2014 bee kay (@beekaytulsa) October 13, 2014\n\nThat is, it\u2019s typical of a federal bureaucrat \u2014 however accomplished \u2014 to assume that the amount of spending is directly proportional to success. In the Obama Era, that\u2019s not even close to true.\n\n@sleepdoctorjoe You must understand increase in funding does not necessarily achieve positive results. Ppl have to do the work.
