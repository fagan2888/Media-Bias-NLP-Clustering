In practice, that means insurers aren\u2019t paying out for the treatments a healthcare provider bills for, but rather the results those healthcare providers achieve.\n\nThis emphasis on results requires healthcare providers to monitor patients after their treatments and track what\u2019s happening across a network of millions of patients and former patients.\n\nSt. Louis-based Essence Group Holdings, raised its latest round from previous investors including Sandbox Industries, BlueCross BlueShield Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Camden Partners, and undisclosed new investors, according to a statement.\n\nMoney from the round will be used to expand the company\u2019s Lumeris operations in additional markets, growing from eight to twenty.\n\nLumeris sells technology and services to ease the transition from treatment-based, or fee-for-service, healthcare to one that involves more distributed responsibilities for patient care and payments.\n\n\u201cThe health care industry is undergoing a major revolution in accountability and shared responsibility for delivering better clinical outcomes for all Americans at more affordable costs by shifting from volume to value,\u201d said W. Michael Long, chairman and chief executive of EGHC and Lumeris, in a statement.\n\n\u201cBy expanding into an additional 12 markets by the end of 2015, Lumeris expects to partner with organizations representing more than 50 million lives,\u201d Long said.\n\nFeatured Image: James Steidl/Shutterstock", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/jonathan-shieber/\" title=\"Posts by Jonathan Shieber\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Jonathan Shieber</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jshieber\" rel=\"external\">@jshieber</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "Essence Group Holdings Corp., the parent company of health management services provider Lumeris, has raised $71 million in a round of financing announced today.
