Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) to sign the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act. The students, members of Ball State\u2019s Students for Creative Social Action and the university\u2019s Amnesty International chapter, donned orange jumpsuits with black head pieces while other members dressed in military fatigues to simulate the roles of Guantanamo Bay detainees and the personnel who watch over them.\n\n\u201cThe point of the silent protest was to represent the voicelessness of the people down there and give a voice to this cause ending indefinite detention,\u201d Matthew Smith, director of Ball State\u2019s Amnesty International chapter, told Red Alert Politics.\n\nBoth student groups hope to see Guantanamo detainees receive a fair trial in U.S. courts or release those who have been cleared, he said.\n\nSince its opening in 2002, reports indicate several prisoners were waterboarded at the base \u2014 which houses several suspected members of al-Qaeda and Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Additionally, many of the detainees have protested their own detention through a hunger strike, which led to force feeding from military personnel.\n\nThe waterboarding of the prisoners sparked the idea for members of SCSA to conduct their own interrogation using the technique. \u201cDetainees\u201d and their \u201cprison guards\u201d marched from the school\u2019s student center to Bracken Library, the nucleus of Ball State\u2019s campus.\n\nAs onlookers gathered outside the library, Caleb Hoagland \u2014 vice president of SCSA and an Army veteran \u2014 laid on his back, and Smith placed a cloth over his face, pouring a jug of water over the material.\n\n\u201cI kept telling myself it\u2019s not fatal,\u201d Hoagland told Ball State\u2019s The Daily. \u201cI trust Matt Smith, but there was a point where some primal part of my brain said, \u2018You\u2019re going to die.\u2019 I kept breathing and water was going in. It really tricks your brain into thinking you\u2019re drowning.\u201d\n\nA petition urging Donnelly to take action on the 2014 NDAA circulated through a crowd of passersby who gathered to watch. Though the group received support prior to the waterboarding, many students lent their signatures after watching the staged interrogation.\n\n\u201cSeeing a body gasping for air and just knowing how much it means to be breathing, you really appreciate breathing,\u201d Ariana Brown, SCSA\u2019s president, told Red Alert Politics. \u201cIt just made it easier to emphasize. A lot of people conceptualize everyone in Guantanamo Bay as the worst person ever and that they\u2019re bad people. So to see someone suffering, to see a physical person suffering in front of you, that makes it a lot easier to relate to that person. \u2026 This really put a face on the issue.\u201d\n\nBut SCSA\u2019s event didn\u2019t sway everyone to join in efforts to close the facility.\n\n\u201cGuantanamo Bay uses interrogation techniques to gain information on future terrorist attacks to protect the American people,\u201d Hillary Cherry, program officer of public relations at Young America\u2019s Foundation, told Red Alert Politics in an email. \u201cSmith and Hoagland should be thankful to our soldiers stationed at Guantanamo for protecting their First Amendment rights to stage this appalling protest in the first place.\u201d\n\nAnd SCSA and Amnesty International club members faced backlash from fellow students who felt they were disrespecting the military, Smith, 21, said.\n\n\u201cMy response to that is, first of all, I think it\u2019s disrespectful to order our military members, our service members to perform this sort of procedure and the psychological trauma that goes along with that and also, this is something that the existence of Guantanamo and the existence of these sort of policies actually undermine U.S. national security and put our service members at risk,\u201d he said.\n\nSince President George W. Bush opened the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay in 2002, 779 detainees have been housed, with 164 still held on the base. President Barack Obama campaigned in 2008 on the promise to shutter the detention center, though his efforts have failed.\n\nObama did, however, lift a moratorium allowing low-level detainees to transfer from the facility in Cuba to Yemen.\n\nThe 2014 National Defense Authorization Act \u2014 passed by the House but still in the Senate \u2014 maintains the prohibition of detainee transfers from Guantanamo to the United States or to countries with \u201cconfirmed cases of transferred detainees returning to the fight.\u201d\n\nThe bill was approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee with transfer provisions altered to make them less strict. It remains on the Senate\u2019s calendar.\n\nh/t Young America\u2019s Foundation", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Despite President Barack Obama's failed attempts to shutter Guantanamo Bay, students at Ball State University staged a demonstration voicing their support for the detention center's closing, even going so far as waterboarding a student.", "title": "Ball State student waterboarded to show support for Guantanamo Bay...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/09/Ball-State-Gitmo-Protest-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/09/05/ball-state-student-waterboarded-to-show-support-for-guantanamo-bay-closure/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "young-americas-foundation", "published_time": "2013-09-05T14:56:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-05T15:10:43+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A lot of people conceptualize everyone in Guantanamo Bay as the worst person ever and that they\u2019re bad people.\nBoth student groups hope to see Guantanamo detainees receive a fair trial in U.S. courts or release those who have been cleared, he said.\nDespite President Barack Obama\u2019s failed attempts to shutter Guantanamo Bay, students at Ball State University staged a demonstration voicing their support for the detention center\u2019s closing, even going so far as waterboarding a student.\n\u201cDetainees\u201d and their \u201cprison guards\u201d marched from the school\u2019s student center to Bracken Library, the nucleus of Ball State\u2019s campus.\n\u201cI kept telling myself it\u2019s not fatal,\u201d Hoagland told Ball State\u2019s The Daily."}
