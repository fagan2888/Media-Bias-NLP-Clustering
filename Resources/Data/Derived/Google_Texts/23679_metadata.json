She sees huge needs, especially in the area of supportive housing, and she\u2019s energized to get something done, for the good of her son and for the good of the entire community.\n\nIn high school, her son, Donel Elam, attracted 27 college invitations because of his gridiron success. But all of that evaporated as Elam began to develop apparent schizoaffective disorder.\n\nAs the Post\u2019s Wayne Washington reported, March recently urged Palm Beach County Commissioners to help her create a place where people with serious mental illness can spend as much as a year or two getting stabilized on the right medications, undergoing therapy, and preparing themselves to become self-supporting, productive members of society.\n\nWhen someone has a psychotic break, a short-term stay at a crisis unit isn\u2019t adequate, said Liz Downey, executive director of the Palm Beach County branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\n\u201cOur state government needs to fund residential facilities for people with mental illness. A five-day or even a two-week stay in a Baker Act facility is not doing it,\u201d Downey said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we need to invest in.\u201d\n\nMaking the dream a reality won\u2019t just require money for land and a building. It will require a dedicated source of reimbursements for services.\n\nFor that, it\u2019s up to state legislators. They must include raises for mental health providers in next year\u2019s Medicaid budget.\n\nLegislators must also expand eligibility for Medicaid, so that people who don\u2019t earn enough to get Obamacare subsidies have a fighting chance.\n\nAbout 1 percent of the population suffers with schizophrenia. About 2.6 percent are bipolar. Ignoring the needs of people with mental illness won\u2019t make them go away.\n\nDo you agree that the state has been neglecting its mental health system?", "article_metadata": {"description": "In high school, her son, Donel Elam, attracted 27 college invitations because of his gridiron success.
