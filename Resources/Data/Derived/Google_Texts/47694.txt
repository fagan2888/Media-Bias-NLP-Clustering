Tonight's episode of The Independents (Fox Business Network, 9 p.m. ET, 6 p.m. PT, with re-airs three hours later) begins with the story that for weeks has swallowed The Drudge Report whole: All those illegal immigrant kids massed up in holding facilities near the U.S.-Mexico border. Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, will break down the mechanics of who is coming and going and why; and the subject will be debated by Party Panelists Katie Pavlich (co-host, Outnumbered) and Emily Tisch Sussman (campaign director, Center for American Progress Action Fund). That duo is also slated to discuss the themes in Pavlich's new book, Assault and Flattery: The Truth About the Left and Their War on Women, and also Hillary Clinton's latest comments about political dynasties, and the city of Berkeley requiring medical marijuana dispensaries to give away two percent of their product to the poor.

Fox News Middle Eastern specialist Lisa Daftari will discuss the latest awfulness in Israel and Gaza, Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow (and former Labor Department chief economist) Diana Furchtgott-Roth will break down the connection between welfare payments and employment rates, and yours truly will talk about today's bracing letter to the Obama administration by 38 journalism/open-government groups denouncing his record on transparency.
