In a piece of promotional satire from 2012, actor Sacha Baron Cohen hosted a real press conference as Admiral General Aladeen, the fictional autocrat from his film, The Dictator.

After lambasting the international media for their poor treatment of dictators, General Aladeen made a statement about Syria that eerily seems relevant today.

“Thankfully there are still some supporters of dictatorships,” Cohen told reporters. “On behalf of my dear friend and doubles-tennis partner, President Assad of Syria, I want to thank the United Nation for their brave inaction over Syria. Thirteen months and still no Security Counsel resolution. You guys are amazing! You have done next to nothing for the Syrian people. But remember: you can always do less.”

The remark seems prophetic given the current situation, in which the United States may move forward to strike Syria without the approval of the U.N. Security Counsel.
