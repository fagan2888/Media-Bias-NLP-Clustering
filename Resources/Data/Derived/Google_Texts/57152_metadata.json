Uninsurance rates are down, costs are under control, subsidies are working, etc. But that doesn't mean everything is perfect. Kaiser's latest survey, for example, highlights growing dissatisfaction with Obamacare coverage:\n\nThe number of people who are dissatisfied has gone up from 20 percent in 2014 to 31 percent this year. The main complaint is about premiums and deductibles. As it happens, premiums haven't actually increased all that much, but deductibles have, which means that even modest premium increases strike people as unfair.\n\nAs usual, I'd be cautious about drawing any conclusions from this. It's only a year or two of data, and the Obamacare market is still shaking out. Still, it's genuinely unfavorable news\u2014except for conservatives, who finally have something bad they can point to without actually lying about it.\n\nFor more details, see Andrew Sprung.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/05/finally-some-actual-bad-news-about-obamacare", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Finally, some actual bad news about Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"title": "Finally, some actual bad news about Obamacare", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/05/finally-some-actual-bad-news-about-obamacare", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "Still, it's genuinely unfavorable news\u2014except for conservatives, who finally have something bad they can point to without actually lying about it.\nAs you know, the overall news about Obamacare is almost uniformly positive.\nIt's only a year or two of data, and the Obamacare market is still shaking out.\nAs it happens, premiums haven't actually increased all that much, but deductibles have, which means that even modest premium increases strike people as unfair.\nUninsurance rates are down, costs are under control, subsidies are working, etc."}
