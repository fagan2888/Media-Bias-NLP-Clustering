Aetna (AET) on Tuesday raised its full-year earnings per share guidance, driven by higher membership and lower costs for Gilead Sciences’ hepatitis C drugs.

The insurer now sees 2015 EPS of $7, up from an earlier outlook of $6.90. The discounts that it negotiated with Gilead (GILD) came as Aetna gave preferred status for the drugmaker’s Sovaldi and Harvoni treatments.

“I do think our final negotiations on this topic are creating upside,” Aetna CFO Shawn Guertin said on the earnings conference call, according to Reuters.

Shares rose 1.3% on the stock market today, though the new EPS outlook still falls short of the Wall Street consensus for $7.16.

The stock bolted above its 50-day line in late October but has trended back toward that key level of support in choppy action since December. Gilead, which reports after the close Tuesday, dipped 1.8%.

Aetna’s Q4 overall medical benefit ratio, the amount spent on medical care vs. money brought in from premiums, improved to 83% from 83.9% a year earlier. Aetna says that its medical costs have remained moderate and predicted a medical benefit ratio of 82%-83%.

But the medical benefit ratio for the company’s bread-and-butter commercial health plan segment rose to 82% from 81.7% due to higher business expenses, costs related to hepatitis C treatments and programs mandated by the Affordable Care Act.

Aetna earned $1.22 a share in Q4, down 9% from a year earlier but matching analyst forecasts. Revenue rose 12% to $14.8 billion, topping analyst views for $14.6 billion.

Meanwhile, Centene (CNC), a Medicaid-centric HMO that has benefited from the health law’s Medicaid expansion, reported that its Q4 EPS popped 29% to $1.74, beating estimates by 5 cents.

Revenue surged 53% to $4.73 billion, boosted by the company’s participation in health insurance exchanges and expansions in a variety of states.

Its health benefit ratio rose to 89.3% during Q4 from 88.1% a year ago. Centene expects a health benefits ratio of 89.2%-89.6% this year.

The company also guided full-year GAAP EPS of $5.05-$5.35 on revenue of $20.3 billion-$20.8 billion.

Shares edged up 0.7%.
