(By Jenna Esarey, special to The Courier-Journal) July 12, 2014.\n\nHundreds of individuals and families took advantage of free health screenings, educational information and a bit of pampering during the third annual Health and Wellness Fair at Jeffersonville High School on Saturday.\n\nEastside Christian Church partnered with Community Action of Southern Indiana and Centerstone to host the free event for families and individuals in need.\n\nParticipants could schedule either a dental exam, optical exam or child's medical screening, and take advantage of a spa area offering haircuts and manicures.\n\n\"I didn't know about this last year,\" said Mary Crim as she received a manicure. She came with her sons Noah, 5 weeks old, and Jacob, 12. \"It's pretty cool. I don't have time to do my own nails since I had Noah.\"\n\nThe single mother said events like this are a boon for her. \"The optical exam is really nice,\" she said.\n\nAn optometrist, a number of doctors and dentists, and others all volunteered their time and services for the fair. Former Army barber Danny Kilgore provided haircuts, along with other volunteers. \"I'm wanting to give back to the community,\" he said. \"I'm always trying to give back any way I can.\"\n\nFor the first two years the event was held at Eastside Christian Church, two miles from the high school on Veterans Parkway. It quickly outgrew the space. \"We had 1,900 people come through last year,\" said David Parkerson, outreach minister at Eastside Christian. \"We just couldn't handle it. Jeff High is much nicer, we can really spread out and it doesn't feel crowded.\"\n\nRunning from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., the event drew a large crowd, with people lining up as early as 8 a.m. to reserve their spot in line.\n\nThe fair used classrooms, hallways, the library, health office and most common areas of the school.\n\nVendors representing businesses and organizations providing social services, health care, insurance and other health-related products and services filled the school's gymnasium.\n\nFor the first time this year, health and wellness workshops were offered, covering topics such as tobacco cessation, healthy eating, mental health awareness and HIV/AIDS.\n\nTransportation to Eastside's campus was provided for those wishing to take advantage of free clothing and shoes collected by church members.\n\nJust over 500 backpacks were collected by the church, filled with school supplies and handed out to children entering kindergarten through eighth grade during the fair.\n\n\"Last year we collected 300 and it was not enough,\" said Jennifer Coward, director of the backpack operation. \"This year if we have any left over we'll donate them to the schools.\"\n\nAfter receiving any services, families could pick up a backpack and then head to the cafeteria for a free lunch before leaving.\n\n\"I'm really very grateful,\" said Julia McKinley of Floyds Knobs as she watched her son, Trayton Elliott, 8, receive a haircut. \"Trayton is a type 1 diabetic. There was a lot of information we could use for him. I truly am blessed to be given the opportunity to come here.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1m4xrsS", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Hundreds of individuals and families took advantage of free health screenings, educational information and a bit of pampering during the third annual Health and Wellness Fair at Jeffersonville High School on Saturday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Hundreds of individuals and families took advantage of free health screenings, educational information and a bit of pampering during the third annual Health and Wellness Fair at Jeffersonville High School on Saturday.", "title": "Health, Wellness Fair a boon for those in need", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2014/07/12/health-wellness-fair-boon-need/12571981/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hundreds of individuals and families took advantage of free health screenings, educational information and a bit of pampering during the third annual Health and Wellness Fair at Jeffersonville High School on Saturday.", "title": "Health, Wellness Fair a boon for those in need", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/717327c669493885c53bd006239d810c9ef4f9fa/c=648-0-3240-2592&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/07/12/1of8.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5262a3fca508bc49e1b0aefb92dc445db245ac41/c=972-0-2916-2592/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/07/12/1of8.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/44718bc186ef2bf2a2929512c8afc7138da5ab6b/c=648-0-3240-2592/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/07/12/1of8.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2cccc4549406d22ebdb5e57555edbf9d3eb72268/c=216-0-3672-2592/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/07/12/1of8.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e5e870a9c0be7654263322588184ff7a5ed38936/c=0-202-3888-2389&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/07/12/1of8.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-07-12T18:16:51.853000-04:00", "shorthed": "Health, Wellness Fair a boon for those in need", "articleid": 12571981, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6866234a81c7e41f9230adf9968a10eaba1accf/c=0-202-3888-2389/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/07/12/1of8.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04bd5dcda406da1f9b1fd3b25a8ab8835a554fe7/c=1215-0-2673-2592/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/07/12/1of8.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "story", "author": "Jenna Esarey", "pageclass": "article", "title": "Health, Wellness Fair a boon for those in need"}, "news_keywords": "Indiana, Jeffersonville High School, Health and Wellness Fair"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b6a\"", "article_summary": "Hundreds of individuals and families took advantage of free health screenings, educational information and a bit of pampering during the third annual Health and Wellness Fair at Jeffersonville High School on Saturday.\nVendors representing businesses and organizations providing social services, health care, insurance and other health-related products and services filled the school's gymnasium.\nFor the first time this year, health and wellness workshops were offered, covering topics such as tobacco cessation, healthy eating, mental health awareness and HIV/AIDS.\nEastside Christian Church partnered with Community Action of Southern Indiana and Centerstone to host the free event for families and individuals in need.\nFor the first two years the event was held at Eastside Christian Church, two miles from the high school on Veterans Parkway."}
