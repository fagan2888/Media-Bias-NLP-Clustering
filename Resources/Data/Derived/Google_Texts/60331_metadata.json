We're conquering new elements. We're going different places with stories. It's not just rehashing the same old stuff over and over.\"\n\nThompson, who mentioned how she loves the cast and the fact that the show is still on the air after four years, feels that working on the series is \"just such a beautiful experience.\u201d\n\nIn a recently released promo for the upcoming premiere we get to see how raw Bay is feeling after her split with Emmett.
