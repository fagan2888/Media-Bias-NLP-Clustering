The Lake Havasu City location has four providers, including Joselyn Branchik-Jedick, D.O., Sports Medicine; Sandra Ulmer, FNP; Carol Capozzi, FNP; and Connie Ebach, FNP. The four serve about 1,000 patients in their 15 exam rooms.\n\nWith completion of six new exam rooms in 2015, the clinic plans to expand its staff, too. They currently seek one new doctor and another Family Nurse Practitioner.\n\nThe clinic features a sliding fee scale for services that is based on an individual\u2019s income. Other amenities include discounted vaccinations for children, acceptance of most insurance, an in-house Lab Corp. technician, bilingual staff and translation services, and advocates who help people navigate the state and federal medical insurance programs.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of folks that don\u2019t have health insurance and they don\u2019t know where to go to get it,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cAnd, they don\u2019t know just how close they are to getting it.\u201d\n\nThe clinic\u2019s health insurance advocate, or application counselor, has helped sign up about 500 individuals so far this year with either the state\u2019s Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS), or the federal Affordable Care Act. Overall in Arizona, North Country has helped 11,000 individuals sign up for insurance.\n\nMedical insurance premium prices range from free to $800 depending on denominators including age, residency, income and tobacco use. Advocates help individuals understand the related tax credits, too. Open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is Nov. 3 this year through Jan. 31, 2016.\n\n\u201cWe are more than just a medical clinic, there\u2019s outreach,\u201d said Carol Cronjager, Well Woman Healthcheck Program Coordinator for North Country.\n\nFor example, a mammogram screening Saturday at Kingman Regional Medical Center, in Kingman, served 14 women who may have otherwise gone without the test.\n\n\u201cBreast cancer mortality rates have decreased by 34 percent since 1990 because of screenings,\u201d Cronjager said. \u201cNow, there are 3.1 million breast cancer survivors.\u201d\n\nEarly detection is the key to survival. Educating the public is crucial when one in eight women, and one in 1,000 men, will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lives, she said.

Family Resource Center and Havasu Community Health Foundation. Programs included in the outreach lineup center on diabetes, sexual assault response, HIV/AIDS treatment and support, child development, pregnancy, cancer screening and domestic violence.\n\n\u201cWe are customer-service oriented,\u201d Cronjager said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to help them find the service they need.\u201d\n\nNorth Country Healthcare was founded in 1991 in Flagstaff and stems from the former Flagstaff Community Free Clinic. Other current clinic locations include Ash Fork, Bullhead City, Grand Canyon, Holbrook, Kingman, Payson, Round Valley, Seligman, Show Low, St. Johns, Williams and Winslow.
