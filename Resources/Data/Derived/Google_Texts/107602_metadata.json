He\u2019s spinning in his grave when he sees we\u2019re not beating ISIS,\u201d Trump said:\n\nWe are doing a politically correct war. We have to knock the hell out of ISIS. They cut off heads. They\u2019re drowning people. We have to knock them out. We have to knock them out bad. We have to get back to our country. We have to rebuild our country now. It\u2019s time. It\u2019s now time that we rebuild the United States. Our roads are falling apart. Our schools are a disgrace. You see it on television \u2014 rat-infested, walls falling down. We build schools over there, we build it again, they blow it up, we build it again they blow it up. This goes on four or five times. And if they need money for Brooklyn, if they need money for Boca, they need money for any place, we don\u2019t have it to do anything. Our thinking is wrong. We\u2019re going to have really smart thinking. We are going to think so good and here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen: We\u2019re going to start winning again.\n\nTrump noted that the rest of the world \u2014 especially China \u2014 is taking advantage of America, beating the United States at everything.\n\n\u201cThink about it: When was the last time the United States won at everything? We\u2019re losing at war, we\u2019re losing at trade, we\u2019re losing at everything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t China. I use China because it\u2019s greatest abuser of all. China abuses us more than anyone. I hope they still like me after this speech by the way, but I don\u2019t care. I have the biggest bank in the world is a tenant of mine in Manhattan, from China \u2014 400 million customers \u2014 the biggest bank in the world.\u201d\n\nTrump said that, if the United States actually tried, \u201cwe could do great against China.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sell condos in China for tens of millions of dollars \u2014 I love China, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep letting it go on.\u201d\n\nTrump then laid out what he envisions a Trump presidency would look like.\n\n\u201cSo here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Trump said:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump hammered the core issues of immigration, trade, and national security in a speech Sunday night, 2 days before Florida voters head to the polls.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Donald Trump hammered the core issues of immigration, trade, and national security in a speech Sunday night, 2 days before Florida voters head to the polls.", "title": "'Win, Win, Win!': Donald Trump Zones in on Core Populist Nationalist Issues - We'll Make America 'Greater Than Ever Before' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/donald-trump-boca-florida-AP.png", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/13/donald-trump-zones-in-on-core-populist-nationalist-issues-well-make-america-greater-than-ever-before/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump hammered the core issues of immigration, trade, and national security in a speech Sunday night, 2 days before Florida voters head to the polls.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/donald-trump-boca-florida-AP.png", "title": "'Win, Win, Win!': Donald Trump Zones in on Core Populist Nationalist Issues - We'll Make America 'Greater Than Ever Before' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "border, Border Wall, China, Donald Trump, Education, Florida, George Patton, ISIS, islamic extremism, Islamic State, Make America Great Again, Mexico, national security, nationalist, obamacare, populist, terrorism, trade policy, veterans,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Immigration,donald trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "veterans", "published_time": "2016-03-13T19:39:35-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0dd3\"", "article_summary": "And if they need money for Brooklyn, if they need money for Boca, they need money for any place, we don\u2019t have it to do anything.\n\u201cThink about it: When was the last time the United States won at everything?\nTrump noted that the rest of the world \u2014 especially China \u2014 is taking advantage of America, beating the United States at everything.\nIt\u2019s now time that we rebuild the United States.\nHe\u2019s spinning in his grave when he sees we\u2019re not beating ISIS,\u201d Trump said:We are doing a politically correct war."}
