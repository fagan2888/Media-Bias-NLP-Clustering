Associated Press\n\nThis year\u2019s Beijing Marathon runners who need to take a leak will have to hold it or find somewhere private to go \u2014 unless they want to be disqualified.\n\nContestants for this year\u2019s Beijing Marathon, a 26.2-mile race that starts at Tiananmen Square and snakes through the heart of Beijing, ending at the National Stadium, will be eliminated from the race should they choose to urinate in public places, state media reported Wednesday. A woman answering the phone at the organizing committee of the Beijing Marathon office confirmed the regulation and said pre-registration for the 2014 Marathon, which will take place on October 19, opens this week.\n\nLast year, some of the more than 30,000 marathon runners, many of them foreign, drew ire from Beijing authorities when they urinated on the red walls of the Forbidden City and on hedges along the route. Pictures of runners peeing went viral, sparking outrage on China\u2019s lively social media networks.\n\nAt the time, Beijing marathon organizers said that runners had no reason to urinate so freely. The committee told the Beijing Youth Daily the public peeing instead was because of \u201cuncivilized behavior,\u201d adding that enough portable toilets \u2013 two to three for every five kilometers along the route, according to one staff member \u2013 had been provided.\n\nLess than a month after the controversy, Beijing\u2019s government ordered organizers of large, public events to provide at least one portable toilet for every 70 people present, compared to the previous standard of one toilet per every 100 participants.\n\nVeteran marathon runners say it\u2019s not uncommon to see people publicly relieving themselves at races in other cities, as lines for portable toilets can easily get crowded. For example, runners crossing the Verazzano-Narrows Bridge from Staten Island to Brooklyn, where the New York City Marathon begins, like to urinate off the side. Likewise, Paula Radcliffe, the world\u2019s female marathon record holder, made headlines when she squatted on the side of the London Marathon course in 2005 to defecate four miles from the finish line.\n\nIn the fall, Runner\u2019s World reported that Portable Sanitation Association International, a trade association, was going to review its standards on how race organizers should plan for the number of toilets per event, the first such review in more than 20 years. The current formula is based on sheer number of event participants, but may be revised to also reflect gender breakdowns of participants, among other factors.\n\nReaders, do you think it\u2019s fair for Beijing Marathon runners to be disqualified for public urination?
