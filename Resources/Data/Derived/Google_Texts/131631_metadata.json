Those plans include Obama hitting the campaign trail as early as the spring to help unite the party after the primaries and to sound off on Republicans he portrays as not serious enough for prime time.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe\u2019s been watching the race come together so far and has been eager to dip in, already taking swings at Donald Trump, Mike Huckabee and Jeb Bush, among others.\n\nObama\u2019s expected to be active in House and Senate races, too, mostly in fundraising, but in other ways as well, given a Senate map that\u2019s the flip side of 2014, with most competitive races in blue and Obama-friendly states.\n\nUnderlying all of this is a question that will start to come into focus in Tuesday night\u2019s debate: how much the candidates running for president and every other office embrace Obama and his legacy, and how much they try to distance themselves.\n\nAmong many voters, they need him \u2014 no one is more popular with Democrats at the moment and he could move enough to help secure battlegrounds like Florida and Wisconsin. But they also need him to stay away from other contests; polling shows him almost certain to be an anchor in North Carolina and Iowa.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot at stake: Whoever the nominee is will need to activate the Obama coalition \u2014 mostly African-Americans, Latinos, young people and others who were first-time voters in 2008 \u2014 in the general election, and to win the primaries as well. That\u2019s going to be hard to do without embracing Obama for the people running for president and, to a lesser extent, for other Democratic candidates as well.\n\nDemocrats say they're eager to have him.\n\n\u201cHe is a powerful voice reminding voters of exactly how bad things were when the last Republican administration left office,\u201d said Democratic National Committee communications director Luis Miranda. \u201cThe record of job growth, reducing the number of uninsured and investments that are expanding opportunities for all Americans are all part of an incredible record to build on.\u201d\n\n\"Republicans are going to make sure that every Democrat owns Barack Obama,\" said Mo Elleithee, the executive director of the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service and a former Democratic National Committee communications director. \"The choice every Democrat has is: Try to resist that and hide under a desk or just embrace the good. And there\u2019s a lot more good today than there was in the midterms.\"\n\nAs for presidential candidates, Elleithee added, \"He has won two straight presidential elections, he has a strong following among the progressive base. Don\u2019t be an idiot, campaign with him.\"\n\nFor Obama, the aims are to preserve his legacy as president and reverse the trend that there are fewer Democrats left in office after every election cycle since he was first elected.\n\n\u201cA lot of the progress is fragile. If there\u2019s a Republican president and Congress, a lot of what he\u2019s done could be overturned by a stacked court or by Congress,\" said Tommy Vietor, a former Obama aide on the campaign and in the White House.\n\n\"I definitely need a Democratic successor because the alternatives we\u2019ve got are not what I had in mind,\" Obama told donors at a fundraiser in California this weekend.\n\nWith the primary field still not quite set and candidates still being recruited for down-ballot races, the White House hasn\u2019t gotten into much depth about plans or schedules with the Democratic Governors Association, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee or the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nBut they\u2019ve got big plans, said David Simas, Obama\u2019s political director.\n\n\"As he has in years past, the president will do all he can to support Democrats up and down the ticket in 2016 to build on the progress of the last eight years,\u201d Simas said. \u201cAs head of the party, he\u2019ll be making sure candidates have the resources they need to wage effective campaigns and he\u2019ll be a forceful messenger for the values and priorities championed by Democrats.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton, who as a former member of the administration and a candidate looking to succeed him has the deepest connections unless and until Joe Biden gets into the race, has accelerated her answer to the Obama question in recent weeks. She has distanced herself from the administration on immigration, the Keystone pipeline, gun control, Syria, the Cadillac tax within Obamacare and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\n\nBernie Sanders\u2019 campaign, meanwhile, is powered in large part by the frustration with what\u2019s seen as a rich-get-richer economy that\u2019s grown on Obama\u2019s watch, and he emphasizes his positions to the left of Obama \u2014 as does Martin O'Malley, who's annoyed some in the West Wing with some of his moves to outflank the president.\n\nThis won\u2019t be like 2008, when John McCain essentially had to sneak into the White House for an uncomfortable Rose Garden endorsement from George W. Bush, who was deeply unpopular as a result of the Iraq War and imploding economy, that McCain was distancing himself from within hours.\n\nBarring a dramatic change, this president looks likely to be a help for the Democratic nominee. Tom Jensen of Public Policy Polling pointed to approval ratings hovering around 45 percent versus disapproval at 50 percent.\n\n\"He's certainly not popular. But he's not very unpopular either,\" Jensen said.\n\nThat might be enough.\n\n\"With the way that people feel about politicians these days, if Obama was to break even, Democrats will win the presidential race this year, because break even is the new good,\u201d Jensen said.\n\nThe major question looming over Obama\u2019s activity for the moment is whether his vice president will enter the race. The prospect of having two members of his administration running against each other is difficult enough, but these are two people with whom the president has deep personal relationships.\n\nBefore the Biden flirtation got serious, Obama had been notably sprinkling nice things about Clinton into his public remarks. In recent weeks, he has even-handedly been paying even-handed compliments to both.\n\nAccording to Jensen, that won\u2019t be enough for Biden if he\u2019s hoping to win people over by convincing them he'd be heir to the Obama legacy \u2014 particularly to get primary support among African-Americans and other groups where the president\u2019s most popular and where Clinton\u2019s locked down a lot of support.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s still far and away the most credible figure with Democrats across the country. Biden would actually need the endorsement. Subtle hints won't get the job done,\u201d Jensen said.\n\nWhoever the nominee is will also have to deal with a president who\u2019s shown no signs of wanting to fade into the background \u2014 on the contrary, he\u2019s been pushing forward on a number of issues that are highly charged politically.\n\nIn the White House, they expect that at some point Obama will have to step back. But they believe that point has gotten pushed deeper into the campaign season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a long list of things he wants to get done,\u201d Vietor said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine him giving that agenda a back seat to any candidate that\u2019s running.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "With his popularity holding, the president is planning to play an active role in the campaign.", "title": "Obama won't shrink from 2016 race", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/barack-obama-2016-214617", "image": "http://static.politico.com/db/a1/a2a2ade349ff8ba2e6d99b54e8a4/151009-barack-obama-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "With his popularity holding, the president is planning to play an active role in the campaign.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "President Barack Obama heads into the 2016 campaign season in a position few in the White House or anywhere else expected a year ago: in demand.\nIn the White House, they expect that at some point Obama will have to step back.\nBefore the Biden flirtation got serious, Obama had been notably sprinkling nice things about Clinton into his public remarks.\nThe major question looming over Obama\u2019s activity for the moment is whether his vice president will enter the race.\nThat\u2019s going to be hard to do without embracing Obama for the people running for president and, to a lesser extent, for other Democratic candidates as well."}
