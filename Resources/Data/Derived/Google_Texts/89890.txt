A public effort to reduce Mt. Lebanon's deer population got off to a quiet start Saturday, with the municipality and the private company overseeing the hunt offering few details.

Connecticut-based White Buffalo Inc., which is overseeing the hunt's archers and secured rights to hunt on private property, did not respond to phone calls. Mt. Lebanon spokeswoman Susan Morgans said she did not know whether the archers killed any deer.

The town tried culling deer last winter by luring them into corrals and shooting them, but protesters sprayed deer repellent around the corrals. Six deer were killed.

Mt. Lebanon and White Buffalo officials won't say on which private properties the archers hunted Saturday.

Jason Margolis, a resident opposed to the deer control project, said that's a safety concern.

“It's just a matter of time until a wounded deer will run out into traffic or in front of children,” he said.

Allegheny County 911 dispatchers said they had no reports of injuries connected to the hunt. Hunting will continue daily, except for Sundays, until Jan. 31, but Morgans said the municipality will not issue daily reports.

“They just want to make it go away. They want to keep it quiet, keep it hidden,” Margolis said.

Archers are scheduled to begin targeting deer in municipal parks Monday.
