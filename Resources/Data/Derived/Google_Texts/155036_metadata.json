(AP) \u2014 In an online profile of \u201cOur Farmers,\u201d New York City milk bottler Elmhurst Dairy tells the story of how David Wood bought his first two calves as a part-time hobby in 1970 and grew his Saratoga County farm to more than a thousand Holsteins, whose milk is trucked every day to its plant in Queens.\n\nAt least, it used to be.\n\nElmhurst abruptly cut ties with Wood\u2019s seven-farmer Mohawk Valley Cooperative and another small co-op in central New York in March, giving them 30 days to find new buyers for their milk. It couldn\u2019t have happened at a worse time, with a nationwide glut of milk and plummeting prices.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are scrambling to get all their milk sold,\u201d said Wood, who for 13 years sent milk to Elmhurst from Eildon Tweed Farm, which was founded by his wife\u2019s Scottish ancestors in 1794 in the Saratoga County town of West Charlton. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult market right now. It took a lot of work to find a market, but we now have short-term contracts with three buyers and have been selling all our milk for the past week.\u201d\n\nThis is shaping up as a challenging year for all U.S. dairy farmers, who enjoyed record high milk prices and low feed prices last year. An increase in milk production combined with sharply lower exports and declining sales of fresh milk have combined to depress milk prices paid to farmers from a 2014 high of about $28 per hundred pounds \u2014 about 9 gallons \u2014 to below $18 this spring.\n\nWood said he\u2019s currently selling milk for less than it costs him to produce it \u2014 around $20 per hundred pounds.\n\n\u201cThis issue is affecting both large and small co-ops,\u201d said Joe Morrissey, a spokesman for the state Department of Agriculture and Markets. But small groups are finding fewer outlets for their milk than they had in the past.\n\nWood\u2019s small cooperative is something more typical in the Northeast than elsewhere, said Andrew Novakovic, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University and a part-time U.S. Department of Agriculture economist. Most milk is marketed through large national or regional cooperatives, but in the Northeast, small groups of farmers have been able to negotiate premium prices by guaranteeing a processor one to three 75,000-gallon tankers a day of high-quality milk.\n\n\u201cThat has started to change as milk volume has gone up and people aren\u2019t drinking as much milk as they used to, especially in the Northeast,\u201d Novakovic said. \u201cElmhurst and some other processors can\u2019t afford to take excess milk. They\u2019ve found an alternative supplier that would sell them just what they need, so they no longer need a dedicated supply from these small cooperatives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Low milk prices, glutted market put strain on dairy farmers", "title": "Low milk prices, glutted market put strain on dairy farmers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Low milk prices, glutted market put strain on dairy farmers", "title": "Low milk prices, glutted market put strain on dairy farmers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/03/low_milk_prices_glutted_market_put_strain_on_dairy_farmers/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/dairy-farmers-milk-prices.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Low milk prices, glutted market put strain on dairy farmers", "title": "Low milk prices, glutted market put strain on dairy farmers", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/dairy-farmers-milk-prices.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Esch", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Wood said he\u2019s currently selling milk for less than it costs him to produce it \u2014 around $20 per hundred pounds.\nIt couldn\u2019t have happened at a worse time, with a nationwide glut of milk and plummeting prices.\nAn increase in milk production combined with sharply lower exports and declining sales of fresh milk have combined to depress milk prices paid to farmers from a 2014 high of about $28 per hundred pounds \u2014 about 9 gallons \u2014 to below $18 this spring.\nIt took a lot of work to find a market, but we now have short-term contracts with three buyers and have been selling all our milk for the past week.\u201dThis is shaping up as a challenging year for all U.S. dairy farmers, who enjoyed record high milk prices and low feed prices last year.\nMost milk is marketed through large national or regional cooperatives, but in the Northeast, small groups of farmers have been able to negotiate premium prices by guaranteeing a processor one to three 75,000-gallon tankers a day of high-quality milk."}
