In November 2012, San Francisco voters passed Proposition E, The Gross Receipts Tax and Business Registration Fees Ordinance (the Gross Receipts Tax). The changes went into effect on January 1, 2014, and it is important to be aware of the new tax and how it will affect your business. The measure is intended to replace, over time, San Francisco’s 1.5% payroll expense tax. In short, a phasing out of the current payroll tax will begin in 2014, and by 2018, businesses in the City of San Francisco (the City) will file Gross Receipts Tax returns and pay the annual Gross Receipts Tax, which will be measured by the business’s gross receipts from all taxable business activities attributable to the City.

In 2014, affected businesses will pay the Gross Receipts Tax at 10% of the rates approved by voters; this increases to 25% in 2015, 50% in 2016, 75% in 2017, and 100% in 2018. For businesses in the financial services industry, the tax, once fully phased in, is expected to be imposed at rates between 0.40% (for gross receipts up to $1 million) and 0.56% (for gross receipts in excess of $25 million), as shown in the table below.

Gross Receipts Rate $0 - $1,000,000 0.400% $1,000,001 - $2,500,000 0.460% $2,500,001 - $25,000,000 0.510% $25,000,000 + 0.560%

Taxpayers deriving gross receipts from business activities both from within the City and outside the City are required to allocate or apportion their taxable gross receipts in accordance with the new rules, which could be an onerous task. This is particularly true, because for some taxpayers, this means filing as a unitary business in San Francisco and apportioning receipts on either a US or worldwide basis.
