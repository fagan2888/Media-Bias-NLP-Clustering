The $60 million project will be funded with an equal split of private donations, state money and UCF funding money.\n\nTwo members of the board voted against the project. Gov. Rick Scott vetoed funding for the project last year, but UCF Board Chairman Marcos Marchena said the governor had input on this latest proposal.\n\n\u201cAn example of a concern that resulted in a change to the project was over UCF building housing downtown,\u201d Marchena said. \u201cFrankly, we looked at the proposed project and made a determination we would not build housing downtown and let that be a private sector activity.\u201d\n\nStill, the project wasn\u2019t approved unanimously. Dean Colson on the Board of Governors voted against it, saying UCF is a very good university \u2013 but isn\u2019t a great university.\n\n\u201cAnd building another campus is not a step forward in becoming great,\u201d Colson said. \u201cIf UCF were here today asking for $100 million dollars for a new science building and to recruit five or 10 academic stars, I would be supportive.\u201d\n\nThe next step is to get the Florida Legislature to fund it in the budget. Dan Hoslenbeck, UCF\u2019s vice president of university relations, said none of the capital projects have been revealed in the budget, but lawmakers must have a budget ready by next Tuesday though.\n\nUCF will share the downtown campus with Valencia College, offering programs in digital media, health care and public service, among others.\n\nReporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
