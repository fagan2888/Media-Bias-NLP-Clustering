They bricked up 3 after 3, going 0-for-10 in the first half and barely drawing iron on some of them. Paige opened the second half with North Carolina\u2019s 11th straight miss, and for the next 10 minutes, the Tar Heels basically ignored the 3-point line.\n\nOnly when Trevor Cooney and Malachi Richardson triggered a 10-0 Syracuse run to trim a 17-point deficit to seven did Carolina start thinking long range again. Paige made three 3s and Theo Pinson hit another to stifle the rally and make Carolina almost respectable from the 3-point line: 4 for 17 for the game.\n\nKennedy Meeks finished with 15 points and eight rebounds, including a paddy cake putback after batting a second offensive rebound to himself off glass. That gave the Heels a 67-53 lead.\n\nBefore Paige found his range, Carolina built its lead on the inside, with big-time help from an in-your-face defense that held Syracuse\u2019s leading scorer Michael Gbinije to 12 points on 5-for-18 shooting.\n\n\u201cWe had a brain lapse there for about three minutes in the second half, but other than that I thought we were really good defensively against a team that\u2019s hard to guard,\u201d said Carolina coach Roy Williams, in search of his third title.\n\nIt was a reminder of the days before the 3-point shot was invented, when the way to really beat a zone \u2014 and Boeheim\u2019s 2-3 is the best in the game \u2014 was to make blink-of-an-eye passes in and around the paint and crash the offensive glass to take advantage of a defense that doesn\u2019t put bodies on bodies when the ball goes up.\n\nThat plan still works these days.\n\nEarly in the second half, Jackson made a jump pass from the corner to the lane, where Paige was waiting and batted the ball with an open hand over to Meeks, who dunked.\n\nA bit later, Joel Berry got an easy offensive rebound and a layup to put the Tar Heels ahead by 17.\n\nNorth Carolina finished with 16 second-chance points on 16 offensive boards. Even more telling were points in the paint: Tar Heels 50, Orange 32.\n\nSyracuse trailed by 16 in its crazy comeback victory over Virginia last week to make it here. But there was no full-court press that could beat the Heels, and no meltdown awaiting from them either.\n\nCooney led the Orange (23-14), the first No. 10 seed to make it to the Final Four, with 22 points. Richardson had 17, but after his 3 trimmed the deficit to seven with 9:48 left, Syracuse couldn\u2019t pull closer.\n\nTIP-INS:\n\nNorth Carolina: Meeks missed only two shots and tipped both of them back to himself. His line for the last two games: 11 for 13 from the field with 11 rebounds. \u2026 Overall, Carolina outrebounded Syracuse 43-31.\n\nSyracuse: Syracuse went 4 for 13 from the free throw line and 8 for 25 from 3.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nNorth Carolina: Monday vs. Villanova for the program\u2019s sixth title.\n\nSyracuse: Season over.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "North Carolina rolls past Syracuse into NCAA Tournament Championship", "title": "North Carolina rolls past Syracuse into NCAA Tournament Championship", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/02/north-carolina-rolls-past-syracuse-into-ncaa-tournament-championship/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160402__2273b1aa055cfa11940f6a706700c036p1.jpg", "height": 461}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160402__2273b1aa055cfa11940f6a706700c036p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-02T21:06:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T22:15:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Syracuse: Syracuse went 4 for 13 from the free throw line and 8 for 25 from 3.\nThen, the Tar Heels, ranked 284th in the country this season from long range, reversed that one-game trend.\nPaige finished with 13 points and Brice Johnson and Justin Jackson led North Carolina (33-6) with 16 apiece, as the Tar Heels, the lone No.\nPaige opened the second half with North Carolina\u2019s 11th straight miss, and for the next 10 minutes, the Tar Heels basically ignored the 3-point line.\nA bit later, Joel Berry got an easy offensive rebound and a layup to put the Tar Heels ahead by 17."}
