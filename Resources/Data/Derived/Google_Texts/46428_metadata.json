It\u2019s unclear how stable his position is.\n\nFew teams ever keep more than three quarterbacks on the final roster. Space is too valuable elsewhere. But while Robert Griffin III is expected to be healthy and ready to start the season opener on Sept. 9, the status of backup Kirk Cousins (sprained right foot) remains unclear. Though he expects to practice fully this week, the team remains cautious. Veteran Rex Grossman is the third-string quarterback.\n\nAnd so, for now, White sticks. It didn\u2019t hurt that Washington had two extra spots for the first month of the season. Defensive lineman Jarvis Jenkins and linebacker Rob Jackson will miss the first four games thanks to performance-enhancing drug use suspensions by the NFL.\n\nWhen they return, it seems unlikely White would survive, barring an injury in the meantime to one of the quarterbacks ahead of him. But it\u2019s also possible the Redskins think that insurance policy is worth keeping him around for a month instead of a ninth offensive lineman or a sixth wide receiver.\n\nThe coaching staff saw improvement in White throughout the summer. He shook off the rust and was a better passer by the end of training camp. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s ready for a starting job any time soon. White is far too inconsistent in his drops and the rhythm and accuracy of his throws. But he is an elite athlete and that steady improvement and the roster situation gave him a chance to stay.\n\n\u201cThe more football [White] is around, the more he works at it, the better he\u2019ll get,\u201d Redskins offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cWith the attitude that he does have he will get better because he\u2019s as hard on himself as anybody I\u2019ve been around. Everything is his fault. That\u2019s the way he looks at it.\u201d\n\nWhite, 27, was once a star quarterback at West Virginia. But after one season with the Miami Dolphins, he was cut at the end of training camp in 2010 and hasn\u2019t played in an NFL game since.\n\nWhite signed a contract with the Kansas City Royals less than a week after the Dolphins cut him. He spent that fall at instructional league in Arizona working with the organization\u2019s top prospects.\n\nBut he remained interested in playing football, failing to report for Kansas City\u2019s spring training in 2011 and passing on a contract offer by the Miami Marlins in early 2013. Instead, White began quarterback workouts in San Diego in late January and that led to the opportunity in Washington. He made the most of it.\n\n\u201cI definitely want to continue playing the game,\u201d White told reporters in Tampa after playing the entire preseason finale against the Bucaneers. \u201cI have a lot of passion for it, I love it. I\u2019ve been playing it for a while now. I took a little break, which was a huge mistake on my part. But everything happens for a reason.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins won that game 30-12 and White was 13-for-22 for 181 passing yards and one interception. He also scrambled seven times for 20 yards, including a rushing touchdown.\n\nLike his entire summer, it was far from a perfect effort. White immediately spoke of the mistakes he\u2019d made.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I hurt myself, but I don\u2019t know if I helped myself,\u201d White said afterward.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The coaching staff saw improvement in White throughout the summer.
