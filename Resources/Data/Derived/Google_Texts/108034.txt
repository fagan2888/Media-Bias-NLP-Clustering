DIXON (WIFR) -- Hundreds of workers at the Dixon Correctional Center are at the center of a massive data breach.

The Illinois Department of Corrections says it accidentally gave out the names, social security numbers, ranks, and salaries of more than 1,000 employees at the Dixon and Lawrence prisons. The IDOC says the information was included in a response to a Freedom of Information Act request.

The department is investigating the breach and reviewing procedures to prevent a repeat.
