REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\n4780374\n\nNew York insurance regulators have opened an \u201cofficial investigation\u201d into the nation\u2019s largest Obamacare health co-op for \u201csubstantial underreporting\u201d and \u201cinaccurate representations\u201d of its financial condition, according to the New York Department of Financial Services.\n\nDFS also is seeking to appoint an independent monitor to oversee the management of the failed health insurance co-op, called Health Republic of New York.\n\nThe swiftly unfolding crisis forced regulators to issue its extraordinary actions Sunday. Federal taxpayers are expected to pick up the tab for $355 million in losses due to Health Republic.\n\nState regulators reported they had retained the public accounting firm of Alvarez & Marsell to take over the co-op. That firm also oversaw the closure of accounting giant Arthur Anderson.\n\nThe insurance regulators reported that, \u201cNYDFS investigators are collecting and reviewing evidence relating to Health Republic\u2019s substantial underreporting to NYDFS of its financial obligations. Among other issues, the investigation will examine the causes of the inaccurate representations to NYDFS regarding the company\u2019s financial condition.\u201d\n\nThe same regulators previously ordered Health Republic to cease issuing health insurance policies on September 25. At the time they gave customers until the end of the year to find another insurance provider.\n\nHowever, on October 30 when they first reported that Health Republic faced more serious financial problems and that it had misled regulators, regulators told the co-op\u2019s 215,000 poor and low-income customers they had to choose a new insurance company by November 15.\n\nNew York regulators also put into motion a series of auto-enrollment processes to allow customers to continue with some insurance coverage.\n\nThe Obama administration awarded Health Republic $265 million in 2012 and issued an additional emergency $90 million more in September 2014 in \u201csolvency funds.\u201d\n\nHealth Republic is the largest of the 23 Obamacare co-ops in the country. It was founded by political activist Sarah Horowitz who first met then Senator Barack Obama when they both worked at the same think tank.\n\nIn addition to the $355 million she received from the Obama administration for her New York co-op, Horowitz also received an additional $111 million to create a New Jersey co-op and $62 million to establish a co-op in Oregon.\n\nThe Oregon co-op announced last month that it too would be closing its doors.\n\nHealth Republic is one of the 13 health co-ops to have failed in only two years of operation.\n\nFollow Richard on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Richard Pollock", "description": "Regulators to investigate \"substantial underreporting\" of financial conditions by the nation's largest Obamacare health co-op.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "New York insurance regulators have opened an \"official investigation\" into the nation\u2019s largest Obamacare health co-op for \u201csubstantial underreporting\u201d and \"inaccurate representations\" of its fi", "title": "Largest Obamacare Co-Op Under \u2018Official Investigation\u2019 By Regulators", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/11/09/largest-obamacare-co-op-under-official-investigation-by-regulators/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-17T174846Z_1_CBREA3G1DHC00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-e1447171605943.jpg", "height": 344}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Regulators to investigate \"substantial underreporting\" of financial conditions by the nation's largest Obamacare health co-op.", "title": "Largest Obamacare Co-Op Under \u2018Official Investigation\u2019 By Regulators Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/11/09/largest-obamacare-co-op-under-official-investigation-by-regulators/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-17T174846Z_1_CBREA3G1DHC00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-e1447171605943.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-09 18:16:00", "sailthru.title": "Largest Obamacare Co-Op Under 'Official Investigation' By Regulators", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "health republic of new york,obamacare co-ops", "sailthru.description": "New York insurance regulators have opened an \"official investigation\" into the nation\u2019s largest Obamacare health co-op for \u201csubstantial underreporting\u201d and \"inaccurate representations\" of its fi", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-17T174846Z_1_CBREA3G1DHC00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-e1447171605943.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "REUTERS/Mike Segar4780374New York insurance regulators have opened an \u201cofficial investigation\u201d into the nation\u2019s largest Obamacare health co-op for \u201csubstantial underreporting\u201d and \u201cinaccurate representations\u201d of its financial condition, according to the New York Department of Financial Services.\nDFS also is seeking to appoint an independent monitor to oversee the management of the failed health insurance co-op, called Health Republic of New York.\nState regulators reported they had retained the public accounting firm of Alvarez & Marsell to take over the co-op.\nHealth Republic is one of the 13 health co-ops to have failed in only two years of operation.\nNew York regulators also put into motion a series of auto-enrollment processes to allow customers to continue with some insurance coverage."}
