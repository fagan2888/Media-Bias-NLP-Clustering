Billions of dollars would be invested in our state\u2019s economy. Tens of thousands of hardworking men and women would find well-paying jobs transforming their lives and those of their families.\n\nAnd the nation would come to see Alabama as a premier model for advanced manufacturing recruitment.\n\nOne bold move had a lasting impact on our state.\n\nLast year nearly 1-million automobiles were made by the skilled-hands of hardworking Alabamians.\n\nOur great state produced nearly $6-billion dollars worth of vehicles last year alone.\n\nSince that first Alabama-made SUV rolled off the assembly line 17 years ago, vehicles have remained our State\u2019s number one export.\n\n99 countries today have cars on their roads that are \u201cMade in Alabama\u201d.\n\nOur state is now home to a fast-growing aerospace industry.\n\nToday nearly 400 aerospace companies employ Alabamians.\n\nAnd next year in Mobile, where we created thousands of jobs, the first Alabama-made Airbus airliner will take off.\n\nWe have recruited over 63-thousand new, future jobs to this state since 20-11.\n\nAlabama\u2019s unemployment rate is at a level this state has not experienced in more than six years.\n\nAnd our economy supported more jobs than it has since 2008.\n\nCompanies worldwide know Alabama is a state willing, ready and very able to work hard to make our state a great place to live and work.\n\nI\u2019ve met these people. I\u2019ve been to their homes. I\u2019ve been to their workplace. I\u2019ve been to their churches, their schools, their Main Streets and their backyards.\n\nAnd they, like me, want so badly to see Alabama grow and prosper.\n\nIn Vernon, Alabama almost the entire town turned out on a sunny day last October to celebrate the opening of K & S Lumber.\n\nWith some state resources the town of 2-thousand people cleared a field for a future Industrial Park, the Lumber company was the first business to open there.\n\nHow many people were getting new jobs at K & S Lumber?\n\nIt may not be the largest economic development project in the state, but it is an example of the optimism of our communities and the ability of our State to do whatever it takes to create jobs.\n\nWhether it\u2019s 4,000 jobs at Mercedes, or 11 at K & S Lumber.\n\nSince Alabama won the battle for Mercedes all southeastern states have become much more aggressive in their efforts to compete for jobs.\n\nThis year we must pass new legislation that will make sure Alabama remains a leader in recruiting new industry and in helping our existing businesses - both large and small.\n\nAnd by encouraging investments that lead to greater, future economic opportunities.\n\nTo do this we have worked with local economic developers and national experts to help us update and improve the incentives we use to recruit new industries.\n\nThis Session we will introduce the Made in Alabama Accelerate Alabama Jobs Incentive Package. Our current incentives are 15 years old, out of date and 100 - percent dependent on borrowing money.\n\nThis new incentives package will no longer be based solely on debt.\n\nIt will increase incentives for new projects that locate in rural areas, like Vernon, Alabama.\n\nIt will offer incentives for those who invest in Small Businesses and Start-Ups.\n\nIt will provide research and development credits for work done with Alabama-based research centers. And it will provide additional incentives for new wages paid to our Veterans.\n\nThe Alabama Legislature has always played a critical role in helping to make sure our state is a leader in economic development, and passing the Accelerate Alabama Economic Incentive Package will ensure Alabama remains a leader.\n\nPassing the Accelerate Alabama Jobs Incentive Package will once again make sure that Alabama leads the nation in the recruitment of high-skilled, well-paying jobs the people of our state need and deserve.\n\nThere is nothing more important to our state than job creation. And having students who are college and career ready is one of the critical components of economic development.\n\nThe Alabama Workforce Council made up of Alabama\u2019s world-class industry leaders will be important to building and maintaining high quality partnerships between industry, education and workforce training institutions.\n\nAnd I want to thank the members of this council for helping to prepare Alabama\u2019s workers for high-wage, high-demand careers.\n\nLast fall we announced a statewide effort to assist small businesses owners and entrepreneurs.\n\nSmall businesses create three out of four jobs.\n\nThere are approximately 400-thousand small businesses in Alabama, and in 2011, over 5-thousand jobs were created by our small businesses.\n\nLast fall we launched the Alabama Small Business Commission, and Atlas Alabama, which help identify all resources available to small businesses, and bring them under one roof.\n\nThe Commission, made up solely of small business owners, will encourage innovation, promote policies to help new business start-ups, and allow small businesses to give state government ideas and suggestions to help their businesses grow.\n\nOur people need the opportunity for good jobs, and our young children must have the opportunity to get a strong foundation for learning.\n\nI want every child in the state of Alabama to have the opportunity to get a quality First Class Pre-K Education.\n\nOur First Class Pre-K program is one of the best state-run programs in the country.\n\nLast fall in Alabama more than 7-thousand 4-year-olds across the state were given the opportunity to go to preschool for free.\n\nFor the eighth year in a row, Alabama\u2019s First Class Voluntary Pre-K program is one of only five in the country that met all the quality benchmarks set out by the National Institute for Early Education Research.\n\nWe must continue to expand our Pre-K program because it makes a real difference in the lives and the education of Alabama\u2019s children.\n\nLast year, children who attended our First Class Pre-K program were less likely to fail a grade in school, and across all grades, they consistently scored higher in reading and in math than those who did not attend.\n\nYet only 12% of Four-year-olds in Alabama have access to First Class Volunteer Pre K.\n\nThat is why once again we must continue to increase funding as we continue to expand this opportunity.\n\nI want every parent to know, that at the end of my term, there will be a First Class PreK classroom available for their child.\n\nWe will also embark on a program to make our people healthier.\n\nIn the coming days I will, through Executive Order, create the Alabama Health Care Improvement Task Force, a panel of 30 experts which will bring me recommendations on how we can improve the quality, accessibility and affordability of healthcare for our people.\n\nAlabama faces major problems with chronic conditions.\n\nMany of our health issues are related to lifestyle choices, poverty and access to quality healthcare.\n\nWe must take real steps to reverse the troubling health trends in our state.\n\nWe have already begun this process by reforming Alabama\u2019s Medicaid system.\n\nAs we try to get our people off Medicaid and into private payment programs through job creation we must realize that our hospitals, especially in rural areas, are dependent on Medicaid to survive.\n\nWe are establishing Regional Care Organizations and will focus on improved outcomes for patients to help lower costs and better manage the health care services given to those served by Medicaid.\n\nBut we cannot allow Federal bureaucracy, and the extremely flawed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to derail our efforts to make sure Alabamians have good quality healthcare, especially the poorest and most vulnerable.\n\nWe know the Healthcare needs in Alabama, and we intend to create solutions that are specific to the needs of Alabama\u2019s people.\n\nAs a Conservative Leader, there are three things that are important to me.\n\nUpholding the rule of law, using our state resources wisely and efficiently and preserving the autonomy of state government.\n\nIn Alabama, the problems that have plagued our prison system for decades has put those principles at risk.\n\nThe rule of law must be observed and those who break the law should be held accountable for their actions.\n\nThe blunt facts are alarming. Alabama\u2019s state-operated prison facilities \u2014 the most overcrowded in the United States \u2014 are operating at more than 195-percent capacity.\n\nWe have been forced to rely on short-term fixes that have proven costly, dangerous and disorganized.\n\nThe result has been an overall increasingly inefficient system.\n\nThat is why over the past year, Alabama lawmakers, leaders in the criminal justice system, local and state judges, district attorneys, victims\u2019 rights groups, and many others have collaborated as part of the Prison Reform Task Force to develop a new plan to reform our prison system.\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy and it certainly won\u2019t be cheap.\n\nBut we cannot ignore and under-fund what is an alarming and dangerous problem that must be addressed.\n\nAs leaders of this state, chosen by the people we serve, we are elected to fix problems, not pass them on to someone else, to a future generation.\n\nThe problems we must tackle may have been decades in the making, but it is up to us to solve them today.\n\nWe must have the insight to recognize what HAS to be done, and the willingness, the desire, the courage, the boldness to do it.\n\nWe have seen this for the last four years as together we have worked to make our government run more efficiently, to reduce spending and to save the hard-earned tax dollars of the people of this state.\n\nFour years ago I stood before you at this podium and said \u201cAlabama state government must live within its means. We must do a better job of prioritizing our resources to get the most out of our state expenditures.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done.\n\nAnd this Legislature has been leading the way.\n\nTogether we took on the challenge of a state budget propped up with federal stimulus dollars that camouflaged the excessive spending, the waste and the inefficiencies that drained our badly needed resources.\n\nWe cut.\n\nWe trimmed.\n\nWe closed.\n\nWe consolidated.\n\nWe did without.\n\nWe made sacrifices.\n\nWe asked our state agencies to do more with less, our schools to make choices between teachers and textbooks.\n\nFour years later the results are remarkable.\n\nThe size of state government has shrunk by 12- percent.\n\nWe\u2019ve reformed Medicaid, consolidated the state\u2019s Law Enforcement agencies and overhauled our Information Technology system.\n\nWe\u2019ve passed a balanced budget each year.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve saved the Alabama taxpayer over 1-point-2 Billion dollars annually.\n\nAnd still today - four years later- it is not enough.\n\nWe have a $264-Million dollar combined shortfall in our General Fund and Education Budgets.\n\nOur state is in debt.\n\nWe owe Millions to the Federal Government.\n\nWe owe Millions to the Bank.\n\nWe owe Millions to our taxpayers by way of a borrowed-out Rainy Day Fund.\n\nAs the men and women elected and accountable to the hard-working taxpayers\n\nwe must give them a more Efficient, Effective and Accountable government.\n\nBecause of our debt, and because there is no growth money going into our General Fund, we cannot adequately pay for and provide the basic essential services to our people.\n\nWe must break the cycle of draining our savings accounts to prop up the General Fund.\n\nWe must break the cycle of borrowing from our Education Fund to prop up the General Fund.\n\nWe must break the cycle of budget shortfalls - year after year.\n\nWe must do what every family in Alabama does everyday - Live within our means and manage our finances wisely.\n\nAnd we must have adequate means.\n\nIf we are to solve our financial problems for future generations of Alabamians we must act today.\n\nLike the hardworking people of this state, I want more for Alabama than just maintaining the status quo. I believe we all do.\n\nWhen I was elected to this office, I began serving my time as Governor with an 8-year, long-term plan to serve our people, to solve our problems and to create opportunities for better education and well-paying jobs.\n\nWe made those deep cuts and have saved billions.\n\nAnd we will never stop working to make sure state government lives within its means.\n\nAnd we will continue to grow our economy with well-paying, highly skilled jobs.\n\nNow, as we look to the future, we must take the steps necessary to help get our state out of debt and find secure financial footing.\n\nRevenue must increase.\n\nThere must be growth money in the State\u2019s General Fund.\n\nThe budget I will send you contains specific solutions.\n\nIf we are to pay our debts, cover the shortfall and create a stream of growth revenue for our stagnant General Fund we must look to increase our revenue.\n\nWe must look at all sources, and tax fairly.\n\nI\u2019ve been a Conservative Republican my entire life, and tax increases are not my ideal solution.\n\nTaxes should be fair among all people. It is unfair for certain groups to be taxed for goods and services while others are not taxed for those same goods and services.\n\nIf Alabama families have to pay their fair share of taxes, so should large national and international corporations.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of the corporations operating in Alabama paid ZERO income tax.\n\nOf the 3-thousand Fortune 500 corporate tax returns filed in Alabama, almost 58-percent paid no income tax to our state.\n\nBy requiring combined reporting, we will eliminate that loophole.\n\nThe budget I will send you will contain 8 separate tax increase proposals - which are fair and necessary - for a total of $541 - Million dollars in estimated increased revenue.\n\nWe must also free up funding so that our Legislature can better manage where the money goes.\n\nNinety-one percent of all state revenues for both budgets are already earmarked.\n\nAlabama has the highest percentage of earmarks in the country, by a huge margin.\n\nI will propose we unearmark some of those funds so that we can better determine the needs of our state and steer the taxpayer dollars where they will be best used.\n\nThe plan I am proposing will replace the funds that we unearmark and create more money in the Education Trust Fund.\n\nThe results will be an estimated $250-300 million more dollars for K-12 Education, the State\u2019s 2 Year systems and Higher Education.\n\nThe problems we now face have been years, even decades in the making.\n\nWe cannot put off solving these problems anymore.\n\nWe cannot cut our way out of this.\n\nThere is nothing more conservative than paying your debts and getting your financial house in order.\n\nAnd by keeping spending at a reasonable level we will actually save money, and potentially create a surplus in the General Fund in future years.\n\nThe problems we face not may not have been ours to make, but they are now ours to fix.\n\nWe must continue to create opportunities for better education and better jobs and a better way of life for our people.\n\nBy 2020, a quarter of a million Service Men and Women will be exiting the military and returning to America\u2019s communities.\n\nIn Alabama the Unemployment Rate for Veterans is at 7-percent.\n\nThrough our newly created Alabama Veterans Network we will work to make sure our Veterans are able are to find the jobs they need and deserve.\n\nThrough ALAVETNET we will introduce legislation that gives an employer tax credit for hiring any unemployed Veteran.\n\nWe will do everything we can to serve the men and women who have risked their lives for our freedom.\n\nThis year we will also introduce legislation that will give Alabama\u2019s Foster Children tuition scholarships to our state\u2019s public 2-year colleges and universities.\n\nFostering hope will offer children currently or formerly in Alabama\u2019s Foster Care System the opportunity to get a college education.\n\nBy meeting certain requirements foster children who may not ever attend college will be given the opportunity for a better future.\n\nSince 2011 our First Lady has been a voice for victims of domestic violence and their children.\n\nThis Session you will see Dianne in the State House pushing powerful legislation for Domestic Violence victims and their families. This legislation will modernize our current laws, expand victim services and strengthen victim protection.\n\nWe must defend the women, men and children who are going through this dangerous cycle of violence within their own homes.\n\nI hope you will join with me and members of my Administration in our proud support of Dianne in her effort to protect Alabama families from domestic violence.\n\nEveryday when I wake up, I thank God for the opportunity He\u2019s given me to serve the people of this state.\n\nAnd I am grateful for the privilege and the honor of serving the absolute greatest, hardest working, loving, caring and toughest people in the world - the people who make up this great state - the people who proudly call themselves Alabamians.\n\nOne thing I have always known about our people, and it has proven true during my time in office - They do not back down from a challenge.\n\nNot when they are fighting for their basic civil rights, not in defending our nation\u2019s Freedoms and not in the aftermath of Natural Disasters.\n\nAnd as Leaders of this State, neither will we.\n\nWe will not settle.\n\nWe cannot settle for just barely getting by\u2026\n\nThe people deserve better than that.\n\nI\u2019ve had the privilege to travel to every county and every corner of Alabama over the last four years, and most of you have been there with me.\n\nI\u2019m proud of Alabama.\n\nI\u2019m proud to be you Governor.\n\nAnd I know you are proud to serve this state as well.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I learned very early on, it\u2019s that you can always count on the people of this state to work hard and do what we have to do to make this state better.\n\nThe night I was Re-elected as your Governor I promised the people that we will face our challenges head on.\n\nWe will work with both parties, across the aisle, to make our state better.\n\nBecause that\u2019s what our people do - they work together - and that\u2019s what they expect us to do.\n\nTwo decades ago, the men and women elected to serve our people dared to dream big.\n\nThey wanted our state to be even better, they wanted an economically strong state where our people had opportunities like never before.\n\nThey made a choice, and they forever changed the economic landscape in Alabama.\n\nAnd they proved that one bold move, in the face of skepticism and even criticism, can forever change the course of our State.\n\nIt is time we change course.\n\nIt is time we lead our great state and the great men and women who sent us here.\n\nIt\u2019s time for a bold move.\n\nGod Bless you All. And may God continue to bless the Great State of Alabama.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "robert bentley, news", "title": "Read Alabama Gov.
