(AP) - A $24 billion sea of red ink has millions of Americans in vulnerable flood zones, including homeowners still struggling to recover from Superstorm Sandy, facing steep increases in flood insurance premiums.\n\nNew legislation that went into effect this month - the second time in two years Congress has tweaked the troubled National Flood Insurance Program - allows rate increases of up to 18 percent.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be death by a thousand cuts,\u2019\u201d said Scott Primiano, an Amityville, New York, insurance broker who has been holding seminars for clients to explain the new legislation. \u201cThe concept sounds good, but no one can say what the full risk is. \u2026 They are going to take it in bits and pieces every year and it keeps going until Congress determines we\u2019ve had enough.\u201d\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency spokesman Rafael Lemaitre said the flood insurance program has for decades been paying out more than it took in, with the United States as a whole totaling more than $260 billion in flood-related damages between 1980 and 2013. He said the new legislation is \u201cintended to improve the long-term sustainability of the program while being sensitive to needs of policyholders.\u201d\n\nLemaitre noted that a previous overhaul in 2012 had socked many policyholders with even higher rate hikes - as much as 25 percent annually.\n\nIn addition to rate increases capped at 18 percent annually for those with mortgages living in high-risk flood regions, the new legislation means all flood insurance customers nationwide will pay at least a $25 surcharge on their annual premiums. And homeowners with a \u201csecondary residence,\u201d such as vacation properties, will pay a $250 surcharge.\n\nThe law gives FEMA 18 months to complete a study on flood insurance affordability and up to 36 months to find a way to offer targeted assistance to policyholders who can\u2019t afford high premiums. Congress also said FEMA should set a goal of limiting annual premiums to no more than $2,500 per year for $250,000 in coverage, but didn\u2019t offer any suggestions on how to do that.\n\n\u201cMost of the 30 million homeowners have no idea that their flood insurance is going to rise,\u201d says George Kasimos of Toms River, New Jersey, who founded the grass-roots group Stop FEMA Now after learning of increases in flood insurance premiums. \u201cThe exorbitant rise in flood insurance increases is going to make the 2007 housing bubble look like a walk in the park.\u201d\n\nTom Daniels, a 66-year-old retiree from Lindenhurst, New York, said his home had 3 1/2 feet of water after Sandy struck, and received $97,000 in insurance to pay for the damage. He said his flood insurance rates are up $600 a year, and now pays more than $2,800 annually.\n\n\u201cI had a feeling they were going to go up,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019m one of the lucky ones because I only have to pay $50 a month more. I understand that and we\u2019re grateful for what we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nSusan Goldstone said she is still struggling to assist her parents in their attempts to get their Oceanside, New York, home repaired after Sandy flooded up to 8 feet of their house.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still paying for flood insurance, but we\u2019re still not back in the house,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do they expect people to stay in their home? It\u2019s crazy high and then you have to deal with the taxes. When does it end? There must be some other alternative.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Wayne Parry in Toms River, New Jersey, and David Caruso in New York City contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A $24 billion sea of red ink has millions of Americans in vulnerable flood zones, including homeowners still struggling to recover from Superstorm Sandy, facing steep increases in flood insurance premiums.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A $24 billion sea of red ink has millions of Americans in vulnerable flood zones, including homeowners still struggling to recover from Superstorm Sandy, facing steep increases in flood insurance premiums.", "title": "Millions facing higher premium rates for flood insurance", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/12/millions-facing-higher-premium-rates-for-flood-ins/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/12/3fdadfc76d2c7510730f6a7067006520.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/12/3fdadfc76d2c7510730f6a7067006520.jpg", "description": "A $24 billion sea of red ink has millions of Americans in vulnerable flood zones, including homeowners still struggling to recover from Superstorm Sandy, facing steep increases in flood insurance prem", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Millions facing higher premium rates for flood insurance"}, "Author": "FRANK ELTMAN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdeb5\"", "article_summary": "He said his flood insurance rates are up $600 a year, and now pays more than $2,800 annually.\nMINEOLA, N.Y.
