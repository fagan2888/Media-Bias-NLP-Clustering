In October, officials announced the co-op would close at the end of 2015. It was the largest provider of private health insurance plans through the state health insurance marketplace, Kynect.\n\nThe closing affected about 51,000 Kentuckians.\n\nFederal regulators are looking at making claims on money still owed to the failed co-ops and can recover additional money through audits, USA Today reported.\n\nUSA Today also reported that some states have \u201cguarantee funds\u201d that ensure physicians and other health care providers are reimbursed for services provided through commercial health insurers that go under. Those reimbursements to physicians and hospitals could reduce how much money is reimbursed to the federal government.\n\nThat may be precisely what happens in Kentucky.\n\nLast week, Franklin Circuit Court Judge Phillip Shepherd issued an order to liquidate the Kentucky Health Co-Op, a move sought by the state Department of Insurance. The court said the co-op was in hazardous financial condition.\n\nLiquidated assets will be used to pay existing claims by in-network providers. The Department of Insurance will attempt to pay all debts in full, but some providers may be paid at a reduced rate or not at all.\n\n\u201cDeputy liquidators will be gathering claims data and proof of claim forms through Oct. 15. Once everything has been reviewed, they (overseen by Franklin Circuit Court) will distribute the remaining assets,\u201d said the spokeswoman for the Department of Insurance in an email.\n\nIn October, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services notified the Department of Insurance that KYHC would receive \u201crisk corridor payments\u201d \u2014 a system established under the ACA in which insurers contribute to a federal fund they can then tap to cover financial losses due to higher-than-average usage among members or customers.\n\nFor the 2014 plan year, KYHC received $9,642,095 in risk corridor payments. This left a remaining balance of $67,363,499 that can\u2019t be collected until after August 2016.\n\nAt the time, the Court said it was doubtful that the co-op would receive some or all of the funds.\n\nHealth insurance cooperatives have failed in Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Michigan and Oregon.\n\nPeople who were insured by Kentucky Health Cooperative have until the end of February to choose another insurer for 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Of the 23 co-ops created, a dozen have failed,\u00a0including Kentucky Health Cooperative.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "Of the 23 co-ops created, a dozen have failed,\u00a0including Kentucky Health Cooperative.", "title": "As Kentucky Health Co-Op Enters Liquidation, Federal Government Looks to Recoup Costs", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3648, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5936305758_bf3e7fa920_o-e1450383539611.jpg", "height": 1258}, "updated_time": "2016-01-26T07:37:56-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/51735-2/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Of the 23 co-ops created, a dozen have failed,\u00a0including Kentucky Health Cooperative.", "creator": "@JaNelSJohnson", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5936305758_bf3e7fa920_o-e1450383539611.jpg", "title": "As Kentucky Health Co-Op Enters Liquidation, Federal Government Looks to Recoup Costs", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Health", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2016-01-25T11:15:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-26T07:37:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "It was the largest provider of private health insurance plans through the state health insurance marketplace, Kynect.\nPeople who were insured by Kentucky Health Cooperative have until the end of February to choose another insurer for 2016.\nThe situation with the Kentucky Health Cooperative is complicated by the liquidation of the entity, which a state court ordered this month.\nAbout $2.4 billion of federal funds was put into the creation of the startup health insurance providers.\nOf the 23 co-ops created, a dozen have failed, including Kentucky Health Cooperative."}
