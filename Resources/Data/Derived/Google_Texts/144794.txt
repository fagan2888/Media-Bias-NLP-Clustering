The top executive of United Kingdom-based Admiral Group plc is making his last official visit this week to the company’s U.S. businesses — Elephant Insurance Services LLC and its sister company, Compare.com, based in Henrico County, just outside of Richmond, Va.

“We are enthused with what is happening here (at Elephant), and we are really enthused with what is happening at Compare.com,” Admiral Group CEO Henry Engelhardt said Monday in an interview at Elephant headquarters.

Engelhardt plans to retire from Admiral in about two months, at which point he will hand the CEO reins to current chief operating officer David Stevens, one of the first employees he hired to work for the insurance company 24 years ago.

Admiral, based in Cardiff, Wales, sells insurance in several European nations. Elephant Insurance was founded in 2009 as Admiral’s first U.S. business. It sells insurance directly to customers by phone and over the Internet in Virginia, Texas, Illinois and Maryland.

Elephant has about 500 employees at its headquarters in the Deep Run I office building on Mayland Drive in western Henrico County, and the company is still hiring.
