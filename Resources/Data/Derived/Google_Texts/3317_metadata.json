He figured spies had eyes on him that very moment. He had no doubt they had been intercepting and inspecting his mail. Someone had been clumsy about removing the seals on his letters. Melting away wax marques by candle heat and then replicating and reapplying counterfeit seals was an art that required surgical attention to detail. It was a task that needed to be assigned to the steady hands of a master; whoever had been slicing into his correspondence was no master.\n\nLouis-\u200bFran\u00e7ois was an expert on such matters. That was why he rarely committed compromising words to ink. Instead, if he had to write such a note, he did so only by pinpricks. Furthermore, he took steps to ensure the recipient understood in advance to immediately destroy the correspondence after reading. Having noticed that his mail had been breached gave Louis-\u200bFran\u00e7ois a counterintelligence advantage: the opportunity to disseminate disinformation to throw them off his trail. He was quite good at that sort of thing, too.\n\nNo matter, he was confident they had no idea of his exact plans. Despite what some at Versailles thought of him, the prince was not so full of himself to believe he was infallible. The prudent course of action was to move under the cover of night and to not underestimate his adversaries. And so he considered the possibility of operatives lurking nearby.\n\nEspionage was a game Louis-\u200bFran\u00e7ois played better than anyone. Really, it was his game. He was the French spymaster, by virtue of practice and by occupation. There would have been no Secret du Roi without him. He was the architect of that spy network of mid-\u200beighteenth-\u200bcentury France. He was the one who oversaw the Secret du Roi\u2019s recruiting and managing of the Crown\u2019s agents throughout Europe.\n\nThere weren\u2019t many, if any, tactics Louis-Fran\u00e7ois had not seen or employed. Now that he himself was the subject of intense surveillance it concerned him, of course, but it most certainly did not unnerve him. Part of him found the irony of it, the personal challenge\u2014 and indeed he viewed it as a personal challenge\u2014rather delicious. He carried on just as he would have advised his own agents to do: cautiously, but with typical Parisian, aristocratic composure, as if nothing at all were out of the norm.\n\nWhich was not the case. Moments that set in motion seismic historical events, that compel men to take up arms and kill, that change the balance of world power, that overthrow kings\u2014 this, he thought, was one of those. He had to believe that. Or else, what point was there in all of the risk.\n\nIt was August, the month of his forty-\u200bfirst birthday, and Monsieur Louis-\u200bFran\u00e7ois de Bourbon, the Prince de Conti\u2014 a royal-\u200bblood cousin of King Louis XV, and also His Majesty\u2019s de facto chief of staff\u2014 climbed into a carriage bound for a clandestine rendezvous that by definition of the king\u2019s law constituted conspiracy to commit the highest treason.\n\n~\n\nMore than anyone else it was the Prince de Conti who had the ear of King Louis XV. Their relationship was a subject of great interest within the corrupt and catty royal court. The nobles and their servants whispered about it, and noted it in their memoirs and correspondence thusly: \u201cPeople are always astonished by the intervention of the Prince de Conti in affairs of the state.\u201d His \u201cintimacy\u201d with the king, his access to His Majesty, and influence upon him are \u201cquite remarkable.\u201d The Prince de Conti, alone, would daily enter the king\u2019s private study \u201cby the backdoor carrying great portfolios.\u201d Often not emerging until hours later.\n\nThere was no doubt the two men talked strategy for France\u2019s foreign affairs, which were rapidly escalating into military conflicts. France\u2019s claims in North America were being challenged. The previous spring, in 1754, over in America, a local British militia under the control of a Lieutenant Colonel George Washington had ambushed a contingent of French forces.\n\nIt was one in a steady stream of ongoing guerrilla battles between the two countries in that foreign land. This one, though, occurred in the critical Ohio Territory and became a spark for what was now, more than a year later, all-\u200bout war. This \u201cFrench-\u200bIndian\u201d battle exacerbated tensions between the two powers, already fighting over shipping routes; it contributed to their taking opposing sides in a war between Prussia and Austria, in which Russia and Spain were also invested. All of it one big, bloody international mess that was turning into a Seven Years War.\n\nA testament to the truly top-\u200bsecret nature of the meetings between the prince and the king, no one at the court had any gossip about the specific discussions of their meetings. Due to the mystery shrouding their sessions, as one member of the royal court wrote, \u201cpeople had difficulty understanding what can be the nature of their work.\u201d That is not to say that Conti was someone who otherwise kept a low profile.\n\nHe distinguished himself as a character among characters. A pre revolutionary James Bond. The prince left such an impression on Madame de Genlis, a noted contemporary writer and noblewoman from Burgundy, that she mused on him in her diary:\n\n\u201cThe Monsieur le Prince de Conti was the only prince of the blood who had a taste for the sciences and for literature, and who knew how to speak well in public. He was strikingly handsome, with an imposing figure and manners. No one was able to pay a compliment with more finesse and graciousness and, despite his success with women, it was impossible to discern in him the slightest nuance of fatuity. He was the most magnificent of our princes.\u201d\n\nBorn on August 13, 1717, into a family with Burgundian roots, and one of the most noble of France\u2019s families, Louis-\u200bFran\u00e7ois studied philosophy and the arts, having a particular fondness for Mozart. Most notably, perhaps, he was a lover of love, and, as was common for the noblemen of the times, more often than not with women other than his wife. Louis-\u200bFran\u00e7ois had been fourteen years old when he wed his cousin, the fifteen-\u200byear-\u200bold Louise-\u200bDiane d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, the youngest daughter of the duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, Philippe II.\n\nLouis-\u200bFran\u00e7ois had married into quite a family. When King Louis XIV died in 1715, he had already buried his son and the grandson who would have been next in line for the throne. The monarchy, then, had to wait for his great-\u200bgrandson, Louis XV, who was only five years old at the time of his grandfather\u2019s death. Until Louis XV was old enough to wear the responsibilities that came with the crown, the duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, Philippe II, served as the Regent of the Kingdom. The union of his daughter, Diane, and Louis-\u200bFran\u00e7ois was celebrated in grand fashion at Versailles and, of course, had been arranged for purposes of bloodline politics. The marriage did nothing to discourage the teenage Louis-\u200bFran\u00e7ois from promptly beginning an affair with a mistress inherited from his uncle. (Louis-\u200bFran\u00e7ois\u2019s uncle was moving on to a Parisian dancer.)\n\nThe Prince de Conti was the type of renaissance man who continued to engage in picaresque, libidinous adventures, relishing every opportunity to insert himself into affairs of all sorts. Along with the women, there was the wine. At parties, whether at his cousin-\u200bking\u2019s palace of Versailles, or at one of his own residences\u2014the Palais du Temple, where he had a rank among the Knights Templar, or at his private residence, H\u00f4tel de Conti in Paris, or at his retreat at the L\u2019Isle-\u200bAdam, a couple of hours\u2019 carriage ride south of the city\u2014no soir\u00e9e was complete without the prince filling a beautiful woman\u2019s ear with charm and her glass with exquisite wine.\n\nNot long after the covert business of that summer in 1755, the \u201cinviolable secret,\u201d as Conti himself had begun referring to it, would reach its stunning, almost inexplicable d\u00e9nouement: The prince would commission a painter to memorialize one of his own dinner parties.\n\nIn the scene that Michel-\u200bBarth\u00e9lemy Ollivier would paint, a dozen white-\u200bwigged nobles sit around a long table, amid the warm glow of candlelight. In a nearby corner, a harpist strums. In the room so vividly alive with the buzz of intimate conversation and cascading string music, Conti looks into the eyes of a woman on his right, his mistress du jour, while his left hand seductively caresses the neck of a bottle of his private reserve, which was then known as La Roman\u00e9e.\n\nBy the time the prince would acquire the Burgundian vineyard its Pinot Noir would already have a reputation for being sensationally smooth, stunningly complex, the perfect balance of seductive and powerful\u2014much like Conti himself. However, legend would have it there were other reasons the prince would go to the great lengths he would to acquire the vineyard\u2014also involving surreptitious maneuvering. Reasons that were only now in his present secret matter beginning to take shape. Before there would be Burgundy, there would be Paris, and if the prince had his way, there would be revolution.\n\nThat Conti was so openly dashing yet so politically discreet was one of his many dichotomies. The image of the bespoke, silver-\u200btongued playboy belied the prince in full. He was a decorated war hero several times over, a murderer, a spy\u2014a double, maybe even a triple, agent. He was a fiercely intelligent operator, and generally speaking, an illusive chameleon.\n\nOne of the prince\u2019s fellow noblemen astutely sized him up as \u201ca composite of twenty or thirty men. He is proud, he is affable, ambitious and a philosopher, at the same time; rebel, gourmand, lazy, noble, debauched, the idol and example of good company, not liking bad company except by a spirit of libertinage, but caught up in much self-\u200blove.\u201d Considering the prince\u2019s shrewdness, he may have sustained such a colorful and charismatic dandy-\u200bman persona to distract from his covert and most grave sleights of hand. A misdirection by fa\u00e7ade. By that August of 1755, Conti was someone whom his cousin-\u200bking and Louis XV\u2019s omnipotent mistress, the Madame de Pompadour, had come to fear and mistrust. The king and Pompadour, Conti had no doubt, were the ones who had ordered the postmaster to intercept his mail. They had put him under the surveillance of the French police.\n\nThe mission was overseen by Lieutenant Nicholas-\u200bRen\u00e9 Berryer and a contract agent, Soulier de Puechmaille, aka Lagarde. Lagarde had been recommended for the task by none other than the archbishop of Avignon. The Crown, the church, just about everyone benefiting from the monarchy\u2019s stranglehold on the people, considered Conti a threat to all that was royal and holy. Their suspicions were warranted.\n\nThat night, as the prince made his way to his clandestine meeting, if one of the spies would have found a way to casually emerge from the shadows and inquire the prince about his destination, Conti might have offered an explanation that he was en route to conduct official business of the king, a mission for the good of France. For it was exactly the sort of politically deft response for which Conti had such a gift: a shred of fact that provided just enough cover for the whole treasonous truth.\n\n~\n\nRattling over the cobblestones, navigating Paris\u2019s narrow rues, the carriage almost could not avoid jolting to starts and jerking to stops, twisting with expected unpredictability into the abrupt turns of the capital city. It would have been prudent of Conti to instruct his driver to make a few unnecessary turns along the way to make the route all the more circuitous and harder to follow. During the day, the urban labyrinth teemed with the activity; a mosh pit of nobles and peasants, where it was difficult to discern vice from virtue. In the words of a writer of the time, the city was \u201ca rapid and noisy whirlwind.\u201d\n\nWith a population approaching 25 million, France was three times the size of its mighty and increasingly nervous neighbor England. Nobles and clergymen together\u2014the First and Second Estates\u2014formed the 2 percent of the population that controlled most of the country\u2019s wealth. The poorest of everyone else, the Third Estate, labored to buy the bread they could already barely afford. Peasants had petitioned their aristocratic landowners to invest in agricultural improvements or, at least, to tax them less so that they themselves could modernize and more efficiently harvest grains and wheat, thus producing more bread and making it more affordable. Such requests had been met with indifference.\n\nWith the Catholic Church\u2019s blessing, nobles openly scoffed at labor as something only bourgeoisie did, in order to earn the taxes aristocrats could \u201cinvest\u201d in the church and their own leisurely pursuits: patronizing the arts, which were often odes to themselves or packed with messages to reinforce the necessity of classism; and building their grand palaces, like Versailles, where the Prince de Conti himself kept an apartment; and throwing decadent parties. In the tradition of the late King Louis XIV, every nobleman worth his unearned livres peacocked on the dance floor. Small fortunes were spent trying to outdo the Italians in the latest fashions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How the world's greatest bottle of wine was swept up in the plot to overthrow the French monarchy", "author": "Maximillian Potter", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "How the world's greatest bottle of wine was swept up in the plot to overthrow the French monarchy", "title": "Make wine and kill the king: The legendary vineyard at the heart of a grand European conspiracy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/26/make_wine_and_kill_the_king_the_legendary_vineyard_at_the_heart_of_a_grand_european_conspiracy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/louis_xv.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How the world's greatest bottle of wine was swept up in the plot to overthrow the French monarchy", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/louis_xv.jpg", "title": "Make wine and kill the king: The legendary vineyard at the heart of a grand European conspiracy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Make wine and kill the king: The legendary vineyard at the heart of a grand European conspiracy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, European History, France, French history, History, Louis XV, The Bourbon dynasty, Wine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95e6\"", "article_summary": "In the tradition of the late King Louis XIV, every nobleman worth his unearned livres peacocked on the dance floor.\n~More than anyone else it was the Prince de Conti who had the ear of King Louis XV.\nWhen King Louis XIV died in 1715, he had already buried his son and the grandson who would have been next in line for the throne.\nThe monarchy, then, had to wait for his great-\u200bgrandson, Louis XV, who was only five years old at the time of his grandfather\u2019s death.\nUntil Louis XV was old enough to wear the responsibilities that came with the crown, the duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, Philippe II, served as the Regent of the Kingdom."}
