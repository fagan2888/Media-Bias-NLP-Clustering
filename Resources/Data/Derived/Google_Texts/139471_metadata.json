That\u2019s when our day came to a screeching and very disappointing end with a 43rd-place finish.\n\nI went to bed last night thinking this was my best shot ever to win the Daytona 500. The car was just so good and we were just riding around biding our time, being patient and trying to get to the end of this thing. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t meant to be.\n\nIt looks like something knocked the oil pump belt off. Not sure if it was debris off the race track or what. You typically get about two seconds to shut the engine off once that belt comes off or it will blow up. We just didn\u2019t get enough warning.\n\nWithout having a camera under the hood you really don\u2019t know what caused the belt to come off. I mean, you can speculate. We don\u2019t have the belt so it\u2019s hard to tell if it broke in half, if something hit it or what happened. I will leave that to the engine guys. I don\u2019t want to speculate. I just know the belt is not on there and it should be.\n\nThe Furniture Row guys built us a great race car. I really felt like the car was super strong. Anytime we could get two or three cars lined up with us we could pass guys on the bottom pretty well. That is difficult to do here. I felt great about the car and just a shame we didn\u2019t get to hang around all day and show what we could do.\n\nWe\u2019re off to Nashville to conduct a test session on Monday and we\u2019ll be ready to go again next Sunday at the 1-mile Phoenix International Raceway.\n\nFurniture Row Racing\u2019s Martin Truex Jr., driver of Denver\u2019s No. 78 car, is keeping a daily diary for The Denver Post through the Daytona 500.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Roller coaster crashes for Martin Truex Jr. after Daytona 500 engine blows up", "title": "Roller coaster crashes for Martin Truex Jr. after Daytona 500 engine blows up", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/23/roller-coaster-crashes-for-martin-truex-jr-after-daytona-500-engine-blows-up/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140223__martin-truex-daytona-enginep1.jpg", "height": 355}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140223__martin-truex-daytona-enginep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-23T15:22:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:31:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I went to bed last night thinking this was my best shot ever to win the Daytona 500.\n78 car, is keeping a daily diary for The Denver Post through the Daytona 500.\nDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. \u2014 For our Furniture Row Racing team, I don\u2019t know what else to call Daytona Speedweeks but a big-time roller coaster ride.\nI will leave that to the engine guys.\nWithout having a camera under the hood you really don\u2019t know what caused the belt to come off."}
