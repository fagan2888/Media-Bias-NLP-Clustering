To find out what issues and candidates are motivating this influential demographic in Nevada, Reno Public Radio\u2019s Julia Ritchey sat down with two friends: Hawah Ahmad, president of the Young Democrats of Nevada, and Miranda Hoover, president of the College Republicans, here at the university.\n\nBelow are excerpts of their conversation.\n\nListen to the story.\n\nQ: What\u2019s the energy level right now ahead of the caucus? Do college students care about this election?\n\nHoover: Yes, the way that I\u2019ve seen it, we\u2019ve had a lot of foot traffic. We try to table every Monday and every Tuesday for a couple hours trying to get interest not only for the College Republicans but also making sure that people understand there\u2019s a lot of Republican candidates. \u2026Every single one of our caucus trainings \u2026 they are all full.\n\nAhmad: \u2026So right now you have his weird break where people who aren\u2019t normally involved in politics *are*. So right now we\u2019re just trying to harness that so that after the caucus we can still have an environment like that, to encourage young people to not only participate but to also step up and want to run.\n\nQ: Do you think the surge of young people supporting Bernie Sanders is responsible for that?\n\nAhmad: I do think it\u2019s because of the Sanders craze \u2014 I like to call it the Sanders phenomenon \u2014 because you have so many people participating that would never normally participate. However, on the other side, too, you have Clinton. \u2026.She still does have a base that\u2019s quite large of young people. It\u2019s not necessary talked about and we aren\u2019t really going to see its effects until the caucus day and we look at the numbers for people under the age of 36. \u2026When it comes down to it, it\u2019s because people are more passionate about the issues. \u2026And it\u2019s both sides really motivating young people to kind of start talking about the issues and reach across the aisle to talk to one another.\n\nHoover: You know, people can say whatever they want about Donald Trump, but my only thing with him is that he\u2019s actually getting the young people really interested. I think he\u2019s like our Bernie Sanders on this side. He\u2019s getting the college students and millennials as a whole really interested and involved and excited about what\u2019s going on.\n\nQ: After the caucus, what do you hope the takeaway is about millennials as a political demographic?\n\nHoover: So Hawah and I participated in a millennials and health care event last week, which I thought was really fun. \u2026Millennials really do care about health care and, myself, as a medical public health major, health care is really important to me and trying to figure out the money situation and the access situation. \u2026.I see that a lot of people are really interested in health care with the Affordable Care Act and the Silver State Exchange, which directly affects our state, and millennials are going to have to decide what they support.\n\nAhmad: With the millennials, for the most part, they\u2019re going to start looking at policy more. \u2026I\u2019m really hoping they\u2019re going to be really involved and really excited to look policies.\n\nHoover: We\u2019re there to provide the venue for them so that we can continue that active discussion. If the College Republicans and Young Democrats can work together \u2014 and Hawah and I work together all the time. Very civil all the time. I consider [her] one of my friends. I think it\u2019s important for students to see that. That people from all different political parties can work together.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics and Policy", "description": "Millennials are reshaping everything from health care to the workplace to our political system.
