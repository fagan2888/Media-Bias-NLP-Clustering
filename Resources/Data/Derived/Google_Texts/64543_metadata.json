We finished. We made the right plays down the stretch,\u201d Iowa State coach Steve Prohm said.\n\nThe Cyclones faltered late in recent losses to West Virginia and Texas Tech. But Morris\u2019 step-back jumper with 1:17 left made it 81-74, and Niang\u2019s layup 35 seconds later sealed the win.\n\n\u201cI just feel like the last couple of games, we really didn\u2019t have the will to win,\u201d Niang said. \u201cWe used that motivation. \u2026 We really wanted this win, and when you want it that bad you\u2019re going to pull it out.\u201d\n\nJavan Felix had 13 of his 18 points in the second half to lead Texas (16-9, 7-5), which has dropped two straight.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t defend well enough,\u201d coach Shaka Smart said. \u201cThey have a way of making you look bad on defense.\u201d\n\nMcKay, who had been suspended for violating team rules, finished with eight points, seven rebounds and four blocks - including one with less than 2 minutes left to set up Morris\u2019 key jumper.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be special without him,\u201d Prohm said of McKay.\n\nA 6-2 stretch through the Big 12 - with losses at No. 6 Kansas and No. 3 Oklahoma - put Texas in position to contend for the Big 12 crown.\n\nIowa State, on the other hand, had dropped three of its previous four to effectively fall out of the race.\n\nBut the Longhorns are now also down two games to West Virginia and Kansas with six to play - and Tuesday\u2019s home game against the Mountaineers looms as a must-win for their conference title hopes.\n\nIowa State appeared to be on the verge of pulling away at multiple points early in the second half, most notably when McKay\u2019s alley-oop dunk made it 52-44. But two crucial 3s by Tevin Mack kept the Longhorns close, and Prince Ibeh\u2019s dunk tied it at 56.\n\nMcKay\u2019s second alley-oop of the night gave the Cyclones a 73-67 lead with just more than 5 minutes left.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "A big night from stars Georges Niang and Monte Morris - and a big lift from Jameel McKay off the bench - helped Iowa State get back on track.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A big night from stars Georges Niang and Monte Morris - and a big lift from Jameel McKay off the bench - helped Iowa State get back on track.", "title": "No. 14 Iowa State beats No. 24 Texas 85-75", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/13/no-14-iowa-state-beats-no-24-texas-85-75/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/06/texas_iowa_st_basketball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/06/texas_iowa_st_basketball.jpeg", "description": "A big night from stars Georges Niang and Monte Morris - and a big lift from Jameel McKay off the bench - helped Iowa State get back on track.", "card": "summary", "title": "No. 14 Iowa State beats No. 24 Texas 85-75"}, "Author": "LUKE MEREDITH", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Iowa State, on the other hand, had dropped three of its previous four to effectively fall out of the race.\nWe made the right plays down the stretch,\u201d Iowa State coach Steve Prohm said.\nAMES, Iowa (AP) - A big night from stars Georges Niang and Monte Morris - and a big lift from Jameel McKay off the bench - helped Iowa State get back on track.\n14 Cyclones beat 24th-ranked Texas 85-75 on Saturday in McKay\u2019s return from a two-game suspension.\nMatt Thomas added 13 for Iowa State (18-7, 7-5 Big 12), which shot 67 percent in the second half and allowed just one point in the final 2:29 to hold off the Longhorns."}
