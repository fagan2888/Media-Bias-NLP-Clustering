Fox, actor and Parkinson\u2019s activist, speaks to Anne Wojcicki, chief executive officer of 23andMe Inc.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has ordered 23andMe Inc., a DNA-analysis company backed by Google Inc., to \u201cimmediately discontinue\u201d marketing its over-the-counter genetic-testing kits or face penalties.\n\nIn an unusually stern letter to the Silicon Valley company\u2019s founder, Anne Wojcicki, dated Friday, the FDA warns her to halt sales of the test because the risk of false positives \u201ccould lead a patient to undergo prophylactic surgery, chemoprevention, intensive screening, or other morbidity-inducing actions,\u201d it says, \u201cwhile a false negative could result in a failure to recognize an actual risk that may exist.\u201d\n\nThe FDA expresses frustration with the company, charging, \u201cmonths after you submitted your 510(k)s and more than five years after you began marketing, you still had not completed some of the studies and had not even started other studies necessary to support a marketing submission for the PGS. It is now nine months later, and you have yet to provide FDA with any new information about these tests.\u201d\n\nGoogle /quotes/zigman/93888/delayed /quotes/nls/goog GOOG and Johnson & Johnson Inc. /quotes/zigman/230812/delayed /quotes/nls/jnj JNJ are among 23andMe\u2019s investors. Customers can order a DNA test online for $99, send the company saliva samples, and then receive information about health and ancestry.\n\n23andMe acknowledged the letter in a statement to the press: \u201cOur relationship with the FDA is extremely important to us and we are committed to fully engaging with them to address their concerns.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, the FDA reached out to five companies, 23andMe Inc., deCODE Genetics, Illumina, Navigenics and Knome Inc., warning that the agency requires more regulatory approval before genetic tests can be sold to consumers. 23andMe is the only one being ordered to stop selling its test.\n\nAnne Wojcicki is married to Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google. AllThingsD reported in August that couple are not living together.\n\n\u2014Follow Michelle on Twitter: @m_cof", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-11-25T13:44:16-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "FDA orders 23andMe Inc., a DNA-analysis company backed by Google, to \u201cimmediately discontinue\u201d marketing its over-the-counter genetic-testing kits or face penalties.", "title": "FDA orders Google-backed 23andMe to stop selling $99 DNA test", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/11/25/fda-orders-google-backed-23andme-to-stop-selling-99-dna-test/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Michelle Coffey", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "23andMe,DNA,FDA,Google", "article.headline": "FDA orders Google-backed 23andMe to stop selling $99 DNA test", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "23andMe,DNA,FDA,Google", "author": "Michelle Coffey", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "FDA orders 23andMe Inc., a DNA-analysis company backed by Google, to \u201cimmediately discontinue\u201d marketing its over-the-counter genetic-testing kits or face penalties.", "article.published": "2013-11-25T13:44:16-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/11/25/fda-orders-google-backed-23andme-to-stop-selling-99-dna-test/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "FDA orders 23andMe Inc., a DNA-analysis company backed by Google, to \u201cimmediately discontinue\u201d marketing its over-the-counter genetic-testing kits or face penalties.", "title": "FDA orders Google-backed 23andMe to stop selling $99 DNA test", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/11/25/fda-orders-google-backed-23andme-to-stop-selling-99-dna-test/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1621", "article.updated": "2013-11-25T17:08:39-05:00"}, "article_summary": "23andMe is the only one being ordered to stop selling its test.\nCustomers can order a DNA test online for $99, send the company saliva samples, and then receive information about health and ancestry.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has ordered 23andMe Inc., a DNA-analysis company backed by Google Inc., to \u201cimmediately discontinue\u201d marketing its over-the-counter genetic-testing kits or face penalties.\nFox, actor and Parkinson\u2019s activist, speaks to Anne Wojcicki, chief executive officer of 23andMe Inc.\nAllThingsD reported in August that couple are not living together."}
