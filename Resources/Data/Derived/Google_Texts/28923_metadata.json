He coached the New York Jets and Dallas Cowboys, too, before retiring in 2006 \u2014 although he worked in the Dolphins\u2019 front office for several seasons after that.\n\nParcells was joined at the ceremony by the other five living members of the Hall of Fame who played for the Giants: Y.A. Tittle, Frank Gifford, Sam Huff, Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson.\n\n\u201cThank you for bringing championship football back to the New York Giants,\u201d Carson said before Parcells was given his ring.\n\nLeaving the field after the ceremony, Parcells stopped to hug Giants tight ends coach Mike Pope and current head coach Tom Coughlin. Pope was a member of Parcells\u2019 staff for the Super Bowl wins in 1987 and 1991, while Coughlin was a receivers coach on the second one.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bill Parcells receives his Pro Football Hall of Fame ring", "title": "Bill Parcells receives his Pro Football Hall of Fame ring", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/15/bill-parcells-receives-his-pro-football-hall-of-fame-ring/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130916__hof-ringp1.jpg", "height": 415}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130916__hof-ringp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-15T21:25:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T09:12:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8cd8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThank you for bringing championship football back to the New York Giants,\u201d Carson said before Parcells was given his ring.\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Surrounded by five Giants greats, Bill Parcells was given his Pro Football Hall of Fame ring at halftime of Sunday\u2019s game between the Broncos and New York.\nParcells was joined at the ceremony by the other five living members of the Hall of Fame who played for the Giants: Y.A.\nLeaving the field after the ceremony, Parcells stopped to hug Giants tight ends coach Mike Pope and current head coach Tom Coughlin.\nParcells led the Giants to the 1986 and 1990 NFL championships, the first over the Broncos in the Super Bowl."}
