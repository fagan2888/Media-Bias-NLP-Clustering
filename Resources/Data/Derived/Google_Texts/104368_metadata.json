However, the numbers make them look almost identical.\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nWhy Congress is looking at labels to curb food waste\n\nSmoke detected on EgyptAir Flight 804: What does that mean?\n\nThe HealthCare.gov website, where people can buy health insurance, is displayed on a laptop screen in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2015.\n\nIn the face of widespread criticism of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s excise tax on high-cost employer sponsored health insurance plans (the Cadillac Tax), some lawmakers have backed an alternative: a cap on the current tax exclusion for employer contributions to health insurance.\n\nTo learn how the two ideas would differ, my colleagues at the Tax Policy Center and the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Policy Center modeled both to see how they\u2019d affect taxpayers of different incomes. Their conclusion: The effects are almost identical. The cap would be a modest improvement because its distributional effects are more certain. But the differences are quite small.\n\nThe Cadillac tax is due to take effect in 2018. TPC and HPC found that in 2020, neither version would raise taxes for many workers. About 12 percent of all households would pay higher taxes, averaging about $780. That\u2019s roughly a 0.1 percent cut in their after-tax income. The analysis assumes that most employers would avoid the Cadillac tax by reducing the value of their insurance to below the legal threshold.\n\nRecommended: Can you match the CEO with the company? Take the quiz!\n\nThe two taxes have the same goals\u2014to help contain health costs in a relatively progressive way and to raise revenue. For many years, a cap on the exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance seemed the policy model of choice. When lawmakers pushed back against that idea in the debate over the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Congress settled on the Cadillac Tax, a 40 percent excise tax on high-cost insurance policies.\n\nHowever, political appearances aside, the TPC- HPC analysis suggests there is little difference between the two ideas.\n\nThis article first appeared at TaxVox.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "7c96e35ce5be2016798ab7f8e1cf6eea", "sailthru.author": "Howard Gleckman", "description": "Some opponents of the Cadillac Tax are promoting an alternative cap on the current tax exclusion for employer contributions to health insurance.
