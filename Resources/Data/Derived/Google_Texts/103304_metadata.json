I just wish he were running on the Democratic ticket.\n\nJeb Bush, a likely Republican presidential candidate, called for \"respect\" of same-sex marriages on Monday as his home state of Florida began allowing gays to wed following a court ruling. Bush, a former governor of Florida, said in a statement that even those like him who oppose same-sex marriage must \"respect the rule of law\" now that the state's ban on gay marriages has been ruled unconstitutional.\n\nDo you know what else is the law of the land? ObamaCare.\n\nSo I assume Jeb will ask us to respect the rule of law on that too,\n\nWhen a gay marriage was against the rule of law, did the other side respect it?\n\nNo, they simply pushed and pushed using every dirty trick and then made it the law... by violating the law.\n\nThis is the larger problem, not just with Jeb Bush, but with too many establishment Republicans who view their job as the management of the status quo. That management is what conservatism is opposed to.\n\nIt's what Republican voters are opposed to. It's why Boehner is on the hot seat now.\n\nManaging the status quo imposed by the radical left is a front row seat to the apocalypse. It turns Republicans into the managers of the far left. It makes them into the agents of the crazy rock star who has to take his client's plan to burn down a hotel and try to make it work.\n\nWe don't need to respect a rule of law imposed by the radical left. The only laws we ought to respect are those of the Constitution, not of activist judges.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Do you know what else is the law of the land?
