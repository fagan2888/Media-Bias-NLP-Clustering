Rather, it said that Warren \"looks forward to reviewing the reauthorization\" of the bank because it \"helps create American jobs and spur economic growth.\"\n\nEarlier this month, she ended up voting against the bank not because she had a change of heart about its value. Rather, its funding until 2015 was attached to Senate legislation to help arm moderate Syrian rebel, which she didn\u2019t support. (Ironically, some opponents of corporate welfare, such Republican Sen. Marco Rubio ended up voting to keep the bank alive because they supported the broader bill.)\n\nBe that as it may, Warren must know that the bank does not live up to her rosy claims. In fact, it is the very essence of what she despises: crony capitalism or what she condemns as socialism \"for rich people.\"\n\nCreated by FDR in 1934 with the baffling goal of financing trade with the Soviet Union, the bank, among other things, offers loans on sweet terms to foreign companies, even government owned ones, so that they can purchase American goods and create American jobs. For example, the bank extended financing to the Dubai-based Emirates Air to buy Boeing planes, never mind that the company already has access to limitless cash given that it is owned by the oil-rich United Arab Emirates. This in fact puts American airlines that have to purchase their planes on normal market terms at a competitive disadvantage, prompting Delta Airlines and Air Line Pilots Association to sue the bank.\n\nIn principle, the bank is supposed to help all exporters\u2014big and small\u2014equally. In practice, over 75 percent of its activities have supported a handful of large corporations. In 2013, as in previous years, Boeing got 30 percent\u2014or $8.3 billion\u2014of its total financial assistance\u2014earning the bank the nickname of \"Boeing's Bank.\"\n\nWarren is certainly aware of this record because she gently queried Ex-Im President Fred Hochberg about it during recent reauthorization hearings. But in contrast to the legendary whipping she gave former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner for bailing out too-big-to-fail Wall Street banks while letting smaller ones perish, she amiably accepted Hochberg's assurance that the bank would redouble its efforts to help small businesses going forward. Apparently, 80 years is not enough time.\n\nBut if the bank's record in helping small businesses is pathetic, its job creation record is downright abysmal. The bank claims that last year its $27.3 billion activities helped sustain 205,000 export-related American jobs. This calculation is based on a dubious methodology that has been questioned by the Government Accountability Office. But even if one accepts it, Veronique de Rugy of George Mason University's Mercatus Center notes, this works out to $131,200 in taxpayer exposure for every job sustained.\n\nIf the country must take on debt, wouldn't it behoove Warren, the self-proclaimed progressive champion of ordinary Americans to do so, say, to finance middle-class tax cuts rather than corporate boondoggles?\n\nWhy is Warren so sweet on the bank? It's not like Massachusetts companies receive disproportionate export aid. It's because, as former Democratic Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank told the Huffington Post, Democrats have made a tactical decision to close ranks and dump their previous opposition to Ex-Im because they want to wrest Corporate America\u2014and presumably its campaign contributions\u2014from the GOP.\n\nIn other words, it appears the woman who went to Washington to vanquish the corporate powers-that-be has become a classic Washington insider serving those powers for their money. With a direct vote on the matter delayed until next year, she has time to reconsider, but don\u2019t stand on one foot.\n\nA version of this column appeared in USA Today.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "She is supporting the Ex-Im Bank for the worst reason possible.", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Sells Out to Her Corporate Masters", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/10/02/elizabeth-warren-sells-out-to-her-corpor", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14122721103399871_fm.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14122721103399871_fm.jpg", "description": "Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of\nMassachusetts rode to Washington\u2014and progressive icon status\u2014by\n\npromising \"to work for the middle class and working families\nevery chance I get\" and, unlike Mitt Romney and other Republican\ncorporate lackeys,", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Sells Out to Her Corporate Masters"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2014-10-02T20:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/shikha-dalmia"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde9e\"", "article_summary": "Rather, it said that Warren \"looks forward to reviewing the reauthorization\" of the bank because it \"helps create American jobs and spur economic growth.\"\nThe bank claims that last year its $27.3 billion activities helped sustain 205,000 export-related American jobs.\nIt's not like Massachusetts companies receive disproportionate export aid.\nBe that as it may, Warren must know that the bank does not live up to her rosy claims.\nWarren is certainly aware of this record because she gently queried Ex-Im President Fred Hochberg about it during recent reauthorization hearings."}
