(Newser) â€“ The bad news is that a car driven by a man believed to have been drinking crashed into a barricade at the White House one night last week. The good news is that two Secret Service agents were the first on the scene. The predictable news, courtesy of the Washington Post, is that those two same agents were the ones in the car. It seems they'd been out at a party for a retiring colleague, and the car went through some security tape and into the barricade upon their return. A supervisor let the men go without charges or an investigation, and now the Homeland Security Department's inspector general will open an inquiry. One of the two is on President Obama's protective detail, says the Post.
