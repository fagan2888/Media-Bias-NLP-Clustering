(REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman)\n\n3942029\n\nA California company whose CEO has ties to President Barack Obama was granted nearly $1.3 million to provide health-care navigator services in California and Illinois, despite past allegations of misconduct.\n\nThe East Los Angeles Community Union, known as TELACU, was granted $980,000 from Covered California, the state\u2019s Obamacare health-care exchange. The company, which is a nonprofit organization with for-profit subsidiaries, was also awarded a $294,000 grant to provide navigator services for the state of Illinois, though the company has since declined that contract.\n\nDespite being awarded the grants, which requires navigators to inform the public about their health coverage options under Obamacare, the company has been accused of bribery and influence peddling.\n\nIn 2009, two San Bernadino city councilors accused the company of trying to sway their vote on a downtown housing project.\n\n\u201cWe were offered a bribe,\u201d said former San Bernadino Councilwoman Esther Estrada at the time.\n\n\n\nEstrada explained further in an interview with The Daily Caller News Foundation, saying that in 2009 a \u201chenchman\u201d for TELACU\u2019s CEO David Lizarraga approached her saying \u201cthat TELACU was ready to do whatever\u201d in exchange for her vote on the project.\n\n\u201cI suspect that if they did that with me then they did that with other people,\u201d said Estrada.\n\nAnother San Bernadino city official told TheDCNF that the TELACU\u2019s tactics on that 2009 vote \u201cunderhanded\u201d and \u201cdistasteful.\u201d Wendy McCammack, a city councilwoman who is also a mayoral candidate, said that a government affairs rep for TELACU offered her and other councilmembers \u201cwhatever you need\u201d in exchange for a yes vote on the project.\n\nDespite the bribery accusation, last year Obama appointed Lizarraga to a key position on the Community Development Advisory Board, which falls under the control of the U.S. Treasury Department. The board advises the director of the Community Development Institutions Fund on community development project decisions.\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, TELACU and TELACU Industries employees gave $55,750 to political campaigns in 2012, including $10,250 to Obama. According to FollowTheMoney.org, in 2006 company employees contributed $1,000 to Rod Blagojevich, the former Illinois governor who is in prison for corruption.\n\nAs one of the states that set up its own exchange, California was given nearly $37 million in federal money to help implement Obamacare. Nearly 50 organizations, including TELACU, will use that money to educate Californians about their health care options.\n\nThe 36 states that chose to take part in the federal marketplace were given $67 million by the Washington to provide navigator services. Over 100 organizations throughout the country will provide navigator services in those states which include Illinois.\n\nTELACU originally submitted applications for navigator grants for a total of six states on the federal or partnership exchanges. But the company was awarded only the Illinois and California grants, and decided to focus only on its work in California.\n\n\u201cSince this is not what we proposed, and since providing services in Illinois was only a portion of our overall strategy, we declined the Navigators grant,\u201d said Michael Lizarraga, the CEO of TELACU\u2019s industrial segment, in a statement to TheDCNF.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "A California company with to President Obama was granted nearly $1.3 million to provide Obamacare navigator services in two states, despite misconduct.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A California company whose CEO has ties to President Barack Obama was granted nearly $1.3 million to provide health-care navigator services in California and Illinois, despite past allegations of misc", "title": "California Obamacare navigator has sordid past", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/12/obamacare-navigator-in-calif-illinois-has-controversial-past/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-31T202345Z_1_CBRE99U1KNP00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-MISSISSIPPI-e1384275275123.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'We were offered a bribe'", "title": "California Obamacare navigator has sordid past Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/12/obamacare-navigator-in-calif-illinois-has-controversial-past/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-31T202345Z_1_CBRE99U1KNP00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-MISSISSIPPI-e1384275275123.jpg"}, "creator": "@@ChuckRossDC", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-12 12:22:15", "sailthru.title": "California Obamacare navigator has sordid past", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "california,obamacare,chuck-ross", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "california,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "A California company whose CEO has ties to President Barack Obama was granted nearly $1.3 million to provide health-care navigator services in California and Illinois, despite past allegations of misc", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-31T202345Z_1_CBRE99U1KNP00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-MISSISSIPPI-e1384275275123.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bc7\"", "article_summary": "(REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman)3942029A California company whose CEO has ties to President Barack Obama was granted nearly $1.3 million to provide health-care navigator services in California and Illinois, despite past allegations of misconduct.\nThe East Los Angeles Community Union, known as TELACU, was granted $980,000 from Covered California, the state\u2019s Obamacare health-care exchange.\nThe 36 states that chose to take part in the federal marketplace were given $67 million by the Washington to provide navigator services.\nBut the company was awarded only the Illinois and California grants, and decided to focus only on its work in California.\nOver 100 organizations throughout the country will provide navigator services in those states which include Illinois."}
