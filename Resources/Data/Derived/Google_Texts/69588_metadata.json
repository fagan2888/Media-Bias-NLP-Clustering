The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary, commonly known as the JOLTS report, is one of the indicators on the \u201cdashboard\u201d of economic data that Yellen and other members of the Federal Open Market Committee use to make judgments about the health of the job market. The report for September found that Americans are quitting their jobs at the highest rate in six years \u2014 which is actually good news.\n\nThe JOLTS survey provides a more complete picture than the unemployment rate that is announced on the first Friday of every month. One of the ways JOLTS provides extra perspective is by tracking the reasons why people leave jobs. A key metric is the so-called \u201cquits\u201d rate, which measures the number of people voluntarily leaving a job. A higher quit rate is generally viewed as positive for the economy because it is assumed that workers are more likely to quit an existing job if they have already found a new job or are confident about being able to do so.\n\nRelated: How Major Cities Dragged Down the Economic Recovery\n\nThe rate of 2 million quits in September was the highest since 2008, though it remains below the average level the economy saw before the Great Recession.\n\nThe number \u201cwill be welcome news at the Fed,\u201d wrote Michael Feroli, an analyst with J.P. Morgan North America Economic Research. \u201cHigher quits is a sign of increased confidence in the health of the labor market, and has been signaled out by Yellen in the past as a variable that she would like to see increase. Overall, today's JOLTS report is consistent with a number of other indicators that suggest the cyclical state of the labor market is demonstrating fairly rapid improvement.\u201d\n\nOther economists sounded similarly upbeat. \u201cThe implications of today\u2019s JOLTS report are straightforward: The rise in quits and hires (and the still high number of job openings) corroborates the Fed\u2019s assessment that the healing of the labor market has extended over the past several months beyond the drop in the jobless claims and beyond the rise in payrolls,\u201d wrote Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist for UniCredit Research.\n\nRelated: Why America Voted Against Obama\u2019s Economy\n\nIn other respects, Thursday\u2019s JOLTS report wasn\u2019t quite as positive. While people being hired (5 million) and people leaving their jobs (4.8 million) were both up slightly, the number of job openings actually fell from the previous month, to 4.7 million from 4.9 million.\n\nPeople are still finding jobs at a slower rate than they did before the financial crisis and Great Recession. And, according to an analysis of the JOLTS data by the Economic Policy Institute, there is no major sector of the economy where the number of open jobs exceeds the number of unemployed workers.\n\nRelated: Tech Trade Deal with China Could Mean More U.S. Jobs\n\n\u201cThis demonstrates that the main problem in the labor market is a broad-based lack of demand for workers\u2014not, as is often claimed, available workers lacking the skills needed for the sectors with job openings,\u201d writes EPI senior economist Elise Gould.\n\nTo reach full recovery, \u201chiring needs to pick up,\u201d Gould said in a separate blog post. \u201cWhile it\u2019s been generally improving, the hires rate, has not yet come close to a full recovery\u2014it\u2019s well below its prerecession level.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Unemployment may be on the way down, but the most recent release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics snapshot of the jobs market showed little growth in the number of jobs available.", "title": "More Americans Are Quitting Their Jobs\u2026and That\u2019s Great News", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/13/More-Americans-Are-Quitting-Their-Jobs-and-s-Great-News", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01192012_Office_Theft_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/13/More-Americans-Are-Quitting-Their-Jobs-and-s-Great-News", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01192012_Office_Theft_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Unemployment may be on the way down, but the most recent release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics snapshot of the jobs market showed little growth in the number of jobs available.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd891\"", "article_summary": "The report for September found that Americans are quitting their jobs at the highest rate in six years \u2014 which is actually good news.\nRelated: Why America Voted Against Obama\u2019s EconomyIn other respects, Thursday\u2019s JOLTS report wasn\u2019t quite as positive.\nA key metric is the so-called \u201cquits\u201d rate, which measures the number of people voluntarily leaving a job.\nPeople are still finding jobs at a slower rate than they did before the financial crisis and Great Recession.\nOverall, today's JOLTS report is consistent with a number of other indicators that suggest the cyclical state of the labor market is demonstrating fairly rapid improvement.\u201dOther economists sounded similarly upbeat."}
