A 29-year-old testicular cancer patient is in the fight of his life

A 29-year-old testicular cancer patient is in the fight of his life. Now, he’s sharing his experience, because he hopes it will lead other young men to screen themselves, or get screened for testicular cancer.

Tanner Hill is a 2005 Tuttle High School graduate and an OU student. He says he began experiencing pain in his right testicle two summers ago, but because of concerns about his job he put off getting it checked out. By the time he went to a specialist, his right testicle had grown to the size of a baseball.

Doctors removed Tanner’s right testicle a year ago, and last month he underwent brain surgery because the cancer had spread.

Friday, he finished the last of ten chemotherapy and high-dose radiation treatments at Integris Cancer Institute.

“Once you’ve accepted death, and it doesn’t happen, you kind of let things go, and it puts things in perspective. You realize life is fleeting,” said Tanner.

He’s not giving up his fight. His doctors say advances in medicine give him a much better chance at a longer life.
