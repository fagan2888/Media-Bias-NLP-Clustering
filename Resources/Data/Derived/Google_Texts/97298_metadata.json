Which were summarily withdrawn or buried, to howls of frustration from the GOP\u2019s right flank.\n\n\u201cWhen it came to protecting one of the reasons this nation was formed, [GOP leaders] caved to pressure from corporate lobbyists and the left,\u201d a fuming Julianne Thompson of Atlanta Tea Party Patriots said at the time. She pointed specifically to the \u201cHobby Lobby\u201d portion of the Affordable Care Act that requires employers to include coverage for contraception in health insurance packages.\n\nThompson vowed that the \u201creligious liberty\u201d movement would return next year. And Georgia business leaders apparently believed her.\n\nThe biggest secret of this election season has been the sudden formation of a statewide, independent campaign to oust some of the most extreme \u2013 participants would say anti-business \u2013 members of the Legislature. And lend support to those viewed as more friendly. Financial data has only become available in the last few days.\n\nFormed shortly after the Legislature adjourned in March, and still barely a month old, the Georgia Coalition for Job Creation has already raised north of $350,000.\n\nMassive checks have been written: Nearly $100,000 from Georgia Chamber of Commerce entities, $50,000 each from Coca Cola, Delta, Georgia Power, AT&T, and $25,000 from Newell Rubbermaid, Home Depot and SunTrust.\n\nLeery of being pegged as agenda-driven, the leaders of two groups behind the effort would respond only with heavily circumspect, emailed statements.\n\n\u201c[W]e cannot afford to sit on the sidelines. It is our responsibility to engage and to support those individuals who will make a positive impact on our economy,\u201d said Chris Clark, president and CEO of the Georgia Chamber.\n\n\u201cOur leaders are very focused on the economic future of this state. They understand the importance of nominating leaders in both parties\u2019 primaries who are committed to creating jobs and, more importantly, know how to get it done,\u201d wrote Hala Moddelmog, president and CEO of the Metro Atlanta Chamber.\n\nBoth referred the curious to Scott Paradise, a Marietta political strategist in charge of coalition logistics. \u201cWe had no litmus test to determine our support, nor was there any single issue that encouraged us to support or oppose a candidate,\u201d Paradise said. Also via email.\n\nOne lobbyist involved in the creation of the committee, speaking in private, was more blunt. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let liberty Republicans throw business out of the Republican party,\u201d the lobbyist said.\n\nThe coalition is playing in a dozen or so races, including some Democratic ones. At least three House Republican incumbents have been targeted for elimination: state Rep. Charles Gregory of Kennesaw; Sam Moore of Ball Ground; and Jason Spencer of Woodbine. All three have opposition with whom, according to the rules, the business coalition can\u2019t coordinate.\n\nIn his first term, Gregory has introduced some of the most aggressive gun rights legislation seen in the General Assembly. \u201cIt\u2019s big business trying to buy government,\u201d said the Kennesaw lawmaker. \u201cThey\u2019re propping up their business interests over everybody else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nMoore took office mid-session this year, and was almost immediately slapped down for introducing a bill that would have banned anti-loitering laws and ended restrictions that keep child molesters away from schools and playgrounds.\n\nSpencer was the author of HB 707, a bill that originally would have barred the state insurance commissioner from enforcing Obamacare. For instance, the ban on using pre-existing conditions to refuse coverage.\n\nThe bill passed, but only after being stripped of most of its teeth.\n\nThe coalition is also coming to the defense of some incumbents, including Brooks Coleman of Duluth, chairman of the House Education Committee \u2013 which this year killed a bill that would have required the state school system to withdraw from Common Core, the voluntary standards system that many Republicans condemn as an attempt to federalize education.\n\nThe Georgia Chamber is very much behind Common Core.\n\nThe coalition is choosing its targets carefully. Perhaps recognizing that primary runoffs will require a great deal of cash as well. Or the group may be following that ancient Chinese tactic: \u201cKill a chicken to scare the monkeys.\u201d Translated into English, that means targeting more vulnerable targets in order to send a message to more entrenched lawmakers.\n\nThe coalition has apparently not set its sights on state Sen. Josh McKoon, R-Columbus, or state Rep. Sam Teasley, R-Marietta, who introduced the two religious liberty bills that provoked business concern.\n\nNonetheless, McKoon called the effort unhelpful. \u201cTo the extent that the business community becomes hostile to basic issues and constitutional freedoms like religious liberty \u2013 that deviates from its basic message of economic development,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very constructive enterprise.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/05/17/georgia-business-launches-a-sudden-campaign-aimed-at-the-state-capitol/", "image": "http://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/gregorymailer.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "This winter, the state Capitol erupted in a sudden and unexpected fight over a set of \u201creligious liberty\u201d bills that were interpreted as a hostile reaction to the ground that gay marriage has gained through the courts.\r\n\r\nTea party supporters sought protection for the Christian wedding photographer who, out of conscience,...", "title": "Georgia business launches a sudden campaign aimed at the state Capitol | Political Insider blog"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "AJC blog about Atlanta politics, Georgia politics, Georgia and metro Atlanta election campaigns.
