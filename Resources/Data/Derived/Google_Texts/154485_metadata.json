Highmark and UPMC agreed to continue in-network access to UPMC services through 2014.\n\nLegislation in Harrisburg to require hospitals to accept all insurance companies is aimed directly at the UPMC and Highmark Inc. dispute, but critics say the bills go far beyond the state's legitimate role in the health care marketplace.\n\nEarlier this year, Highmark hired two neurologists from UPMC who work at Butler Memorial Hospital in the new PA Brain and Spine Institute.\n\nAlso, Butler Health and UPMC Cancer Center formed a joint-venture cancer center and acquired Butler Radiation Oncology Associates.\n\nBill Vidonic is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
