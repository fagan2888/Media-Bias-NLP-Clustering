I mean I lived life but I don't think you really live until you have a kid and I just thank God and her for making it a possibility,\u201d Geoff Louvar said.\n\nLast Thursday, Kansas Senator Mary Pilcher-Cook introduced a bill that if passed, would make surrogacy a crime. Anyone who played any part in a surrogate pregnancy would face up to a $10,000 fine or jail time.\n\nThe senator told us by phone, she introduced the bill to start a conversation about surrogacy.\n\n\"I think it's an opportunity for the committee members to weigh all the circumstances, to decide if we should act or maybe we should not act but above all it helps us to learn about the technology, about surrogacy, the people involved and their feelings about it,\u201d Senator Mary Pilcher-Cook (R) Shawnee, said.\n\nThe Louvars tell us they will be at that committee hearing Monday, to try to persuade senators to keep surrogacy a legal option for families.\n\n\"I know families that are looking at surrogacy that this is their only option to have a kid and I can't imagine not having or of somebody else taking that away from me,\u201d Hilary Louvar said.\n\nThe Louvars tell us this bill is especially personal because they were hoping to add on more to their family through surrogacy this year.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Monday, the Kansas Senate Health Committee will discuss a bill that would criminalize surrogate pregnancies in Kansas.
