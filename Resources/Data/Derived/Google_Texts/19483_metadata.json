It was one of five finalists.\n\nO\u2019Connell, who served as a commissioner, said the monument recognizes all who were involved during the war\u2014from the 5 million men and women who signed up to serve on the U.S. home front to support the troops to the nearly 117,000 U.S. servicemen who lost their lives.\n\nAmerica entered the war in April 1917, but the war had raged since July 28, 1914. The conflict ended in November 1918.\n\n\u201cWorld War I represents a war where more men, more of our service people, were lost than [the wars in] Korea and Vietnam combined,\u201d O\u2019Connell said, adding:\n\nAll of those things serve to inspire us to take this time to commemorate and honor the effects of World War I, the people who gave their lives, and the effort across the country on a national basis.\n\nThe memorial designed by Weishaar and Howard will include transforming Washington\u2019s Pershing Park into an open commemoration nestled on Pennsylvania Avenue, just blocks from the White House and with an open view of the U.S. Capitol. The park already honors Gen. John J. Pershing, who led U.S. forces to victory.\n\nThe memorial, expected to cost private donors up to $35 million, will include an elevated lawn surrounded by three walls of remembrance embedded with relief sculptures of servicemen and quotes from generals, soldiers, and politicians woven throughout.\n\nEach cubic foot will reflect one of the 116,516 American soldiers who died. The commission plans to complete the memorial in November 2018 to mark the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day, the official end of the war.\n\nO\u2019Connell lauded the selection for its \u201cclean design\u201d and various entries for access, including a wheelchair ramp.\n\nKen Clarke, CEO of the Chicago-based Pritzker Military Museum and Library, said a large reason it took so long to dedicate a national monument is that at the time, Americans enlisted in regiments on a local level, so memorials usually were placed in the hometowns of soldiers who died.\n\n\u201cWars were memorialized in a very different way in World War I,\u201d Clarke told The Daily Signal. \u201cThe memorials were done on a very local level\u2014it wasn\u2019t really the style of the day to have a big monument in Washington.\u201d\n\nBecause the law bars federal funds from sustaining this project, Clarke said, he and the commission rely on private donations.\n\nHis organization pledged $5 million to assist the commission and committed to match another $2.5 million of outside donations.\n\nAlthough \u201cThe Weight of Sacrifice\u201d will mark Washington\u2019s first national memorial commemorating World War I, it is not the first tribute in the nation\u2019s capital to the war\u2019s fallen.\n\nThe Second Infantry Division Memorial, dedicated in 1936 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on Constitution Avenue near 17th Street NW, honors those who were killed while serving in that Army division. It was expanded in 1962 to include two wings memorializing servicemen killed in World War II and the Korean War.\n\nO\u2019Connell said the new monument is important as both a remembrance of the past and a dedication to the future:\n\nOur veterans coming home notice how we think and how we remember wars of the past. They wonder, will we be recognized the way the World War I veterans have been up to now? Which means not much at all in the national consciousness.\n\nO\u2019Connell said Rebecca Wilson, an Iraq War veteran working with the commission, came home from that conflict to see the District of Columbia War Memorial, a locally erected pavilion, overgrown with vines and \u201cforgotten\u201d in a crook of the National Mall.\n\n\u201cShe thought, \u2018Is this what\u2019s going to happen to me? Is this how my service will be recognized as a place that\u2019s neglected and overlooked?\u2019\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\n\n\u201cNow, she\u2019s one of our key staff to make sure that\u2019s not how we remember World War I, that it\u2019s not just left in a corner and neglected. Because if a vet sees that, how do they know that that\u2019s not going to be how their service is remembered?\u201d\n\nThis report has been modified to include the Second Infantry Division Memorial, specify the date war was declared, and correct an editing error regarding Pershing\u2019s title.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today, tourists who descend on the nation\u2019s capital find not a single national memorial dedicated to those who served 100 years ago during the Great War.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Today, tourists who descend on the nation\u2019s capital find not a single national memorial dedicated to those who served 100 years ago during the Great War.", "title": "Here's the Design for the National World War I Memorial", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160126_WWIMemorial_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T13:16:12+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NyTeGx"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Today, tourists who descend on the nation\u2019s capital find not a single national memorial dedicated to those who served 100 years ago during the Great War.", "title": "Here's the Design for the National World War I Memorial", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160126_WWIMemorial_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "veterans", "published_time": "2016-01-28T16:52:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T13:16:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Libby O\u2019Connell, History Channel, World War I Centennial Commission, The Weight of Sacrifice, World War I, memorial, Pershing Park"}, "article_summary": "It was expanded in 1962 to include two wings memorializing servicemen killed in World War II and the Korean War.\nThey wonder, will we be recognized the way the World War I veterans have been up to now?\nAlthough \u201cThe Weight of Sacrifice\u201d will mark Washington\u2019s first national memorial commemorating World War I, it is not the first tribute in the nation\u2019s capital to the war\u2019s fallen.\n\u201cNow, she\u2019s one of our key staff to make sure that\u2019s not how we remember World War I, that it\u2019s not just left in a corner and neglected.\n\u201cWars were memorialized in a very different way in World War I,\u201d Clarke told The Daily Signal."}
