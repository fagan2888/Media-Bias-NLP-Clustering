The track, from an upcoming album featuring her poetry set to music, gets a wider hearing today in a Speakeasy exclusive.\n\n\u201cWe really felt like it was fitting,\u201d says Colin A. Johnson, Angelou\u2019s grandson and co-founder of the new family enterprise Caged Bird Legacy. \u201c\u2018Still I Rise\u2019 was a really central piece for her.\u201d Angelou, an acclaimed poet, actress, dancer and singer, died in May. She was 86.\n\nAngelou \u201cloved the concept,\u201d Johnson says, and recorded new readings of some of the works on the album, including \u201cStill I Rise.\u201d Angelou first published the poem in her 1978 collection \u201cAnd Still I Rise.\u201d Her matter-of-fact voice carries the track, which features a simple, stomping beat, a rich chorus of backing vocals and a lean blues riff. The piece is the last of 13 songs on \u201cCaged Bird Songs,\u201d produced by Shawn Rivera and RoccStarr, who has worked on music by Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Hudson and Cee Lo Green.\n\nAngelou had released previous albums: her lengthy list of career awards includes three Grammys for various spoken-word projects, and she began her career as a nightclub singer in the 1950s, releasing the LP \u201cMiss Calypso\u201d in 1957. Decades later, Angelou also collaborated with Ashford & Simpson on their 1996 album \u201cBeen Found.\u201d Johnson hopes that pairing Angelou\u2019s words and voice with more hip-hop-centric music will keep her work alive for a new, younger audience.\n\n\u201cThis transcends some generational gaps,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cMy grandma was 86. How do you reach someone who\u2019s my daughter\u2019s age, 16? Music is one of the best ways to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cCaged Bird Songs\u201d is due Nov. 4 on Smooch Music.
