But the greatest threat today comes from the fundamentalist right, with its ideological hostility to other religious or philosophical systems, to homosexuality, to sex education, and indeed to the basic idea of secular education.\u201d\n\nIn order to bring awareness to the issue of censorship in the U.S., the American Library Association hosts an annual Banned Books Week. It encourages libraries, schools and bookstores to draw attention to the harms that can occur to society and individual freedoms if books are censored.\n\n\u201cWhether in print or digital format, books are a precious resource, providing us with information, entertainment, opinions, ideas, and a window on lives far different from our own,\u201d wrote Molly Raphael, president of the American Library Association, in a piece to remind Americans that censorship still exists, even with the existence of the Internet.\n\n\u201cFree access to books and ideas is the foundation of our government and our society, enabling every person to become an educated participant in our democratic republic.\u201d\n\nBetween 2000 and 2009, there were 5,099 challenges reported to or recorded by the Office for Intellectual Freedom. In 2012, there were 464 challenges, marking a 25 percent increase from 2011, but still low compared to the number of challenges seen in the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 especially considering the Office for Intellectual Freedom simplified the process of challenging books. In 2013, there were 307 challenges, including to the books \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d\n\nSince some books that are challenged end up disappearing from libraries and bookstore shelves, the Forbidden Bookshelf is working to restore Americans\u2019 access to censored literature by making these pieces available in an e-book format.\n\nForbidden Bookshelf recently shared five books it will re-release to the public, which inspired MintPress News to find five other pieces of literature that contain material so controversial that they have had to be removed from libraries and classrooms.\n\n1. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain, 1884\n\nOne of the most frequently challenged books in the U.S. is Mark Twain\u2019s \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\u201d It was first banned in Concord, Massachusetts, in 1885, as it was viewed as \u201ctrash and suitable only for the slums.\u201d While some see the book as historically and culturally important, it is still challenged and banned in some parts of the U.S. because of its frequent use of racial slurs. Although such disparaging language was part of the everyday vocabulary when Twain wrote the novel, many argue that the book should be banned because it is \u201cracially insensitive,\u201d \u201coppressive\u201d and \u201cperpetuates racism\u201d against blacks, Native Americans and poor white Americans.\n\n2. Gone With the Wind, Margaret Mitchell, 1936\n\nIts reputation as one of the best-selling novels of all time hasn\u2019t stopped efforts to censor the Pulitzer Prize-winning story of the spoiled daughter of a Southern plantation owner before, during and after the Civil War. While the book has been praised for its criticism of the South\u2019s positive outlooks on slavery and racist attitudes, Mitchell\u2019s inclusion of words like \u201cdamn\u201d and \u201cwhore\u201d has also given as reasons why the book should no longer be available to the public.\n\n3. The Jungle, Upton Sinclair, 1906\n\nDespite being credited with leading to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration and meat inspections, Sinclair\u2019s story \u2014 first published in serial form in a socialist newspaper \u2014 was initially classified as a dangerous, socialist text. Though Sinclair\u2019s story was never officially banned in the U.S. and, in fact, has been used to teach generations of American students about muckraking and yellow journalism in social studies classes, publishers have been accused of changing the text to appease corporations.\n\n4. Our Bodies, Ourselves, Boston Women\u2019s Health Book Collective, 1971\n\nFictional tales aren\u2019t the only ones that are challenged and subject to censorship, which is evident by the attempts during the 1970s to ban a text about female anatomy and sexuality. One public library that opted to remove the book from its collection said the book \u201cpromotes homosexuality and perversion\u201d \u2014 since the word \u201cvagina\u201d remains taboo in the U.S., few are surprised about motions to keep this book off shelves.\n\n5. Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, Alfred C. Kinsey, 1948\n\nThe number one reason a book is censored is because of sexual content. For this reason, it should come as no surprise that a survey in which men and women were questioned about their sex lives didn\u2019t receive a warm welcome. Though Alfred Kinsey\u2019s survey was the first of its kind, it remains a controversial text even today.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From best-sellers to sex surveys, the U.S. has a history of keeping controversial texts off shelves, even though the First Amendment should be protecting books from such a fate.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Rucke", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "From best-sellers to sex surveys, the U.S. has a history of keeping controversial texts off shelves, even though the First Amendment should be protecting books from such a fate.", "title": "Banned But Not Forgotten: Book Censorship In The U.S.", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/banned-forgotten-book-censorship-u-s/193202/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AP071101051119-795x528.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-01T07:18:00-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From best-sellers to sex surveys, the U.S. has a history of keeping controversial texts off shelves, even though the First Amendment should be protecting books from such a fate.", "title": "Banned But Not Forgotten: Book Censorship In The U.S.", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AP071101051119-795x528.jpg", "creator": "@katierucke", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: Inside Stories", "tag": "First Amendment", "published_time": "2014-06-28T05:00:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-01T07:18:00-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5f7\"", "article_summary": "While censorship is often conducted by corporations and governments to prevent words, images or ideas from entering the mainstream, censorship of literature has been around as early as 399 B.C.\nOne public library that opted to remove the book from its collection said the book \u201cpromotes homosexuality and perversion\u201d \u2014 since the word \u201cvagina\u201d remains taboo in the U.S., few are surprised about motions to keep this book off shelves.\nBanned But Not Forgotten: Book Censorship In The U.S.From best-sellers to sex surveys, the U.S. has a history of keeping controversial texts off shelves, even though the First Amendment should be protecting books from such a fate.\nSexual Behavior in the Human Male, Alfred C.
