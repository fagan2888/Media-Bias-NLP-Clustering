Romneycare shadows Brown tour\n\nCONCORD, N.H. \u2014 Scott Brown is on an \u201cObamacare isn\u2019t working\u201d tour.\n\nThe former Massachusetts senator, now running in New Hampshire, has become a walking megaphone of anti-Obamacare rhetoric. He calls the health law a \u201cdisaster,\u201d a \u201cfiasco,\u201d a \u201cgovernment takeover\u201d and a regulatory \u201ctsunami\u201d that will overwhelm the state\u2019s businesses, its medical device industry, its ski resorts.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nYet for all the vitriol, Brown may not be the purest critic. Obamacare is an offshoot of Romneycare, which Brown supported as a Republican state lawmaker in Massachusetts. That gives Brown the same problem Mitt Romney had while running for president in 2012: explaining why he likes and still defends a health reform law packed with mandates in Massachusetts while declaring its central elements unfit for the nation.\n\nBrown insisted in an interview that although Obamacare is \u201cthe biggest issue in New Hampshire\u201d he is not taking health care cues from Romney.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: $474M for 4 failed Obamacare exchanges)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not told me anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to anybody about it. I understand the issues and do my own research.\u201d\n\nYet Brown is not reticent about enlisting Romney to make his case, including a fundraising appeal highlighting the very topic that confounded Romney\u2019s own candidacy.\n\n\u201cThe only way to get rid of Obamacare once and for all is to get rid of the Obamacare Democrats who forced it upon the American people in the first place \u2026 starting with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen,\u201d Romney wrote on Brown\u2019s behalf.\n\nNo candidate\u2019s political identity is more intertwined with Obamacare than Scott Brown\u2019s. His ongoing praise for Romneycare and condemnation of Obamacare is the conundrum of his unusual bid to unseat Democrat Shaheen and become the first person to represent two states in the Senate since 1879.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Massachusetts ditches RomneyCare health exchange)\n\nOpposition to President Barack Obama\u2019s health law worked for Brown \u2014 once. It propelled him from the backbenches of the Massachusetts State Senate to Washington in 2010. Less than three years later, he was voted out.\n\nIt was arguably easier to attack the federal version of the law when Massachusetts already had a state-based program to cover its own people. It may be harder to finesse as Brown transplants himself to New Hampshire, where enrollment in Obamacare exceeded goals. More than 40,000 people signed up, including 31,000 with subsidies, and the GOP-led state Senate recently joined Democrats to expand Medicaid, covering more low-income people in the state by embracing a key piece of the federal health law.\n\nShaheen, like many of the vulnerable Democrats up for reelection in November, has been reticent about Obamacare. But she said in an interview outside the Senate chamber this week that \u201csuccesses\u201d are emerging. \u201cI think people are beginning to see the changes the health care law has made,\u201d she said, while again pledging to keep addressing its flaws.\n\n( CARTOONS: Matt Wuerker on Obamacare)\n\nThere are, of course, plenty of voters in New Hampshire who oppose the president\u2019s health law fiercely, and Brown barreled into the state promising to be their champion. One health insurer dominates the exchange, he notes, and there\u2019s been a particular outcry here from people who can\u2019t see the doctor they are used to, or go to the nearest hospital without incurring extra costs. And there were those politically toxic canceled health plans.\n\nBrown hammers on those points on his tour, and he spends most of his stump speech slamming the law and the ills he says it has wrought on New Hampshire. He makes passing mentions of high energy costs and emphasizes his \u201clong and strong ties\u201d to New Hampshire. But he repeatedly returns to the harm of Obamacare \u2014 and he lays the blame in Shaheen\u2019s lap.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the deciding vote on Obamacare, along with all the other Democrats that rammed it through Congress,\u201d Brown said on his tour stop.\u201cSince when does the federal government tell us what to do and how to do it? That\u2019s not what we believe in here, that\u2019s not what I believe in.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)\n\nShaheen has been talking about small businesses, jobs and veterans more than the Affordable Care Act. Her campaign notes her support for the health law but emphasizes her efforts to \u201cimprove\u201d it, a staple for embattled Democrats. Lately though, she\u2019s beginning to describe more bright spots, including robust enrollment numbers. She also said as many as five insurers are thinking about joining New Hampshire\u2019s exchange next year, undercutting Brown\u2019s argument about a lack of competition.\n\nShe also pounced on Brown\u2019s role in passing Massachusetts\u2019s health care law, accusing him of having \u201cchanged his mind\u201d on policies he supported as a state senator. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Scott Brown\u2019s been, \u201d she said. \u201cThere are fixes that we need to make but the answer is not to repeal the law.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Brown says he\u2019s not conflicted about his health record.\n\n\u201cI have no challenge. I\u2019m very clear. I know what I did. I know how I voted,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cWe addressed a situation in Massachusetts that everybody worked on together \u2026 That\u2019s not what the federal plan did. And we didn\u2019t raise taxes, and we didn\u2019t cut Medicare.\u201d\n\nPolls show Shaheen leading by a few points, but it\u2019s early and lots of voters are undecided. Americans for Prosperity recently announced a \u201csix-figure\u201d ad buy here, hammering Shaheen on Obamacare and helping Brown. Republicans need to pick up six seats to take control of the Senate. They want New Hampshire to be one of them.\n\nHow well the \u201cObamacare\u2019s Not Working\u201d tour is itself working is hard to gauge. Visiting Secure Care Products, a medical tech company nestled in an office park not far from the statehouse, Brown the other day told workers to brace themselves for Obamacare fallout.
