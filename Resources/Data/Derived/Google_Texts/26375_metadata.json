We want to teach these guys no matter how big the situation is we want to keep serving,\" said Taylor.\n\nThe players said despite the excitement on campus this is a great diversion.\n\n\n\n\"Its just really been hectic. A lot of media attention. It's great, get our mind off stuff. Help the community out. I think it's great,\" Romelo Banks said.\n\n\n\nThe Sulzbacher Center said it's grateful UNF does programs like this with the kids who stay at the center.\n\n\"There's swoop fever and we're just glad they're coming and all the other students that are here to help,\" said Linda Hemphill with the Sulzbacher Center.\n\nThe idea for this trip is part of a program at UNF called Alternative Spring Break Transformational Learning Opportunity. It was spearheaded by a UNF instructor in the psychology department.\n\nCopyright 2015 by News4Jax.com. All rights reserved.
