It\u2019s not known how many times the suspect was shot. Both men were taken to the Medical Center of the Rockies in Loveland. Fort Collins patrol officers are required to wear bulletproof vests.\n\nA witness called police at 3:45 p.m. and reported seeing a suspicious person, said Fort Collins Deputy Chief Cory Christensen.\n\nThe police officer responded to the apartment complex near the busy intersection of Drake Road and Shields Street, Christensen said. The apartments are on the southwest corner of the intersection.\n\nThe officer spotted a man lying on the floor in an apartment stairwell.\n\nAs the officer approached, the man pulled out a gun and shot the officer. The officer fired back, striking and injuring the man, Christensen said.\n\nArzelia Morgan, 57, who lives at Cimarron Square Townhouses, 2601 Davidson Dr., said she was out front smoking when she heard what sounded like fireworks.\n\n\u201cThere were two pops and then there were three or four pops,\u201d she said. \u201cThen every cop in town showed up.\u201d\n\nChristensen said that although police officers regularly answer suspicious person calls, they are cautious each time, knowing what can go wrong.\n\n\u201cThis kind of call \u2014 it\u2019s a regular call that we handle every day,\u201d he said. \u201cThe uncommon part is that the suspect shot at him.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether the officer followed proper procedures, Christensen replied, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nDetectives are investigating the case, he said. They will present the evidence to the Larimer County district attorney\u2019s office for review.\n\nPolice are not releasing the names of the suspect or the police officer.\n\nThe injured officer has been on the police force for less than a year, Christensen said. However, he was a police officer in other jurisdictions before he came to Fort Collins, he said.\n\nThe officer has been placed on paid leave of absence.\n\n\u201cThe main reason is for the welfare of the individual who was involved in the shooting,\u201d Christensen said.\n\nHe said the last officer-involved shooting in Fort Collins was in June when a man charged a police officer with a gun. The suspect was shot but survived. Before that it had been two years since the previous officer-involved shooting.\n\nMorgan said the area has a lot of traffic and the biggest thing that usually happens are multiple-car accidents.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell, denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Man dies after exchanging gunshots with Fort Collins police officer", "title": "Man dies after exchanging gunshots with Fort Collins police officer", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/05/man-dies-after-exchanging-gunshots-with-fort-collins-police-officer/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-05T17:04:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-05T17:04:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A man died Sunday after exchanging gunshots with a Fort Collins police officer at an apartment complex after the officer responded to a suspicious person call, authorities said.\nA witness called police at 3:45 p.m. and reported seeing a suspicious person, said Fort Collins Deputy Chief Cory Christensen.\nHe said the last officer-involved shooting in Fort Collins was in June when a man charged a police officer with a gun.\nFort Collins patrol officers are required to wear bulletproof vests.\nHowever, he was a police officer in other jurisdictions before he came to Fort Collins, he said."}
