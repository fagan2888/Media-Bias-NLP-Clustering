He\u2019s giving them one.\n\nThe Nationals dropped their sixth consecutive game, losing to Madison Bumgarner and the San Francisco Giants, 5-0, on Sunday to complete a four-game sweep and matching their longest skid of the season.\n\nA popular pick before opening day to win the World Series, the Nationals fell below .500 at 58-59.\n\n\u201cIt will be good to give the guys a day off, get away from the game,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou have to look at where we are, look at the big picture. If we win some games, we jump right back into this.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals dropped to 1-6 on their road trip, which concludes with a three-game series against the Colorado Rockies. Before the opener on Tuesday, the Nationals will have a free day in Denver.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take the day off, regroup, hit the reset button and come back and try to get hot,\u201d first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve played terrible the last 15 or 16 games, and we faced one of the best today [in Bumgarner]. He might be the best in the bigs right now.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals were shut out for the third time in six games and the first two were started by Los Angeles Dodgers aces Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw.\n\nInclude Bumgarner\u2019s offensive capabilities and he may be the best overall pitcher. He hit a home run and doubled, drove in two runs, struck out 14 and pitched a three-hitter.\n\n\u201cHe throws all his pitches from the same arm angle, he works both sides of the plate and he and Buster [Posey] work together to keep you off balance,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cHe\u2019s not an easy one to get, but we have to find out how to do it.\u201d\n\nBumgarner (14-6) held the Nationals hitless into the fifth inning. The World Series MVP matched his career high for strikeouts while pitching his first shutout of the year and fourth overall in the regular season.\n\nThe big lefty permitted just three singles, and no runner made it past second base. Bumgarner improved to 3-5 in 10 starts \u2014 including the postseason \u2014 against Washington. He had lost his last three in the rivalry and the Giants had dropped Bumgarner\u2019s previous five starts facing the Nationals.\n\nJoe Ross (3-5) struck out the first four Giants and threw three perfect innings before running into trouble in the fourth.\n\nRoss lasted a season-low four-plus innings, allowing four runs and six hits. He walked one and struck out six.\n\n\u201cI was making adjustments the second time through the lineup and I made a few mistakes and things added up on me,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome of the balls they hit weren\u2019t bad pitches.\u201d\n\nNationals outfielder Bryce Harper was back in the lineup less than 24 hours after fouling a ball off the top of his foot. Harper said it was still painful after Saturday night\u2019s game but that he was encouraged that X-rays were negative.\n\n\u201cI got it pretty good,\u201d Harper said. \u201cIt felt terrible at the time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bumgarner also hit a home run and doubled as part of his three-hitter, and the 5-0 victory for the Giants on Sunday handed the Nationals a losing record.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Bumgarner also hit a home run and doubled as part of his three-hitter, and the 5-0 victory for the Giants on Sunday handed the Nationals a losing record.", "title": "Madison Bumgarner strikes out 14 as Giants complete sweep of Nationals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/16/madison-bumgarner-strikes-out-14-giants-nationals/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/16/436d2cffb5b54c247f0f6a706700fccb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/16/436d2cffb5b54c247f0f6a706700fccb.jpg", "description": "Bumgarner also hit a home run and doubled as part of his three-hitter, and the 5-0 victory for the Giants on Sunday handed the Nationals a losing record.", "card": "summary", "title": "Madison Bumgarner strikes out 14 as Giants complete sweep of Nationals"}, "Author": "Rick Eymer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Washington Nationals, San Francisco Giants, Matt Williams, Ryan Zimmerman"}, "article_summary": "The Nationals dropped their sixth consecutive game, losing to Madison Bumgarner and the San Francisco Giants, 5-0, on Sunday to complete a four-game sweep and matching their longest skid of the season.\nHe had lost his last three in the rivalry and the Giants had dropped Bumgarner\u2019s previous five starts facing the Nationals.\nA popular pick before opening day to win the World Series, the Nationals fell below .500 at 58-59.\nIf we win some games, we jump right back into this.\u201dThe Nationals dropped to 1-6 on their road trip, which concludes with a three-game series against the Colorado Rockies.\nJoe Ross (3-5) struck out the first four Giants and threw three perfect innings before running into trouble in the fourth."}
