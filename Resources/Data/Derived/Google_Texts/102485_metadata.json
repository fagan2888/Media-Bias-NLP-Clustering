Sometimes the issue is simply tax revenues from admired companies. When, for example, Pfizer recently announced its plans to move to London to reduce its tax bill, brothers Representative Sander Levin (D., Mich.), and Senator Carl Levin (also D., Mich.) promptly joined forces to back new legislation that would force Pfizer to share its revenues by blocking the companies\u2019 move.\n\nThe New York Times branded Pfizer\u2019s move a \u201ctax dodge,\u201d a way of suggesting Pfizer\u2019s behavior is sleazy.

And who can disagree?
