He did not speak to the media after the fight, as he was taken to a hospital as a precaution.\n\n\u201cMiguel beat him from pillar to post,\u201d said Martinez\u2019s promoter, Lou DiBella. \u201cMiguel Cotto is a great champion.\u201d\n\nCotto improved to 39-4 and is 8-1 at Madison Square Garden. Martinez fell to 51-3-2.\n\nAccording to Todd duBoef, the President of Top Rank, the attendance was 21,090, and the gross gate was under $5 million.\n\nIn the week leading up to the fight, Roach, Cotto\u2019s trainer, said his pupil would be able to use his footwork to control the fight, and still possessed power even though he moved up in weight class.\n\nCotto proved Roach right from the opening bell, knocking down Martinez twice in the first round with a flurry of body shots. As the fight progressed, Cotto pressured Martinez around the ring, and attacked when openings were presented.\n\nCotto won every round, including a 10-6 first.\n\n\u201cMiguel fought a really great fight,\u201d Roach said. \u201cThank you, Miguel, for making me look so good.\n\n\u201cHe really gave the guy a boxing lesson.\u201d\n\nMartinez forced Cotto to fight in the middle of the ring instead of on the ropes or in the corners. But Cotto was able to land a variety of jabs and hooks. By the end of the eighth round, Martinez had swelling around his right eye. He also had a cut on his forehead due to a head-butt.\n\nBoth cuts were glued shut.\n\nCotto landed 54 percent of his punches, and 54 percent of his power punches. By comparison, Martinez connected on 31 percent of his punches, and landed 60 of 157 power punches.\n\n\u201cMartinez couldn\u2019t hurt him,\u201d Roach said. \u201cMiguel listened to the game plan.\u201d\n\nThe Cotto-Martinez fight was the main event of a nine-fight card.\n\nMarvin Sonsona (19-1-1) became the NABF featherweight champion with a 10-round split decision win over Wilfredo Vasquez Jr (23-4-1).\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a dirty, rotten fighter,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cWhen I pressured him, he held. He landed one good punch, the punch that knocked me down.\u201d\n\nJavier Maciel (29-3) won the USNBC super welterweight title, defeating Jorge Melendez (28-4-1) by split decision, and Andy Lee (32-2) stopped John Jackson (18-2) with a left hook in the fifth round.\n\n\u201cI ran into a bad one,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWhat a lucky punch.\u201d\n\nPrior to the main card bouts, Felix Verdejo improved to 13-0 with a first-round technical knockout of Engelberto Valenzuela (9-2); and Jose Lopez (13-0) won an eight-round unanimous decision over Raul Hidalgo (21-11-0-1) to retain the WBC super bantam FECARBOX title.\n\nJose Pedraza moved to 17-0 with a first-round technical knockout of Arturo Uruzquieta (15-6); and Willie Nelson improved to 22-1-1 with a first-round technical knockout of Darryl Cunningham (29-7). In his first professional bout, Jantory Ortiz stopped Elio Ruiz (1-5) in the first round.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Miguel Cotto stops Sergio Martinez for middleweight title", "title": "Miguel Cotto stops Sergio Martinez for middleweight title", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/08/miguel-cotto-stops-sergio-martinez-for-middleweight-title/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140608__cott-martinezp1.jpg", "height": 494}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140608__cott-martinezp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-08T09:45:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:09:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf344\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMiguel Cotto is a great champion.\u201dCotto improved to 39-4 and is 8-1 at Madison Square Garden.\nNEW YORK \u2014 As Freddie Roach recalled, he recently received a phone call from Miguel Cotto, who suggested he only had three fights left.\nBy the end of the eighth round, Martinez had swelling around his right eye.\nBy comparison, Martinez connected on 31 percent of his punches, and landed 60 of 157 power punches.\nCotto became the first Puerto Rican fighter to win world championships in four weight divisions, stopping Sergio Martinez in their WBC world middleweight title fight Saturday night."}
