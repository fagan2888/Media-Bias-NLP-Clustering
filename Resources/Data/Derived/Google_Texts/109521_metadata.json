The 2006 Massachusetts health law, later a model for the national one, provided his family with affordable coverage following a layoff.\n\nBut lately the state\u2019s online insurance marketplace has not been working for Kimball \u2014 or for many other consumers. He spent two weeks trying to enroll in a new plan, without success, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the state relaunched its insurance website Oct. 1 to comply with the national law, it has had persistent problems: links lead nowhere, technological failures lock users out or deliver inexplicable error messages, and consumers endure long wait times to speak with customer service representatives, who sometimes offer little more than a suggestion to try again later.\n\nThe Connector\u2019s Facebook page is full of complaints from consumers, many of whom said they support the state and national health care laws ideologically but are incensed by an uncooperative website and by the fact that the old, functional state system is gone.\n\nLeaders of the Massachusetts Health Connector, the independent agency that runs the marketplace, say they are working around the clock to address the problems. They say they have brought in experts to help engineer fixes and plan to double the number of people working the hot line by the end of this week.\n\n\u201cUltimately, getting people the coverage that they are entitled to is our highest priority,\u201d said Jean Yang, executive director of the Connector, who said she understands why people are frustrated.\n\nAbout 105,000 people who have state subsidized coverage, through a program called Commonwealth Care, must enroll in a new plan in the coming months, and many more people want to shop for insurance. As of Wednesday night, 23,275 people had completed applications, about twice the number at the end of October. Just 1,047 had selected a plan, the last step before paying and becoming fulling enrolled. The website is not yet accepting online payments.\n\nMatthew Cavanaugh for The Boston Globe After trying for two weeks, Sean Kimball still is seeking a plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the first days of troubleshooting the website, Connector spokespeople said that they were fixing relatively minor glitches and that some of the more significant problems were related to difficulty accessing the troubled federal data hub. But weeks later, many of the most common complaints are about the state website itself.\n\nYang stopped short of saying that the website was launched before it was ready or that mistakes were made in its design. She called it a \u201cvery young system\u201d and one that is far more complicated than the Connector\u2019s old site.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working very hard to improve and stabilize and enhance the system, and that\u2019s a process that has been ongoing since the day that we went live,\u201d she said.\n\nThe $69 million website was built by CGI, which helped develop the much-maligned federal site. The state and CGI recently brought in engineers from Oracle to refine the site, which is largely built on Oracle software.\n\nThe Connector also moved the deadline by which the 105,000 people enrolled in Commonwealth Care must select a new plan \u2014 to March 31, allowing three more months.\n\nFor Kimball, 51, the reprieve was welcome. He tried frequently over two weeks to enroll but the system repeatedly assigned him the wrong home address and wouldn\u2019t accept his changes. Or, it incorrectly determined he is incarcerated and therefore ineligible.\n\nThat automated message was generated whenever the federal Homeland Security database was down, Yang said, but connector officials said they have changed the process to allow people to proceed with their application when that occurs. They also fixed a problem that caused the system to deny user passwords.\n\nKimball is worried about securing the insurance coverage his family needs. But, more than that, he is concerned that the state is backsliding.\n\n\u201cI loved being able to say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got the whole gay marriage thing, that\u2019s cool, and the health care thing works, too,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt seems really important to me, and I don\u2019t want to lose it.\u201d\n\nMary Lincoln of Jamaica Plain also lamented the loss of the old Connector site, where she bought separate plans for herself and for her 24-year-old son. Her son\u2019s plan expires at the end of the year.\n\nHe is a full-time student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and probably can get coverage from the school, Lincoln said, but she wanted to compare the price with Connector plans. She submitted an application for him and was told she would receive verification by mail.\n\nThat was four weeks ago. Since then, she has called customer service several times.\n\n\u201cI just keep being on hold, and eventually I just have to give up,\u201d she said.\n\nYang said the average wait time as of mid-November was just under 10 minutes, though many people were waiting more than 30 minutes. She said she hopes an increase in representatives taking calls, from 65 to 130, will help.\n\nHealth Care for All, a consumer advocacy group, has been hearing complaints that the website is slow to load or finicky. Kate Bicego, the consumer assistance program manager, said she is confident the state is doing what it can to fix it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking people to take a deep breath,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one has lost coverage.\u201d\n\nBut that is a concern. Some people with nonsubsidized plans through the Connector\u2019s Commonwealth Choice program must reenroll in coverage by year\u2019s end if their plan expires. And some consumers with canceled commercial plans are looking to shop for coverage through the state market and avoid a gap in coverage.\n\nRichard Ilsley, 60, of Wellesley last week finally succeeded in choosing a plan \u2014 one that costs less and has a lower deductible than the one he had, even without a subsidy. It took nearly five weeks of trying. Ilsley said the site clearly wasn\u2019t well tested before launch. Asked what advice he had for those trying to apply, Ilsley said, \u201cGood luck to everyone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.865774327", "eomportal-id": 540305, "description": "Sean Kimball had a retort ready when friends expressed their objections to the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt\u2019s worked out well for us,\u201d he would say.
