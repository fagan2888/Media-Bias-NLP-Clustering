The Sinai board has started the process to name a replacement, with an announcement expected in May, Chairman Gary Niederpruem said in Sinai's statement.\n\nMr. Channing, a graduate of the University of Cincinnati and Ohio State University, joined Sinai in 2004 after serving seven years as CEO of St. Vincent Charity Hospital and St. Luke's Medical Center in Cleveland. Before that he was CEO at three hospitals in the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Andrew L.
