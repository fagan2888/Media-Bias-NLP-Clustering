NEW YORK — Kentucky coach John Calipari, Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson and four-time Defensive Player of the Year Dikembe Mutombo are among the finalists for this year’s Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame class.

Former NBA stars Tim Hardaway, Spencer Haywood and Jo Jo White also were chosen as finalists Friday. They join former WNBA star Lisa Leslie, longtime referee Dick Bavetta, and two-time NBA Coach of the Year Bill Fitch among the class of 2015 hopefuls.
