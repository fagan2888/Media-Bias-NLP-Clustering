The times when his players don\u2019t box out. The times when the ball bounces in front of them and they still don\u2019t go for the ball. The (many) missed free throws. The shoddy defense.\n\nHe must have had a hard time sitting through Friday\u2019s game against the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Pepsi Center.\n\nComing off a blowout loss at Charlotte and a sloppy defeat at Brooklyn, the Nuggets returned home to host the Timberwolves, the worst team in the West, in a game that, on paper, should have been Denver\u2019s for the taking.\n\nAnd until the fourth quarter, Kenneth Faried appeared to be the only Nuggets player who wanted it.\n\nFaried, who turned in one of his finest showings of the season against Brooklyn three nights earlier, came back with an even better one Friday with 26 points and a career-high 25 rebounds while leading the Nuggets to a 106-102 victory over the Timberwolves.\n\n\u201cAfter 26 points,\u201d Shaw said, \u201cI want him to understand that we didn\u2019t call plays for him. He got those 26 points going after offensive rebounds every single time. And probably four times, I would say tonight, the ball got volleyballed around and it fell right in his hands and he was able to put it right back up and in. But that was just because he put himself in the right place by being in there in the first place. That\u2019s what I want him to take away from that.\u201d\n\nSaid Faried: \u201cMy back wasn\u2019t tight. I felt loose and limber, like I was playing back at USA Basketball. I was able to keep going. Teammates were missing shots, but I was just there at the right time. They played hard, Minnesota did, but I just wanted to keep going and keep us in it, some way, somehow.\u201d\n\nBut with every one of his baskets, as well as those of his teammates, the Timberwolves seemed to have a response on the other end, ones that were often handed to them by the Nuggets\u2019 miscues.\n\nEighteen turnovers. Too many wide-open shots to count for Minnesota. Many poor decisions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had droughts at the wrong time,\u201d Shaw said before the game. \u201cBut when you\u2019re not shooting the ball well, you can live with that if you\u2019re defending. And I thought our defense has slipped. We haven\u2019t been accomplishing our goals in terms of keeping teams to 24 each quarter on a consistent basis.\u201d\n\nThe Timberwolves (5-23) arrived in Denver sporting the worst defensive rating in the NBA, allowing 113 points per 100 possessions and letting opponents shoot a league-worst 49.8 percent from the field and 65.3 percent from within 5 feet of the rim.\n\nIt was a defense, or lack of one, that was tailored to point guard Ty Lawson. But the guy who came in leading the league with 13 drives per game couldn\u2019t get in the paint much and settled for 6-of-17 shooting from the field for 16 points, while adding 11 assists.\n\nWilson Chandler, who has been a model of consistency for the Nuggets for much of this season, added 21 points. But he hit only 7-of-21 attempts from the field, including just 2-of-9 shots from 3-point range.\n\nThe victory?\n\nSure, the Nuggets (13-17) will take it. They have to. They need it. As Shaw said before Friday\u2019s game, the Nuggets \u201chave to make a run and do something right now.\u201d\n\nMaybe this was the start.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kenneth Faried grabs 25 rebounds, saves Nuggets from sloppy loss", "title": "Kenneth Faried grabs 25 rebounds, saves Nuggets from sloppy loss", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/26/kenneth-faried-grabs-25-rebounds-saves-nuggets-from-sloppy-loss/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141226_092843_denver-nuggets.jpg", "height": 478}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141226_092843_denver-nuggets.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-26T21:34:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T07:35:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6aa\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAfter 26 points,\u201d Shaw said, \u201cI want him to understand that we didn\u2019t call plays for him.\nHe must have had a hard time sitting through Friday\u2019s game against the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Pepsi Center.\nAs Shaw said before Friday\u2019s game, the Nuggets \u201chave to make a run and do something right now.\u201dMaybe this was the start.\nAnd until the fourth quarter, Kenneth Faried appeared to be the only Nuggets player who wanted it.\nThe times when the ball bounces in front of them and they still don\u2019t go for the ball."}
