Presumably, it meant \"anything.\" Pundits asked whether Cruz would throw another cluster bomb when the omnibus spending bill came up. The Wall Street Journal's Neil King interviewed Cruz less than two weeks ago; the senator did nothing to wave off speculation.\n\nIn an interview, he lambasted Senate Republicans for a lack of courage, compared himself to Ronald Reagan and vowed to \"fight even harder\u2026to repeal every word of Obamacare.\"\n\nRepublicans must use \"every leverage point available\" to uproot the law, he said in a 45-minute discussion in which he mentioned Obamacare more than 40 times... Mr. Cruz said opportunities to scale back the law will come with a spending bill to fund federal agencies, which must be approved by Jan. 15.\n\nWell, the bill passed. It won such massive majorities in the House and Senate (though most Senate Republicans, like Cruz, opposed it) that it stopped being a story. A fight is news; a handshake usually isn't. What happened to Cruz? David Rogers reports it succinctly:\n\nComing out of a party luncheon, Cruz\u2019s colleagues said he was insistent on demanding a vote on this amendment, even if it meant delaying passage. But ultimately the Texan changed his tone. Instead he used a speech on the floor to highlight his complaints about the president\u2019s program and then politely left after Appropriations Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) objected to his requests.\n\nSensitive to the perception of him backing down, Cruz\u2019s office said later that \u201che remains committed to keeping the conversation about Obamacare front and center as the law continues to harm more and more Americans by raising their premiums, canceling their plans and keeping them from their doctors.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Ted Cruz Says He Will \"Do Anything\" to Stop Obamacare, Doesn't Actually Do Anything", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "After the government shutdown ended, when Republicans would even leave the garden of anonymity to trash Ted Cruz for putting them in an awkward positio ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "After the government shutdown ended, when Republicans would even leave the garden of anonymity to trash Ted Cruz for putting them in an awkward positio ...", "title": "Ted Cruz Says He Will \"Do Anything\" to Stop Obamacare, Doesn't Actually Do Anything", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/01/17/ted_cruz_says_he_will_do_anything_to_stop_obamacare_doesn_t_actually_do.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/weigel/2014/01/17/ted_cruz_says_he_will_do_anything_to_stop_obamacare_doesn_t_actually_do/187249870-republican-senator-ted-cruz-of-texas-attends-a-hearing.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After the government shutdown ended, when Republicans would even leave the garden of anonymity to trash Ted Cruz for putting them in an awkward positio ...", "title": "Ted Cruz Says He Will &quot;Do Anything&quot; to Stop Obamacare, Doesn't Actually Do Anything", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/01/17/ted_cruz_says_he_will_do_anything_to_stop_obamacare_doesn_t_actually_do.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/weigel/2014/01/17/ted_cruz_says_he_will_do_anything_to_stop_obamacare_doesn_t_actually_do/187249870-republican-senator-ted-cruz-of-texas-attends-a-hearing.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@daveweigel", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-17T09:49:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Ted Cruz Says He Will \"Do Anything\" to Stop Obamacare, Doesn't Actually Do Anything", "sailthru.headline": "Ted Cruz Says He Will \"Do Anything\" to Stop Obamacare, Doesn't Actually Do Anything", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Ted Cruz Says He Will \\\"Do Anything\\\" to Stop Obamacare, Doesn\\u0027t Actually Do Anything\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/01/17/ted_cruz_says_he_will_do_anything_to_stop_obamacare_doesn_t_actually_do.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/weigel/2014/01/17/ted_cruz_says_he_will_do_anything_to_stop_obamacare_doesn_t_actually_do/187249870-republican-senator-ted-cruz-of-texas-attends-a-hearing.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"200140117002\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-17T09:49:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"David Weigel\",\n  \"tags\": []\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Ted Cruz Says He Will \"Do Anything\" to Stop Obamacare, Doesn't Actually Do Anything", "keywords": "ted cruz", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "ted cruz", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "http://facebook.com/daveweigel"}, "sailthru.description": "After the government shutdown ended, when Republicans would even leave the garden of anonymity to trash Ted Cruz for putting them in an awkward positio ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/weigel/2014/01/17/ted_cruz_says_he_will_do_anything_to_stop_obamacare_doesn_t_actually_do/187249870-republican-senator-ted-cruz-of-texas-attends-a-hearing.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4a5\"", "article_summary": "\"I would do anything, and I will continue to do anything I can, to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare,\" Cruz told ABC News three months ago.\nIt won such massive majorities in the House and Senate (though most Senate Republicans, like Cruz, opposed it) that it stopped being a story.\nPundits asked whether Cruz would throw another cluster bomb when the omnibus spending bill came up.\nIn an interview, he lambasted Senate Republicans for a lack of courage, compared himself to Ronald Reagan and vowed to \"fight even harder\u2026to repeal every word of Obamacare.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal's Neil King interviewed Cruz less than two weeks ago; the senator did nothing to wave off speculation."}
