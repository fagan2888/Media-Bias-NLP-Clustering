Rather, it would extend health care, under the Family Access Medical Insurance Security program, to such children. This version has been corrected.\n\nWhile Va. House Republicans rejected Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s push to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, their budget plan includes $124 million for mental-health care and health services for the poor. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nHouse Republicans announced Thursday that their state budget plan will include $124 million for mental-health care and health services for the poor \u2014 slightly more than the money proposed last fall by Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D).\n\nThe move reflects a bid by the GOP to build on mental-health reforms begun after a tragedy involving a senator\u2019s son and to shake off the \u201cparty of no\u201d label Democrats have lobbed at them for rejecting McAuliffe\u2019s big push to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe GOP played up distinctions between their plan and McAuliffe\u2019s fallback \u201cHealthy Virginia\u201d program on Thursday, while the governor took credit for spurring Republicans into action.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: We are not expanding Medicaid, not funding the specifics the governor put out,\u201d said Del. John M. O\u2019Bannon III (R-Henrico). \u201cOur budget will strengthen the existing safety net for the truly needy.. . . We\u2019re using real dollars, not promises of federal funding for the most pressing needs of our most vulnerable Virginians.\u201d\n\nAfter a meeting between McAuliffe and House leaders later in the day, McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy said the governor had concluded that their plan was not too different from his own.\n\n\u201cThe Governor is happy to see House Republicans recognize the need to expand care for thousands of Virginians with serious mental illness, even if it took the announcement of his own plan to motivate them to act,\u201d McAuliffe\u2019s office said in a written statement.\n\nO\u2019Bannon unveiled the plan on the House floor ahead of formal approval that will come from the House Appropriations Committee in a meeting Sunday. It would use $124 million in state funds to provide treatment for people with serious mental illness and nearly double funding for free clinics.\n\nA news release from House leaders said the budget would \u201creject Governor McAuliffe\u2019s effort to implement Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion and will not fund Governor McAuliffe\u2019s \u2018Healthy Virginia\u2019 entitlement program.\u201d\n\nThe Republican plan includes some components of the Healthy Virginia plan, however. The GOP, like the governor, would cover dental care for 45,000 pregnant Virginians and extend health care, under the Family Access Medical Insurance Security, to the children of low-income state employees.\n\nBut the GOP plan diverges from the governor\u2019s when it comes to mental health. McAuliffe has created the Governor\u2019s Access Plan, or GAP, as a way to provide medical and mental-health care for 20,000 of the state\u2019s most severely mentally ill individuals.\n\nThe Republican plan would cover 30,000 mentally ill people, but provide them with only psychiatric care, including psychiatric prescription coverage. It would not provide them with broader health care. Republicans propose addressing unmet medical needs with an extra $3 million for free health clinics.\n\nThe mental-health services in the House plan would be provided through the same managed-care system that handles psychiatric care for the state\u2019s Medicaid patients. But the new patients would not be considered Medi\u00adcaid enrollees nor be eligible for other Medicaid services, said Matthew Moran, spokesman for House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford). The federal government would match what Virginia spends on those mental-health services.\n\nThat 50-50 match is considerably less favorable than the match Washington offers under Medicaid expansion. But Republicans opposed to expansion have questioned the federal government\u2019s ability to keep its promise to pay at least 90 percent of the cost, with lawmakers saying they fear that Virginia will ultimately be stuck with the bill.\n\nThe House\u2019s plan would cover severely mentally ill people making less than 80 percent of the federal poverty rate. McAuliffe\u2019s would cover the severely mentally ill making up to 100 percent, which is about $24,000 a year for a family of four.\n\nMcAuliffe recently received federal approval to spend $13 million to pay for a GAP pilot program through June 30, the end of the fiscal year. But the GOP-controlled legislature would have to approve continuing the program in the next fiscal year.\n\nRepublicans have questioned McAuliffe\u2019s authority to create a new program without legislative consent as well as the wisdom of enrolling patients with no guarantee that the General Assembly will continue funding their care.\n\nThe House plan suggests that even in an election year, Republicans feel comfortable calling for more spending for mental health \u2014 as long as it is on their terms. The issue was among the most prominent in last year\u2019s legislative session after the November 2013 suicide of Austin \u201cGus\u201d Deeds, the mentally ill son of Sen. Creigh Deeds (D-Bath).\n\nBut GOP lawmakers remain wary of anything that could be construed as expansion of Medi\u00adcaid under the federal health-care law.\n\n\u201cExpanding Medicaid is the wrong approach,\u201d said Appropriations Committee Vice Chairman Steve Landes (R-Augusta). \u201cIt relies on the false promise of free federal money and creates a new welfare entitlement system for able-bodied working adults. Our approach increases access to existing services for the neediest Virginians.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers are quick to note differences between their proposal and the governor\u2019s Medicaid efforts.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Lawmakers are quick to note differences between their proposal and the governor\u2019s Medicaid efforts.", "title": "Va.
