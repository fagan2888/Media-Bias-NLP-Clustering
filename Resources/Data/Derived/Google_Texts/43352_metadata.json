LM Otero/AP As Obamacare\u2019s second open enrollment season barrels to a close on Sunday, nearly [\u2026]\n\nAs Obamacare\u2019s second open enrollment season barrels to a close on Sunday, nearly a million Texans have purchased or applied for health insurance. Instead of going it alone, many applicants this time have turned to insurance brokers, who are aggressively marketing their services as savvy guides to Obamacare. It\u2019s a big change for the brokers, who have long had an uneasy relationship with the federal health law.\n\n\n\nBart Franco in the chapel next to his home in Houston. Carrie Feibel/Houston Public Media\n\nBart Franco is one customer who sought help from a licensed broker this round. He is the pastor of a community church that he founded in a garage behind his house near downtown Houston.\n\nAt age 65, Franco is retired and covered by Medicare, but needed to buy insurance for his wife and son. When he tried to enroll them in an Affordable Care Act health plan last year, he got nowhere.\n\n\u201cFirst, I called the 1-800 number,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd I was on hold for 40 minutes and just hung up \u2014 gave up. I\u2019m not going to put up with that.\u201d\n\nFranco missed the 2014 deadline to get insurance on HealthCare.gov. He later called an insurance company directly \u2014 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas \u2014 and succeeded in purchasing a short-term catastrophic health plan for his family. But he felt the process was rushed.\n\n\u201cThey just give you \u2026 insurance,\u201d Franco says, and tell you \u201d \u2018It costs this much, and you only pay $146 (a month).\u2019 That sounds good, doesn\u2019t it? OK, fine. You\u2019re hooked, and you don\u2019t even know what you have.\u201d\n\nFranco didn\u2019t like the plan\u2019s high deductible, which was more than he made in a year.\n\nSo this year, when enrollment began again for 2015 plans, he turned to Jo Middleton, a licensed insurance broker who had advertised in the local paper.\n\n\u201cShe connected us on the computer,\u201d Franco says. \u201cShe showed us everything; showed us a deduction, why we didn\u2019t want this and why we didn\u2019t want that. So she explained everything.\u201d\n\nFranco\u2019s rough experience last year was common, says Middleton, who is also president of the Houston Association of Health Underwriters. People struggled to pick plans on their own in 2014, using the HealthCare.gov website. Many only learned later that they couldn\u2019t afford the deductible. Others discovered that their favorite doctor or hospital wasn\u2019t accepting a particular plan.\n\n\u201cBuying an insurance policy is not like going online and buying a vacation,\u201d Middleton says. \u201cIt\u2019s much more complicated. There are a lot more nuances.\u201d\n\nMany brokers say the federal health law sidelined them from its inception, with marketing that focused on the navigators and the federal website.Some shoppers turned to government-funded navigators for help \u2014 but there are fewer than 500 of them in Texas, compared to more than 190,000 health insurance agents.\n\nLast year, Houston brokers worked individually to help consumers. But now they\u2019re uniting to assert their expertise and market themselves. Middleton has organized two enrollment events featuring brokers from the Houston Association of Health Underwriters.\n\n\n\nA brochure by insurance brokers in Texas offering to help sign up people for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Courtesy of Houston Association of Health Underwriters\n\nBrokers across Texas are trying multiple strategies: holding events with hospitals and community groups, putting up fliers and even buying TV ads.\n\nThe agents say the health law\u2019s impact on them has been mixed.\n\nOn the one hand, the law created a whole new market of potential customers for insurance agents, who get paid a commission every time they sign up one of those people for a new health policy.\n\nBut the brokers also say their commissions have been cut. That\u2019s because the law puts a cap on insurance companies\u2019 profits; some companies have avoided that squeeze on their own profit by reducing the agents\u2019 commissions as well.\n\nMarcy Buckner is with the National Association of Health Underwriters in D.C.\n\n\u201cThis has just kind of devastated the agent community, and has been in place for several years,\u201d Buckner says.\n\nHer association is backing a bill in the new Congress that would help insurance agents and brokers with those reduced commissions.\n\nIn the meantime, Buckner says, brokers have had to adjust.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some agents who have been able to really work the new opportunities that they\u2019ve had in the marketplace,\u201d she says. They\u2019ve \u201ccontinued to grow their business, and have succeeded very well, while the others have still been struggling under this cut in commissions.\u201d\n\nAnd some brokers have to switch their focus to Medicare policies or to health plans for small businesses.\n\nIt\u2019s too early for any exact numbers on how many brokers stayed in the game, or how many people they signed up. What is clear, a few days before the deadline, is that more than 9 million people have signed up or re-enrolled this year. And about 1 in 10 of those people is from Texas.\n\nThis story is part of NPR\u2019s reporting partnership with Houston Public Media and Kaiser Health News.
