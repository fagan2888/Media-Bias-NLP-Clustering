WaPo poll: Current GOP lead on the economy much larger than in 2010

Lots of poll posts around these parts lately, and here’s another one. (You’re welcome). This should worry Democrats:

The challenge for the president and his party: Win back the political high ground, which Republicans have seized on the economy for the first time in nearly 12 years. That should come as troubling news for president and his party 9 1/2 months before election day. Americans trust Republicans more than Democrats to do a better job handling the economy 44 percent to 37 percent, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. It’s the first time since 2002 that Republicans have sported a meaningful advantage, and larger than any edge congressional Republicans have held over Obama during his administration. Perhaps even more striking: The numbers mark a mirror image reversal from the eve of the 2010 midterms, when Republican picked up a historic 63 House seats. In October of 2010, Democrats held an identical 44-37 advantage.

Feast your eyes:

During the home stretch of the 2010 campaign, Democrats held a seven-point advantage over Republicans on the economy in the Washington Post/ABC News poll. And then this happened. The same poll now shows a 14-point swing in the GOP’s direction on the issue, as compared to the October ’10 survey. Factor in similar Obamacare headwinds, and perhaps this outcome isn’t quite as far-fetched as it may seem. It’s numbers like these that lead me to believe that Obama’s political team has basically thrown in the towel on Democrats winning back both houses of Congress, hence the forthcoming power grab-palooza.
