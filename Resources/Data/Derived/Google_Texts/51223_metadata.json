Kay Hagan.\n\n(Watch the full ad here.)\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s on the ballot in North Carolina this year? One person knows the answer,\u201d the ad begins.\n\nThe ad cuts to a shot of President Obama.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on the ballot this fall,\" the president says. \"Michelle\u2019s pretty happy about that. But make no mistake, these policies are on the ballot, every single one of them.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the ad is all about Hagan.\n\n\u201cThe Obama policies are on the ballot in the U.S. Senate race. Kay Hagan voted for Obamacare. She voted for Obama\u2019s Supreme Court judges. She stood behind Obama on foreign policy, immigration and energy, too. Kay Hagan votes with Obama 96 percent of the time,\u201d the ad says.\n\nThis is a true claim. In 2013, Hagan voted in favor of President Obama's positions \"96 percent of the time,\" according to legislative tracking service Congressional Quarterly. CQ has reported that Hagan voted with the president on health care reform, Supreme Court nominees, foreign policy, immigration and energy.\n\nHowever, Tillis' ad fails to mention that last year, Hagan \"went against the grain of her own party more often than all but three of her Democratic colleagues.\" According to CQ, Hagan opposed gun control and sequestration. She also sided with Republicans on the issue of whether to keep Guantanamo Bay open.\n\nWhy is Hagan's voting record the focus of Tillis' new ad?\n\n\"If you want to stop the Obama policies, you have to replace Kay Hagan,\" the ad concludes.\n\nPolitical observers say Tillis hopes to capitalize on new polling numbers that show President Obama's approval rating at an all-time low of 40 percent. The same poll found GOP voters are more likely to vote in the mid-term elections. Hence, Tillis is trying to reinforce the notion that a vote for his opponent is a vote for President Obama.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Thu, 16 Oct 2014 12:06:59 EDT", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Tim Waller", "og": {"site_name": "WYFF4", "description": "In his latest ad, North Carolina U.S. Senate hopeful Thom Tillis attacks his Democratic rival's voting record.
