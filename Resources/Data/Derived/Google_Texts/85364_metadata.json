Mike Sinkeldam, a principal for Mercer's Health and Benefits practice, explained that Internal Revenue Code section 4980I, as enacted by the ACA, imposes a 40% nondeductible excise tax on employers, health insurance issuers, and/or other entities administering health plan benefits if the aggregate value of \u201capplicable employer-sponsored coverage\u201d exceeds a specified annual dollar limit.\n\n\u201cAs health plan sponsors, you really need to start thinking seriously about how this impending tax will impact your business,\u201d Sinkeldam warned. \u201cWill you have to cut down on the rich end of your plan spectrum? If you don\u2019t and your plan triggers the tax in 2018 or later, is this cost going to get passed on to employees or be absorbed by the employer?\u201d\n\nOne important fact about the excise tax to consider is that the maximum value threshold applies to any group health plan that is made available to an employee by an employer and \u201cis excludable from the employee\u2019s gross income under IRC Section 106, or would be so excludable if it were employer-provided coverage [within the meaning of IRC Section 106].\u201d Thus, both the employer- and employee-paid portions of premiums are taken into account.\n\nThe excise tax applies to both third-party insured and self-funded plans, Sinkeldam observed, as well as governmental plans and coverage that provides health insurance to self-employed individuals. According to Mike Boucher, Health and Benefits Solutions Leader at Mercer, the impending tax sets a pretty challenging value bar for plan sponsors of all types to hit.\n\n\u201cJust considering that costs have increased by 3% to 8% annually for the last decade or longer, it\u2019s really not hard to imagine a large number of plans running into the excise tax come 2018,\u201d Boucher said, \u201cEven if they are operating today below the threshold, that doesn\u2019t mean they will still be fine two or three years down the road.\u201d\n\nNEXT: Addressing ACA requirements", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Fees, Healthcare", "Description": "After this year health care plan sponsors will only have two\r\nmore open enrollment periods to make changes before the introduction of the much-maligned\r\n\u201cACA Cadillac Tax.\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "article_summary": "The firm hosted a webcast Wednesday on preparing for employee health plan open enrollment for the 2016 plan year, noting the excise tax under the ACA is looming large.\nThe excise tax applies to both third-party insured and self-funded plans, Sinkeldam observed, as well as governmental plans and coverage that provides health insurance to self-employed individuals.\n\u201cAs health plan sponsors, you really need to start thinking seriously about how this impending tax will impact your business,\u201d Sinkeldam warned.\nNow is the time for health plan sponsors to consider how they will confront the excise tax programmed into the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), according to Mercer experts.\nAccording to Mike Boucher, Health and Benefits Solutions Leader at Mercer, the impending tax sets a pretty challenging value bar for plan sponsors of all types to hit."}
