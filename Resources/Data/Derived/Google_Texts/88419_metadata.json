WardsAuto, which tracks production data, expects the rate to increase to 1 in 4 by 2020.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. South and Mexico are winning the battle,\u201d said Dennis DesRosiers, president of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants near Toronto. \u201cOver half the capacity and 80 percent to 90 percent of investment dollars are going to the U.S. South or Mexico.\u201d\n\nConversely, he sees the Canadian auto industry dwindling to five automakers with a single assembly plant each over the next decade or two \u2014 or about half its current manufacturing footprint.\n\nThe auto industry is global, but increasingly companies want to build in the region where they sell. Which means chances are your new vehicle will continue to be built in North America but may not be made in the U.S.A.\n\nBack in 2004, 11.6 million vehicles were built in the U.S., or 74 percent of the 15.8 million industry total. Canada built 2.7 million, or 17 percent of the capacity; and Mexico contributed only 1.4 million vehicles, or 9 percent, according to WardsAuto.\n\nIn 2014, signs were evident the tide had turned.\n\nMexico\u2019s production had more than doubled to 3.2 million units, or 19 percent of the 16.9 million industry total. It came at the expense of the U.S., which dipped to 11.4 million units, or 67 percent; and Canada, which was down to 2.4 million, or 14 percent.\n\nAnd the trend will continue. Wards forecasts new plants will add 1.2 million units of capacity in North America by 2020 and it is not evenly split.\n\nSouthern migration\n\nVirtually every automaker is adding capacity in Mexico. The country is a \u201cmassive untapped market\u201d that could grow by another 1 million to 2 million vehicles a year, DesRosiers said.\n\nBy 2020, Mexico is expected to build 1 in 4 vehicles in a North American industry of 18.6 million units. The U.S. will hold its own at two-thirds of the output, or 12.2 million vehicles. Canada is the big loser, down to 1.6 million vehicles and 9 percent of the output.\n\nIn 2014, automakers announced $18.25 billion in additional investments in North America. The breakdown: almost $10.5 billion for the U.S., $7 billion in new projects for Mexico, and a single $750-million project for Canada, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.\n\nThat is on top of the 18 plants already in Mexico, and there are at least five more planned or under construction. Mexico has seen a 40 percent increase in auto jobs since 2008 to 675,000 last year, while the U.S. saw only a 15 percent increase in the same period to more than 900,000.\n\nThe supply base also has improved its quality, said Haig Stoddard, industry analyst for WardsAuto. \u201cThe litmus test was when Toyota said it would build there,\u201d a reference to the company\u2019s strict standards.\n\nThe domestic market continues to grow, and Mexico\u2019s ports and its trade agreements with 45 counties have helped establish it as a strong export hub to Europe and South America as well as the rest of North America. By contrast, the U.S. has about 20 trade agreements, and Canada also has but a fraction of Mexico\u2019s pacts.\n\n\u201cMexico bested us on trade agreements,\u201d said Sandra Pupatello, a former Canadian politician who now oversees business development for PwC Canada in Toronto as well as the Windsor-Essex Economic Development Corp. \u201cThey quietly have been negotiating trade agreements with the world.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., Northern states are gaining third shifts at existing plants while the South is getting investment in new plants and the thousands of jobs that come with them.\n\nBy 2019, the U.S. South will have about 5 million units of capacity, almost catching up to the North, where the Midwest is not expected to grow much beyond the more than 6 million now, said Michael Robinet, managing director of IHS Automotive Consulting.\n\nThat is astounding given the history of how the auto industry developed.\n\nThe U.S. auto industry started in Detroit more than a century ago and the predominance of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler were such that they became known as the \u201cBig Three.\u201d\n\nProduction was centered in the Midwest and Michigan in particular \u2014 spilling over into neighboring Canada. It wasn\u2019t until foreign automakers decided to build in the U.S. that a new manufacturing base was established in the South. States such as Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia used incentives and a nonunionized workforce to attract automakers seeking a manufacturing toehold in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. will be fine, at least over the next five years,\u201d said Stoddard. \u201cProduction will stay here, especially of larger vehicles. There will be a lot of new capacity in the South, and it is needed. The North will hum along at current levels for the next five years.\u201d\n\nChanging economics\n\nThe pros and cons of each country keep changing.\n\nEveryone wanted to build in Canada until a few decades ago, when Mexico emerged as the attractive low-cost region. Then Mexico lost some of its edge in 2000 because its costs were about 11 times more than China, said Peter Hall, chief economist with Export Development Canada.\n\nBut wages have been rising about 19 percent a year in China\u2019s coastal regions while costs have remained flat in Mexico. The end result is that Mexico\u2019s labor costs are only slightly higher than China and in some instances they approach parity.\n\nWithin North America, labor costs in northern U.S. states are close to $60 an hour; the South is closer to $40 an hour, and Mexico is less than $10. Canada is even higher, said Hall. The average Mexican will work up to 450 hours more than an American every year, earning less than a fifth of the pay, according to the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development.\n\nBut labor is only one of the factors in play when automakers are deciding where to invest. They must be balanced against the productivity and product quality of a trained workforce. There are logistics such as roads, ports, rail access, crime rates, security issues and trade pacts.\n\nIt used to be simple: The U.S. had higher labor costs but quality made up for it. Canada offset some of its costs with universal health care, a weaker dollar, productivity and quality. Mexico had problems with quality and productivity, but wages were much lower.\n\nFast forward to today. With new entry-level wages in the U.S., union-run health-care trusts and the Affordable Care Act, labor costs have come down. Canada has become a higher-cost nation. Mexico continues to mature, increasing its quality and output to meet greater demand at home and abroad.\n\nFord\u2019s Stephen Odell, head of global sales and marketing, adds a cautionary note. \u201cMexico has a lot of capacity going in. At some point, labor rates will go up as a result.\u201d\n\nMexico\u2019s political landscape also has to be weighed, Stoddard says. It is still not the safest of countries and there is corruption.\n\nHonda experienced growing pains in Mexico, where it has built a new plant to manufacture the subcompact Fit and new HR-V crossover.\n\n\u201cLooking back, we were probably a little more optimistic than we should have been in Mexico,\u201d said John Mendel, Honda executive vice president of Automobile Operations. \u201cPrimarily because new plant, new site, new workforce with an average age of 22 and 60 percent don\u2019t have driver\u2019s licenses, new supply base, new transportation system and we expected it all to go like we had just built a new plant in Marysville (Ohio). So we were probably a little bit too optimistic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The United States, Mexico and Canada are fierce rivals in the boardrooms where auto executives decide where to invest in the latest equipment and additional jobs.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "The United States, Mexico and Canada are fierce rivals in the boardrooms where auto executives decide where to invest in the latest equipment and additional jobs.", "title": "Why Mexico is winning the auto-jobs war", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/business/why-mexico-is-winning-the-auto-jobs-war/", "image": {"width": 1560, "identifier": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/96cc0f8a-1c69-11e5-aa61-1a056ac6f648-1560x1040.jpg", "height": 1040}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seattletimes", "description": "The United States, Mexico and Canada are fierce rivals in the boardrooms where auto executives decide where to invest in the latest equipment and additional jobs.", "card": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/96cc0f8a-1c69-11e5-aa61-1a056ac6f648-780x520.jpg", "title": "Why Mexico is winning the auto-jobs war"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-07-04 20:00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-02 15:25:26"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Business, Economy, International Trade, Local Business"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe U.S. South and Mexico are winning the battle,\u201d said Dennis DesRosiers, president of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants near Toronto.\nThe country is a \u201cmassive untapped market\u201d that could grow by another 1 million to 2 million vehicles a year, DesRosiers said.\nMexico\u2019s production had more than doubled to 3.2 million units, or 19 percent of the 16.9 million industry total.\nCanada built 2.7 million, or 17 percent of the capacity; and Mexico contributed only 1.4 million vehicles, or 9 percent, according to WardsAuto.\nThe auto industry is global, but increasingly companies want to build in the region where they sell."}
