But after the P85D racked up a score of 103, Consumer Reports was forced to create a new benchmark for the system and overhaul the ratings process according to a news release. The new system caused the car to slip to a score of 100.\n\nA few characteristics of the car that allowed it to perform better in the test than any other car ever before include its rapid acceleration ability (0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds), its remarkable energy-efficiency (the car gets the equivalent of 87 miles per gallon) and its better breaking and handling system than the former top-scoring standard Model S. Two years ago, the base model version of the Model S received a 99 out of 100, which at the time was the highest rating ever for a vehicle.\n\nRelated: Why Americans Are Keeping Their Cars Longer Than Ever\n\nThe report is careful to note that even with a perfect score, the Tesla isn\u2019t a perfect car. Besides a price tag of $127,820, beyond the means of the average person and the most expensive car Consumer Reports has ever reviewed, the car is louder than the base Model S and isn\u2019t as plush as other luxury vehicles.\n\nIn addition, a long drive might be problematic if there aren\u2019t any nearby charging stations along the route due to the vehicle\u2019s 200-plus mile range. The rating also doesn\u2019t account for the Tesla\u2019s reliability, but the Model S comes with average reliability, according to owner-survey responses.\n\nImperfections aside, the car received an enviable final assessment. \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable car that paves a new, unorthodox course, and it\u2019s a powerful statement of American startup ingenuity,\u201d the report reads.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Tesla Model S P85D sedan just broke the Consumer Reports rating system.
