First, at the 2014 Billboard Women in Music Luncheon at Cipriani Wall Street, where an incredible highlight was watching Aretha Franklin sing Ms. Swift an impromptu \u201cHappy Birthday.\n\nThen to close out her 24th year, Ms. Swift was the headliner of Z100\u2019s Jingle Ball, performing until just after midnight, ringing in her birthday on stage at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThere was a surprising amount of overlap at these two events, which goes a long way to show that dynamic ladies are having a particularly exciting year in music.\n\nAmong the other honorees at the lunch, besides Ms. Swift, who also performed at Jingle Ball, were the 21-year-old pop star Ariana Grande; the 20-year-old, Nantucket-born Meghan Trainor, whose \u201cAll About that Bass\u201d was a huge hit this year; the British singer Jessie J; the 24-year-old Australian recording artist Iggy Azalea; and the 22-year-old Brit Charli XCX, who is perhaps best known for her song \u201cBoom Clap.\u201d\n\nThis was a long event. It started at 11 a.m., with about 90 minutes of milling about, and we weren\u2019t out the door until around 3 p.m., after a panel discussion with the honorees (moderated by Matt Lauer) that ended with Ms. Franklin\u2019s serenade, plus a selfie in homage to Ellen DeGeneres at the Oscars.\n\nENLARGE Beyonc\u00e9 and Lee Anne Callahan-Longo Getty Images\n\nENLARGE Idina Menzel and Savannah Guthrie Getty Images\n\nBut this was a full meal: performances by Jessie J, Ingrid Michaelson, Colbie Caillat and Hayley Williams of Paramore, and impassioned, girl-power speeches by nearly everyone.\n\n\u201cI wrote this down because I was afraid I would make eye contact with Beyonc\u00e9 and forget everything,\u201d said Ms. Williams.\n\nDid we mention Beyonc\u00e9 was there, too?\n\nIdina Menzel was recognized by the magazine as achieving the \u201cbreakthrough of the year,\u201d for her monster hit rendition of \u201cLet It Go\u201d from \u201cFrozen.\u201d Ms. Menzel said that it was a little bit strange to be considered \u201ca breakthrough artist at 43.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much about a breakthrough publicly, but a personal breakthrough,\u201d she said.\n\nThrough years of both success and \u201cobscurity with no work,\u201d she\u2019d been asked the question \u201cWhat kind of artist are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the resounding answer at the age of 43 is \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 \u201d she explained, adding that it had taken her this long to realize that it isn\u2019t good to be able to easily categorize and describe yourself. It\u2019s about, like her hit song, following \u201cmy heart and my gut and my truth.\u201d\n\nIt sounds a little cheesy in retrospect, but in the moment Ms. Menzel\u2019s sentiments felt genuinely unmanufactured and like, well, a breakthrough.\n\nENLARGE Iggy Azalea and Taylor Swift WireImage\n\nENLARGE Ariana Grande WireImage\n\nENLARGE Jessie J and Meghan Trainor Getty Images\n\nIf the Billboard luncheon was about stepping into maturity, that evening\u2019s Jingle Ball, as per usual, was about trying to remain a kid.\n\nThis year\u2019s lineup felt particularly strong. Besides the aforementioned artists, others on the bill included Pharrell Williams (who did a song with Gwen Stefani), Maroon 5, Sam Smith, and OneRepublic. Because of those more mature acts, the audience, while still comprised of lots of children, appeared to skew a little bit to the older side. But old fogies like us can still enjoy what the young folks listen to, right?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing [Jingle Ball] for 10 years,\u201d said Adam Levine, who was wearing a red flannel shirt, \u201cwhich means we\u2019re older than some of you.\u201d\n\nBecause the bill is so long\u2014it starts at 8 p.m., ends just after midnight\u2014each act has to keep it short. It\u2019s like a pu-pu platter of pop music.\n\n\u201cThank you for spending 15 minutes with us,\u201d said Ryan Tedder, the lead singer of OneRepublic after his set.\n\nThere are always things at Jingle Ball that make no sense. Why, for instance, should the D.J. Calvin Harris perform if he\u2019s just going to stand behind a booth, with headphones and say \u201cThis time, I want to see you go crazy, New York,\u201d in between playing his hits \u201cSummer\u201d and \u201cBlame?\u201d\n\nBut there are so many pleasures, too, that you can\u2019t criticize Ms. Swift for wanting to celebrate her birthday at Jingle Ball. Some of the best things include a) no B-sides, b) watching little tots who know all the words sing along to songs like \u201cBlack Widow\u201d by Ms. Izalea, with Rita Ora, and c) reading the tweets as they go by on the Jumbotron.\n\n\u201cAdam Levine, be my husband please,\u201d read one, to the Maroon 5 singer. \u201cWe\u2019re both wearing flannel so I think we should get together and have great looking, flannel-wearing children,\u201d said another. Talk about swoon.\n\nWrite to Marshall Heyman at marshall.heyman@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-12-15T01:30:00.000Z", "article.section": "US", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "It was a big weekend for the singer/songwriter Taylor Swift\u2014she was honored at the Billboard Women in Music Luncheon and turned 25 on stage at the Jingle Ball Saturday.", "title": "Taylor Swift Takes New York on Her Birthday Weekend", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FZ909_NYSCEN_G_20141214131807.jpg", "alt": "Taylor Swift takes New York on her birthday weekend.", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FZ909_NYSCEN_D_20141214131807.jpg"}, "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB12096357918852044289404580337260825119230&headline=Taylor%20Swift%20takes%20New%20York%20on%20her%20birthday%20weekend.&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB12096357918852044289404580337260825119230"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "adam levine,ariana grande,beyonce,iggy azalea,jessie j,jingle ball,maroon 5,meghan trainor,taylor swift,taylor swift's birthday,political,general news,celebrity news,gossip,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,music,interviews,musician interviews", "news_keywords": "adam levine,ariana grande,beyonce,iggy azalea,jessie j,jingle ball,maroon 5,meghan trainor,taylor swift,taylor swift's birthday", "article.headline": "Taylor Swift takes New York on her birthday weekend.", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FZ909_NYSCEN_E_20141214131807.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FZ909_NYSCEN_D_20141214131807.jpg"}}, "description": "It was a big weekend for the singer/songwriter Taylor Swift\u2014she was honored at the Billboard Women in Music Luncheon and turned 25 on stage at the Jingle Ball Saturday.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB12096357918852044289404580337260825119230&headline=Taylor%20Swift%20takes%20New%20York%20on%20her%20birthday%20weekend.&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB12096357918852044289404580337260825119230", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "New York", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "It was a big weekend for the singer/songwriter Taylor Swift\u2014she was honored at the Billboard Women in Music Luncheon and turned 25 on stage at the Jingle Ball Saturday.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-12-15T01:30:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-c642", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"internal_link_count": 2, "image_count": 6, "word_count": 801, "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "It was a big weekend for the singer/songwriter Taylor Swift\u2014she was honored at the Billboard Women in Music Luncheon and turned 25 on stage at the Jingle Ball Saturday.", "title": "Taylor Swift Takes New York on Her Birthday Weekend", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/taylor-swift-takes-new-york-on-her-birthday-weekend-1418607013", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FZ909_NYSCEN_G_20141214131807.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Marshall Heyman", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Taylor Swift Takes New York on Her Birthday Weekend", "article.type": "NY Heard & Scene", "article.id": "SB12096357918852044289404580337260825119230", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-12-15T01:30:00.000Z"}, "article_summary": "ENLARGE Janice Min and Taylor Swift at the Billboard Women in Music Luncheon WireImageIt was a big weekend for the singer/songwriter Taylor Swift\u2014she turned 25 on Saturday.\nSwift was the headliner of Z100\u2019s Jingle Ball, performing until just after midnight, ringing in her birthday on stage at Madison Square Garden.\nSwift for wanting to celebrate her birthday at Jingle Ball.\nThere are always things at Jingle Ball that make no sense.\nENLARGE Iggy Azalea and Taylor Swift WireImageENLARGE Ariana Grande WireImageENLARGE Jessie J and Meghan Trainor Getty ImagesIf the Billboard luncheon was about stepping into maturity, that evening\u2019s Jingle Ball, as per usual, was about trying to remain a kid."}
