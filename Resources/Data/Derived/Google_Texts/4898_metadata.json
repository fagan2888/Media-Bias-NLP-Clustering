I love my Church and I love Pope Francis and my trip to the Vatican last year was a highlight of my life. Being blessed by Francis in St. Peter\u2019s Square is something I will never forget.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nI should also add that one of the things I love about the Catholic Church is our disagreements. The last thing I want to do is sit in a Church that doesn\u2019t spiritually or politically challenge me.\n\nNevertheless, until I learned this morning that Francis visited with the Little Sisters of the Poor, the nuns suing the Obama administration for relief from the persecution of a law (ObamaCare) that forces Catholics to violate their conscience, I was beyond frustrated with this Pope.\n\nAs our own government gives hundreds of millions of dollars to Planned Parenthood, an organization that butchers millions of innocent babies and sells off their body parts, the Pope ignoring that issue (and I hope the Holy Father will eventually address it) in favor of the unicorn of Global Warming is an abomination.\n\nAnd when I live in a country where the poor have air conditioning and cable bills and iPhones and an obesity problem, with all due respect, the Pope\u2019s attacks on capitalism are anti-science. Nothing has done more to lift the poor out of true poverty than free enterprise. If you want to see where true poverty still exists, visit a socialist country \u2014 any country where the government has \u201csolved\u201d wealth inequality.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the issue of immigration.\n\nPope Francis urged Catholic bishops in the United States to open their doors to immigrants, asserting that \u201cthese people will enrich America and its Church.\u201d As a Latin American, the Pope apologized for \u201cpleading my own case,\u201d when speaking about the influx of Hispanic immigrants into the United States. He also thanked the bishops for the work they have done for immigrants in this country. \u2026 \u201cPerhaps you will be challenged by their diversity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut know that they also possess resources meant to be shared. So do not be afraid to welcome them.\u201d The Pope also urged the bishops to offer immigrants \u201cthe warmth of the love of Christ.\u201d\n\nAgain, I mean no disrespect but this is coming from a man who lives in a city-state completely surrounded, literally, by giant walls. Vatican City is a literal fortress.\n\nWhat would happen to Vatican City if it was to do what Francis is asking America to do?\n\nI\u2019m assuming Pope Francis could order such a thing tomorrow, and after the walls came down he could also choose to greet the wave of \u201cpilgrims\u201d with the \u201cwarmth of the love of Christ.\u201d\n\nOf course Pope Francis would never do such a thing because he knows what would happen: Vatican City would be no more, everyone\u2019s security and well-being would be compromised, and the standard of living for close to a thousand residents would be destroyed. Chaos would completely destroy the home of St. Peter.\n\nJust as the loss of Vatican City would be detrimental to the world, so too will the loss of an America as we know it if our culture and free enterprise system is exploded into a giant welfare state by waves of immigrants embraced by mercenary, power-hungry Democrats desperate to use them to increase the power of the State.\n\nVatican City\u2019s walls allow the Vatican to save itself in order to hold tight to an invaluable culture that exports its generosity and charity and missionary work. Vatican City cannot take everyone in and survive. And it must remain Vatican City or be destroyed at the expense of all the incalculable good it does.\n\nBy all means, Pope Francis should push and prod and even shame America and Americans to give and give and give and give. We should do whatever we can to help the refugees in the Middle East and do whatever we can to influence and help Mexico and its people.\n\nBut we cannot do that if we\u2019re no longer America.\n\nAnd all I\u2019m asking is that for the good of the world Pope Francis allow America the same border security the home of no less than St. Peter enjoys.\n\nMy Church challenges me. It\u2019s something I invite. With love in my heart this is me, a faithful follower, gently pushing back.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pope Francis: Tear Down the Vatican Wall!", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Pope Francis: Tear Down the Vatican Wall!", "title": "Pope Francis: Tear Down the Vatican Wall! - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/1422298814751.jpg", "height": 960}, "updated_time": "2015-09-24T10:24:55-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2015/09/24/pope-francis-tear-down-the-vatican-wall/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pope Francis: Tear Down the Vatican Wall!", "title": "Pope Francis: Tear Down the Vatican Wall! - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/1422298814751.jpg", "creator": "@noltenc", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "immigration, Pope Francis visits US, Vatican,2016 Presidential Race, Faith,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-09-24T07:31:20-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-09-24T10:24:55-07:00", "tag": "Vatican", "categories": "2016 Presidential Race,Faith"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I love my Church and I love Pope Francis and my trip to the Vatican last year was a highlight of my life.\nAnd it must remain Vatican City or be destroyed at the expense of all the incalculable good it does.\nWhat would happen to Vatican City if it was to do what Francis is asking America to do?\nBy all means, Pope Francis should push and prod and even shame America and Americans to give and give and give and give.\nAnd all I\u2019m asking is that for the good of the world Pope Francis allow America the same border security the home of no less than St. Peter enjoys."}
