SEASIDE HEIGHTS — Gov. Chris Christie was back in Seaside today, and he gave a brief update on the damage assessment to Thursday’s fiery destruction of parts of the boardwalk in Seaside Park and Seaside Heights.

Standing just two blocks north of the fire line, where the flames finally stopped, he told reporters that while he didn’t want to minimize the losses, he was relieved the damage was contained.

“This could have been significantly worse,” he said, before heading off to a private meeting with his cabinet and local business owners.

Christie said that although he spoke to business owners Thursday night as they watched their shops burn to the ground, this afternoon will be the first time he’ll be meeting all of them "face-to-face.”

“We’re going to take a few questions and then we’re going to get to work,” he said.

Spurred by 30 mph winds, the fire, which took nine hours to be extinguished, burned down or significantly damaged dozens of small businesses along the boardwalk that had been recently rebuilt after Hurricane Sandy.

“For those people on those four blocks, it’s awful,” Christie said. “But we could have lost all of this.”

Seaside Heights Police Chief Thomas Boyd estimated the damage will likely be between $5 million and $10 million.

Christie received a warm reception from locals and onlookers at the boardwalk.

“Most people are just saying ‘thank you for being here,’” he said. “It’s what this job is all about.”

The governor canceled a trip to Florida with his wife Mary Pat, whose birthday is Sunday.

“She’s a champ,” he said of his wife. “We both also know this is the job.”
