Not much, according to the department\u2019s written decision.\n\nThe couple who testified, Arleen and Marc Sandy Block, said the insurance premiums were already unaffordable for their young adult son, who works seven days a week at a nonprofit. Arleen Block spoke of hours wasted trying to fix administrative glitches with the coverage and the struggle their son faced getting a prescription filled.\n\nBut the actuary who oversaw the hearing and reviewed the proposal, Paul Lombardo, wrote that affordability and service problems aren\u2019t grounds regulators can use to deny a rate increase.\n\nHis 30-page proposed decision, which Insurance Commissioner Thomas B. Leonardi adopted, included comments critical of the value of the public hearing, particularly compared to the department's usual practice for handling proposed rate hikes.\n\nAnd so, even as the outcome won praise from state officials, the comments included in the decision reignited a longstanding dispute between the insurance regulator and consumer advocates over what role public hearings play, if any, in determining how much health insurance costs.\n\nWhat goes into rate decisions\n\nState Healthcare Advocate Victoria Veltri is among those who believe public hearings can influence the insurance department\u2019s decisions and are crucial to ensuring public confidence in the rate review process. She\u2019s sought legislation to require a public hearings for certain rate proposals, and said she\u2019ll likely renew the effort.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\nInsurance department officials, by contrast, have characterized public hearings as largely irrelevant to decisions about whether to let companies raise rates. Those decisions, they\u2019ve long maintained, are based on studying the insurers\u2019 calculations and assumptions.\n\nIn his decision, Lombardo noted that state law allows the insurance commissioner to reject rates for three reasons: if they\u2019re inadequate, excessive, or unfairly discriminatory.\n\n\u201cWhile it is reasonable to expect acceptable service delivery when paying for any product, service delivery failures are not factors used in rate review within the statute or standard actuarial principles,\u201d Lombardo wrote, citing concerns raised during the hearing.\n\n\u201cNor is affordability which is relative to each person and subjective, and although of overall concern, is also not a standard for rate review within either the state or federal statutes or standard actuarial principles.\u201d\n\nLombardo determined that Anthem\u2019s proposed rates were excessive, disagreeing with some of the assumptions the company used in calculating its rates.\n\nHe also rejected a rate proposal by UnitedHealthcare and approved an increase for ConnectiCare Benefits plans that was half what the company requested. There was no public hearing on either proposal, although at least one of the factors used in each decision was similar to that used in the Anthem decision.\n\nAre hearings worth it?\n\nRegardless of whether a hearing is held, the insurance department posts insurers' rate requests and correspondence about them online, and allows people to submit comments.\n\nClose to 140 people commented on the Anthem proposal, which showed that the public can make their views known to the department, Lombardo wrote.\n\nAs for the public hearing, Lombardo noted that 48 people attended, aside from parties to the hearing and department officials.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\nThirty-four were media, lobbyists, government staffers or representatives of insurance companies, law firms or medical societies. He described the other 14 as \u201cpublic attendees,\u201d and said 12 were affiliated with special interest or advocacy groups.\n\n\u201cThe unaffiliated general public was represented by one couple speaking about Anthem service problems on behalf of their son,\u201d he wrote, referring to the Blocks.\n\nBut even if a hearing doesn\u2019t draw a crowd of affected customers, is there a downside to holding one?\n\nLombardo suggested there was, writing that he was unable to ask Anthem certain follow-up questions because doing so after the record was closed would require him to give the healthcare advocate\u2019s office a chance to seek more information, and reopen the record and hearing, taking up additional costs and time.\n\nVeltri disagreed, saying the department could have simply left the record open longer initially.\n\nBut Lombardo wrote that the department\u2019s regular process for addressing rate proposals \u201cprovides for more flexibility, more deliberation, and less cost.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, insurance department spokeswoman Donna Tommelleo said in a statement that the agency \u201cunderstands and respects the desire for public input,\" and provides avenues for people to weigh in.\n\nBut, she added, \u201cWhile a hearing provides another venue for the public to express concerns, the final rate disposition would be based on actuarial principles and would not differ.\u201d\n\n'This has real impact on people's lives'\n\nVeltri, though, said there are reasons why hearings themselves are important.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\nThey give the public confidence in the process used to evaluate rates -- something that\u2019s especially important now that people are required by law to have coverage, she said.\n\nHaving a third party, like her office, participate in hearings means they can cross-examine the insurance company officials, not just submit written comments. Veltri noted that Lombardo requested certain information from Anthem after others asked questions during the hearing.\n\nAnd people who weigh in might raise issues that influence the department\u2019s decision, she said. Some people at the hearing raised questions about whether Anthem\u2019s assumptions about medical costs and members\u2019 health care needs were accurate.\n\n\u201cIf you want consumers to be engaged in their health care and you want consumers to not complain about the rates they\u2019re paying for their health care because it\u2019s a valid price for a premium that they have to pay, you need to offer them an opportunity to understand how the process works,\u201d Veltri said. \u201cAnd there really isn\u2019t that opportunity without a hearing.\u201d\n\nVeltri requested the hearing on Anthem\u2019s proposal under the terms of a 2011 agreement with Insurance Commissioner Thomas B. Leonardi. They reached the agreement -- which calls for holding up to four public hearings per year, at Veltri\u2019s request, on proposals to raise rates by 15 percent or more -- after Gov. Dannel P. Malloy vetoed a bill that would have required a public vetting process for proposed hikes of at least 10 percent. The Insurance Department disagreed that the agreement would have covered Veltri\u2019s request, but held the hearing.\n\nAttorney General George Jepsen, whose office represented the healthcare advocate during the hearing, said public hearings are commonplace in the setting of electric and water rates.\n\n\u201cIn every other context that I\u2019m aware of, it\u2019s an expected and reasonable part of the process,\u201d he said.\n\nA former legislator, Jepsen said he\u2019s sat through many public hearings that went late into the night, and said there\u2019s a value to letting people come in and express themselves, even if they stray off topic.\n\n\u201cFor 66,000 people, this is a very significant issue of real cost to them, and part of what makes a democracy function is when people feel like they have the opportunity to take part in the process and express themselves,\u201d Jepsen said. \u201cThis is not simply a bureaucratic function. This has real impact on real people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nDid the public hearing influence the outcome in the Anthem case?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to me to speculate as to what might have been different or would\u2019ve been different if it had been decided completely behind closed doors,\u201d Jepsen said.\n\nThe previous public hearing was in 2010, when Anthem sought a 19.9 percent rate increase, which the department rejected. The hearing officer wrote that while many people testified about affordability concerns, that wasn\u2019t a basis on which he could make a decision.\n\nOn other rate proposals that weren\u2019t subject to public hearings, the department has taken a mix of actions in recent years, approving some and requiring companies to lower their proposed rate hikes in other cases.\n\nVeltri said her concern is about process.\n\n\u201cThe department could do the best review in the world, and actually, I think they did a very good review and I give them credit for that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do think that we\u2019re in an era of maximum transparency and consumer interest being primary.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/08/06/do-public-hearings-influence-what-health-insurance-costs/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Connecticut Insurance Department, insurance, Paul Lombardo, Victoria Veltri", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/08/06/do-public-hearings-influence-what-health-insurance-costs/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "A Fairfield County couple traveled to Hartford in June to urge regulators not to let their son's insurer raise its rates.
