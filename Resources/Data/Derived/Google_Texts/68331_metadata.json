On Friday, he proposed that Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus form a currency union \u2013 a situation similar to that in in the Eurozone, in which all three nations would use a common medium of exchange.\n\nPutin on Friday met with Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev. After the meeting, he told reporters, \"The time has come to start thinking about forming a currency union.\"\n\nRelated: Putin Again Begs Oligarchs to Bring Their Money Home\n\nNeither Lukashenko nor Nazarbayev commented on the question of combining with Russia under a single currency, but it seems safe to say that they are likely to be dubious at best.\n\nThe benefits of a joint currency would include removing foreign exchange risk on the substantial trade among the three countries, which at the beginning of the year formed the Eurasian Economic Union (other participants include Armenia and, eventually Kyrgyzstan).\n\nThe EEU, sort of a junior version of the European Union, removed many restrictions on cross-border trade and allows free cross-border travel for citizens of member states. The elimination of exchange risk is no small matter at a time when the Russian ruble has lost about 40 percent of its value due to international sanctions related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula and its support of rebels in eastern Ukraine.\n\nTo see the potential dangers of such a Union, particularly one in which one partner is dominant, the presidents of Belarus and Kazakhstan need only look to the southwest to see what is currently happening to Greece.\n\nRelated: Putin Takes His Wacky War Games One Step Further\n\nThe Greek economy was not in great shape when the Great Recession hit, which crippled the country with debt. It never implemented a rigorous tax collection system and growth initiatives that could have immunized the country against collapse. Today, Greece is still struggling to recover.\n\nGermany, on the other hand, is disciplined on all counts and is the dominant economy in the Eurozone. It long resisted measures that might have eased the pain of its weaker neighbors, including lowering interest rates as the U.S. Federal Reserve bank did with considerable success.\n\nThere is no doubt about who would be the dominant partner in such an arrangement. Even given the tough economic times it has been facing, Russia\u2019s $3.6 trillion economy in 2014 was more than six times the size of the combined economies of Kazakhstan\u2019s ($420.6 billion) and Belarus\u2019s ($176.9 billion).\n\nRelated: Putin Comes Out of the Shadows \u2013 With a Bang\n\nUnclear at the moment is whether Putin is proposing the creation of an entirely new currency, or suggesting that the other EEU countries simply adopt the ruble. The latter move, bringing a group of former Soviet Socialist Republics back under the ruble, would be hugely symbolic. Putin, however, would likely have to cede some of the Russian central bank\u2019s control over monetary policy to get his partners to agree.\n\nRussia has also shown no compunction about bullying its EEU partners. It banned food imports from Belarus for a time last year, inciting a trade war. The reason behind the ban was Russia\u2019s belief that Belarussian exporters were re-selling European foodstuffs that Russia had placed under embargo.\n\nHowever, before any of Putin\u2019s partners begin worrying about the details of monetary and trade policy, they will likely want to think seriously about the wisdom of deepening their economic connection to Putin. Tying their very currency to a Russian regime that has shown little concern about transforming itself into an international pariah state, subject to debilitating sanctions, could be a fatal mistake.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Vladimir Putin says that it is time for the three members of the Eurasian Economic Union to begin taking steps toward the creation of a joint currency.
