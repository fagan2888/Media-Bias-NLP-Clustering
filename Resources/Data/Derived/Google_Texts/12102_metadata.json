Blinder said he had spoken to Clinton directly about Glass-Steagall.\n\nThis is a big mistake.\n\nIt\u2019s a mistake politically because people who believe Hillary Clinton is still too close to Wall Street will not be reassured by her position on Glass-Steagall. Many will recall that her husband led the way to repealing Glass Steagall in 1999 at the request of the big Wall Street banks.\n\nIt\u2019s a big mistake economically because the repeal of Glass-Steagall led directly to the 2008 Wall Street crash, and without it we\u2019re in danger of another one.\n\nSome background: During the Roaring Twenties, so much money could be made by speculating on shares of stock that several big Wall Street banks began selling stock along side their traditional banking services \u2013 taking in deposits and making loans.\n\nSome banks went further, lending to pools of speculators that used the money to pump up share prices. The banks sold the shares to their customers, only to have the share prices collapse when the speculators dumped them.\n\nFor the banks, it was an egregious but hugely profitable conflict of interest.\n\nAfter the entire stock market crashed in 1929, ushering in the Great Depression, Washington needed to restore the public\u2019s faith in the banking system. One step was for Congress to enact legislation insuring commercial deposits against bank losses.\n\nAnother was to prevent the kinds of conflicts of interest that resulted in such losses, and which had fueled the boom and subsequent bust. Under the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, banks couldn\u2019t both gamble in the market and also take in deposits and make loans. They\u2019d have to choose between the two.\n\n\u201cThe idea is pretty simple behind this one,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren said a few days ago, explaining her bill to resurrect Glass-Steagall. \u201cIf banks want to engage in high-risk trading \u2014 they can go for it, but they can\u2019t get access to ensured deposits and put the taxpayers on the hook for that reason.\u201d\n\nFor more than six decades after 1933, Glass-Steagall worked exactly as it was intended to. During that long interval few banks failed and no financial panic endangered the banking system.\n\nBut the big Wall Street banks weren\u2019t content. They wanted bigger profits. They thought they could make far more money by gambling with commercial deposits. So they set out to whittle down Glass-Steagall.\n\nFinally, in 1999, President Bill Clinton struck a deal with Republican Senator Phil Gramm to do exactly what Wall Street wanted, and repeal Glass-Steagall altogether.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Will she do Wall Street's bidding or side with the people?", "author": "Robert Reich", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Will she do Wall Street's bidding or side with the people?", "title": "Robert Reich: Hillary Clinton is making \u201ca big mistake\u201d by not reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/18/robert_reich_hillary_clinton_is_making_a_big_mistake_by_not_reinstating_the_glass_steagall_act_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Will she do Wall Street's bidding or side with the people?", "creator": "@rbreich", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "title": "Robert Reich: Hillary Clinton is making \u201ca big mistake\u201d by not reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Robert Reich: Hillary Clinton is making \u201ca big mistake\u201d by not reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Glass-Steagall Act, Hillary Clinton, Robert Reich", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Many will recall that her husband led the way to repealing Glass Steagall in 1999 at the request of the big Wall Street banks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see Glass-Steagall,\u201d Blinder said after her economic speech Monday in which she failed to mention it.\nBut the big Wall Street banks weren\u2019t content.\nIt\u2019s a mistake politically because people who believe Hillary Clinton is still too close to Wall Street will not be reassured by her position on Glass-Steagall.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, Glass-Steagall Act, Hillary Clinton, Robert Reich, News, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Robert Reich's blogHillary Clinton won\u2019t propose reinstating a bank break-up law known as the Glass-Steagall Act \u2013 at least according to Alan Blinder, an economist who has been advising Clinton\u2019s campaign."}
