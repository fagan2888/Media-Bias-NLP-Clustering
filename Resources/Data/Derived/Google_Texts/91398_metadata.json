That\u2019s cheaper than this year\u2019s $279 monthly premium for Blue Cross\u2019 plan. Next year, the Blue Advantage silver HMO plan\u2019s price jumps to $353 a month, they noted.\n\nThe researchers cautioned that in a majority of the marketplace counties across the country where there\u2019s a deal to be had by switching to a cheaper silver plan, consumers will have to change carriers. That may mean having to change doctors or other providers. Consumers also should carefully scrutinize a new plan\u2019s deductible, copayments and drug coverage, they said.\n\n\u201cThe problem with that is people don\u2019t like changing plans,\u201d Austin-based health policy analyst Stacey Pogue, who is with the center-left think tank the Center for Public Policy Priorities, told me last week as I wrote this overview of the Texas marketplace during the current open enrollment period.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pain,\u201d Pogue said. \u201cThere\u2019s a different formulary and a different provider network. But that\u2019s actually how it\u2019s supposed to work. We\u2019re supposed to find the lowest cost one that meets our needs, and we switch to that. We\u2019re just not used to doing that in health care.\u201d\n\nThe Kaiser foundation\u2019s analysis concludes that comparison shopping would pay off in nearly three-quarters of the 2,365 counties served by Healthcare.gov in 36 states. That\u2019s because in these 1,721 counties, the silver plan with the lowest premiums in 2015 is no longer the lowest-cost plan in 2016.\n\nIn North Texas, the emerging picture of the 2016 marketplace is mixed. While in Dallas and Collin counties, consumers have a choice of more plans from more insurers than was true a year ago, that\u2019s not true in Kaufman County.\n\nAs a reader pointed out to me Monday, Blue Cross is the only carrier serving Kaufman, and it\u2019s offering just HMO plans \u2014 12 of them. Last year, there were 43 plans offered on the exchange in Kaufman County by four carriers. Twenty were preferred provider organization plans, five were point of service plans and 18 were HMO plans. Aetna, Cigna Healthcare and Scott and White Health Plan pulled out of Kaufman County for 2016.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8xMS9zdHVkeS1kYWxsYXMtY29sbGluLXNob3BwZXJzLWZhY2UtYmlnZ2VzdC1vYmFtYWNhcmUtcHJpY2UtaGlrZXMtaWYtdGhleS1kb250LXN3aXRjaC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert T.
