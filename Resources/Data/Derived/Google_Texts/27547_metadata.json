He had a box full of unpaid medical bills, a result of uncontrolled diabetes and all the health complications that came with it. He badly needed health insurance, but as a self-employed alarm installer, he could not afford it \u2014 especially since insurers could charge chronically ill people much more before the new law took effect.\n\nThe New York Times started following Mr. Elson in Louisville, Ky., in the months before the law\u2019s new insurance marketplaces opened. Kentucky was the only Southern state to both expand Medicaid for low-income residents and open its own marketplace where others could buy private coverage, often with financial assistance. Would David Elson finally get health insurance, and would his life change as a result?\n\nThis Times Documentary grew out of a series of articles, \u201cRemaking Medicine,\u201d in which we traced how the health care law affected lives in one city.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150614084142, "twitter": {"description": "In June 2015, the Times profiled David Elson, a chronically ill Kentucky man who signed up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act but lost it after not paying the premiums.", "title": "A Hard Road to Health Insurance", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/15/us/a-hard-road-to-health-insurance.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003731495"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/11/multimedia/healthreform-doc/healthreform-doc-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/15/us/a-hard-road-to-health-insurance.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003731495", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/15/us/a-hard-road-to-health-insurance.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "June 14, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Louisville (Ky),Diabetes,Dialysis", "description": "In June 2015, the Times profiled David Elson, a chronically ill Kentucky man who signed up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act but lost it after not paying the premiums.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The New York Times", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/11/multimedia/healthreform-doc/healthreform-doc-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "15healthreform", "byl": "By THE NEW YORK TIMES", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "In June 2015, the Times profiled David Elson, a chronically ill Kentucky man who signed up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act but lost it after not paying the premiums.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/11/multimedia/healthreform-doc/healthreform-doc-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Diabetes,Dialysis", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 14, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2015-10-07", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Dialysis", "published": "2015-06-14", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Louisville (Ky)", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151007020001, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/15/us/a-hard-road-to-health-insurance.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/11/multimedia/healthreform-doc/healthreform-doc-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In June 2015, the Times profiled David Elson, a chronically ill Kentucky man who signed up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act but lost it after not paying the premiums.", "title": "A Hard Road to Health Insurance"}, "pdate": 20150614, "des": "Dialysis", "articleid": 100000003731495, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "A Hard Road to Health Insurance", "col": "Remaking Medicine", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Would David Elson finally get health insurance, and would his life change as a result?\nThis Times Documentary grew out of a series of articles, \u201cRemaking Medicine,\u201d in which we traced how the health care law affected lives in one city.\nThe New York Times started following Mr. Elson in Louisville, Ky., in the months before the law\u2019s new insurance marketplaces opened.\nHe badly needed health insurance, but as a self-employed alarm installer, he could not afford it \u2014 especially since insurers could charge chronically ill people much more before the new law took effect.\nThe Affordable Care Act was designed to help people like David Elson."}
