A Republican from Brunswick filed papers with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday indicating his intention to run against four-term U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree next year.

The paperwork filed by Mark Irving Holbrook designates his campaign committee as Holbrook for Congress, 135 Maine Street, Brunswick. Reached Thursday night, he said his campaign will hold a kickoff party Dec. 4 at the Cumberland Club on High Street in Portland.

Holbrook, a licensed clinical professional counselor, lays out his political views on his website. He says he doesn’t support the Affordable Care Act or illegal immigration, and calls the national debt Washington’s “reprehensible legacy.”

“I want to bring some common sense, some sanity to Washington, D.C.,” Holbrook said Thursday night.

Pingree, a Democrat, has held Maine’s 1st Congressional District seat since 2008. Her spokesman, Willy Ritch, confirmed Thursday that Pingree will seek re-election in November 2016. She made that clear to her staff and supporters in an email in June.

“Congresswoman Pingree is honored to represent Maine in Washington and is running for re-election so she can continue to serve Maine families in Congress,” Ritch said in a prepared statement.
