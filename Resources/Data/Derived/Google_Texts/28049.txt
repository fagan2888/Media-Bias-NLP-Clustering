For more than three decades, a tiny child’s suitcase has been carried by Ginger Lewis to wherever she lived. Filled with letters and legal papers, it’s a time capsule of her family’s dark secret and source of her pain.

Her progression from scared child to confident advocate gave Lewis the resolve recently to open it for the world to see. The revelation that she was sexually assaulted from age 11 to 16 by her father, a well-known and respected Tulsa attorney, has stunned the legal community and motivated legislators to consider changing the law.

Lewis, 45, testified in February before the House Criminal Justice and Corrections Committee and put confessional-like letters from her father on a website, toprevail.org, which contains her story and the reasons she is seeking the expansion and eventual elimination of the statute of limitations on child molestation.
