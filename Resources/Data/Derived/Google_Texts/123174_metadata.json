A series of bungled attacks on Rubio and his wife by the paper has given the freshman Senator from Florida more buzz than any other contender in the race.\n\nIt began last week when The Times assigned two reporters and a researcher to blow the lid off the dangerous driving practices of the Republican contender and his wife Jeanette, who they reported had collected seventeen traffic tickets over the last seventeen years. Only it turned out that the candidate himself had only received four tickets, while his wife \u2013 who isn\u2019t running for any office \u2013 had 13 in the same period of time. She had also sustained an accident recently in her husband\u2019s Ford F-150 pickup truck, which The Times first described as a \u201csport-utility vehicle,\u201d quietly changing it later to \u201ctruck\u201d without noting the correction.\n\nRelated: Why Marco Rubio Might Just Beat Hillary Clinton\n\nWhy Jeanette Rubio\u2019s driving needs public airing in a New York newspaper is a question that The Times still hasn\u2019t answered. For that matter, they haven\u2019t explained the news value of Rubio\u2019s four moving violations in 17 years. He didn\u2019t have the tickets quashed through an exercise of power, but instead hired a lawyer to deal with them and went to traffic school, as did his wife, to clear his record.\n\nThe records of the tickets would come back to bite the Paper of Record, however. The Washington Free Beacon checked the Miami-Dade system to see who had acquired copies of the Rubio records, and discovered that the last access had come ten days prior to The Times\u2019 publication \u2013 by people working for American Bridge, a Democrat-affiliated opposition research firm.\n\nThe Times claimed that they got the records from a document retrieval service, which calls into question why the paper would have assigned two reporters and a researcher to the story. Later checks on the records again showed that the last access to all of the records were on May 26th for the American Bridge researchers, Free Beacon reporter Brent Scher told me that evening.\n\nStill reeling from widespread derision over their big scoop, The Times came back with another story Monday on Rubio about his supposedly profligate spending and \u201cpenchant for luxury.\u201d This article actually did briefly cover some substantive, if old, issues about the Republican Party of Florida and its sloppy accounting practices in the last decade, to which Rubio had a small connection. That issue got subsumed by The Times\u2019 desire to paint Rubio as personally profligate and irresponsible, focusing on his student debt, low savings rate, and purchases such as a house that was \u201camong the most expensive in West Miami\u201d and a \u201cluxury speedboat\u201d that cost $80,000.\n\nRelated: Marco Rubio\u201417 Things You Should Know About Him\n\nOnly a strange thing happened. Instead of painting Rubio as a profligate \u201cbedeviled by financial struggles,\u201d the Times described the success story of many in Rubio\u2019s generation. True, at times Rubio appeared overextended, but his $300,000 salary from his law practice put him on solid ground for his real estate ventures.\n\nThe Times found a financial adviser to call his liabilities \u201cstaggering\u201d and \u201cdangerous,\u201d but never mentioned that the advisor, Harold Evensky, was an Obama donor in 2007\u2013 another fact discovered by the Free Beacon and not disclosed by The Times. Only after sixteen paragraphs did The Times note that the Rubios had settled their debt a few years earlier, begun a broad plan for savings and college funds, and put themselves on sound footing.\n\nThe Times\u2019 idea of \u201cluxury\u201d underscored the middle-class nature of the Rubios, too. The description of a \u201cluxury speedboat\u201d evoked images of cigarette boats running off the coast of Miami, but the craft turned out to be a 24-foot fishing boat with two outboard motors, in a city where a boat is almost de rigueur for residents of any means.\n\nThe house in West Miami purchased by the Rubios in 2005, with its \u201cin-ground pool,\u201d had previously been described by Politico and other media outlets as relatively humble. Its 2700 square feet might be a step above some of the other homes in the \u201cHispanic enclave,\u201d but an appropriate size for Marco and Jeanette to raise four children. \u201cThere is nothing opulent about their home,\u201d Politico wrote in 2012, \u201cbut it is warm and bright and simply decorated with white and brown furniture.\u201d\n\nRelated: With Eye on Middle Class, Rubio Floats Tax Plan\n\nTwo years ago, a self-professed skeptic from the Sun Sentinel visited the Rubio household to confirm Rubio\u2019s description of his residence. \u201cIn the case of his claim that he lives in a \u201cworking-class neighborhood,\u201d score one for Rubio in the truth column,\u201d wrote Michael Mayo. \u201cI have to back him on this.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Rubios had gone through many of the same struggles that younger professionals had endured. Neither of them came from wealthy families, and while their twenties and thirties were financially challenging, they had managed to modestly prosper and settle down not far from where Rubio grew up.\n\nWhile the Clintons deal with their massive fortune earned by exploiting their connections to power and public trust, the Rubios seem more accessible to mainstream America than ever. The story turns out so well that MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes wondered on Twitter whether Rubio was planting the stories in The Times as \u201cfalse flags made to make him look sympathetic.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Flap Over Rubio\u2019s Finances Could Help or Hurt Him\n\nThis fight with The Times did more than make Rubio a more sympathetic candidate. It rallied conservatives around him while prompting media analysts to criticize the Paper of Record as reckless and biased. Conservatives also noticed the nimbleness of Team Rubio and their response effort. In 2008 and 2012, Republican voters felt frustrated by presidential campaigns that didn\u2019t have good reflexes in the media battles; this showed the rank-and-file that Rubio and his team aren\u2019t afraid to play hardball in the major leagues.\n\nThe primary debates are still months away, and the first chance for voters to cast ballots even farther off. Rubio may have just passed a major test and at the same time performed a favor to the rest of the Republican field. The New York Times may hope to pick the next President, but they may get their wish in a completely unforeseen way.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "An adage about strategic patience in politics advises, \u201cWait, and your opponents will", "title": "The NY Times Just Made Rubio the Hero of the Struggling Middle Class", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/06/11/NY-Times-Just-Made-Rubio-Hero-Struggling-Middle-Class", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04192015_Marco_Rubio_CBS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/06/11/NY-Times-Just-Made-Rubio-Hero-Struggling-Middle-Class", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04192015_Marco_Rubio_CBS.jpg", "creator": "@EdMorrissey", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "An adage about strategic patience in politics advises, \u201cWait, and your opponents will", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5cd6\"", "article_summary": "True, at times Rubio appeared overextended, but his $300,000 salary from his law practice put him on solid ground for his real estate ventures.\nRelated: Why Marco Rubio Might Just Beat Hillary ClintonWhy Jeanette Rubio\u2019s driving needs public airing in a New York newspaper is a question that The Times still hasn\u2019t answered.\nInstead of painting Rubio as a profligate \u201cbedeviled by financial struggles,\u201d the Times described the success story of many in Rubio\u2019s generation.\nThe New York Times may hope to pick the next President, but they may get their wish in a completely unforeseen way.\nRubio may have just passed a major test and at the same time performed a favor to the rest of the Republican field."}
