Their candidates for the most part do not resonate. Except one.\n\nThe others are all wasting other people\u2019s money, but this is what politicians do. It shows how the donor class would rather throw money into a bad investment then give up their stranglehold.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe money Cruz, Rubio, Bush, and some of the others have spent is astounding to me. I could have advised them differently and saved them a ton of money. But the political ruling class has become a group of intellectually effete corpses who feast on the waste of their own decayed entitlement.\n\nThey refuse to listen to the needs of the American people or what they may have to say. I warned them six years ago when I met with GOP leadership and forewarned them what we are seeing today. You can read the articles here. I keep hearing the phrase \u201cConstitutional Conservative.\u201d The battle cry we have heard for decades. As if this were the most important issue.\n\nWell, I must say has the GOP been able to overturn \u201cRoe vs Wade\u201d? Has the GOP been able to deny same sex marriage? Has the GOP been able to deny Obamacare? A Cruz Supreme Court Justice favorite denied the death of Obamacare twice.\n\nThe GOP intellectual establishment pushes the importance of getting conservative Supreme Court justices to ensure that our constitution is protected. I am not saying this is not important, but, what I will say is both parties push this agenda and until this election they have ignored what is hurting Americans and their families. The decimation of the American working class for White, Blacks, Latinos, et all!\n\nWhile the parties focus on social issues, blue collar Americans have been silently screaming about survival. Until Donald Trump came along and began to pry off the death grip the political class held around the throats of the the \u201csilent majority.\u201d\n\nTruth be told, the majority isn\u2019t silent, their cries have been choked out of them by the deception and lies. If not for Trump the TTP would go through under a Ted Cruz or Hillary Clinton, and once again the American worker would be left to suicide and drugs or alcohol addiction.\n\nThe ruling class of both parties have not protected American\u2019s. No they have systematically reduced and effeminized the American worker into submission. Trump is fighting the battle for America. Not for himself. Not for a party. But for us all.\n\nWhat does Trump have to gain? What does he have to lose? What does Cruz have to gain? What does Cruz have to lose? And you can go down the line on this. Ted Cruz sees himself as the anointed one. Ted Cruz gave a speech this morning trying to sell us on his ability to bring in Reagan Democrats? This is absurd! I\u2019ve met with folks all over this great country of ours, even Texas, and I have not met one Reagan Democrat who would vote for Cruz, but have met many for Trump.\n\nIt is this kind of out-of-touch tone deafness that the American people can see through.\n\nEven in his speaking, Cruz employs a kind of preacher\u2019s theatrics that will grate on the general public. Could you listen riveted to Cruz for one hour, or Hillary, or Bernie? But Trump has the kind of Kennedy/Reagan ability to communicate strength and authenticity the others can\u2019t.\n\nLast night ,while watching the election on all three cable networks, when Mississippi\u2019s polls were closed and the results first flashed on the screen, Trump had a double digit commanding lead. Something very interesting happened next. They put up Michigan\u2019s results while the polls were still open, showing Kasich with an early lead. They never went back to Mississippi.\n\nI went back and forth to all three cable stations and they all had Michigan but no Mississippi. The only time they changed was when Trump overtook Kasich. All while polls were open. Does this not seem strange to you? Well it sure as hell does to me. I have never seen the kind of attacks Trump is undergoing and from every single aspect of those in power, politics, media, entertainment, business. A relentless pummeling. Two of my favorite leaders went through this, Ronald Reagan and Winston Churchill. Trump embodies qualities of both these men.\n\nNow let\u2019s sit back and watch how the assassins line up against him and in doing so betray all of us.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Davi: Donald Trump is Like Reagan and Churchill", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Davi: Donald Trump is Like Reagan and Churchill", "title": "Davi: Donald Trump is Like Reagan and Churchill - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Donald-Trump-camarografo-Baton-Rouge-Gerald-Herbert-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/03/09/davi-donald-trump-is-like-reagan-and-churchill-combined/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Davi: Donald Trump is Like Reagan and Churchill", "title": "Davi: Donald Trump is Like Reagan and Churchill - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Donald-Trump-camarografo-Baton-Rouge-Gerald-Herbert-AP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, GOP, Robert Davi, Ronald Reagan, Ted Cruz, Winston Churchill,2016 Presidential Race, Big Hollywood,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Winston Churchill", "published_time": "2016-03-09T12:43:44-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe money Cruz, Rubio, Bush, and some of the others have spent is astounding to me.\nWhat does Trump have to gain?\nI warned them six years ago when I met with GOP leadership and forewarned them what we are seeing today.\nWhat does Cruz have to gain?\nWhat does Cruz have to lose?"}
