Rapid City, SD

Gay and straight couples are converging on Mount Rushmore National Memorial this weekend to hold a large group wedding in celebration of this summer's U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage.



The event, organized by women who challenged South Dakota's ban on same-sex marriages, is being held in the amphitheater of the memorial.



Nancy Rosenbrahn says she already knows of six couples who have received marriage licenses in South Dakota and plan to get married Sunday afternoon beneath the memorial.



Rosenbrahn says married couples, like she and her wife Jennie, will also be renewing their vows at the ceremony.



Marriage ceremonies are typically held off to the side of the memorial and Rosenbrahn believes their ceremony will be the first of its kind in the amphitheater.
