The Free Radicals jazz band played as the protesters handed out flyers to passersby.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve commodified human beings,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIn other words, these private prisons have guaranteed occupancy rates, or else they can sue the state. The judges all of a sudden have pressure to fill these prisons, so people are going there for nonviolent drug convictions. They\u2019re being pumped into the system that\u2019s using them as a commodity, basically.\u201d\n\nKramp and Winfield started a Change.org petition a month ago hoping to persuade the Board of Regents to divest stock in banking firms that have stock in Corrections Corporation of America and GEO Group.\n\n\u201cWe would like them to institute a policy that says they won\u2019t invest in for-profit prisons again or in institutions that own majority shares in private prisons,\u201d Kramp said. \u201cThere\u2019s a wide array of other investments that they have, so we would like to see that money that\u2019s going to (Ameriprise and J.P. Moran Chase) rerouted.\u201d\n\nAccording to the protesters\u2019 pamphlets, those two companies \u201care two of the largest for-profit prison corporations in America\u201d and the industry \u201chas an incentive to lock up as many people as possible to maximize profits.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about to graduate from the University of Houston, and we have Tier One status, and honestly I\u2019m really proud of our institution,\u201d Winfield said. \u201cBut this (investment) doesn\u2019t match up with the rest of that. I feel like they could be so much better than this.\u201d\n\nThe partners\u2019 next step would have been speaking at the May 19 Board of Regents meeting, but for the first time in nearly a decade, the meeting changed locations to UH-Victoria.\n\n\u201cNow we can\u2019t go in there and talk to them about this unless we want to do a three-hour drive, which really sucks,\u201d Winfield said. \u201cI feel like this could have been a really good opportunity to really be genuine about the democracy and about the students\u2019 ownership of campus and listen to what students were saying.\u201d\n\nAllen connected with Kramp and Winfield via Facebook, where he frequently posts on the page for End Mass Incarceration Houston. Allen works with a group called Enlace International, which campaigns for university and corporate divestment from private prisons. Kramp and Winfield reached out to Allen after reading about the group\u2019s findings that UH was also involved.\n\n\u201cThe Board of Regents knows it,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThey\u2019re a bunch of rich, old white guys who don\u2019t really care about poor people, about black people or about brown people. I don\u2019t know any way to sugarcoat it. I think it is the epitome of hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nOne protester, Free Radicals trombone player Henry Darragh, graduated from UH in December with a doctorate in musical arts after serving two years in prison on a nonviolent drug offense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an ex-convict and know a thing or two about the prison industrial complex and was surprised to hear that UH is indirectly supporting incarceration, though I don\u2019t think if Renu Khator or the Board of Regents knew they would (continue investing),\u201d Darragh said.\n\n[email protected]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Social work graduate students Julia Kramp and Nakia Winfield led a protest Wednesday afternoon while Free Radicals jazz band played in the background.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Cougar", "description": "Social work graduate students Julia Kramp and Nakia Winfield led a protest Wednesday afternoon while Free Radicals jazz band played in the background.", "title": "Student, community members protest UH prison investment", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thedailycougar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web_IMG_9762.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-05T19:39:02+00:00", "url": "http://thedailycougar.com/2016/05/05/students-community-members-protest-uh-prison-investment/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Cougar", "description": "Social work graduate students Julia Kramp and Nakia Winfield led a protest Wednesday afternoon while Free Radicals jazz band played in the background.", "title": "Student, community members protest UH prison investment", "creator": "@thedailycougar", "site": "@thedailycougar", "image3": "http://i2.wp.com/thedailycougar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web_IMG_9675.jpg?resize=896%2C599", "image2": "http://i0.wp.com/thedailycougar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web_IMG_9676.jpg?resize=295%2C198", "image1": "http://i0.wp.com/thedailycougar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web_IMG_9693.jpg?resize=295%2C197", "image0": "http://i0.wp.com/thedailycougar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web_IMG_9762.jpg?resize=597%2C399", "card": "gallery"}, "fb": {"admins": 37502686}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thedailycougar", "section": "Campus", "tag": "private prisons", "published_time": "2016-05-05T16:15:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-05T19:39:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe167a\"", "article_summary": "Students, community members protest UH prison investment\u201cBig organizations like UH keep pumping money into the system, and if we can pull the money out, we can decrease the size of their operating capital,\u201d said Organizer Michael Allen.\n\u201cIn other words, these private prisons have guaranteed occupancy rates, or else they can sue the state.\nSocial work graduate students Julia Kramp and Nakia Winfield and community organizer Michael Allen led the protest Thursday afternoon beside TDECU Stadium.\n| Photo by Leah Nash/ The Cougar Many of the protesters had ties to UH as students, alumni or family of alumni.\nAllen works with a group called Enlace International, which campaigns for university and corporate divestment from private prisons."}
