Gov. Mark Hutchison is chairing his campaign in Nevada.\n\nRepublican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio is kicking off his visit with a rally at the Peppermill Casino in Reno the evening of Aug. 31. The next day, he\u2019ll visit the Carson City Community Center before heading to Pioneer Crossing in Yerington at 2 p.m. and the Fallon Convention Center at 5:30 p.m.\n\nNevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt hosts the Morning in America, Inaugural Basque Fry at Corley Ranch Saturday at Corley Ranch in Gardnerville.\n\nDeliala Burke, 7 1/2, and her 3 1/2 brother Keenan of Sparks play near an old wagon Saturday at Corley Ranch.\n\nFormer Ambassador John Bolton greets a supporter Saturday at the Inaugural Basque Fry at Corley Ranch.\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker addresses the large crowd with Job's Peak in the background Saturday at Corley Ranch.\n\nJoan Reid of Carson City helps herself to a plate of Basque food Saturday at Corley Ranch.\n\nRepublican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina speaks to a large crowd Saturday at the Inaugural Basque Fry Saturday in Gardnerville.\n\nRepublican presidential hopeful Dr. Ben Carson poses for a photo with Congressman Mark Amodei Saturday at the Inaugural Basque Fry at Corley Ranch in Gardnerville.\n\nMax Yasgur loaned his New York farm to the greatest lineup of musicians 46 years ago.\n\nOn Saturday, the Corley Ranch south of Gardnerville hosted a handful of presidential candidates seeking the support of Nevada\u2019s Republican caucus voters who nominate a candidate in late February.\n\nA conservative Basque fry featured four Republican hopefuls who offered both rhetoric and solutions to take back the White House from the Democrats in 2016.\n\nAlthough the candidates met the public during the day and delivered prepared speeches to about 1,500 people at allotted times, organizers and local politicians said they were pleased with the event and the reaction. Many of the other invited presidential candidates, though, attended the Iowa State Fair this weekend. Attorney General Adam Laxalt, along with the Nevada Republican Party, Douglas County Central Republican Committee and Nevada Federation of Republican Women, resurrected an event once hosted by Laxalt\u2019s grandfather, former Nevada governor and U.S. senator, Paul Laxalt.\n\nThe darling of many guests was Tea Party favorite, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Earlier in the day before the event featured opening remarks from Laxalt and its first speaker, Cruz talked to the media under shade tree outlining some of his ideas and discussing the government\u2019s control of state lands.\n\n\u201cEighty-four percent owned by the federal government. That is fundamentally wrong,\u201d Cruz said of Nevada, noting in his home state of Texas, the federal government owns only 2 percent of the land.\n\nCruz said the federal government should transfer the land back to the state. During his stint in Congress, Cruz said he introduced an amendment to limit how much land the federal government may own in each state.\n\nWhen pressed how states would pay to administer the lands, Cruz reverted back to Texas, saying ideally only 2 percent of the federal government should own Nevada land.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be the state of Nevada\u2019s people who own the land,\u201d Cruz said, adding once in private hands, the land can be developed for recreation or development.\n\nCruz and Dr. Ben Carson enjoyed rock-star status, following their handlers as they maneuvered through big crowds. Many people either wanted to shake their hands or have a photo taken with them.\n\nBob Clifford of Fallon, who is involved with the local Tea Party, said he was reserving judgment on which candidate could do the best.\n\n\u201cTerms of my favorites is the one who can do change,\u201d Clifford said.\n\nBoth Republican state Sen. James Settelmeyer, who represents Churchill County, said he was pleased with the inaugural event and the candidates who made appearances. Besides Cruz and Carson, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker attended.\n\nFormer New York Gov. George Pataki, who was listed to speak, didn\u2019t attend. No reason was given. Former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton spent time talking to small groups of attendees.\n\nSettelmeyer said the guests appreciated the opportunity to see the candidates at the Basque fry.\n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve loved to seen all the candidates here, but I\u2019m glad to see many of the top tier candidates,\u201d Settelmeyer added.\n\nFor the weekend he said Gardnerville was the center of presidential politicking for a day.\n\nRepublican Assemblywoman Robin Titus, whose district includes Churchill County, said Nevada is important in attracting presidential candidates because of the caucus process.\n\nAs for Titus, she said she supports Walker but she also likes Carson.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not vetted in a political office. I need to see people\u2019s track record,\u201d Titus aid.\n\nThe first-term lawmaker said she is impressed with Fiorina, but like Carson, she wants to see the candidate\u2019s record on the issues.\n\nChurchill County Chief Deputy Attorney Lane Mills said he was also impressed with Fiorina and Carson.\n\n\u201cI like Carson. He\u2019s a likable guy and came off as genuine,\u201d Mills said.\n\nWalker has made several trips to Nevada after announcing his candidacy for president. He listed his accomplishments occurring in a blue state dominated by Democratic legislators.\n\n\u201cI took Wisconsin to a right to work state, and I defunded Planned Parenthood four years ago before there was any video,\u201d he said to the delight of the partisan crowd.\n\nA common theme from every candidate was the Affordable Care Act. Walker was no different. The second-term governor said Obamacare must be repealed.\n\nWalker said he has traveled throughout the country, talking to voters.\n\n\u201cI can tell you a lot of people are fed up with Washington. It\u2019s 68-square miles surrounded by reality,\u201d Walker said, drawing loud applause and laughter.\n\nAll four candidates railed against Democrat Hillary Clinton, the current frontrunner in her party for the presidential nomination.\n\nIn a separate interview after his speech, Walker was asked about any plans to resurrect the Yucca Mountain nuclear storage idea. He said his decision would be based on scientific data, not politics.\n\nCarson said the United States is a land where many people can realize their dreams. For him, it was becoming a successful neurosurgeon.\n\n\u201cI love anything to do with medicine,\u201d he said.\n\nCarson\u2019s comments on his life led into how today\u2019s individuals must take responsibility for their own lives, not rely on others. Carson pointed out Americans live in a \u201ccan-do\u201d nation, not what the country can do for them. He said his mother, for example, worked various jobs to ensure Carson and his younger brother succeeded. She required her sons to check out books weekly from the library and do reports on them.\n\n\u201cShe was soft spoken but forceful,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen he mentioned his religious beliefs and his mother\u2019s faith, Carson was down to earth in seeking help.\n\n\u201cThe nice thing with God is you don\u2019t need a Ph.D. to talk to him,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Carson discussed his personal beliefs more than policy, the retired physician said it was wrong for the federal government to own so much land in Nevada, and he favored a strong military.\n\nFiorina, who appeared in the second-tier of debaters on the Fox News Channel 10 days ago, received favorable responses for her comments and presence on the stage. That winning formula for Fiorina was also apparent Saturday. Before the debate, she said about 40 percent of Republicans didn\u2019t know of her ... now most of them do.\n\nAs she did in the Fox debate and at many of her campaign stops, Fiorina has taken Clinton to task, accusing her of lying about the Benghazi attack in 2012, her personal computer\u2019s server and State Department emails found on her personal computer.\n\nFiorina said her goal is to make people aware of conservatism and how it works in government. She decried how liberal-leaning lawmakers in California have bowed to environmental policies and regulations that have restricted the state\u2019s ability to store water, specifically an issue heightened during the drought.\n\nFiorina, who believes in a strong military and feels strongly for veterans\u2019 care, said if elected president, she would make two calls on her first day: The first would be to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu telling him the United States would \u201cstand by\u201d his country and the second, to the supreme leader of Iran, telling him no deal on a nuclear treaty until the Iranians allowed inspections at every military and nuclear facility.\n\nChurchill County Commissioner Bus Scharmann said Carson and Fiorina were great speakers at the Basque Fry.\n\n\u201cThis is a neat gathering like the old stump speeches,\u201d he said. \u201cI liked her speech talking about the first two calls she would make after becoming president.\u201d\n\nScharmann, though, said he wished other presidential candidates had attended the Gardnerville event.\n\nOverall, Rural Caucus Chairman Wes Rice said the Basque fry was an outstanding event that attracted candidates willing to mingle with the crowds and guests from every county in Nevada.\n\n\u201cWe had friends from Elko here and Mineral and Esmeralda counties,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have a lot of volunteers from Carson City and Douglas County. I\u2019m impressed with the rural effort.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Max Yasgur loaned his New York farm to the greatest lineup of musicians 46 years ago.On Saturday, the Corley Ranch south of Gardnerville hosted a handful of presidential candidates", "og": {"url": "http://www.NevadaAppeal.com/news/government/17752414-113/presidential-candidates-at-basque-fry", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.NevadaAppeal.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=Sm1Hrkyl99Yvxz7ZgZvu$8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYug_FWA7xVDfWX3AOEKUu9CWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "site_name": "The Nevada Appeal", "description": "Max Yasgur loaned his New York farm to the greatest lineup of musicians 46 years ago.On Saturday, the Corley Ranch south of Gardnerville hosted a handful of presidential candidates", "title": "Presidential candidates at Basque Fry | NevadaAppeal.com"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NevadaAppeal", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 555484641151578}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 17752414}}, "__sync_contentCategory": "Paid", "keywords": "CARSON, NEVADA, PRESIDENTIAL, REPUBLICAN, CANDIDATES, BASQUE, FRY, STATE, CRUZ, FIORINA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina speaks to a large crowd Saturday at the Inaugural Basque Fry Saturday in Gardnerville.\nMany of the other invited presidential candidates, though, attended the Iowa State Fair this weekend.\n\u201cI liked her speech talking about the first two calls she would make after becoming president.\u201dScharmann, though, said he wished other presidential candidates had attended the Gardnerville event.\nRepublican presidential hopeful Dr. Ben Carson poses for a photo with Congressman Mark Amodei Saturday at the Inaugural Basque Fry at Corley Ranch in Gardnerville.\nRepublican Assemblywoman Robin Titus, whose district includes Churchill County, said Nevada is important in attracting presidential candidates because of the caucus process."}
