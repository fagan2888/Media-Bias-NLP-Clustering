I don\u2019t mean colleagues throwing punches, of course, but at many small businesses, conflict tends to bubble up pretty quickly.\n\nSmart businesses also know instinctively that conflict is good\u2014as long as it gets resolved quickly. Both the company and its customers benefit when they have passionate advocates willing to go to the mat for what they think is right.\n\nBut as small businesses start to get bigger, they often learn to hate conflict\u2014and the conflict simmers under the surface rather than being addressed head on. Disputes become personal, or infest entire teams, pitting one group against the other. Worse, the company begins to view it as unprofessional to disrupt a carefully scheduled meeting agenda with an unresolved dispute. People start to frown on dissent.\n\nThe solution is a Monday morning meeting designed to unblock any organizational obstacle that keeps people from doing their jobs effectively. The best companies have weekly meetings with a clear cultural norm: meet, fight and then resolve. This ensures that conflicts don\u2019t linger, which would hamper the rest of the organization\u2019s ability to act. And while such meetings help the leadership team to keep tabs on the issues that might prevent the front line from acting, the front line learns that they can\u2019t let a conflict fester for more than four business days.\n\n\u201cWe love conflict,\u201d the chief executive of a Turkish firm told me. At his weekly leadership team meeting, he said, \u201cI expect major fights.\u201d At one meeting, his team debated what to do about some products that had been poorly packaged in off-brand colors. Pulling the stock would likely cause stock-outs at its retail partners. The chief executive grew angry, not because of the packaging snafu but because certain executives didn\u2019t advocate for brand consistency. \u201cOur head of marketing was being way too reasonable,\u201d the executive recalled. Understanding the consequences of stock-outs, he was too quick, in the executive\u2019s opinion, to say that the color issue wasn\u2019t that bad, when he should have been advocating for brand consistency. \u201cDuring a break, I told him that he was not doing his job.\u201d\n\nThat executive understands that good organizational design encourages conflict\u2014not for the sake of conflict, but so the ultimate decision flows from full-throated, passionate debate. Too often, companies suppress debate, allowing unresolved conflicts to paralyze employees and suck away their energy. The Monday morning meeting is a simple mechanism to remind everyone that fighting isn\u2019t the answer, but can be a great way to find the answer.\n\nJames Allen is co-leader of the global strategy practice at Bain & Company.\n\nRead the latest Small Business Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "JAMES ALLEN: Walk the halls of any fast-growing, entrepreneurial company, and there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll see some fights.
