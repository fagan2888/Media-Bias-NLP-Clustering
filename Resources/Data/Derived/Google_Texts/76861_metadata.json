Rick Snyder has been named one of nine \u201cpublic officials of the year\u201d for 2014 by Governing magazine.\n\nThe annual list, which highlights elected or appointed officials in state and local governments, includes a mixture of Democrats and Republicans from around the country.\n\nSnyder, fresh of his hard fought re-election win over challenger Mark Schauer, was praised for bringing \u201crisk-taking and performance management\u201d to the governor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cMost elected officials abhor risk. They run from it,\u201d Snyder said in an honoree profile. \u201cBut if everything we did worked, that means we\u2019re not taking risks.\u201d\n\nThe magazine highlighted several instances where Snyder \u201cstuck his neck out\u201d to support potentially controversial policies, including Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, right to work and state aid for a Detroit bankruptcy settlement.\n\nOther 2014 honorees included Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams and Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. Former Michigan Budget Director John Nixon, appointed by Snyder, was honored in 2012.\n\n\"Especially when the federal government is plagued by partisan fighting and gridlock, these dedicated individuals have shown that real change is possible,\u201d Governing executive director Zach Patton said in a statement.\n\nFollow the link to check out Governing\u2019s full list of \u201cpublic officials of the year.\"\n\nJonathan Oosting is a Capitol reporter for MLive Media Group.
