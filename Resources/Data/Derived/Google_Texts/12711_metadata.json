Mike Pence want it to.\n\nBut there are a handful of other priorities that Pence, House Speaker Brian Bosma and Senate President Pro Tem David Long have outlined for the session that starts in January, which are detailed below:\n\nQUICK SESSION\n\nBosma says House Republicans want to focus on a handful of big issues \u2014 including roads funding, the state\u2019s teacher shortage and a ban of over-the-counter pseudoephedrine sales\u2014 before quickly bringing the 10-week session to a close.\n\nMinority Democrats snarkily assessed that attitude as shrewd \u2014 especially in an election year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of good that can happen for the Republicans by being in session,\u201d House Minority Leader Scott Pelath said. \u201cThe longer you\u2019re here, the more problems that crop up for them.\u201d\n\nDifficult political questions like how to fund roads and how to address LGBT civil rights could be political liabilities for the GOP come November, especially with the large-yet-fractious House Republican caucus, Pelath said.\n\n\u201cYou have your ideologues, your pragmatists and your sort of moderates. They don\u2019t agree on many things \u2014 they certainly don\u2019t agree on strategy. And they don\u2019t necessarily like each other,\u201d the Michigan City Democrat said. \u201cWhen you have to cajole and corral a group like that, you\u2019re gonna want to tend to wrap things up as quickly as you can.\u201d\n\nIndianapolis Public Works employees Danica Troutman,left, Torin Harris and Kenneth Stinger Jr., right, work to fill spots of asphalt down in chuckholes in an alley near East Washington Ave and Sherman Drive Thursday morning.

In response, Pence proposed a $1 billion short-term solution that relies on borrowing and drawing down the state\u2019s reserves to repair state highways.\n\nBut Democrats say that ignores county and municipal roadways, and made a counterproposal for a $2 billion short-term plan that would pay for all roads by tapping into reserves and redirecting money that lawmakers can currently spend any way they want.\n\nBosma says both plans fail to address the need for a more reliable stream of revenue, and has directed GOP caucus leaders to find a solution, stating \u201cnothing is off the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that we can have more of a long-term vision,\u201d said Bosma, of Indianapolis. \u201cI suspect the need isn\u2019t just $1 billion or $2 billion.\u201d\n\nBut Long, who supports Pence\u2019s proposal, indicated that a long-term plan would be better dealt with during a year when lawmakers write the state\u2019s two-year budget.\n\n\u201cIt is not an easy answer,\u201d the Fort Wayne Republican said.\n\nISTEP reminders are posted on a middle school bulletin board.

Some key Republicans have argued the accountability measure must stay, though Bosma and Pence have said they are open to lessening the blow, which Democrats have requested for months. Long said a dip in grades \u201cneeds to be addressed so we don\u2019t unfairly penalize our schools, our students.\u201d\n\nA teacher writes algebraic equations on a classroom chalkboard.

Bosma says he hopes to reverse that trend, which has seen the number of first-time teaching licenses issued by the state decline by 33 percent over the past five years.\n\nHouse Republicans are proposing full-ride scholarships for teachers who commit to teaching in the state for five years, though they haven\u2019t outlined a funding source.\n\nBosma also says too much school funding goes to paying for administration and overhead, and more should go to increasing salaries for entry-level teachers.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1jeNWs6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The debate over whether to extend civil rights protections to gays and lesbians, ISTEP scores and Indiana's teacher shortage are just a few of the things that will be brought up next legislative session.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "The debate over whether to extend civil rights protections to gays and lesbians, ISTEP scores and Indiana's teacher shortage are just a few of the things that will be brought up next legislative session.", "title": "4 things to expect from the Indiana legislature", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2015/11/22/4-things-expect-indiana-legislature/76223466/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The debate over whether to extend civil rights protections to gays and lesbians, ISTEP scores and Indiana's teacher shortage are just a few of the things that will be brought up next legislative session.", "title": "4 things to expect from the Indiana legislature", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1044b7648f45b6e30bfff1e411fc316f2b22901b/c=0-1592-3148-4740&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/04/29/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635659482152879065-Indiana-Legislature-INAM109-WEB812801.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Schools", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Schools", "title": "4 things to expect from the Indiana legislature", "author": "Brian Slodysko", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/722f96c7ca3c21b6206479b8b3e24151ec60d923/c=0-543-3148-4740/local/-/media/2015/04/29/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635659482152879065-Indiana-Legislature-INAM109-WEB812801.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d03f3ba8a14dea1edc5debce4dc6071af64cc9f3/c=0-1592-3148-4740/local/-/media/2015/04/29/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635659482152879065-Indiana-Legislature-INAM109-WEB812801.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/171723af3f0876cc06ee6fa28f80b3e842d1b223/c=0-2373-3148-4740/local/-/media/2015/04/29/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635659482152879065-Indiana-Legislature-INAM109-WEB812801.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce55bec129f3db84c0a46e3e1e0d5224db9ab51a/c=0-2962-3148-4740&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/04/29/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635659482152879065-Indiana-Legislature-INAM109-WEB812801.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-11-22T16:24:50.860000-05:00", "shorthed": "4 things to expect from the Indiana legislature", "articleid": 76223466, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e780cee9499ca8735b0310372d854d85c9164e51/c=0-2962-3148-4740/local/-/media/2015/04/29/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635659482152879065-Indiana-Legislature-INAM109-WEB812801.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8de5b34056ce149bab11c3b70e9f841a05f23d5a/c=493-0-3147-4740/local/-/media/2015/04/29/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635659482152879065-Indiana-Legislature-INAM109-WEB812801.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Indiana, legislature,"}, "article_summary": "House Republicans are proposing full-ride scholarships for teachers who commit to teaching in the state for five years, though they haven\u2019t outlined a funding source.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of good that can happen for the Republicans by being in session,\u201d House Minority Leader Scott Pelath said.\n(Photo: Charlie Nye / The Star 2003 file photo)TEACHER SHORTAGELike dozens of other states, Indiana is facing a teacher shortage, especially in math, science and special education.\nSpeaker of the House Brian Bosma, R-Indianapolis, addresses the chamber on April 29, 2015, the final day of the year's legislative session at the Statehouse in Indianapolis.\nThey don\u2019t agree on many things \u2014 they certainly don\u2019t agree on strategy."}
