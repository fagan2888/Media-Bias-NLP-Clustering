I don\u2019t know if it will work, but I feel it\u2019s worth the try for me and the hundreds of thousands of us facing only the alternatives of pain or surgery. The process should be regulated and the consumer needs to beware of quackery, but we also need medical research to test the opportunities.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 719,000 knee-replacement surgeries in 2010. Such a surgery costs $50,000-plus. Compare that to a low-risk outpatient procedure at a quarter of the cost. Our health care system needs to be finding, testing, regulating and paying for successful innovations.\n\nI am doing my small part. The Post might consider celebrating the legitimate and promising opportunities in this field and not merely damning the \u201c Beverly Hills\u201d approach.\n\nMaureen Hanrahan, Denver\n\nThis letter was published in the May 26 edition.\n\nSubmit a letter to the editor via this form or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/05/25/the-opportunity-of-stem-cells-as-an-alternative-to-knee-replacement/37806/", "site_name": "eLetters", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2015/05/stem-cells-495x371.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "The opportunity of stem cells as an alternative to knee-replacement"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "The opportunity of stem cells as an alternative to knee-replacement", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/05/25/the-opportunity-of-stem-cells-as-an-alternative-to-knee-replacement/37806/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2015/05/stem-cells-495x371.jpg", "creator": "@denveropinion", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "How sad that The Post chose a front-page article offering a limited perspective, and little encouragement for the legitimate use of stem-cell therapy."}, "article_summary": "I am participating in a clinical trial to test the use of stem-cell therapy as an alternative to knee-replacement surgery.\nHow sad that The Post chose a front-page article offering a limited perspective, and little encouragement for the legitimate use of stem-cell therapy.\nRe: \u201c\u2018Wild West\u2019 of stem sell clinics grows amid lack of regulation,\u201d May 18 news story.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 719,000 knee-replacement surgeries in 2010.\nThe Post might consider celebrating the legitimate and promising opportunities in this field and not merely damning the \u201c Beverly Hills\u201d approach."}
