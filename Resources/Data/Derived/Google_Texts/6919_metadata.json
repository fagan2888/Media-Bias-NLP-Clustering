But a look at data collected by the East Baton Rouge Parish Emergency Medical Services Department shows that the amount of travel time to bring a patient to an emergency room has increased steadily over the past few years.\n\n\u201cIn a true life-threatening emergency, I think time is one of the most important factors,\u201d said Mike Chustz, EMS spokesman. \u201cAny delay \u2014 traffic, weather, on the scene, going to the scene \u2014 any delay could have consequences.\u201d\n\nThe long distance to an emergency room for people living in north Baton Rouge has grown into a prominent issue in recent months, garnering attention from politicians and community organizers. Residents and local leaders say they want to see a change, warning of potential health perils to some of the poorest people in the city-parish.\n\nLocal hospital leaders have downplayed any concerns about a lack of ERs in north Baton Rouge or Mid City, saying the ones in the south part of the parish and Zachary can safely provide the needed care for everybody across the region. They\u2019ve also said they simply cannot afford to build emergency rooms and hospitals back into the areas the companies have left.\n\nBaton Rouge General\u2019s Mid City campus was bleeding $23.8 million before its emergency room closed in 2015, while state officials shuttered Earl K. Long Medical Center, which previously provided care for indigent patients, in 2013, saying it made more sense to move to a contract with a private hospital than rebuild the dilapidated facilities in north Baton Rouge.\n\nEMS transport data mirrors the changes in ER options. In 2012, it took paramedics and emergency medical technicians 13 minutes and 32 seconds, on average, to drive from where they picked up a patient to the hospital. The transport time rose by 32 seconds the year the Earl K. Long Medical Center closed, transferring care of their patients to Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center on Essen Lane. It increased again to reach an average of 15 minutes and 40 seconds last year, during which Baton Rouge General\u2019s ER closed on Florida Boulevard in March.\n\nNumbers for the first quarter of 2016 show another increase. Transportation times rose to an average of 16 minutes and 19 seconds during the first few months of this year.\n\nChustz said having an emergency room in north Baton Rouge should cut down on transportation times and drop times, which is how long is spent off-loading patients at hospitals. Drop times averaged 22 minutes and 25 seconds in 2015.\n\nHospital heads point out that most people in dire emergencies \u2014 such as trauma victims who have gotten in car wrecks, who are bleeding from gunshot wounds or who have fallen down \u2014 would skip over an emergency room in north Baton Rouge regardless. Those patients need to be taken to Our Lady of the Lake\u2019s Trauma Center in south Baton Rouge, which has the needed array of specialists on staff at all times that other hospitals do not have for the most acute emergencies.\n\nStill, local leaders believe some kind of emergency room will improve overall care in the north part of the city. State Sen. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, and East Baton Rouge Parish Metro Councilwoman Chauna Banks-Daniel are testing the waters to see if a company would open a freestanding emergency room in the Champion Medical Center near the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport.\n\nThat could be a tough task. Once an area loses hospitals and emergency care, it can be difficult to bring them back. Alan Sager, a Boston University health care policy expert, has tracked more than 1,000 hospitals across the nation going back to the 1930s.\n\nHis research shows hospitals have been more likely to close in black neighborhoods each decade.\n\n\u201cIf you go downhill and abandon or relocate emergency rooms, operating rooms, stat imaging labs, it can be hard to re-create them,\u201d Sager said. \u201cIf the need is there, it\u2019s possible to re-establish services. But that requires a commitment, and it does require adequate financing.\u201d\n\nER vs. trauma center\n\nEMS data shows that its total call time \u2014 how long it takes from the moment ambulances are notified of an emergency until they drop off of a patient at the hospital and move onto the next one \u2014 has gone up by 7 percent since 2012. The department\u2019s call volume also has increased by 12 percent since 2012.\n\nThe increases are a concerning statistic to Metro Councilman and parish mayor-president candidate John Delgado, who said it shows that the entire city-parish is affected by the lack of an emergency room in north Baton Rouge. Chustz said EMS has not increased staffing or equipment.\n\n\u201cAre we now going to have to put more ambulances on the street and what cost to taxpayers?\u201d Delgado asked.\n\nProximity to an emergency room, rather than the level of care, is most important in four cases: when paramedics are unable to find airways and make patients breathe; when patients are in traumatic cardiac arrest; when more than 40 percent of a person\u2019s body is burned and they have no IV or cannot breathe; and when air is escaping out of a patient\u2019s lungs and into their chest. The Louisiana Emergency Response Network directs those patients to the nearest emergency room. A smaller emergency room might create an airway on a patient before he or she is transferred to a trauma center.\n\n\u201cIf I had a cardiac arrest, the person\u2019s not breathing, they have no pulse, of course I\u2019m going to take them to the closest hospital,\u201d Chustz said.\n\nWhether future patients could go to a hypothetical north Baton Rouge emergency room depends on the level of care the ER would offer. For example, Chustz said the Earl K. Long center did not treat head injuries, so proximity to that hospital, when it was open, didn\u2019t help patients with head wounds.\n\nChustz said the biggest benefit of having an emergency room in north Baton Rouge would be for patients who are not in need of critical care but still call ambulances. They include diabetics with blood sugar issues, people with broken bones and others who can tell that they do not feel right but are not sure what the problem is.\n\nOur Lady of the Lake\u2019s Trauma Center will nearly always receive the trauma calls. Among the many incidents qualifying for transport to a trauma center are adults who have fallen more than 20 feet; children who have fallen 10 feet; and people ejected from vehicles, run over by vehicles or in motorcycle crashes going more than 20 mph. People who have been shot also are typically taken to a trauma center.\n\n\u201cIn trauma, oftentimes, you bypass,\u201d said Paige Hargrove, Louisiana Emergency Response Network executive director. \u201cThere\u2019s so much literature out there to support that those trauma centers have the ability to find something that others don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOur Lady of the Lake also has the city\u2019s most robust Stroke Center \u2014 a level two \u2014 in comparison with the level-three stroke centers at Baton Rouge General, Lane Regional Medical Center in Zachary, Ochsner Medical Center and others.\n\nScott Wester, chief executive officer at Our Lady of the Lake, said people should realize they are getting better quality of care when they go to the Trauma Center and stroke centers as opposed to going to a closer-by hospital.\n\n\u201cAn emergency room by itself doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be a better level of care,\u201d Wester said.\n\nOur Lady of the Lake deferred to EMS and the Louisiana Emergency Response Network on the ambulance response times issue, while officials at Lane said they did not have anything more to add when asked about them.\n\nEvery emergency room in East Baton Rouge Parish is primed to receive major heart attack victims . But other smaller hospitals \u2014 such as the West Feliciana Parish Hospital and St. Elizabeth Hospital in Gonzales \u2014 are not as well-equipped to deal with them and refer patients to bigger hospitals.\n\nEMS is the first line of defense for emergencies in Baton Rouge, but calls also go through the private Acadian Ambulance Service, which backs up the department. Justin Cox, operations manager for Acadian Ambulance, said the data from EMS provides a better overview of the hospital closure impact because EMS is the primary ambulance provider.\n\nCox said changes in Acadian\u2019s average transportation times have been nominal.\n\nStandalone ER\n\nWorries about people in north Baton Rouge having to travel too far to emergency rooms have prompted numerous ideas from community leaders and organizing groups. The latest is a push to create a standalone emergency room at the Champion Medical Center in Howell Place.\n\nThe center opened in 2005 as the physician-owned Greater Baton Rouge Surgical Hospital, with 10 beds for elective surgeries. The hospital lost $6.8 million between 2007 and 2010, and when it closed in 2012, the former leader said it was not receiving enough patients.\n\nIt later became Champion Medical Center, which also does specialty surgeries, but more than 30,000 square feet of space is empty, and its Dallas-based owners at Cambridge Holdings Inc. want to lease it.\n\nElize Pruske, Cambridge\u2019s vice president of leasing and development, said the medical space has been built out and is ready to move into but that they have not received much interest from the local medical community. Both Barrow and Banks-Daniel are eyeing the space to fill the health care gap, and Barrow has a bill in the current legislative session to regulate freestanding emergency rooms.\n\nBut there\u2019s no funding and no partner in place yet.\n\nLocal hospital leaders have made it clear that they do not see building in north Baton Rouge as a viable venture.\n\n\u201cThere was not a sustainable path forward for the Mid City ER,\u201d said Baton Rouge General CEO Mark Slyter in a statement. \u201cOver the last year, we have worked diligently to develop a plan that is sustainable and that allows us to continue to care for the entire Baton Rouge community.\u201d\n\nThe unwillingness of hospitals to step forward to partner for proposed health care ideas in north Baton Rouge has frustrated north Baton Rouge political leaders.\n\n\u201cBased on the comments of our current hospital providers, I believe there is a clear indication that these providers are getting all the business from the north they want,\u201d Banks-Daniel said.\n\nAsked about hospital leaders saying they are not willing to step forward in north Baton Rouge, former state Sen. and current parish mayor-president candidate Sharon Weston Broome added, \u201cThat\u2019s a little insensitive, to be quite frank with you.\u201d\n\nWhile several groups are exploring the possibility of standalone emergency rooms \u2014 which do exist in other parishes in the Baton Rouge region \u2014 they are viewed skeptically by some experts because they often cannot treat critical patients and are more expensive for consumers than urgent care centers.\n\nSager, the health care policy expert from Boston, said freestanding emergency rooms make health care more fragmented if they are not affiliated with local hospitals and if they do not have integrated medical records.\n\nWalter Lane, a health care economics expert at the University of New Orleans, also is a critic of standalone emergency rooms. He said they often treat low acuity problems and that they cannot substitute for trauma centers or full-service hospitals.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not attached to a hospital, those are really glorified urgent care centers,\u201d he said. \u201cMy initial impression is they exist because if they call themselves an emergency room, they can charge more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baton Rouge, LA /News/: It took ambulances carrying Baton Rouge patients two minutes longer on average to arrive at an emergency room last year than it did in 2012, before two ERs closed in the city.
