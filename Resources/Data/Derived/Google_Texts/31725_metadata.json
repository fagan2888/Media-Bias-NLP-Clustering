Jeff Merkley with the right candidate. Jason Conger is that candidate.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan had a placard in his office with the words \u201cIt CAN Be Done.\u201d Many inside and outside of Oregon are looking at our U.S. Senate race and first asking, \u201cCan it be done?\u201d \u2013 can Democrat incumbent Jeff Merkley be beaten? The answer is a Reaganesque, \u201cIt CAN Be Done.\u201d\n\nThis is a winnable race, but Republicans must choose the right candidate. We cannot afford to nominate another first-time millionaire candidate, prone to gaffes, who the Democrats will exploit as \u201cout of touch\u201d. We need a battle-tested, full-service Republican who can unite Republicans, while appealing to working class Oregonians. We need a new kind of Republican whose personal background allows him to connect with swing voters and the working people of Oregon. That Republican is Jason Conger, a two-term legislator who\u2019s won twice in a district that\u2019s a microcosm of Oregon.\n\n\u201cMerkley\u2019s Reelection is No Sure Thing.\u201d Magellan Strategies BR concluded after a December poll that Merkley has some repair work to do.\n\nMagellan Strategies BR concluded after a December poll that Half of Oregon\u2019s voters have never heard of, or have no opinion of U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley . Just 37% have a favorable view of Merkley.\n\n. Just 37% have a favorable view of Merkley. Just 33% believe Merkley deserves reelection , while 35% prefer a new person and 33% say they don\u2019t know or it depends on who else is running.\n\n, while and 33% say they don\u2019t know or it depends on who else is running. Moore\u2019s survey was done months before the implosion of Obamacare. Merkley was one of the Senate Democrats who promised that if you like your health plan, doctor and insurance, you can keep them. Oregonians now know Merkley and Obama didn\u2019t tell them the truth about this.\n\nthe implosion of Obamacare. Merkley was one of the Senate Democrats who promised that if you like your health plan, doctor and insurance, you can keep them. Oregonians now know Merkley and Obama didn\u2019t tell them the truth about this. Magellan Strategies BR poll in December showed that 33 percent of Oregon voters think Merkley should be re-elected and 43 percent thinks it\u2019s time for a new person.\n\nIn 2008 \u2013 Merkley only won only 48.9% of the vote to Republican Sen. Gordon Smith\u2019s 45.6% . Barack Obama won 56.7% of the Oregon vote.\n\n. Barack Obama won 56.7% of the Oregon vote. Merkley will be running for re-election in a year that\u2019s historically devastating for the party in the White House, lashed to a president whose approval numbers are now lower than George W. Bush\u2019s at the same period of his presidency.\n\nIn 2010, the last non-presidential year with a competitive statewide race, Republican Chris Dudley lost by only 22,238 votes. Even then, Dudley was a political newcomer who made rookie mistakes, under-performed in 8 counties compared to recent statewide Republican candidates and failed to energize key parts of the GOP base.\n\nNew Endorsements!\n\nI am proud to announce the following Oregon elected officials have officially declared their endorsement for this campaign:\n\nState Senator Fred Girod\n\nState Senator Bruce Starr\n\nState Representative Jim Thompson\n\nState Representative Mark Johnson\n\nState Representative Kevin Cameron\n\nPreviously announced endorsements:\n\nState Representative Sherrie Sprenger\n\nState Representative Bill Kennemer\n\nState Representative Wally Hicks\n\nState Representative Vic Gilliam\n\nState Representative Vicki Berger\n\nState Senator Jackie Winters\n\nState Senator Herman Baertschiger\n\nState Senator Bill Hansell\n\nState Senator Tim Knopp\n\nState Senator Jeff Kruse\n\nState Senator Alan Olsen\n\nState Senator Chuck Thomsen\n\nState Senator Doug Whitsett\n\nState Representative Cliff Bentz\n\nState Representative John Davis\n\nState Representative Bob Jenson\n\nState Representative Mike McLane\n\nState Representative Andy Olson\n\nState Representative Julie Parrish\n\nState Representative Jim Weidner\n\nState Representative Gene Whisnant\n\nFrom homeless to Harvard and on to the Oregon House, I know what it is like to struggle to put food on the table, and I will stand up for all Oregonians, not just the privileged and well connected. As our United States Senator, I will fight for the middle class and for greater opportunities for Oregonians \u2013 just like I have in the State Legislature.\n\nRep. Jason Conger Passes Cover Oregon Reform\n\nMonday afternoon, February 24, 2014, the House Committee on Health Care passed two amendments to SB 1562A that will bring accountability and transparency reforms to Cover Oregon. Health Care Committee Chair Mitch Greenlick publicly recognized the good intentions of Rep. Conger\u2019s amendments during the February 12th work session on HB 4154 and worked with Rep. Conger to secure their passage.\n\nAt the conclusion of today\u2019s hearing, Rep. Jason Conger delivered the following remarks:\n\n\u201cAs my political hero Winston Churchill once said, \u2018Never, never, never give up!\u2019 After having tried three time to bring these amendments up for discussion, I am proud that our persistence has paid off.\u201d\n\n\u201cThroughout this process, colleagues on both sides of the aisle have expressed frustration that they\u2019re expected to act on important reforms with incomplete information. The failure of Cover Oregon to give timely and complete information prevented legislative oversight and got us into this mess in the first place. \u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been told by the exchange that the fee structure isn\u2019t enough for the program to be self-sustaining but Oregonians have no idea what fee increases, budgetary obligations, or benefit reforms are necessary moving forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been told that over 30,000 Oregonians have enrolled in the new Cover Oregon health care exchange but we have no actuarial data on the enrollment population. If, as expected, the insurance pool is dominated by high risk applicants what reforms are we going to implement to mitigate the cost of plans sold on the exchange?\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, by demanding that the Cover Oregon Executive Director provide us with these answers and by requiring the public release of all independent investigations, we\u2019re closer to understanding the full nature of problem. Today, we made a first step in restoring the broken trust with Oregon voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I want to thank the work of Chair Mitch Greenlick. Working together we made the outcome better.\u201d\n\nJason Conger for U.S. Senate", "article_metadata": {"wot-verification": "4539614150de0ef2ed1b", "og": {"site_name": "The Oregon Catalyst", "description": "Jason Conger for U.S. Senate A Winnable Race Oregon Republicans can defeat Democrat Sen.
