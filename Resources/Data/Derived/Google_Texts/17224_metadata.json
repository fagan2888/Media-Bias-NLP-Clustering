You spend a lot of money on something and most of the time, it lifts off the ground. But more frequently than you\u2019d like, it crashes, and when it does, it leaves a big fiery mess.\n\nHealthCare.gov is but one of those fiery crashes. Whether it was USAJobs.gov, or New York\u2019s CityTime project, governments have a history of expensive crashes.\n\nIn the case of HealthCare.gov, the root cause isn\u2019t the bugs we see in the software\u2019s code. Instead, it\u2019s the way that government procures things \u2014 in this case, software.\n\nThe regulation is 6,500 pages long, and if it isn\u2019t followed, people go to jail.\n\nThe result of this regulation? The contracts are going to the people who understand those regulations the best, not those who can do the best job.\n\nWhile HealthCare.gov\u2019s bugs might be an attractive target for those engaged in the sportsification of politics, the real bugs are in the federal acquisition. They prevent the small, innovative, agile tech firms that have given you a great user experience on the Web from even considering working with government.\n\nThis model of buying technology ensures the kind of failure that you see with HealthCare.gov. Any citizen who truly wants a government that spends money wisely and delivers good service ought to be more concerned with the fact that there\u2019s a new digital divide in America: the one between the public sector and the private. In order to bridge this gap, we\u2019ve got to fix the problems that created it to begin with.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "CLAY JOHNSON", "twitter": {"description": "The history of information technology acquisitions by the government is a bit like the history of helicopters.
