He said European countries \u201cseparately but relatedly\u201d don\u2019t spend enough on defense.\n\nIn the wake of the Paris attacks, the U.S. has agreed to enhanced intelligence-sharing with the French military to help it respond to fight Islamic State. The Pentagon isn\u2019t expected, however, to announce any new military deployments or step up airstrikes as a result of the attacks in Paris.\n\nMr. Carter said the U.S. has shifted its approach to the fight against Islamic State in the past few weeks, beginning even before the events in Paris.\n\n\u201cIn the last few weeks we got Jihadi John,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got the head of their nest, their metastasized nest in Libya\u2026 We started some sustained strikes on oil infrastructure\u2026 We are identifying and aiding able and capable and motivated ground forces.\u201d\n\nMr. Carter said the strike on Jihadi John, a British militant whose real name is Mohammed Emwazi, demonstrated improved U.S. capabilities\n\n\u201cI think Jihadi John probably overestimated his safety,\u201d Mr. Carter said.\n\nKey to defeating Islamic State in the long-term will be finding ground forces that can keep and hold territory, Mr. Carter said.\n\n\u201cWe need capable and motivated local forces who can keep the place running without extremism after ISIL has been defeated,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re hard to come by in Syria and Iraq but they do exist.\u201d\n\nPaul Morse/The Wall Street Journal\n\nIn Iraq, Mr. Carter said the U.S. hasn\u2019t yet received all of the authorizations for Sunni forces that it needs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Sunni areas where ISIL is, so those communities and those people need to decide that they need to participate and then hold that territory,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cWe can enable them, we can help them.\u201d\n\nFor the U.S., the most immediate danger from Islamic State and other extremist groups are lone wolf attacks inspired by the group, Mr. Carter said. The Chattanooga, Tenn. shooting at a military base over the summer resulted from a disaffected young man who \u201cwent on the internet, got all frizzed up and then went and bought a firearm.\u201d\n\nIslamic State is the first social-media terrorist organization he said, which the military is learning to adapt to.\n\nMr. Carter also discussed the U.S. outlook on Russia and China both of which have challenged the U.S. in the past year.\n\nRussia\u2019s role in Syria remains a complicating factor in the fight against Islamic State, Mr. Carter said. But Secretary of State John Kerry is working on finding a way to work with them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible\u2026 that they can get on the right side of things here, which is promoting a political transition in Syria,\u201d he said. The Russians can be helpful in persuading Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad to leave power, Mr. Carter said.\n\nIn Russia, Mr. Carter said the U.S. hasn\u2019t been as concerned with Moscow since the Cold War.\n\n\u201cWe are making adjustments in our own investments, in our own posture to take into account Russian moves and make sure we stay ahead,\u201d he said, such as positioning heavy equipment in countries surrounding it and strengthening NATO\u2019s posture.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis is a new playbook.\u201d\n\nWhile China has done little to respond to U.S. patrols in the South China Sea, Mr. Carter said China isn\u2019t the U.S.\u2019s only audience and its approach to trying to resolve claims aggressively has encouraged other nations in the Pacific to draw closer to the U.S.\n\nGordon Lubold contributed to this article.\n\nMore From WSJ CEO Council\n\nMarco Rubio Says GOP Rivals Paul and Cruz Tried to Weaken U.S. Intelligence Efforts\n\nFull coverage \u2014 articles and videos \u2014 from WSJ CEO Council\n\nMore Ash Carter Video:\n\nHas the U.S. Approach Towards ISIS Changed?\n\n* * *", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Defense Secretary Ash Carter Monday called on European nations to step up their involvement in the fight against Islamic State in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks.", "title": "Defense Chief Ash Carter Calls on Europe to Do More to Confront ISIS", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/16/defense-chief-ash-carter-calls-on-europe-to-do-more-to-confront-isis/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LH437_CEOCOU_P_20151116214008.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Defense Chief Ash Carter Calls on Europe to Do More to Confront ISIS", "description": "Defense Secretary Ash Carter Monday called on European nations to step up their involvement in the fight against Islamic State in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Felicia Schwartz", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Defense Secretary Ash Carter Monday called on European nations to step up their involvement in the fight against Islamic State in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-11-17T03:21:35-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/16/defense-chief-ash-carter-calls-on-europe-to-do-more-to-confront-isis/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-59286", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Defense Secretary Ash Carter Monday called on European nations to step up their involvement in the fight against Islamic State in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks.", "title": "Defense Chief Ash Carter Calls on Europe to Do More to Confront ISIS", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/16/defense-chief-ash-carter-calls-on-europe-to-do-more-to-confront-isis/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LH437_CEOCOU_P_20151116214008.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-59286", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-11-17T04:17:22-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0cfe\"", "article_summary": "Russia\u2019s role in Syria remains a complicating factor in the fight against Islamic State, Mr. Carter said.\nThe Russians can be helpful in persuading Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad to leave power, Mr. Carter said.\nIn Russia, Mr. Carter said the U.S. hasn\u2019t been as concerned with Moscow since the Cold War.\nKey to defeating Islamic State in the long-term will be finding ground forces that can keep and hold territory, Mr. Carter said.\nBut Secretary of State John Kerry is working on finding a way to work with them."}
