It shows that no, the government isn't lying about slower health-care costs\u2014they really are going up slower than they used to. But all those savings? They're not going to you, or me, or other consumers.

There's an awful lot still to be done to make healthcare affordable and universal in this country.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "So healthcare spending growth has hit a 53-year low , but how come your costs keep rising?
