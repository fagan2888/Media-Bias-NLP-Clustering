By Jamelle Bouie.\n\nThis was supposed to be Jim DeMint\u2019s moment. As head of the Heritage Foundation, chief sponsor of Heritage Action, and founder of the Senate Conservatives Fund, he had positioned himself as the Lex Luthor of American politics, a schemer who\u2014with the help of like-minded ideologues like Texas Senator Ted Cruz\u2014had whipped conservatives into a frenzy. With their control of the House of Representatives, and the debt ceiling and the continuing resolution, they would defund the Affordable Care Act, and land a mortal blow to the legacy of Barack Obama.\n\nStrategic recklessness aside, the chief problem with the plan was that it needed a weak, feckless opposition. But Obama and the Democrats wouldn\u2019t oblige. They held their ground, and when it became clear they would make no concessions, the scheme fell apart.\n\nBut rather than concede and move on, DeMint has redoubled his efforts to dislodge the president\u2019s health-care law. To wit, in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, he announced he will \u201ccontinue to fight\u201d to \u201cprotect the American people from the harmful effects of the law.\u201d\n\nThe obvious question is, \u201cwhy?\u201d Not only has the public voiced its intense dissatisfaction with the push to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but there\u2019s the tiny issue of elections: We\u2019re not even a year removed from the results of the last contest, where a solid majority of voters reelected Obamacare\u2019s namesake.\n\n\u201cBut aha!\u201d, says (my imagined) DeMint, teeth bared in a mischievous grin. \u201cThe public didn\u2019t endorse Obamacare at all!\u201d Or, as he writes in the op-ed, \u201cObamacare was not the central fight in 2012, much to the disappointment of conservatives. Republicans hoped that negative economic news would sweep them to victory, and exit polls confirmed that the economy, not health care, was the top issue. The best thing is to declare last year\u2019s election a mistrial on Obamacare.\u201d\n\nA \u201cmistrial?\u201d The only way to call the 2012 election a mistrial on the Affordable Care Act is to ignore the 2012 election.\n\nTo wit, Mitt Romney kicked off his general-election campaign with an ad that detailed his plans for day one of his administration. In his first 24 hours, President Romney would approve the Keystone Pipeline project, cut taxes, and repeal Obamacare.\n\nOver the next six months, Romney would talk about the first two items on that agenda, but he would focus on the third one. From his stump speeches, to his ads, to his address at the Republican National Convention, Romney was clear on his plans for the president\u2019s health-care law: \u201cWe must rein in the skyrocketing cost of health care by repealing and replacing Obamacare.\u201d He did the same in the days before the election, telling an audience in Wisconsin that\u2014on his first day in office\u2014he would issue waivers that would \u201cbegin to repeal\u201d the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe notion that the law was ancillary to last year\u2019s contest is ridiculous. If there was anything that anyone was certain to take away from the election, it was Romney\u2019s commitment to repealing Obamacare, and the president\u2019s commitment to defending it. DeMint\u2019s op-ed, in other words, is a load of nonsense. The public understood what it was doing when it reelected Obama; it was\u2014among other things\u2014giving him a chance to implement his health-care law.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "Mitt Romney, Jim DeMint, Tea Party, Obamacare, Debt Ceiling, government shutdown, Heritage Foundation, u.s. poli, 2012 Election, United States Senate", "publicationDate": 201310182150, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The Heritage chief wants Americans to believe they never voted in the 2012 elections.
