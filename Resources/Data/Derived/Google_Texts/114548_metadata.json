Photo: Bloomberg News\n\nCONCORD, N.H. \u2013 Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright offered a warning to young women who aren\u2019t inclined to elect Hillary Clinton the first female president.\n\n\u201cJust remember,\u201d Ms. Albright told the crowd at a get-out-the-vote rally for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for women who don\u2019t help each other.\u201d\n\nThe familiar phrase was a hit in the room, drawing cheers from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters. But online, the reaction was much different.\n\nPlayed in short video clips online or quoted in tweets, the quote almost sounded like a threat to other women: Help Hillary Clinton or else.\n\nSome on social media asked if they should also be helping the other woman in the 2016 race, former Hewlett-Packard chief Carly Fiorina. Others expressed surprise at the idea that a women should be forced to vote for a woman \u2014 instead of being free to chose based on issues. And some on Twitter took it a step further, with references to Bill Clinton\u2019s history with women during his time in the White House.\n\n@madeleine I\u2019m a good woman! But apparently I have a special place in hell? Thanks-but My God can decide that. #SetBackToWomen #FeelTheBern \u2014 canamgirl (@onmiemtp) February 6, 2016\n\nBut, Ms. Albright, who served in the Clinton administration was quoting herself. It\u2019s from a speech she gave in 2006 as a keynote speaker. As backlash spread, Jesse Lehrich, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s rapid-response spokesman, tweeted \u201cpeeps freaking out about that Madeleine Albright quote: It\u2019s not new \u2014 it was literally on a Starbucks cup.\u201d\n\nNick Merrill, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s press secretary, pointed out on Twitter that Ms. Albright had said this \u201cliterally hundreds of times.\u201d\n\nWith only three days remaining until New Hampshire\u2019s primary, Mrs. Clinton deployed some of her high-profile supporters, including Ms. Albright and Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.), during a busy day on the campaign trail.\n\nIn Concord, Ms. Albright shared stories of working with Mrs. Clinton during her eight years as first lady. And Ms. Albright made a forceful push for making history by electing a woman to the country\u2019s highest office.\n\n\u201cPeople are talking about revolution, so what kind of a revolution would it be to have the first woman president of the United States?\u201d Ms. Albright said, referring to Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s call for a political revolution.\n\nIn an effort to reach the young people the Clinton campaign is aiming to attract from its rival, the campaign advertised the event on the Students for Bernie Sanders subreddit group on the website Reddit and streamed it online on Facebook and received more than 100,000 views.\n\nMs. Albright said some young women don\u2019t understand the importance of supporting Mrs. Clinton, adding that there\u2019s more work to be done to break gender barriers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not done, and you have to help,\u201d Ms. Albright said. \u201cHillary Clinton will always be there for you.\u201d\n\nHigh Stakes in Tonight\u2019s GOP Debate\n\nHillary Clinton Knocks on Doors to Close Gap in New Hampshire\n\nClinton, Sanders Jockey in New Hampshire as Primary Looms\n\nPAC Payments Raise Questions Over Rubio Campaign Finance", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright offered a warning to young women who aren\u2019t inclined to elect Clinton, Hillary the\u00a0first female president.", "title": "Critics Pounce on Madeleine Albright\u2019s Exhortation to Women to Back Clinton", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/06/critics-pounce-on-madeleine-albrights-exhortation-to-women-to-back-clinton/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MM292_ALBRIG_P_20160206190323.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Critics Pounce on Madeleine Albright\u2019s Exhortation to Women to Back Clinton", "description": "Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright offered a warning to young women who aren\u2019t inclined to elect Clinton, Hillary the\u00a0first female president.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Colleen McCain Nelson and Natalie Andrews", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright offered a warning to young women who aren\u2019t inclined to elect Clinton, Hillary the\u00a0first female president.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-02-07T00:12:07-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/06/critics-pounce-on-madeleine-albrights-exhortation-to-women-to-back-clinton/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-60959", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright offered a warning to young women who aren\u2019t inclined to elect Clinton, Hillary the\u00a0first female president.", "title": "Critics Pounce on Madeleine Albright\u2019s Exhortation to Women to Back Clinton", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/06/critics-pounce-on-madeleine-albrights-exhortation-to-women-to-back-clinton/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MM292_ALBRIG_P_20160206190323.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-60959", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-02-07T15:22:02-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe19bf\"", "article_summary": "Photo: Bloomberg NewsCONCORD, N.H. \u2013 Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright offered a warning to young women who aren\u2019t inclined to elect Hillary Clinton the first female president.\nMs. Albright said some young women don\u2019t understand the importance of supporting Mrs. Clinton, adding that there\u2019s more work to be done to break gender barriers.\nENLARGE Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright at a rally on Saturday in New Hampshire.\nIn Concord, Ms. Albright shared stories of working with Mrs. Clinton during her eight years as first lady.\nPlayed in short video clips online or quoted in tweets, the quote almost sounded like a threat to other women: Help Hillary Clinton or else."}
