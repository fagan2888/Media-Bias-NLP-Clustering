This set of photos was predicated on the famous galaxy-cluster shot from the Hubble telescope released by NASA earlier this year. The image \u201cis a composite of separate exposures taken from 2003 to 2012,\u201d according to the European Space Agency/NASA press release in sharing the photo back in June.\n\nThe full set has been making the Internet rounds, the photos uncredited but the scale credible. This is one of those cases in which a picture speaks a thousand words, or in this case stars\u2014try hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe planet we\u2019re on, and the conflicts and heartbreaks we\u2019re embroiled in, seem so large, immutable and solid. But as these photos show, that is more an illusion than a fact.\n\nThe series starts out innocently enough with a photo of a giant-looking Earth, then pairs it with the moon, which still makes us look pretty impressive.\n\nBut the next few shots put us next to the other planets\u2014first our neighbors that are about our size, then with the gas giants of the outer solar system, and then, of course, with the sun.\n\nBut wait\u2014there's more. The sun, that ginormous orb, is dwarfed by the star Sirius. Which is in turn dwarfed by Pollux, which is miniscule next to Arcturus. Daunting doesn't even begin to describe it. But there are a few more stars to go\u2014and then come the galaxies.\n\nRELATED: Let's Get 'Sirius' About the Dog Star, Sky's Brightest Twinkler\n\nDon\u2019t forget\u2014we are made of this stuff.
