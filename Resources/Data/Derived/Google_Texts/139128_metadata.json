(Photo: Bullit Marquez, AP, 1991)\n\nIf current trends in greenhouse gas emissions continue, unprecedented megadroughts may plague much of the western USA, and the tropics may get so hot that widespread crop failures and famines become commonplace. There is a chance that climate change will prove truly catastrophic, with people suffering and dying in many parts of the world.\n\nWith the Earth in such a fevered state, there will be intense and irresistible pressure for politicians to do something, anything, to cool things off.\n\nOUR VIEW: Reflecting sunlight offers no quick fix for feverish planet\n\nPeople in crisis won't want to wait decades for carbon dioxide-polluting energy systems to be transformed. And even if emissions of all greenhouse gases were stopped suddenly, the Earth would remain hot for thousands of years. There is basically only one way known to cool the Earth rapidly.\n\nThe only thing politicians can do to cause Earth's climate to cool within their terms in office is to reflect more of the sun's warming rays back to space. We know this is possible because we have seen volcanoes do it. In 1991, the Mount Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines injected lots of small particles high in the atmosphere, and the next year the Earth cooled, despite the continued rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.\n\nA small fleet of airplanes could do what large volcanoes do \u2014 create a layer of small particles high in the atmosphere that scatters incoming sunlight back to space. Cooling the Earth this way could be fast, cheap and easy.\n\nWith the Earth in a fevered state, the pressure to put on a \"solar geoengineering\" ice pack could become irresistible, especially if this ice pack could potentially save millions of lives.\n\nIt is possible, of course, that sustaining the kind of aerosol layer that circled the Earth in 1991 would just make things worse. We just don't know. We need to do the research so that if a climate catastrophe does occur, politicians will know whether turning down the heat this way can really save lives and alleviate suffering.\n\nIgnorance is not an option. The cost of not knowing is too large. The ethical path forward is to generate the knowledge now that may be needed to save lives in the future.\n\nKen Caldeira is a climate scientist with the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1EeRrUC", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Solar geoengineering could be fast, cheap and easy, writes Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist with the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Solar geoengineering could be fast, cheap and easy, writes Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist with the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford.", "title": "One known way to cool the Earth: Another view", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/02/15/megadrought-climate-change-ken-caldeira-editorials-debates/23465975/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Solar geoengineering could be fast, cheap and easy, writes Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist with the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford.", "title": "One known way to cool the Earth: Another view", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc8e59b842c7cd27a5b67d19d9bfd014097dbb8c/c=170-0-853-683&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/02/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635596243655283945-OURVIEW.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Topics/Editorials and Debates", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Topics/Editorials and Debates", "title": "One known way to cool the Earth: Another view", "author": "Ken Caldeira", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d1d42fbdaa7f7391a071368d7404eef2f9ec7356/c=140-0-652-683/local/-/media/2015/02/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635596243655283945-OURVIEW.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04b8bec6b09be4c8ec13e127598f748ba87fa9e0/c=170-0-853-683/local/-/media/2015/02/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635596243655283945-OURVIEW.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/447d9c6343f1bfbbba93525ffc93f142ac3d3cf4/c=115-0-1023-683/local/-/media/2015/02/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635596243655283945-OURVIEW.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/547a220f236de3b9c488b2888dc57ab4c2701b96/c=0-105-1023-683&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/02/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635596243655283945-OURVIEW.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-02-15T19:19:04.523000-05:00", "shorthed": "How to cool the Earth: Another view", "articleid": 23465975, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f02a958f8e3aefc58c09599f576b304b0d6ee476/c=0-105-1023-683/local/-/media/2015/02/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635596243655283945-OURVIEW.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/caae9347944ffe72ade4cef8c23aab864a2e1014/c=189-0-571-683/local/-/media/2015/02/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635596243655283945-OURVIEW.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "megadrought, climate change, solar geoengineering, earth, Ken Caldeira, editorials, debates,"}, "article_summary": "There is basically only one way known to cool the Earth rapidly.\nA small fleet of airplanes could do what large volcanoes do \u2014 create a layer of small particles high in the atmosphere that scatters incoming sunlight back to space.\nCooling the Earth this way could be fast, cheap and easy.\nWith the Earth in such a fevered state, there will be intense and irresistible pressure for politicians to do something, anything, to cool things off.\nAnd even if emissions of all greenhouse gases were stopped suddenly, the Earth would remain hot for thousands of years."}
