But more importantly, they met Syrians who have lived for decades in North Jersey and who could offer help and understanding.\n\namy newman / staff photographer Newly arrived Syrian families gathered for a picnic at the park Sunday so they can meet, socialize and network within the Syrian community\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have papers here, you can\u2019t work and you can\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Nidal Almeslamani, 24, of Paterson, who came here two years ago and has a green card. He pointed to a friend, Mohamad Jalo, also 24, of Wayne, whom he met at a protest. \u201cThis guy here, he helped me find a job,\u201d he said.\n\nAlmeslamani is among hundreds of Syrians who have settled in North Jersey since fighting began in their country more than three years ago. The conflict started in March 2011 with anti-government protests and turned into a full-scale civil war following a brutal government crackdown. More than 191,000 people have been killed, according to a United Nations report last month, and 3 million people have fled the country.\n\nFor those who made it to the U.S., North Jersey is a destination because of the large Syrian-American community that has century-old roots here and because many have relatives here. But Syrian immigrants continue to struggle as they try to find jobs or, in some cases, get permanent resident status.\n\nAn informal network exists through word of mouth and through mosques and churches. The Wafa House charitable non-profit in Clifton has also offered help with legal services, therapy and food vouchers.\n\n\u201dWe want to bring those families together to meet each other, to expand their network and share experiences,\u201d said Hamid Imam, a Syrian-American activist from Paterson who organized the picnic. \u201cMaybe people will have jobs for them, or housing or simply friendship.\u201d\n\nFor sisters Mariam Alzouabi, 12, and Hoda Alzouabi, 15, the event was a chance to meet up with friends who also are from Syria.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy because they are here,\u201d said Mariam, who is learning English at her school in Paterson. \u201cIt\u2019s hard leaving your family and country.\u201d\n\nShe and her family escaped bombings, gunfire and hunger in Syria and made it to Jordan, where they got visas to travel to the U.S. The girls\u2019 father, Mahmoud Alzouabi, works as a janitor at the Islamic Center of Passaic County.\n\nAlmeslamani, 24, got out of Syria with the help of a sympathetic man who worked for the Assad regime. He also used a fake I.D., he said, because the regime targeted health-care workers like him if they were suspected of aiding the wounded from the opposition.\n\n\u201cI had applied for a visa [to the U.S.] before the fighting. I\u2019m lucky I got it in time,\u201d he said.\n\nHis friend, Jalo, said Syrian-Americans should reach out to newcomers because they need help and because any one of them could have been in their situation. The goal, he said, was to be unified like \u201ceid wahada\u201d \u2014 or \u201cone hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have this event so he knows that we are Syrian. If he needs help, he comes to us.\u201d\n\nSome activists also said they hoped the United States would do more to help Syrians settle here.\n\nSo far, 164 Syrians have been officially accepted as refugees since the war began. That\u2019s expected to increase, according to the State Department, because the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has determined that many are unlikely to be able to return home. The agency said it will make 130,000 referrals for refugee placement around the globe between 2014 and 2016. The United States is taking thousands of referrals and the screening process for applicants takes 18 to 24 months.\n\nOther Syrians have come to the U.S. as visitors and stayed. Between March 2012 CQ and January of this year, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has accepted 5,261 applications for temporary protected status from Syrians already in the U.S., approving 2,038 of those and denying 59 so far.\n\nOf those, 335 applications came from Syrians in New Jersey; 150 were approved, three were denied and the rest are pending. Immigration Services has granted asylum in about 1,200 other cases, sometimes involving whole families. Immigration courts approved an additional 83 applications for asylum out of 518 that were received in the past three years, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nEmail: adely@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "For Syrian families new to the U.S., a picnic on the Palisades offered a chance to set aside worry about their families back home and struggles to settle in a new country.
