Since Monday\u2019s \u201cstunning\u201d third place finish in the Iowa caucuses, Republican presidential contender and Florida Senator Marco Rubio has been subjected to indignities that would offend the sensibilities of even the most self-effacing circus chihuahua.\n\nRubio has faced mockery over his overly-triumphant Bronze Medal speech, taken \u201cbubble boy\u201d insults from a guy who barely outpolls stuffed manicotti, and watch freshly-minted endorser Rick Santorum completely faceplant when asked to name just one Rubio accomplishment. Now, he\u2019s even losing chunks of flesh to a guy who has to beg his own audiences for applause.\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush returned to the scene of Santorum\u2019s crime Friday morning wearing a bib, and Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough served him a plate of Rubio sashimi by asking him to comment on the thin list of \u201caccomplishments\u201d the Rubio campaign sent him after Santorum couldn\u2019t name any. That list, according to a Scarborough producer, consisted of \u201cV.A. accountability reform, Obamacare bailout, Girls Count Act, Venezuela sanctions, and Hezbollah sanctions.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty meager tapas plate to begin with, but by the time Bush dug in like a Berkshire pig with a tapeworm, there was nothing left:\n\nSCARBOROUGH: Marco Rubio was in the news yesterday because we had Rick Santorum on who couldn\u2019t list an accomplishment that \u2014 that he had. First of all, I want to ask you and I\u2019ll ask you two questions since we have a slight delay here. What do you think of Marco Rubio\u2019s list of accomplishments that his campaign got out after Rick Santorum couldn\u2019t name one? And give us your list. J. BUSH: Well, his list of fighting for additional sanctions for Hezbollah, which was done by unanimous consent \u2014 unanimously, literally, where he didn\u2019t show up to vote, that was one of them. BRZEZINSKI: Whoa. J. BUSH: I think he passed a bill\u2026 SCARBOROUGH: Wow. J. BUSH: \u2026 with Jeanne Shaheen that seemed pretty nice. That\u2019s his one bill that\u2019s became law. And that\u2019s about it. Oh, the risk corridor for Obamacare that \u2014 that actual sponsors of the amendment claim, correctly so, that they did it, and that was confirmed by the New York Times after they misreported it. So his record of accomplishment is slim. He was speaker of the House and he did a fine job there. But every speaker before him and after him but one that worked with both of us is supporting me\n\nNow, Jeb isn\u2019t being entirely fair to Rubio about the Hezbollah sanctions, he did sponsor the bill, so he had to have shown up at some point along the way, but on the so-called \u201cObamacare bailout,\u201d he\u2019s correct, Rubio got busted for that right on Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe worst part of this, though, isn\u2019t that Rubio is taking hits, it\u2019s that he\u2019s taking hits from this guy? Whatever bump Rubio received coming out of Iowa, the rest of his pals at the bottom of the pack are holding onto his ankles for dear life to try and keep him down there with them.\n\nThe Rubio campaign also needs to do a better job of selling their candidate\u2019s accomplishments, instead of cursing the poor unfortunate messenger. According to Politico, they had some choice words for Santorum:\n\n\u201cHe took a s\u2014,\u201d one Rubio insider said of Santorum\u2019s appearance.\n\nHey, maybe they should add that to the list of Rubio\u2019s accomplishments, he had to have done it at least once!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Looks like Marcomentum\u2122 isn't all fun and games.
