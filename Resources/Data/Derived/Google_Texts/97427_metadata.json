Tammy Duckworth in the northwest suburban 8th Congressional District could be a close one.\n\nA poll by GBA Strategies last month showed businessman Raja Krishnamoorthi with 41 percent, state Sen. Michael Noland with 27 percent and Villa Park Village President Deborah Bullwinkel with 5 percent. The poll of 400 likely voters was taken Feb. 9 to 11 for Krishnamoorthi\u2019s campaign, which released the results.\n\nConsidering the margin of error is 4.9 percent and 26 percent of those surveyed said they were undecided, some political observers say the race could be tight. An earlier poll taken in January by Public Policy Polling showed Noland with 22 percent, Krishnamoorthi with 17 percent, Bullwinkel with 11 percent and 50 percent undecided.\n\nKrishnamoorthi, a former state deputy treasurer who ran against Duckworth in 2012, has received the endorsements of high-ranking Democrats, like Sen. Dick Durbin and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Krishnamoorthi has also raised more money than the other candidates, with more than a million dollars on hand at the end of last year, according to federal campaign records.\n\n\u201c[Rep. Duckworth] has done an excellent job at constituent services, which is an important part of the job,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said. \u201cShe\u2019s also been in very close contact with all of the elected officials of the district to find out what their needs and wants are, which is something I would respectfully like to do should I be elected the next member of Congress from this area.\u201d\n\nNoland, on the other hand, had a little over $64,000 on hand by the end of last year. But he has the support of state Senate President John Cullerton and the state\u2019s largest public employee union, AFSCME Council 31. Noland, an attorney and Navy veteran, was first elected to the General Assembly in 2007.\n\n\u201cWhere I differ from [Rep. Duckworth] is our belief that we need to be a little bit more aggressive with respect to answering some of the requirements under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Noland said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see us perhaps shift to a single-payer universal health care. I think she would have taken a more graduated approach to that. So, I\u2019d like to see us \u2026 make health care a right and not so much a privilege.\u201d\n\nBullwinkel began her political career in 2009 when she was elected as a village trustee in Villa Park. She then successfully ran for village president in 2013. She previously worked as a reporter for the Lisle Sun and as a director for two mental health organizations. Bullwinkel had $14,000 on hand at the end of last year, according to financial reports.\n\n\u201c[Rep. Duckworth] has made herself available,\u201d Bullwinkel said. \u201cThat is one of the things I will hope to have the opportunity to follow along in her tradition \u2013 being accessible and available to the people of the 8th Congressional District.\u201d\n\nWhoever wins the Democratic primary will face Republican Peter DiCianni, a DuPage County board member, in the November general election.\n\nDetails about the District\n\nThe 8th Congressional District includes Elk Grove Village, Schaumburg, Elgin and a western portion of O'Hare Airport.
