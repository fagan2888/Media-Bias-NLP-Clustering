Republicans gained control of the U.S. Senate, retained control of the U.S. House, held onto most of the governorships they started with while picking up surprise wins in the traditional Democratic bastions of Maryland, Massachusetts, and Illinois, also picking up several state legislative chambers.\n\nGrace-Marie Turner, head of the Galen Institute, a health care think-tank, cited pre-election polling showing the health care law would be a deciding factor for a majority of voters in swing Congressional districts.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama pledged to Democratic members of Congress in 2010 that if they voted for the law, voters would thank them,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThe opposite happened, and Democratic losses in 2010 and 2014 can be directly tied to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nHealth care policy scholar Michael Cannon of the Cato Institute shared Turner\u2019s view. \u201cThough Democrats tried to deny it, Republicans made a big issue of their opposition to Obamacare during the election, and they won,\u201d Cannon said.\n\nCorbett lost his reelection bid after expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nCampaigns Focused on Obamacare\n\n\n\nSome campaign watchers had predicted Obamacare would fade as a campaign issue. An August 19 story at Bloomberg.com by Heidi Przybyla cited a reduction in anti-Obamacare ads in the North Carolina U.S. Senate race, concluding it was \u201ca sign that the party\u2019s favorite attack against Democrats is losing its punch.\u201d\n\nBut an analysis by Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group found between October 6 and October 26 Obamacare was the top issue in ads run by Republican candidates for U.S. Senate. Over that period Republicans aired nearly 37,000 spots criticizing the law and their opponent\u2019s support for it, more than any other issue.\n\nIn addition, a November 3 article by Sarah Ferris in The Hill cited National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesman Daniel Scarpinato saying Obamacare was one of the most important issues of 2014 and noting nearly one-third of all NRCC ads in the cycle had been about Obamacare, more than any other issue.\n\nSally Pipes, president of the Pacific Research Institute, told Health Care News, \u201cHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) predicted in March that Obamacare would be a \u2018winning issue\u2019 for Democrats in the midterm election\u201d despite polls consistently showing a majority of Americans did not support the law. \u201cThe election results of November 4 reveal that the polls were correct, Ms. Pelosi was wrong, and the voters tossed out many of those candidates who were supporters of Obamacare,\u201d Pipes concluded.\n\n\u2018If You Like Your Plan\u2026\u2019\n\n\n\nRepublican candidates were able to use the statements of many incumbent Democratic U.S. Senators about Obamacare against them in ads that began early in the election cycle.\n\nAs far back as January, the pro-free market group Americans for Prosperity unveiled ads against Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. The ads specifically cited each for their statements echoing President Obama\u2019s claim, \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\u201d The issue was a staple of ads throughout the campaign.\n\nHagan lost, and Landrieu faces a difficult December runoff. Shaheen barely managed to hang on to her seat against Republican Scott Brown, a former U.S. Senator from Massachusetts. Other Democratic senators hurt by similar statements included Colorado\u2019s Mark Udall, Arkansas\u2019 Mark Pryor, and Alaska\u2019s Mark Begich, all of whom lost.\n\nDemocratic Senators who potentially have tough re-election campaigns in 2016 may face criticism for similar statements, including Harry Reid of Nevada and Michael Bennett in Colorado.\n\nExchange Failures Hurt Democrats\n\nThe botched implementation of Obamacare at the state level may also have contributed to two surprise Republican wins in the Democrat-friendly states of Maryland and Massachusetts.\n\nIn Maryland, Democrat nominee Lt. Governor Anthony Brown was given the responsibility of overseeing the rollout of the exchange. The site crashed immediately after opening for business, and Brown drew heavy criticism for the failures of the site.\n\nLater reports revealed Brown and others in Maryland ignored several warnings the project was not meeting its goals and would not function as needed in the year leading up to the launch.\n\nBrown\u2019s Republican challenger, Larry Hogan, made the failed launch of Maryland\u2019s Obamacare exchange a central point of his campaign in questioning whether the Lt. Governor was ready for a promotion to the Governor\u2019s office.\n\nIn an ad titled \u201cWeak Leadership,\u201d Hogan blamed Brown for \u201c$169 million wasted\u201d and \u201cfamilies unable to get health insurance,\u201d concluding with, \u201cAnthony Brown: Just not ready to be governor.\u201d Hogan also brought up the botched rollout in debates, calling it a \u201ccomplete disaster\u201d and pointing out Brown\u2019s responsibility for the failure.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Attorney General and Democratic nominee for governor Martha Coakley appointed three members to the ten-person board of the Health Connector, as the exchange is known as in the state. Coakley strongly defended her appointees in the aftermath of the site\u2019s failure, even after it was shown her appointees knew about the exchange\u2019s troubles but ignored them and allowed the site to be launched.\n\nHer Republican opponent, health care executive Charlie Baker, made her defense of the appointees a campaign issue, charging in a release, \u201cBeacon Hill needs real leaders willing to ask tough questions, especially when it comes to spending hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars, and the Attorney General proved she is not up to the task.\"\n\nSean Parnell (sparnell@heartland.org) is managing editor of Health Care News.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Grace-Marie Turner, head of the Galen Institute, a health care think-tank, cited pre-election polling showing the health care law would be a deciding factor for a majority of voters in swing Congressional districts.\n\u201cThough Democrats tried to deny it, Republicans made a big issue of their opposition to Obamacare during the election, and they won,\u201d Cannon said.\nCampaigns Focused on ObamacareSome campaign watchers had predicted Obamacare would fade as a campaign issue.\nThe passage and botched implementation of the Affordable Care Act played a significant role in the November election outcome, say several experts contacted by Health Care News.\nSean Parnell (sparnell@heartland.org) is managing editor of Health Care News."}
