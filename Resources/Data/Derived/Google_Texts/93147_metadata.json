You\u2019re feeling crummy, so you call your family doctor for a checkup.\n\nThe next day, he shows up at your house and asks to see your kitchen pantry, fridge and freezer. You\u2019re astonished. He eyes your stash of cola and Oreos, smiles warmly, and wanders over to your pots and pans (assuming you have some.) \u201cDo you own a grill pan?\u201d the good doctor asks.\n\n\u201cWhat about a food processor?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many meals do you cook at home every week?\u201d\n\nWhat? Welcome to the world of culinary medicine, a delicious new movement in health care that recognizes and celebrates the importance of real food \u2014 especially cooking it at home \u2014 when it comes to quickly, substantially, improving your health.\n\nDr. Rani Polak is a teacher of culinary medicine, a physician-chef at the Institute of Lifestyle Medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nHe knows that people who cook at home tend to be healthier. They consume more fruits and veggies, eat healthier fats and have easier portion control. As a result, they are less overweight, with better digestion and stronger hearts. But people aren\u2019t cooking nearly as much as they used to. (Let\u2019s hear it for bringing back home economics.) \u201cThere\u2019s been a 42 percent increase in eating away from home in the last 40 years,\u201d reports Polak, who has devoted his practice to getting people cooking again, including doctors themselves, who spend most of medical school eating from vending machines.\n\nHere\u2019s the bitter truth: Most doctors in the U.S. know next-to-nothing about nutrition. It\u2019s still not part of the training in about 75 percent of medical schools. This is in spite of a recent JAMA article acknowledging that a poor diet is the No. 1 risk factor for disease and death in the U.S.This is a disconnect the size of Rhode Island.\n\nAnd it\u2019s one reason why culinary medicine started percolating back in 2008, when chef-physician John La Puma published his book called \u201cChefMD\u2019s Big Book of Culinary Medicine.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still a great resource and guide to building a \u201cculinary medicine chest\u201d with 50 foods that help prevent and control a variety of health issues, from Arthritis to Zits.\n\nCurrently, there are about 30 institutions around the country teaching Culinary Medicine, including Polak\u2019s. I recently sat in on one of his classes, and here are a few highlights:\n\nAny kind of cooking is better than none. \u201cIt almost doesn\u2019t matter what people cook at home,\u201d Polak reports. The important thing is that you cook. Any style of cooking is better for your health than no cooking.\n\nExpect obstacles. Finding the time to cook is a common problem people wrestle with. Get over it. If you\u2019re being true to yourself about improving your health, then you\u2019ll make the time. Cook multiple meals at one session and store them in the freezer. Lentils freeze well. So do chickpeas and rice. Once you have a taste of success preparing simple, tasty meals, your confidence will sizzle.\n\nImplement your plan. \u201cBuy a grill pan and use it,\u201d Polak advises. Add a little olive oil, and it\u2019s perfect for stovetop grilling vegetables (like eggplant or asparagus that don\u2019t need to cook through), chicken breasts, fish fillets, thin sliced beef.\n\nFood over supplements. Polak talks to clients about eating fish, not omega-3. He\u2019d rather you get fiber from vegetables, not fiber pills.\n\nIf culinary medicine spreads, more patients will come home from their doctor\u2019s office with prescriptions for spinach-feta frittatas, and America\u2019s health care crisis will fizzle faster than a deep-fried corn dog.\n\nMarilynn Preston is a fitness expert, personal trainer and speaker on healthy lifestyle issues.
