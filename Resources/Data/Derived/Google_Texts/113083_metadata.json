Rash Curtis & Associates specializes in customer-focused collections from patients for remaining out-of-pocket liability. The result is a coordinated solution to minimize a provider\u2019s unpaid, underpaid and disputed insurance claims, bad debts and charity care and to relieve as much of the financial burden as possible from patients and their providers.\n\nAn unfavorable by-product of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is the \u201cchurning\u201d of patients between Insurance Coverage, Federal, State & Local Benefit Programs and Self-Pay status for various reasons, including constantly evolving changes in income and patient non-payment of insurance premiums. When a self-pay patient is treated and/or the Qualified Health Plan Insurance (QHP) denies payment for non-coverage, the coordination between Eligibility/Enrollment, Insurance Denial Appeals and Self-Pay Collection Services is more important than ever to confirm whether the optimum solution for an unfunded account is through Coverage, Appeal or Self-Pay Collections.\n\nTerry & Natasha Paff, Owners of Rash Curtis & Associates and Al Leibovic, Founder and President of Health Advocates are excited to partner with each other to deliver a broad array of Revenue Cycle services. According to Mr. Leibovic, \u201cWe are convinced that by working together, we are better able to guide our respective provider clients through the challenges presented by the roll-out of ACA Health Reform and the increasing complexities of the Revenue Cycle reimbursement spectrum.\"\n\nMr. Paff states, \u201cThe two companies will now be able to offer and provide a broad array of services that include pre- and post-discharge patient eligibility screening and receivable management services, including, but not limited to, insurance claim appeals, zero-balance account review and recovery, early out and self-pay collections.\u201d\n\nBoth agree that, \u201cBy joining forces, we enhance our tools, resources and overall services to our existing clients and patients by offering more services.\u201d\n\nAbout Health Advocates\n\nFounded in 1990, Health Advocates is one of California\u2019s largest privately funded Eligibility and Revenue Cycle company with nearly 400 FTEs.
