A candlelight vigil was held Thursday in Meridian to honor homicide victims. It's an effort to let the victims' loved ones know the community cares.

Members of Mothers of Murdered Children say they will not let people be forgotten this Christmas, because they let individuals going through a hard time know they matter and there are people to help. Organizer Sherren Smith says they are starting the new year with positivity by encouraging people to take advantage of job training and other assistance in our area to become productive citizens.

"We are having so many things going on now with our youth, our young adults. There is crime and homicides and different things like that, and we want to be able to reach our children before they are gone," said Williams.
