Or at least, like the Italians used to eat.\n\nAs a new mother in Italy, Marshall was ready to embrace a culture that, she believed, would allow her to raise a child more healthfully than she could have back home in Canada, where fast food and packaged snacks reign over fresh ingredients and home cooking. She still believes that, but she\u2019s also seen how that \u201ctraditional\u201d culture is rapidly disappearing, as the food industry continues to take over the world.\n\nThe food industry doesn\u2019t need to be fixed, Marshall decided \u2014 it needs to be abandoned. In its place, she says, we need a new culture: one that pays less attention to nutrition science and puts a premium on real food instead. Her book, The Lost Art of Feeding Kids, which hits U.S. shelves in January, makes a compelling case for how that can be done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the problem when you\u2019re in the middle of it,\u201d Marshall says, \u201cand it\u2019s hard to see your own culture when you\u2019re in the middle of it, too.\u201d She spoke with Salon about the real meaning of \u201chealth,\u201d how the system can help working families, and raising a kid who\u2019s into the idea of eating snails. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed.\n\nRaising your son in Italy was a very different experience for you than it would have been had you raised him in Canada. What are some of the assumptions you had about feeding kids that you\u2019ve come to question?\n\nMy son, Nico, is almost 9 now, but when he was first born, I hadn\u2019t really been around children that much. All of the things that I had to call upon were from my own experience growing up in Canada, where there were foods for children. When he started eating solid foods he would be picky about things, and I\u2019d think, \u201cWell, certainly our culture has made something for this problem, I\u2019ll just go to the supermarket and look for it.\u201d\n\nI think I expected that the problem was taken care of for me, that I could go to the store and buy packages of macaroni in boxes and things like that which were meant for children. I didn\u2019t find them, and when I did, they looked so ghastly that it made me stop and think. I started to look around and I realized that the Italians didn\u2019t do that. Sometimes I thought, \u201cReally, you\u2019re just going to cook constantly?\u201d That surprised me, just the idea that you would make a meal for the child or expect the child to eat what you\u2019re eating.\n\nSo from the beginning, the Italians you met were feeing their children like little adults, and there wasn\u2019t a separate class of food for children?\n\nYeah, but it\u2019s changing. I\u2019m sure if I went to a baby group right now, even in these few years that have intervened, it would be quite different. But I used to feel this expectation that you would just cook what you were going to be making for your family and you would prepare it in such a way that the baby could eat it, by pureeing it and adding the nice, healthy broth \u2013 that you\u2019d also made \u2013 to go with it. Once I started doing it, I realized it\u2019s not hard. In fact, it\u2019s easier than going out and trying to stock up on all these products that you have to carry around with you. To actually just feed the child the same thing you\u2019re eating is so much easier.\n\nWould you say your son\u2019s embraced most of that? Is he less picky than other kids?\n\nHe had some pickiness, for sure, and he still does. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s perfect. Sometimes when friends have read the book, they come over and try to find the food he won\u2019t eat, just to show me up. And it\u2019s not hard to do if you go outside of Italian culture. But within Italian culture, it\u2019s kind of interesting to me that he will eat just about anything. That includes things that in North American culture children don\u2019t eat. He loves anchovies, he loves octopus, he actually wants to eat snails.\n\nAt the same time, we went to an Indian restaurant. He was quite excited by the different culture and the smells and the music. But he would only eat plain rice and drink a mango lassi. So he\u2019s very much into Italian food and that\u2019s a very broad category. But I think we\u2019ll have to wait until he is a teenager to really get him to explore other cultures and their foods as well.\n\nYou cite a lot of interesting research about how children start to develop their culture\u2019s taste through breast milk, and even earlier in the womb. Is there a certain point where their culture\u2019s food become ingrained, after which it might be too late to embrace new things?\n\nIt\u2019s hard, because here I think kids are getting much more of a mixture than they would have had in the past. I haven\u2019t looked at the recent statistics, but even in Italy, breast-feeding was losing favor for a while. Now it seems to be becoming more accepted again. That\u2019s pretty essential to introducing your child to some of the flavors that they\u2019ll have later on.\n\nThen I think the next step that\u2019s really important is introducing solid foods when they\u2019re around six months old. What we were doing was looking for the packages and the jars of food, and what Italian women were doing was pureeing dinner and making the broth. That was a huge step in getting children to learn and understand the taste of their own culture.\n\nBut really once their toddlers are walking around, there are a lot more foods that are available to them now. There are these horrible snack cakes that are everywhere \u2013 Mulino Bianco. The E.U. recently shook their finger at them because of a recent ad they had, where one child says to another, \u201cI don\u2019t eat it because it\u2019s good, I eat it because it\u2019s healthy.\u201d All they are is white flour and sugar; there\u2019s nothing healthy in them. Even a lot of my friends will argue with me, saying \u201cThey\u2019re healthy, they\u2019re fine.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a strange interpretation of \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nI think they argue that because they look sort of like the sweets Italians might make in their homes. But what they are not realizing is that when you make sweets in your home, you might eat them once a week. Kids are eating these things several times a day \u2014 morning snack, afternoon snack, they\u2019re just carrying these things around. So that\u2019s probably introducing a lot more sugar into the diet of children here than they would\u2019ve had 20 or 30 years ago.\n\nSometimes Italians will say something is healthy when it isn\u2019t, when it\u2019s just traditional. I think that is an interesting confusion that they make. Because for the most part, their traditional food is healthy. Even having that slice of cake at the end of the meal on the weekend is healthy, because you had it at the end of the meal and it makes you happy and you\u2019re eating it with your family. I think that probably plays a role in their health right along with the green vegetables and all of those other things. So sometimes I think it\u2019s not just the individual food, it\u2019s the way the whole thing works together.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, though, because we get obsessed with individual foods \u2013 I certainly do myself. Now I\u2019m noticing that a lot of my Italian friends are talking about what vitamins are in certain vegetables when I swear three years ago they had no idea. They just knew that you eat all these foods; it\u2019s part of their culture and their culture, for the most part, is healthy.\n\nAnd what do we know about what\u2019s healthy anyway? The next study that comes out will probably tell you that kale isn\u2019t good for you.\n\nYou make a pretty strong argument that the science of nutrition and food labels and all of that are hurting more than they\u2019re helping, because they\u2019re causing people to focus on the wrong aspects of food.\n\nI think that that is true. A few nutritionists in Canada got in touch with me and told me they agreed with me, and I was really surprised. I met a woman for lunch who was coming to Rome, and she felt the same way, that the whole science of nutrition is still very new and sensitive in many ways. But we take those studies and we think that they are sometimes more meaningful than they really are. Sometimes the industry distorts the studies or will use them to promote some of their own products. So I think we just get so confused. And to me, it just seems like, let\u2019s not pay quite so much attention to it, because it is confusing. And it detracts from the pleasure that you get from eating as well. If all you are thinking about is the nutritive quality of the food, it\u2019s not very pleasurable.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Journalist Jeannie Marshall explains why kids need real food", "title": "The only way to defeat the food industry: Cook more", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Journalist Jeannie Marshall explains why kids need real food", "title": "The only way to defeat the food industry: Cook more", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/01/the_only_way_to_defeat_the_food_industry_cook_more/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/potato_peeler.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Journalist Jeannie Marshall explains why kids need real food", "title": "The only way to defeat the food industry: Cook more", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/potato_peeler.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Cooking, Editor's Picks, food culture, Food Industry, healthy food, Italy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ca3\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Cooking, Editor's Picks, food culture, Food Industry, healthy food, Italy, Sustainability News, Life NewsIf Jeannie Marshall were in charge, we\u2019d all be eating like the Italians.\nSo sometimes I think it\u2019s not just the individual food, it\u2019s the way the whole thing works together.\nShe still believes that, but she\u2019s also seen how that \u201ctraditional\u201d culture is rapidly disappearing, as the food industry continues to take over the world.\nThe food industry doesn\u2019t need to be fixed, Marshall decided \u2014 it needs to be abandoned.\nSo from the beginning, the Italians you met were feeing their children like little adults, and there wasn\u2019t a separate class of food for children?"}
