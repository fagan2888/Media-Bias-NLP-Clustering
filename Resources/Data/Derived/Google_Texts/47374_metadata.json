Some had led state ballot initiatives that effectively barred same-sex couples from legal marriage.\n\nYet, when the court issued its decision on June 26, Church leaders properly marked the occasion as a turning point with likely dangerous consequences.\n\nAs faithful shepherds, they signaled their unchanged commitment to teach that God intended marriage to be a union of one man and one woman and to defend the right of children to be raised, when possible, by their natural mother and father.\n\nMany expressed alarm regarding the ruling\u2019s impact on religious freedom, even as they urged Catholics to respect and welcome persons with same-sex attraction. There were stern moral judgments that described the court\u2019s decision as a \u201ctragic error\u201d and a smattering of more nuanced opinions that revealed a desire to mitigate church-state tensions in a changing world.\n\nLove and Truth\n\nHowever, Archbishop Kurtz\u2019s forthright articulation of Church teaching set the tone and the course for the bishops in the aftermath of this momentous decision. It also signaled an intent to use the ruling as a teaching moment for an anxious flock.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ, with great love, taught unambiguously that, from the beginning, marriage is the lifelong union of one man and one woman. As Catholic bishops, we follow Our Lord and will continue to teach and to act according to this truth,\u201d stated Archbishop Kurtz.\n\nHe called on the faithful to love their neighbors, \u201ceven those who hate us or would punish us for our faith and moral convictions.\u201d And he urged all those \u201cin positions of power and authority to respect the God-given freedom to seek, live by and bear witness to the truth.\u201d\n\nFinally, he rebuked judges and lawmakers who endorsed same-sex \u201cmarriage\u201d: \u201cThe law has a duty to support every child\u2019s basic right to be raised, where possible, by his or her married mother and father in a stable home.\u201d\n\nCompared with President Barack Obama\u2019s ringing endorsement of the court\u2019s decision as the proper fulfillment of the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of \u201cequal protection of the law,\u201d Archbishop Kurtz\u2019s firm statement of faith was all the more striking.\n\n\u2018Recipe for Tyranny\u2019\n\nDuring a day that featured the fa\u00e7ade of the White House bathed in rainbow-colored spotlights and millions tweeting their support for the ruling, the USCCB head\u2019s moral rebuke to the court was echoed by other Church leaders.\n\n\u201cThis decision reflects a deep confusion about the meaning of marriage, the family and the human person; about individual liberty; and about the role of the courts and legislatures in our democratic system of self-government,\u201d stated Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles.\n\nArchbishop Thomas Wenski of Miami issued an even stronger repudiation of the decision: \u201cAllowing \u2018an act of the will\u2019 to be substituted for \u2018legal judgment\u2019 is a recipe for tyranny.\u201d\n\nA number of Church leaders who reacted to the ruling highlighted natural-law principles that undergird Catholic teaching on marriage, which the Church hallows as a sacrament.\n\nEven as the court attributed a moral equivalence of traditional marriage with same-sex unions, these bishops reminded their flocks that the fundamental rights of spouses and children existed prior to the power of the state to redefine marriage.\n\n\u201cMarriage is a natural institution that predates and precedes governments and government regulation,\u201d read a statement issued by Archbishop Paul Coakley of Oklahoma City, who articulated national-law principles that once guided the state\u2019s interest in marriage as a union of one man and one woman.\n\n\u201cSociety needs an institution that connects children to their mothers and fathers, and marriage is the only institution that by its nature is able to accomplish this,\u201d said Archbishop Coakley.\n\n\u201cChildren have a basic right, wherever possible, to know and be loved by their mother and father together in a stable union.\u201d\n\nBishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, R.I., who had fought repeated efforts to change Rhode Island's marriage laws, until legislation was approved in 2013, defended the unchanging nature of a bedrock institution.\n\n\u201cA thousand courts may rule otherwise, but the very notion of \u2018same-sex marriage\u2019 is morally wrong and a blatant rejection of God\u2019s plan for the human family,\u201d stated Bishop Tobin.\n\n\u201cAs Pope Francis taught while serving as archbishop in Argentina: \u2018Same-sex marriage is not simply a political struggle, but it is an attempt to destroy God\u2019s plan. It is a move of the Father of Lies, who seeks to confuse and deceive the children of God.\u2019\u201d\n\nStatements also clarified the connection between biblical teaching on marriage and natural law.\n\n\u201cMarriage is rooted in creation: God created marriage in the very same breath as he created the human person, and for the Catholic Church, that will not change,\u201d stated Bishop Richard Malone of Buffalo, N.Y., the chairman of the U.S. bishops\u2019 Committee on Laity, Marriage, Family Life and Youth.\n\nConsequences for Religious Freedom\n\nWhile many Church leaders focused on the dangers that the court\u2019s decision posed for the rights of natural parents and their children, a number expressed alarm about the consequences for religious freedom.\n\nThe majority opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy \u201crecognizes free-speech rights of religious people to speak and advocate, but does not acknowledge the free exercise of religion, the right to implement Church teaching and the right to follow Church teaching when interacting with the broader society,\u201d noted Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore, the bishops\u2019 point man on religious freedom.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision, I believe, will give rise to many challenges and legal controversies, and we will do our best to protect ourselves, in terms of how we organize and run our ministries, and to advocate for protections at the state and local levels.\u201d\n\nIndeed, recent litigation initiated by same-sex couples who were denied services for their weddings by Christian businesses and the campaign of attacks on state versions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act point to the challenges ahead.\n\nYet Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of Galveston-Houston, the vice president of the bishops\u2019 conference, vowed that Church leaders would not back off from their defense of religious liberty.\n\nThe Church will \u201csupport public-policy issues, including a version of the marriage and religious-freedom act.\u201d\n\nReaffirming Respect\n\nChurch leaders were at pains to balance their expressions of outrage and dismay with a clear regard for the dignity and respect due every person.\n\n\u201cCertainly, every citizen of this land, regardless of their sexual orientation, deserves to be respected in their personal and civic life,\u201d stated Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley of Boston, where same-sex civil marriage has been the law of the land for more than a decade.\n\nWhile Cardinal O\u2019Malley also expressed his \u201csadness\u201d and \u201cdisappointment\u201d at the decision, a few Church leaders offered a more nuanced and necessarily subdued message.\n\n\u201c[T]he Catholic Church has an abiding concern for the dignity of gay persons,\u201d stated Archbishop Blase Cupich of Chicago.\n\n\u201cThis respect must be real, not rhetorical, and ever reflective of the Church\u2019s commitment to accompanying all people.\u201d\n\nArchbishop Cupich, who used part of his June 26 statement to express support for the court\u2019s latest ruling on the Affordable Care Act, sought to draw a distinction between civil and sacramental marriage.\n\nThe court\u2019s \u201credefinition of civil marriage has no bearing on the Catholic sacrament of matrimony,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chicago archbishop appeared to stake out a limited sphere of influence for the Church \u2014 ideally, a position that would mitigate any direct threat to the free-exercise rights of Church institutions, but also one that would restrict the Church\u2019s voice on this matter in the public square.\n\nFurther, Archbishop Cupich\u2019s statement seemed intended to reassure same-sex couples and their families that he welcomed future collaboration and saw no need for tensions.\n\nTeaching Moment\n\nBut if some Church leaders opted to maintain a low profile, most used the historic decision as a teaching moment.\n\nCardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington provided the most comprehensive response to the court\u2019s decision, with point-by-point answers to a range of questions about the Church\u2019s now-unique stance on marriage.\n\nLike many of his peers, Cardinal Wuerl drew a bright line between civil law and religious teachings proclaimed over millennia. But he also offered a more developed treatment of the role and significance of sexual complementarity in the Church\u2019s understanding of marriage.\n\n\u201cOur faith is not based on human preferences, but the revealed word of God,\u201d said Cardinal Wuerl, quoting Jesus\u2019 words to the Pharisees in Matthew 19. \u201cMarried love is unique in God\u2019s plan for the bodily union of a husband and wife.\u201d\n\nMost strikingly, he directly engaged claims by homosexual-rights groups that have charged that Christian teaching on marriage fuels bigotry against persons with same-sex attraction.\n\n\u201cChurch teaching and common sense make a distinction between who a person is and what that person does,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are also called to follow God\u2019s plan and the moral law expressed, for example, in the [Ten] Commandments, the Sermon on the Mount and the reflection on the Last Judgment (Mark 10:17-21; Luke 18:18-22; Matthew 5, 6 and 7; Matthew 19:17-20; Matthew 25:31-46),\u201d the Washington archbishop said. \u201cThe ancient maxim \u2018Love the sinner, but hate the sin\u2019 is central to our behavior, because it refers to all human beings.\u201d\n\nHis calm dismissal of the charge that opposition to \u201cmarriage equality\u201d necessarily constituted an act of discrimination fortified the faithful as they stood apart from the celebratory mood on television and social media.\n\nYes, practicing Catholics might well feel like outsiders in their own country. And so the bishops offered a final consideration to those who might be tempted to set aside their objections to redefining marriage and enter into the festivities.\n\nThe high court\u2019s decision to impose the will of a slim majority on the entire nation, sweeping away state laws that barred \u201cmarriage equality,\u201d brought to mind another landmark ruling: Roe v. Wade. That decision was supposed to \u201csettle\u201d a divisive national debate, but did no such thing.\n\nBack then, in the early decades following Roe, it was the Catholic bishops who kept the issue alive.\n\nThat responsibility will likely fall to them again, as they grapple with a more hostile age of intolerance toward Christian sexual ethics. And their statements carry an implicit invitation to the faithful to accompany them on this pilgrimage of faith.\n\nNo doubt, their somber tone reflects a measure of regret for their own failure to effectively catechize their flock, with reportedly more than half of baptized Catholics now supporting \u201cmarriage equality.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the U.S. bishops rightly marked this historic moment as a turning point in the culture. Before long, Catholics will see whether this day of reckoning will be a turning point for the Church as well as one that injects a new urgency in the mission of bishops, pastors and the laity to proclaim, defend and live Jesus\u2019s teaching on marriage.\n\nJoan Frawley Desmond is the Register\u2019s senior editor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. bishops\u2019 immediate responses to Supreme Court\u2019s decision on \u2018marriage equality\u2018 set a\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "U.S. bishops\u2019 immediate responses to Supreme Court\u2019s decision on \u2018marriage equality\u2018 set a course for new, unpredictable era.", "title": "High Time for the Church\u2019s Teaching Moment on Marriage", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/high-time-for-the-churchs-teaching-moment-on-marriage/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Wedding_scene_p-255x255.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/high-time-for-the-churchs-teaching-moment-on-marriage/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Wedding_scene_p-255x255.jpg", "description": "U.S. bishops\u2019 immediate responses to Supreme Court\u2019s decision on \u2018marriage equality\u2018 set a course for new, unpredictable era.", "card": "summary", "title": "High Time for the Church\u2019s Teaching Moment on Marriage"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register,", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd1ca\"", "article_summary": "\u201cChurch teaching and common sense make a distinction between who a person is and what that person does,\u201d he said.\nTeaching MomentBut if some Church leaders opted to maintain a low profile, most used the historic decision as a teaching moment.\nBack then, in the early decades following Roe, it was the Catholic bishops who kept the issue alive.\nCardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington provided the most comprehensive response to the court\u2019s decision, with point-by-point answers to a range of questions about the Church\u2019s now-unique stance on marriage.\nIt also signaled an intent to use the ruling as a teaching moment for an anxious flock."}
