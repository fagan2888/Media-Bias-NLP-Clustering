Eight years of liberal, progressive policies have produced miserable results and I really don\u2019t think the country is going to have more of the same.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Speaker Paul Ryan Is in a Hurry to Craft GOP's 2016 Agenda", "description": "Speaker Paul Ryan Is in a Hurry to Craft GOP's 2016 Agenda", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "While Republicans presidential candidates continue firing at one another on the bruising campaign trail, House Speaker Paul Ryan is mapping out a conservative agenda the GOP can run with in 2016.\n\"We can't sit around until July when we have a convention, we've got to get going now,\" Ryan told...", "title": "Speaker Paul Ryan Is in a Hurry to Craft GOP's 2016 Agenda", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/speaker-paul-ryan-hurry-craft-gops-2016-agenda/story?id=35862985", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/AP_paul_ryan_jt_151219_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Date": "2015-12-20", "twitter": {"description": "While Republicans presidential candidates continue firing at one another on the bruising campaign trail, House Speaker Paul Ryan is mapping out a conservative agenda the GOP can run with in 2016.\n\"We can't sit around until July when we have a convention, we've got to get going now,\" Ryan told...", "title": "Speaker Paul Ryan Is in a Hurry to Craft GOP's 2016 Agenda", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/speaker-paul-ryan-hurry-craft-gops-2016-agenda/story?id=35862985", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/AP_paul_ryan_jt_151219_4x3t_240.jpg", "creator": "@benyc", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,35862985", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,35862985", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/speaker-paul-ryan-hurry-craft-gops-2016-agenda/story?id=35862985"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-20", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,35862985", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/speaker-paul-ryan-hurry-craft-gops-2016-agenda/story?id=35862985"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/speaker-paul-ryan-hurry-craft-gops-2016-agenda/story?id=35862985", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,35862985", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2015-12-20 07:27:44", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "Paul Ryan, Congress, President Barack Obama, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Paul Ryan, Congress, President Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "While Republicans presidential candidates continue firing at one another on the bruising campaign trail, House Speaker Paul Ryan is mapping out a conservative agenda the GOP can run with in 2016.\nCriminal justice reform, Ryan said, is \"something where we can find common ground.\"\n\"We can't sit around until July when we have a convention, we've got to get going now,\" Ryan told reporters Friday.\nRyan -\u2013 whose office isn\u2019t completely free of the smell of former House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s cigars \u2013- said he hasn't sat down one-on-one with the GOP presidential candidates, but would \"absolutely\" trade notes on policy.\nRyan isn't worried about Republicans losing their 58-seat majority in the House, even if the GOP selects presidential frontrunner Donald Trump as the party's presidential nominee."}
