They deserve an IRS that is committed to delivering the highest level of customer service to American taxpayers,\u201d Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said in his opening remarks. \u201cThat\u2019s what each of our bills is about today \u2013 making the IRS accountable to the American people. Americans send a significant portion of their hard-earned dollars to the IRS every April.\u201d\n\nThe first bill, introduced by Rep. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, is aimed at stopping the IRS from rehiring an employee that was laid off for misconduct. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found this to be a major problem as many agency employees who were fired had failed to pay their own taxes, filed false documents and accessed sensitive information without permission.\n\n\u201cIf the IRS currently thinks its current practices are protecting taxpayers then they need a reality check,\u201d Noem said, adding the agency refuses to fix the problem on its own. \u201cAnd the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act is a simple bipartisan fix to a serious problem.\u201d\n\nRanking Member Sander Levin said while he objected to the other three bills being considered, he had no problem with the South Dakota Republican\u2019s legislation.\n\nRep. Patrick Meehan\u2019s bill was designed to ensure IRS employees don\u2019t receive bonuses until the agency has \u201cdeveloped and implemented a comprehensive customer service strategy.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest complaints about the agency has been its lack of efficiency when it comes to addressing taxpayer questions.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say you never need to pay out a bonus, it simply says do your job first and identify who comes first,\u201d Meehan said. \u201cWe are asking to fill what has been asked by the GAO and more specifically by the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Democrat Rep. Bill Pascrell blasted the bill, saying they are not fully funding the agency for it to operate properly \u2013 a claim Meehan shut down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make a factual point,\u201d Meehan said. \u201cThe IRS received the same appropriations for taxpayer services accounts in 2015 as it had in 2014, however, because it didn\u2019t get any extra money for the Affordable Care Act it repurposed $133 million from its own internals for the Affordable Care Act instead of doing taxpayer services.\u201d\n\nThe third bill, sponsored by Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, would give Congress the power to determine how the IRS spends user fees.\n\n\u201cThey (IRS) have not proven to this committee, they have not proven to the Missourians I represent and they have not proven to the American people that they are responsible stewards of user fees,\u201d Smith said. \u201cTheir user fees collect almost $500 million it\u2019s nothing but a slush fund. That\u2019s why we filed the IRS OWES Act, it provides Congress and the American people better oversight on how the IRS is spending valuable taxpayer resources.\u201d\n\nThe fourth and final bill marked up Wednesday \u2013 introduced by Rep. David Rouzer of North Carolina, who doesn\u2019t sit on the panel \u2013 which passed out of committee along party lines would force the agency to \u201ccertify that no IRS employees have serious delinquencies with respect to their own tax obligations.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jim McDermott of Washington accused the bills of being designed to make the agency fail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all because you\u2019re mad over what happened around the allegations that they were picking on right-wing PACs,\u201d he said. \u201cStarving the IRS by taking away 3.5 percent in one bill and taking away the ability to rehire people in another bill \u2013 everything in here is designed to destroy the IRS. It\u2019s bad legislation and you ought to vote no.\u201d\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania emphasized it is Congress\u2019 duty to protect the taxpayer.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
