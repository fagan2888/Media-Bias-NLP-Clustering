The government lawyer derided Justice Alito\u2019s suggestion that there would be no harm if the Court gutted the system of tax credits offered by the federal government.\n\n\u201cWhat about Congress?\u201d asked Justice Scalia. \u201cYou really think Congress is just going to sit there while all these disastrous consequences ensue?\u201d \u201cThis Congress?\u201d Mr. Verrilli replied. The audience erupted into laughter.\n\nThat's right. No one, right or left, expects Congress to do anything.\n\nThat\u2019s why the case hinges on whether the Obama administration can interpret a preposition \u201cby\u201d to mean \u201cin.\u201d Americans don\u2019t trust Congress to pass thoughtful, well-crafted laws. We also don\u2019t trust Congress to fix poorly worded laws after problems become apparent.\n\nThis situation reminds me a bit of where the Roman Republic found itself in the first century BC.\n\nThe Roman Senate had long been the most influential political institution of the Roman state, but factionalism began to take its toll. Some senators promoted the interests of the lower strata of Roman society over and against the senatorial families. Some senators tried to curtail the growing political influence of \u201cthe people.\u201d Senators on both sides tended to use their faction to further their personal political success rather than to promote the health of the Roman state.\n\nThe Senate lost its credibility.\n\nRome faced myriad social crises in the first century BC. I can imagine one Roman citizen asking another, \u201cYou really think the Senate is just going to sit there while all these disastrous consequences ensue?\u201d His interlocutor would undoubtedly laugh and reply, \u201cThis Senate?\u201d\n\nThe Senate couldn\u2019t rule so the people looked to strongmen to lead them. The succession of strongmen and their civil wars eventually gave rise to the Roman imperial system. During the first hundred years or so, this new system looked just like the old Republic, but Rome had a guy named Caesar making sure that the institutions of government ran smoothly. If a law turned out to contain problems or unforeseen consequences, Caesar could fix it.\n\nNow, even though the Roman people began putting all their faith and hope in this one man named Caesar, they didn\u2019t actually notice that their Republic had died until about a hundred years after the fact. All the old institutions were still there.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that we\u2019re heading in the same direction as Rome. I actually think we\u2019ve already charted a different course. But like the ancient Romans, our Republic is dead\u2014it has been dead a long time. And like the ancient Romans, we\u2019re just starting to notice.\n\nIn my estimation, the American Republic died one hundred and fifty years ago during the Civil War when Lincoln established the IRS. Out of the ashes of our Republic rose the American Bureaucracy, which shepherded us through the process of becoming a superpower.\n\nBut over the last few decades, it seems that Congress and the Bureaucracy for which it stands have ossified. We\u2019ve moved into a period in which everyone expects the president to act as an elected monarch. Few Americans vote\u2014except for a presidential candidate, because the president is seen as being the only person who can fix our problems. Is it any wonder that we invest so much time, money, and emotion in the presidential election cycle?\n\nThe typical American\u2014and, indeed, Congress\u2014views the president as having the powers of a monarch. The president himself knows that he has the powers of a monarch. It seems that the only people in America who aren\u2019t convinced of the president\u2019s status as our elected king are four, maybe five, justices on the Supreme Court.\n\nSome of us might still mourn the passing of our Republic, but I\u2019m glad we\u2019re all getting to the point where we can laugh about it.\n\nCollin Garbarino is assistant professor of history at Houston Baptist University.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A blog devoted to sharing initial thoughts on topics, and daily ramblings, First Thoughts speaks to the latest topics in religion and today\u2019s society.", "og": {"site_name": "First Things", "description": "The typical American\u2014and, indeed, Congress\u2014views the president as having the powers of a monarch.
