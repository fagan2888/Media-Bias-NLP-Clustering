(Photo: Joel Ebert / The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nA panel of lawmakers passed a Senate resolution Tuesday directing Tennessee\u2019s attorney general to sue the federal government despite the fact that one senator said it could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the state\u2019s refugee community.\n\nAbout 80 people, many of whom held signs in protest, watched as the Senate Finance Ways and Means Committee approved a resolution that orders Attorney General Herbert Slatery to sue the feds for noncompliance of the Refugee Act of 1980.\n\nPassage of the resolution, sponsored by 23 Senate Republicans, would ensure that Tennessee is the third state to sue the federal government over the matter but the first state to do so on the grounds of the 10th Amendment.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mark Norris, R-Collierville, said the resolution is necessary in order to get a court to settle an issue that has left Tennessee in a confusing place as it relates to refugees.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of Senate Joint Resolution 467 is to initiate legal proceedings for declaratory relief in light of the federal government\u2019s failure to consult regarding the relocation of refugees in Tennessee and the mandatory expenditure of state funds under a federal program from which the state has formally withdrawn,\u201d he said.\n\nNorris said despite the fact that Tennessee opted out of the refugee resettlement program in 2008, under then-Gov. Phil Bredesen, the federal government has required the state to participate in the program in some capacity.\n\nCiting the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in National Federation of Independent Business vs. Sebelius \u2014 the landmark decision that upheld Congress\u2019 power to enact the majority of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Norris said, \u201cIn that case, the Supreme Court said a state cannot be compelled or coerced to participate in a federal program at which it has chosen not to participate.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the state has been forced to appropriate state funds for as many as 11 programs, including Medicaid, to support the refugee resettlement program.\n\nThe resettlement program is being administered by Catholic Charities, which says it is fully funded by the federal government.\n\nNorris said if the state does not expend funds to those 11 programs, the entire program is at risk.\n\n\u201cWe find ourselves sort of in that catch-22 \u2014 wondering what it is we are constitutionally and legally able to do,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile some members of the Senate committee expressed safety concerns as it relates to the refugee resettlement program, the majority of the discussion centered on Norris\u2019 point about solving what he previously described to The Tennessean as a \u201cconstitutional quandary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe take home point is for us to be able to discharge our duties to the people of Tennessee,\u201d Norris said while answering a handful of questions from Sen. Steve Dickerson, R-Nashville, during a nearly hour-long discussion on the resolution.\n\nDickerson wondered what the impact of passing such a resolution may be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid this might be perceived as unwelcoming,\u201d he said, noting that Nashville receives about three refugees every day. \u201cThis might have a chilling effect on that.\u201d\n\nNorris tried to dispel the notion that the resolution would send a negative message.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not designed to be welcoming or unwelcoming,\u201d he said, adding that the resolution was not intended to be \u201cmean-spirited\u201d or a \u201cfear-mongering\u201d tactic.\n\nNorris noted that the resolution, which heads to the Senate floor, would not immediately halt refugees from coming into Tennessee. He said it would likely maintain the status quo of having refugees come into the state, until a court decides on the matter.\n\nWhile many on the committee defended the resolution, which passed with a 9-1 vote \u2014 Dickerson was the sole member to vote against it while Sen. Thelma Harper, D-Whites Creek, did not vote \u2014 there were many in attendance who rebuked the committee\u2019s action.\n\nStephanie Teatro, a co-executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, called the resolution \u201cone of the most extreme anti-refugee\u201d efforts in the United States.\n\nShe took issue with the claims that the resolution is centered on the 10th Amendment, saying that is \u201cjust smoke and mirrors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis legislature has been considering anti-refugee policy for the last several years,\u201d Teatro said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about keeping anyone safe. It\u2019s really about creating an unwelcoming and hostile environment.\u201d\n\nSeveral opponents of the resolution provided lawmakers with a copy of a petition expressing their opposition.\n\nBuy Photo William Mwizerwa, a former Rwandan refugee and the director of Legacy Mission Village, said the passage of SJR 467 could push refugees away. (Photo: Joel Ebert / The Tennessean)\n\nAlthough Teatro said she doesn\u2019t believe the lawsuit will succeed, she said it creates a climate of fear for refugee families.\n\n\u201cThis fear-based, discriminatory measure would have us turn our backs on families fleeing violence and terror,\u201d said Hedy Weinberg, American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee executive director. \u201cClosing our doors in the faces of people in crisis is not who we are as Tennesseans \u2014 it undermines our very values of justice, fairness and aiding those in need. Refugee resettlement is the sole responsibility of the federal government. Not only is this resolution ethically wrong, denying refugees violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and federal law.\u201d\n\nNorris said the resolution is not simply about success or failure. It is necessary in order to have a court settle the issue, he explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a situation where the federal court would declare our rights as a state under these various situations ... what we can and cannot pay for, and what we must and must not do,\u201d Norris said.\n\nAmong those watching the actions of the committee was William Mwizerwa, a former Rwandan refugee and the director of Legacy Mission Village, a Brentwood-based nonprofit organization dedicated to helping refugee families in Tennessee.\n\nHe said the resolution appears to be an attempt to push refugees away. Mwizerwa said that many refugees have had to flee their country because of violence, and that they are grateful for being welcomed to the United States and Tennessee.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned what will happen next,\u201d he said.\n\nReach Joel Ebert at 615-259-8379 and on Twitter @joelebert29.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1ToDu0U", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A panel of lawmakers passed a resolution Tuesday directing Tennessee\u2019s attorney general to sue the federal government.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "A panel of lawmakers passed a resolution Tuesday directing Tennessee\u2019s attorney general to sue the federal government.", "title": "Senate resolution could have 'chilling effect' on refugees", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2016/02/16/senate-resolution-could-have-chilling-effect-refugees/80454444/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A panel of lawmakers passed a resolution Tuesday directing Tennessee\u2019s attorney general to sue the federal government.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/16/Nashville/Nashville/635912250506433824-IMG-0584.JPG", "title": "Senate resolution could have 'chilling effect' on refugees", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "title": "Senate resolution could have 'chilling effect' on refugees", "author": "Joel Ebert", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06ba27a0362a386e9000c02e5ad114cc3f2d85e9/c=714-0-2550-2448/local/-/media/2016/02/16/Nashville/Nashville/635912250506433824-IMG-0584.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70261845367a788a3f907a9f1f073a9c7298db27/c=408-0-2856-2448/local/-/media/2016/02/16/Nashville/Nashville/635912250506433824-IMG-0584.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/519e70b3dd198a728f9efe74a59e76efcbe622d3/c=4-0-3260-2448/local/-/media/2016/02/16/Nashville/Nashville/635912250506433824-IMG-0584.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/abf7fc9e077790e137c6a86512b8396963a5a375/c=0-302-3264-2146&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/02/16/Nashville/Nashville/635912250506433824-IMG-0584.JPG", "publishtime": "2016-02-16T13:31:07.180000-06:00", "shorthed": "Lawmakers advance refugee lawsuit resolution", "articleid": 80454444, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d46f0a03148c87ce3989a311abc6d55d0153ee9/c=0-302-3264-2146/local/-/media/2016/02/16/Nashville/Nashville/635912250506433824-IMG-0584.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/66842c332f18d455b65eba46bb12306e1e2c3863/c=1628-0-2999-2448/local/-/media/2016/02/16/Nashville/Nashville/635912250506433824-IMG-0584.JPG"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Tennessee refugee resettlement, Sen.
