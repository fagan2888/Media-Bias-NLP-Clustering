But a new study questions whether that\u2019s actually happening in doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nOf the more than 4 million procedures office-based nurse practitioners and physician assistants independently billed more than 5,000 times in a year to Medicare \u2013 a list including radiological exams, setting casts and injecting anesthetic agents \u2013 more than half were for dermatological surgeries.\n\nThat\u2019s not surprising, according to Ken Miller, president of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, because when patients are older, skin problems such as \u201cboils, skin tags and warts\u201d are pretty typical.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see the majority of procedures that are occurring both in primary care and in some of the other specialties like geriatric clinics,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Aug. 11 study, published in the JAMA Dermatology analyzing 2012 Medicare claims, is suggesting that nurse practitioners and physician assistants should face higher regulation if performing surgical procedures.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Brett Coldiron, a dermatologist and clinical assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati, said while the \u201cintent for mid-level nurse practitioners was to give primary care,\u201d the level of surgical billing implies that may not necessarily be true.\n\nHe said those mid-level providers \u2013 PAs and NPs \u2013 \u201care doing invasive procedures and surgery. I\u2019m not sure they were trained to do that.\u201d\n\nBut practitioners who perform specialized procedures often have received additional training, according to Miller.\n\n\u201cIf they find something that is out of their scope, they will refer \u2013 and it\u2019s the same thing that primary care physicians do,\u201d he said.\n\nThe study\u2019s analysis found that a majority of procedures billed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants relate to dermatology specifically, a trend Coldiron said could stem from the frequency of dermatological procedures being performed in offices rather than hospitals, along with the higher rate of skin cancer among the older patients Medicare covers.\n\nThe nurse practitioners performing specialized dermatological procedures often have received extra training, Miller said, and they often attend \u201cthe same symposiums and conferences dermatologists actually attend.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re in the same subspecialty of dermatology, they may be doing these procedures because that\u2019s how they\u2019ve been trained,\u201d he said.\n\nHe thinks no more than 3 or 4 percent of nurse practitioners actually end up specializing in a specific area of care. But all nurse practitioners will often see patients with dermatological conditions, and the treatments they require are usually not \u201cextraordinary,\u201d he said.\n\nColdiron said while the mid-level providers may have received extra training within a relevant specialty, many likely lack the expertise of doctors who have done a residency within the field. \u201cIf nurses are going to practice surgery, that\u2019s not [nursing] \u2013 that\u2019s medicine,\u201d he said.\n\nNurse practitioners and physician assistants have been suggested as a potential solution to shortages in primary care physicians, providers whose roles were emphasized in the Affordable Care Act. But both Coldiron and Miller suggested that may not be the case in practice.\n\nIt would be a mistake to treat any one kind of health care provider as a silver bullet to fix primary care shortages, Miller said. Though he expressed concern that particular geographic areas may lack sufficient access to primary care, nurse practitioners or physician assistants can\u2019t fill that gap, he said.\n\nWhat \u201chealth professionals are all trying to provide is quality care that is convenient and accessible,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201cthere is not enough primary care out there, and there is not one discipline out there\u201d to meet patient needs.\n\nThe study cautioned that a boost in mid-level providers performing surgical procedures could lead to more cases of malpractice, a concern Coldiron said suggested a need for greater regulatory oversight of nurse practitioners and physician assistants.\n\nBut that kind of argument is a \u201cred herring,\u201d Miller argued.\n\n\u201cThere have been no real studies out there that show nurse practitioners are less safe than physicians,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re all trying to do,\u201d he added, \u201cis we\u2019re trying to provide the best care and the best quality of care.\u201d\n\n###\n\nThis article was produced by Kaiser Health News with support from The SCAN Foundation.
