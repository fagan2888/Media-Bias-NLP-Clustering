With the money from the surcharge, all of its employees would benefit from healthcare. (By law, money from tips can go only to servers.)\n\nWhatever the reasoning for the healthcare fee, it comes down to the same issue that many restaurants are facing, whether they want to offer health benefits to their staff now or, for businesses with more than 50 full-time employees, when they're required to do so in 2016. It's safe to assume that the higher costs of doing business will be passed on to diners.\n\nBut in what way, shape or form? Is the surcharge the answer?\n\n\"I'm still not getting why you just didn't build it into the price of my chicken Kiev or whatever I'm getting,\" host Bill O'Reilly said during the show. \"Just give it there.\"\n\nChait responded that it was the most cost-effective way to provide the benefit.\n\n\"We used healthcare as the conversation rather than ... additional wages because it was actually a very efficient way, a tax-free way for people to get a benefit because healthcare's not taxed,\" he said. As opposed to revenue and/or wages, presumably. Some restaurateurs have said that menu prices would have to increase significantly more in order to generate what a nominal surcharge does.\n\nIs 60 extra cents on your $20 lunch too much to ask?\n\nALSO:\n\nJimmy Fallon, Will Ferrell say 'ew' but eat Michelle Obama's kale chips\n\nEverything you need to know to make great pie -- and 52 terrific pie recipes\n\nFree Plan Check doughnuts, fried chicken at The Larder; vegan Umami dinner at Crossroads\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "The new cost of dining: Republique owners defend 3% surcharge on 'O'Reilly Factor'", "Description": "Restaurateur Bill Chait and chef-owner Walter Manzke of Republique appeared Thursday on Fox News' \"The O'Reilly Factor\" to discuss the 3% \"Healthy LA\" automatic surcharge that it has added to all of its customers' checks.
