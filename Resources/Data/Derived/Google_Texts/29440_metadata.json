This amount includes all savings and losses.\n\nAccording to CMS, these Pioneer ACOs tend to be more experienced, having adapted coordinated care initiatives relatively early on. Resultantly, they are able to assume larger performance-based financial risk levels, CMS adds.\n\nConcurrently, 97 ACOs qualified for shared savings payments topping $422 million, says CMS. These 97 ACOs met both quality standards and their savings threshold.\n\nSuch results imply ACOs are consistently delivering high quality care, says CMS, even as they continue to serve even more Medicare beneficiaries annually. According to CMS\u2019s early indications, the number of Medicare beneficiaries served by ACOs will likely grow once again next year.\n\n\u201cACOs are judged on their performance on an array of meaningful metrics that assess the care they provide \u2013 including how highly patients rated their doctor, how well clinicians communicated, whether they screened for high blood pressure and tobacco use and cessation, and their use of Electronic Health Records,\u201d CMS maintains.\n\n\u201cIn the third performance year, Pioneer ACOs showed improvements in 28 of 33 quality measures and experienced average improvements of 3.6% across all quality measures. Shared Savings Program ACOs that reported quality measures in 2013 and 2014 improved on 27 of 33 quality measures.\u201d\n\nThe results additionally demonstrate more experienced ACOs generally perform better with time. ACOs are collectively transforming how care is being provided, says Andy Slavitt, CMS Acting Administrator, in a press release. \u201cMany of these ACOs are demonstrating that they can deliver a higher level of coordinated care that leads to healthier people and smarter spending,\u201d Slavitt states.\n\nSuch findings have not always been the case. As EHRIntelligence.com reported in 2013, some Pioneer ACOs failing to produce savings left for good with intentions to apply to the Medicare Shared Savings program. Such occurred even before the Pioneer ACO program had reached its third year of implementation.\n\nAs RevCycleIntelligence.com reported, over the last two years alone, Pioneer ACOs have generated over $380 million in Medicare savings.\n\nMedicare beneficiaries in Pioneer ACOs report high quality, coordinated care \u2013 more appropriate levels of care delivered, stronger communication levels among healthcare providers, fewer numbers of tests and procedures performed, and more post-hospital discharge provider follow-up visits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Accountable care organizations (ACOs) generated over $411 million in net program savings last year, according to performance results released by CMS.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/why-experienced-acos-assume-high-risk-generate-high-savings", "type": "article", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_2553996909.jpg", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "title": "CMS Reports ACOs Assume High Risk Yet Generate High Savings"}, "twitter": {"description": "Accountable care organizations (ACOs) generated over $411 million in net program savings last year, according to performance results released by CMS.", "title": "CMS Reports ACOs Assume High Risk Yet Generate High Savings", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_2553996909.jpg"}, "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "As RevCycleIntelligence.com reported, over the last two years alone, Pioneer ACOs have generated over $380 million in Medicare savings.\nAs EHRIntelligence.com reported in 2013, some Pioneer ACOs failing to produce savings left for good with intentions to apply to the Medicare Shared Savings program.\nAccording to CMS, these Pioneer ACOs tend to be more experienced, having adapted coordinated care initiatives relatively early on.\nShared Savings Program ACOs that reported quality measures in 2013 and 2014 improved on 27 of 33 quality measures.\u201dThe results additionally demonstrate more experienced ACOs generally perform better with time.\nSuch results imply ACOs are consistently delivering high quality care, says CMS, even as they continue to serve even more Medicare beneficiaries annually."}
