But hospitals that invested in monitoring systems and RFID location systems to help caregivers quickly respond to patients' requests, combined with process of care, would reduce readmissions by 3 percent.\n\nHospitals must walk a tightrope between improving both process-of-care measures and patient experience measures, both of which affect their reimbursements, Senot and Chandraskaran wrote in Harvard Business Review. Caregivers widely perceive satisfaction-focused measures as subjective and unscientific, and of little value in the quest to improve outcomes. Indeed, experts have raised concerns that satisfaction measures could take the focus off of tangible outcomes.\n\nMeanwhile, many hospitals pay less attention to improving caregiver communication because of high training costs, according to the authors. They also note that technical skills take priority over patient communication at medical schools. However, improving the communication aspect is actually cheaper than improving the response aspect by about $14 per patient, according to the study. \"These results have important implications for where hospital administrators should invest to improve the overall healthcare delivery system in the United States,\" the authors wrote in HBR.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the study (.pdf)\n\n- check out the HBR column\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nDo patient satisfaction surveys value comfort over outcomes?\n\nHospitals work to capture patient voices to improve healthcare experience\n\nAre high-end, hotel-like amenities a waste of money?\n\nHospitals develop online ratings strategy in quest for patient satisfaction\n\nDo hospitals care too much about patient satisfaction scores?\n\nPatient satisfaction may not correlate with care quality\n\nHow to balance patient satisfaction and quality care\n\nStudy questions link between patient satisfaction and clinical quality\n\nHospitals with unhappy patients still provide high-quality care\n\nHard outcomes data proves patient relationships matter\n\nQuality metrics represent growing slice of doc-compensation pie", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although many hospitals invest in\u00a0hotel-like amenities to improve the patient experience, leaders would be better off spending more money on improving\u00a0caregiver-patient communication, the number-one factor in preventable readmissions,\u00a0according to\u00a0research published in\u00a0Management Science.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Although many hospitals invest in\u00a0hotel-like amenities to improve the patient experience, leaders would be better off spending more money on improving\u00a0caregiver-patient communication, the number-one factor in preventable readmissions,\u00a0according to\u00a0research published in\u00a0Management Science.", "title": "Improved doc-patient communication linked to reduced readmissions", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/improved-doc-patient-communication-linked-reduced-readmissions/2015-09-24", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "30-day readmissions,Care Delivery,communication,doctor-patient communication,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient satisfaction,readmission prevention", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf961\"", "article_summary": "Hospitals develop online ratings strategy in quest for patient satisfactionDo hospitals care too much about patient satisfaction scores?\nTo learn more:- read the study (.pdf)- check out the HBR columnRelated Articles:Do patient satisfaction surveys value comfort over outcomes?\nThey also note that technical skills take priority over patient communication at medical schools.\nIndeed, experts have raised concerns that satisfaction measures could take the focus off of tangible outcomes.\nMeanwhile, many hospitals pay less attention to improving caregiver communication because of high training costs, according to the authors."}
