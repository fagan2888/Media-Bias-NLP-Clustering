Only about 60 received more than $1,000 and of those, a dozen received more than $10,000. The money represented payments companies made to or on behalf of doctors over a five-month period from Aug. 1, 2013, to the end of that year.\n\nThe data, made public by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Studies last week, were part of a nationwide release that showed industry payments of almost $3.5 billion to 546,000 individual doctors \u2014 including dentists and chiropractors \u2014 and 1,360 teaching hospitals in five months. The release, mandated by the Affordable Care Act, was the largest ever documenting the ties between industry and health care professionals.\n\nAdvocates for transparency in the health industry had hoped the data would shine a light on potential conflicts between companies and doctors \u2014 for example, a doctor who prescribes drugs from a manufacturer that also pays the doctor \u201cconsulting fees.\u201d Such relationships are thought by experts to inflate health costs through unnecessary prescriptions and surgical procedures.\n\nAllan Coukell, the senior director of drugs and medical devices for The Pew Charitable Trusts, hailed the release for putting \u201cmore information in the public domain than we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that most physicians have some financial relationship with the industry, and this confirms that,\u201d Coukell said.\n\nMedical and industry groups criticized the release \u2014 which amounted to a giant data dump. More than a third of the payments were not linked to specific doctors because of errors in the data. The South Dakota State Medical Association joined other state groups and the American Medical Association in August asking the government to delay the first release until next year, in part because many clinicians were unaware the data was going to be made public.\n\nPractitioners had an opportunity to register and review the accuracy of the data before it went public, but Dr. Mary Milroy, the SDSMA\u2019s president, said the process was cut short. When physicians were allowed to register, it required them to navigate a cumbersome process that took up to 45 minutes. Milroy said many doctors didn\u2019t have the time.\n\nThe categories under which physicians allegedly received industry payments also were misleading, Milroy said. Doctors, for example, who took textbooks or other materials for continuing education purposes appeared in the data as though they had taken money from industry companies.\n\nDr. Scott Lederhaus, a California neurosurgeon and president of the Association for Medical Ethics, had been anxious to see the data. But it proved cumbersome and was not user-friendly when it finally came out.\n\n\u201cI was very disappointed,\u201d he said by email.\n\nIdentified South Dakota clinicians were a tiny piece of the $3.5 billion in payments made nationally. Even so, a handful of individuals stood out.\n\nDr. Allison Tendler, an ophthalmologist who practices at Vance Thompson Vision, led the state with almost $168,000 in payments during the five-month period. Two other doctors at Vance Thompson, including Dr. Thompson and Dr. John Berdahl, were in the top 10.\n\nMatt Jensen, the CEO of Vance Thompson Vision, said Tendler is in a unique situation. For several years, she has been the face of a national advertising campaign for Allergan\u2019s dry-eye drug Restasis. Tendler used the drug herself, Jensen said, and Allergan was looking for a health provider who uses the drug to front the campaign. Tendler replaced a Hollywood actress.\n\nThe vast majority of Allergan\u2019s payments to Tendler were listed as a \u201cconsulting fee,\u201d with slightly less than $3,000 in the category of travel, lodging and food.\n\nThe data credited Berdahl with more than $82,000 in payments. Thompson showed more than $25,000 in payments and almost $80,000 more in research grants from Alcon Research.\n\n\u201cWe do an incredible amount of research,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cWe tend to be a place that are early adopters of technology. Not only that, but we tend to be early adopters and perfect it for the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nThe doctors share their research with others, including in poor countries with limited access to medical care, Jensen said. The data, for example, show that Berdahl took a trip to Armenia. Meanwhile, the clinic\u2019s international reputation routinely attracts patients from around the world.\n\n\u201cI think the community is very aware of our role in the industry,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cWe go to national meetings, and they are like heroes there.\u201d\n\nRoyalties\n\nA Rapid City orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Stuart Fromm, received the second highest amount in payments, at more than $127,000. The nature of those payments was listed as royalties made by two companies: DePuy Synthesis and Smith & Nephew, both of which sell orthopedic implants.\n\nFromm said he receives royalty payments on devices he\u2019s patented. Those payments, he said, are different than the consulting fees that some doctors receive from drug companies, which he called a \u201cgray area\u201d in terms of medical ethics.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big distinction between a consulting fee and a royalty,\u201d he said.\n\nA review of patent registrations show that Fromm is a co-inventor on a dozen devices that received patents between 2002 and 2014.\n\nFromm also said that he receives no royalties from devices he uses, or for devices that any doctor uses in a facility where he practices.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way it can bias my decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way anybody can claim a kickback.\u201d\n\nLederhaus said that doctors are not allowed to receive royalty payments for devices they use because it creates a conflict of interest.\n\nSioux Falls doctors\n\nTwo Sanford Health doctors and two Avera McKennan doctors were among the top 10. The federal data showed that Dr. John Palmer, an endocrinologist with Sanford, compiled more than $50,000, while Sanford psychiatrist Rajesh Singh had almost $40,000.\n\nLois Marshall, Sanford\u2019s chief compliance officer, said the health system\u2019s physicians are not banned from accepting payments from industry companies, but there are safeguards and controls in place to prevent abuse. Doctors are required to have agreements that spell out the terms of their outside work.\n\n\u201cThose agreements have to be in writing,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t just fly-by-night payments. They\u2019re legitimate services provided by these physicians on behalf of those companies.\u201d\n\nThe data showed that Avera McKennan cancer doctors Ahmed Galal and Kelly McCaul received $70,000 and $42,000, respectively.\n\nLindsey Meyers, Avera\u2019s spokeswoman, said the health system requires doctors to report outside income to the Internal Revenue Service. Avera also has other policies, although she declined to comment on the specifics.\n\nMeyers said last week\u2019s data release did not help consumers identify which doctor-industry relationships are beneficial and which are not.\n\n\u201cAvera really does feel that transparency is a good thing for patients,\u201d she said. \u201cTransparency with context is a powerful thing.\u201d\n\nTop industry payments to doctors\n\nTop doctors\n\n10 South Dakota clinicians who received the most industry payments between Aug. 1, 2013, and Dec. 31, 2013 (does not include industry research grants)\n\nAllison Tendler $167,857.46\n\nStuart Fromm $127,115.19\n\nJohn Berdahl $82,171.69\n\nAhmed Galal $70,071.89\n\nJohn Palmer $50,231.94\n\nKelly McCaul $41,988.53\n\nRajesh Singh $39,739.42\n\nVance Thompson $25,286.81\n\nChandar Singaram $23,067.36\n\nMatthew Tschetter $12,008.96\n\nTop companies\n\n10 companies making the most payments to South Dakota clinicians\n\nAllergan\n\n$ 182,732.22\n\nDePuy Synthes Sales\n\n$ 120,402.79\n\nAlcon Laboratories\n\n$ 60,402.65\n\nSunovion Pharmaceuticals\n\n$ 41,604.01\n\nCelgene Corp.\n\n$ 36,610.34\n\nMillennium Pharmaceuticals\n\n$ 34,182.30\n\nNovo Nordisk\n\n$ 27,718.58\n\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals\n\n$ 25,091.47\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Co.\n\n$ 25,008.02\n\nForest Laboratories\n\n$ 21,948.30\n\nTop payments by category\n\nConsulting Fee\n\n$270,485.9\n\nCompensation for services other than consulting, including serving as faculty or as a speaker at a venue other than a continuing education program\n\n$222,568.2\n\nRoyalty or license\n\n$134,309.4\n\nTravel and lodging\n\n$101,998.5\n\nFood and beverage\n\n$74,995.92\n\nEducation\n\n$31,381.96\n\nHonoraria\n\n$28,150.49\n\nGift\n\n$17,044.24\n\nSpace rental or facility fees(teaching hospital only)\n\n$8,842\n\nCompensation for serving as faculty or as a speaker for a nonaccredited and noncertified continuing education program\n\n$2,000\n\nGrant\n\n$1,770.90\n\nEntertainment\n\n$148.42\n\nRead or Share this story: http://argusne.ws/1w0kqJx", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "12 doctors in the state received more than $10,000 from medical device or drug companies.", "og": {"site_name": "Argus Leader", "description": "12 doctors in the state received more than $10,000 from medical device or drug companies.", "title": "Medical firms give thousands to S.D. doctors", "url": "http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2014/10/11/medical-firms-give-thousands-sd-doctors/17137233/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/argusleader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "12 doctors in the state received more than $10,000 from medical device or drug companies.", "creator": "@argusleader", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/30e9a5103e98897fa5267eb1909d6924fd972c2f/c=0-80-342-422&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/SiouxFalls/2014/10/11/158181234.jpg", "title": "Medical firms give thousands to S.D. doctors", "site": "@argusleader", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=823665884", "fb": {"app_id": 174484999248444}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce10\"", "article_summary": "Sioux Falls doctorsTwo Sanford Health doctors and two Avera McKennan doctors were among the top 10.\nThe categories under which physicians allegedly received industry payments also were misleading, Milroy said.\nThe money represented payments companies made to or on behalf of doctors over a five-month period from Aug. 1, 2013, to the end of that year.\nMore than a third of the payments were not linked to specific doctors because of errors in the data.\nDoctors, for example, who took textbooks or other materials for continuing education purposes appeared in the data as though they had taken money from industry companies."}
