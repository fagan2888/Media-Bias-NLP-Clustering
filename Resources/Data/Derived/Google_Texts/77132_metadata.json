That\u2019s three years in a row (that I\u2019ve observed) that teacher assistants \u2014and education in general \u2014 have been in the cross hairs of the state budget debate.\n\nIn those three years (longer than that, actually) Ms. Carter, who is a second grade teacher at John Cotten Tayloe Elementary in Beaufort County, hasn\u2019t had a dedicated TA in her classroom. She gets only one hour a day of assistance, in which time her gifted students, her students with special needs, and her English language learners get one-on-one help from a TA to help them along academically. The rest of the hours in the day she is left alone to try to handle every child\u2019s diverse set of needs herself.\n\nWhen I visited Ms. Carter two years ago as she got her classroom ready for school, she told me of her fears of facing yet another year without a dedicated teacher assistant (TA), not to mention how to cope with a state budget that dealt significant cuts to other areas of the classroom at that time.\n\nShe is worried. Not the back-to-school jitters kind of worried; she has deep-seated concerns about the challenges she will face this year [2013-14] as educators grapple with a public school budget that spends $500 million less than what was spent in 2008. Five years ago, the teacher assistant who is now sitting in Carter\u2019s classroom preparing instructional materials would typically spend the entire day, every day, with Carter during the school year. That teacher assistant would help her manage 21 or 22 seven-year-old children who need to go to the bathroom, get fed, learn a lesson at a slightly slower or faster pace, or go to the nurse\u2019s office, among many other possible situations, all throughout the day. Now, that teacher assistant will be shared among four or five other classrooms. So maybe Carter will have a colleague help her manage her classroom for just an hour each day. Maybe.\n\nWorking in rural Beaufort County, Carter also helped me understand that she must educate a student population that has an awful lot of needs.\n\n\u201cOften when children come to my classroom, they are hungry. They need to be fed before they can think about reading comprehension,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how many children come to school who are sleeping three or four to a bed. And maybe one sibling wets the bed. So they come to school hungry, tired, and wearing yesterday\u2019s clothes, sometimes soaked with urine.\u201d \u201cAs teachers, we feel that we need to fix all our students\u2019 problems so they can get down to learning. Their intrinsic needs must be met first,\u201d said Carter. Every teacher, Carter speculates, at John Cotten Tayloe has bought clothing for students at one time or another, or taken a child to get cleaned up and fed so they can learn. They dig into their own pockets and rely on the support of the PTA and the church to help them.\n\nIn this context, Carter wondered how she would ensure her students would accomplish the learning gains they need to make with an hour or less each day of extra help.\n\nA classroom of 21 students is not terribly large, explained Carter, but without support it will be difficult. \u201cAnd now that they have lifted the cap on classroom sizes, what will we do? We can keep adding desks, but that\u2019s not good for our students,\u201d said Carter. Many of Carter\u2019s students have Individual Education Plans, or IEPs. These are federally mandated learning plans that are intended for children with disabilities or special learning needs. Teachers must provide specialized instruction and assessments for children with IEPs to help them achieve specified learning goals. When you have increased class sizes and fewer educators in the classroom, it will be much more difficult to identify early on which children have special needs and need special accommodations. \u201cWhen the General Assembly looks at education, they look at numbers, not individual children. But there are so many other issues to consider,\u201d said Carter.\n\nAnd that was in 2013, when the state lawmakers passed a budget that slashed funding for 3,800 TAs and 5,200 teaching jobs across the state.\n\nIn 2014, the budget debate took aim at teacher assistants again, cutting their funding by 22 percent.\n\nAnd now, the Senate once again wants to eliminate thousands of teacher assistants\u2014possibly more than 8,500 over the next two years. This proposal comes on top of the many cuts to TA funding over the past several years.\n\nTeacher assistant positions, however, have not been filled by Carson, [John Cotten Tayloe\u2019s principal] as people have retired or moved on. \u201cWe had to make a decision three years ago \u2013 when a teacher assistant left or retired, we would just have to adjust without that position. And over the past three years, we\u2019ve lost ten teacher assistants, either through attrition or transfer. No one has lost their job\u2014some folks we transferred to another local elementary school,\u201d said Carson. John Cotten Tayloe has 29 homerooms, and five or so years ago, each of those homerooms would have had a teacher assistant. But the state has been systematically pulling back funding for teacher assistants over the past several years. For this 2013-15 biennial budget, $120 million has been cut out of the state appropriation for teacher assistants, which amounts to a loss of nearly 4,000 teacher assistant positions statewide. The cumulative effect these cuts have had on the classroom is clear. This year the school will have just eight teacher assistants to be shared by 29 classrooms. This comes at a particularly difficult time, explained Carson, because educational trends are heading in a direction that would actually demand more personnel in the classroom.\n\nI called John Cotten Tayloe\u2019s principal, Bubs Carson, today. He said they\u2019re still working with very few TAs, and he\u2019s tried to do some creative scheduling to make sure that kids who have special needs are getting an hour of help each day.\n\nAs for the Senate\u2019s proposal to take the money saved by cutting TAs and hire more teachers in an effort to get class sizes down \u2014 Carson wasn\u2019t to keen on that idea.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere to put those additional teachers,\u201d said Carson. On top of that, he described how hard of a time he had hiring teacher vacancies this year in the first place \u2014 many candidates had at least one job offer, some multiple.\n\n\u201cIt would be a struggle to find high quality teachers this late in the game,\u201d said Carson.\n\nIn light of all of this, how are the teachers doing? How is Ms. Carter coping, I asked?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just doing the best they can,\u201d said Mr. Carson. \u201cThey\u2019ve just had to adjust.\u201d\n\nBarbara Dell Carter had some parting words for me as I left her classroom two years ago.\n\n\u201cI am a taxpayer. I know no one likes to see their taxes increase, but if that money goes toward producing a generation of more productive citizens, then I don\u2019t know what better investment there is that I can make.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "John Cotten Tayloe has 29 homerooms, and five or so years ago, each of those homerooms would have had a teacher assistant.\nNow, that teacher assistant will be shared among four or five other classrooms.\n\u201cWe had to make a decision three years ago \u2013 when a teacher assistant left or retired, we would just have to adjust without that position.\nTeacher assistant positions, however, have not been filled by Carson, [John Cotten Tayloe\u2019s principal] as people have retired or moved on.\nFor this 2013-15 biennial budget, $120 million has been cut out of the state appropriation for teacher assistants, which amounts to a loss of nearly 4,000 teacher assistant positions statewide."}
