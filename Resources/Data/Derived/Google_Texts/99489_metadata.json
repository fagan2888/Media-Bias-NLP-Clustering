According to statistics from the RCMP, a Mounty has not been killed by a gunshot wound in the line of duty since 2007, more than six years ago.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nCNN reports:\n\nA man dressed in fatigues and carrying a rifle went on a rampage, killing three police officers and wounding two others. Early Thursday morning, the shooter was still on the loose. Residents were asked to keep their doors locked and their outside lights on, as helicopters hovered overhead and the hunt for the man continued. Police say they know who the suspect is: 24-year-old Justin Bourque of Moncton. What they don\u2019t know \u2014 or haven\u2019t disclosed \u2014 is what prompted the attacks.\n\nPaul Greene, an RCMP spokesman, told reporters that Bourque was last seen in a wooded area and that search for him was ongoing.\n\n__________________________________\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License.\n\nThis article was published by Common Dreams.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nation that has largely avoided mass shootings mourns.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jon Queally | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The nation that has largely avoided mass shootings mourns.", "title": "Shooting Rampage Shocks Canada", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/shooting-rampage-shocks-canada/192080/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/canadian-shooter.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-06T11:24:25-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The nation that has largely avoided mass shootings mourns.", "title": "Shooting Rampage Shocks Canada", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/canadian-shooter.jpg", "creator": "@jonqueally", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Shooting", "published_time": "2014-06-07T05:00:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T11:24:25-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfff0\"", "article_summary": "Shooting Rampage Shocks CanadaThe nation that has largely avoided mass shootings mourns.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorCNN reports:A man dressed in fatigues and carrying a rifle went on a rampage, killing three police officers and wounding two others.\nPaul Greene, an RCMP spokesman, told reporters that Bourque was last seen in a wooded area and that search for him was ongoing.\nThough such shootings have become nearly an everyday occurence in the United States, Canada has a relatively low rate of gun violence compared to their southern neighbor.\nResidents were asked to keep their doors locked and their outside lights on, as helicopters hovered overhead and the hunt for the man continued."}
