She stood next to Attorney General Loretta Lynch at a news conference announcing a civil rights investigation into the BPD.\n\nAt the time she took the helm at Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division, an administration official told reporters President Barack Obama would soon pick her to take the job permanently. But more than six months after taking the temporary lead of the division, the White House has yet to send the Senate a nomination for Gupta or any other attorney to fill the spot permanently.\n\nThat means the top spot at the Civil Rights Division, a historically controversial position to get through the confirmation process, hasn\u2019t had a Senate-confirmed leader in nearly two years.\n\nIn the meantime, Gupta, a career civil rights lawyer and former American Civil Liberties Union deputy legal director, is playing a key role in the big issues facing the Justice Department. That includes the department\u2019s reactions to the deaths of black men in interactions with police in Ferguson, Mo.; New York, and now Baltimore.\n\nThere is no apparent reason Obama hasn\u2019t officially nominated Gupta to lead the division, and no indication he might have changed his mind.\n\n\u201cCurrently, Vanita Gupta is providing the leadership and stability the organization needs, and the administration not only has full confidence in her abilities in this role but is proud of the work she has been doing,\u201d an administration official said.\n\nJames Cole, who left the Justice Department as the No. 2 administrator in January, said Gupta is a talented leader in the acting capacity.\n\n\u201cShe inspires loyalty in the civil rights division, so she helps overcome any disability\u201d that comes with not having the official title, said Cole, now a partner at the Sidley Austin law firm.\n\nBut the department functions much better when those in Gupta\u2019s position are in a confirmed status.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better as a general matter\u201d to have division heads \u201cin place that have the authority already, have the confirmation under their belt, and have the ability to take those actions in a more official way,\u201d Cole said.\n\nThe Justice Department will carry on its work in any division even when it doesn\u2019t have a confirmed head, said Jamie Gorelick, a former deputy attorney general who is now a partner at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr.\n\nThere\u2019s less uncertainty about who will be the leader in the long term, and when nominees are not confirmed they have to look at every issue through the lens of an upcoming confirmation process, Gorelick said.\n\nThe Justice Department now is in a state of transition at the top administrator posts, including the confirmation of Lynch after months of delay in the Senate.\n\nTwo others are in the Senate confirmation process: acting Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates to take the position full time as the No. 2 administrator, and acting Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery to take that position full time as the No. 3 administrator.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans historically have had confirmation battles over the Civil Rights Division spot because the parties have different approaches to how the division should be run, starting with affirmative action and voting rights, Gorelick said.\n\n\u201cThey are hot-button issues that do provoke strong feelings,\u201d Gorelick said. \u201cSo it\u2019s by no means unusual.\u201d\n\nGupta is the right person for the job, Gorelick said. \u201cShe\u2019s just very impressive; she\u2019s smart, she\u2019s able, she can navigate difficult issues,\u201d Gorelick said. \u201cShe has a terrific demeanor for that job and is a collaborative person.\u201d\n\nThe last Senate-confirmed leader of the division was Thomas E. Perez, who is now Labor secretary. Obama nominated Debo Adegbile to the post, but some Democrats joined Republicans in blocking his confirmation in March 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "", "title": "Acting Civil Rights Head Still Awaits Nomination", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/acting_civil_rights_head_still_awaits_nomination-241734-1.html", "image": {"type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2015-05-11T16:53:04Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "iProCategory,iProStoryType,iProProductCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSDMID", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-11T16:53:04Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-11T16:53:04Z"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/acting_civil_rights_head_still_awaits_nomination-241734-1.html", "site": "@rollcall", "description": "", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)", "title": "Acting Civil Rights Head Still Awaits Nomination"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "She stood next to Attorney General Loretta Lynch at a news conference announcing a civil rights investigation into the BPD.\nAs the acting head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, Vanita Gupta played an integral role in the Justice Department\u2019s response to the recent unrest in Baltimore.\nAt the time she took the helm at Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division, an administration official told reporters President Barack Obama would soon pick her to take the job permanently.\n2 administrator, and acting Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery to take that position full time as the No.\nIn the meantime, Gupta, a career civil rights lawyer and former American Civil Liberties Union deputy legal director, is playing a key role in the big issues facing the Justice Department."}
