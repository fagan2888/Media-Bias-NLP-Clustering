Yet as Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe prepares to address Congress next week, in the 70th anniversary year of the war\u2019s end, something rankles the U.S. military veteran about Japan\u2019s attitude toward its past.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want the young people to know what really happened,\u201d complains Tenney, now 94.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke to three U.S. war veterans about their surrender in the Philippines in 1942 and their exploitation as slave laborers in Japan. It\u2019s an episode of history most notorious for the Bataan Death March, when tens of thousands of Filipino and American prisoners of war were forced 65 miles on foot to prison camps. Thousands are believed to have perished.\n\nThe AP also asked the veterans for opinions about Japan today. The U.S.-allied nation issued a formal apology to American POWs in 2009 and again in 2010, and has paid for some veterans to travel to Japan, leaving them with a more positive view of the Japanese people. All three veterans, however, remain adamant that their wartime experiences, and those of the POWs who didn\u2019t make it, should not be forgotten.\n\n____\n\nTenney, with the 192nd Tank Battalion, U.S. Army, said he was made to march for eight days after his capture.\n\n\u201cYou had to stand on your own two feet and you had to keep moving. If you fell down, you died. If you had to go to the bathroom, you died. If you had a malaria attack, you died. The Japanese would just kill you, period. You had to stay on your feet \u2026 If you looked at a Japanese soldier in the wrong way, he would beat the hell out of you.\u201d\n\nAfter a 28-day journey by ship to Japan, Tenney worked at a coal mine near the town of Omuta run by the Mitsui Mining Co., shoveling coal 12 hours a day for three years. He said British, Australian and Indonesian prisoners also worked there and they had no protective gear, and they\u2019d self-inflict injuries to get days off. His weight dropped from 189 pounds to 97 pounds. He said Mitsui has never responded to his letters calling for an apology.\n\n(Mitsui & Co., which was disbanded after the war and then re-established as a major industrial group, denies having any legal or historical responsibility for Mitsui Mining Co.\u2019s treatment of forced laborers before or during the war. It says therefore it cannot comment on complaints or requests for apologies.)\n\n\u201cIf Mr. Abe comes here I would like him to say, \u2018I bring with me an apology from the industrial giants that enslaved American POWs.\u2019 He could say that very easily \u2026 I\u2019m afraid that when Mr. Abe leaves here, all of it\u2019s going to be forgotten. They\u2019re going to forget about apologies to the POWs, they\u2019re going to forget they did anything wrong. It\u2019s going to like whitewashing the whole thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a high-ranking country today if you\u2019re not willing to face your past. They have to admit their failures. If they admit their failures, then by golly they deserve to have the best.\u201d\n\nAfter the war, Tenney became a professor of economics at Arizona State University and today lives in Carlsbad, California. He has returned to Japan five times and was instrumental in starting Japanese government-supported \u201cfriendship\u201d visits by POWs.\n\n\u201cThe Japanese people were wonderful. They were very kind, they were very hospitable, no question about it. They treated us beautifully \u2026 And there\u2019s no reason why they shouldn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t do anything wrong (in the war).\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Japan\u2019s views of WWII history rankles some US veterans", "title": "Japan\u2019s views of WWII history rankles some US veterans", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Japan\u2019s views of WWII history rankles some US veterans", "title": "Japan\u2019s views of WWII history rankles some US veterans", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/25/japans_views_of_wwii_history_rankles_some_us_veterans/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/us-japan.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Japan\u2019s views of WWII history rankles some US veterans", "title": "Japan\u2019s views of WWII history rankles some US veterans", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/us-japan.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Matthew Pennington", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5afe\"", "article_summary": "The Associated Press spoke to three U.S. war veterans about their surrender in the Philippines in 1942 and their exploitation as slave laborers in Japan.\nThe AP also asked the veterans for opinions about Japan today.\nAll three veterans, however, remain adamant that their wartime experiences, and those of the POWs who didn\u2019t make it, should not be forgotten.\nThey\u2019re going to forget about apologies to the POWs, they\u2019re going to forget they did anything wrong.\nYet as Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe prepares to address Congress next week, in the 70th anniversary year of the war\u2019s end, something rankles the U.S. military veteran about Japan\u2019s attitude toward its past."}
