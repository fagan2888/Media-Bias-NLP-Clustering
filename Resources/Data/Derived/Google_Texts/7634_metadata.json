The cost comes out to the equivalent of about $16,500 for 10 weeks, reports the conservative Daily Express, which rather predictably scoffs at using taxpayer money to remind \u201cfat people\u201d to do what is \u201cjust common sense.\u201d\n\nThe right-wing paper has no trouble finding an outraged man on the street to vent his indignation: \u201cIt is insane that they are spending 10 grand on sending texts,\u201d 38-year-old James Robinson tells the paper. \u201cIt is a joke, surely there are better ways to spend money helping people lose weight.\u201d\n\nThis is all, on a smaller scale, reminiscent of conservatives' stateside attacks on the Affordable Care Act and, more specifically, Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d campaign. In 2010, Sean Hannity decried the first lady\u2019s efforts to tackle the obesity crisis as \u201ctaking the nanny state to a new level\u201d and predicted that the government would soon be \u201cfining us for eating salt.\u201d For his part, an even-more-paranoid-than-usual Rush Limbaugh warned that the White House would no doubt start monitoring his show to \u201creport\u201d listeners who are \u201cpart of the obesity problem.\u201d\n\nYet it\u2019s telling that, when I looked at the Daily Express story, the top \u201crelated article\u201d linked at the bottom of the page is about a five-year-old girl who had to be taken into custody by social workers because she weighed in at a staggering 140 pounds. That story begins: \u201cShocked politicians said last night that it was a \u2018sad sign of our times\u2019 as Britain faced up to an obesity epidemic among schoolchildren.\u201d\n\nOK, so surely we can agree that sending obese residents encouraging reminders to make healthy choices is better (and less expensive) than taking overweight kids into custody, right?\n\nIt\u2019s just another reminder of how extreme conservative paranoia (or, more cynically put, a \u201cparanoia\u201d hyped to boost ratings and readership) is thoroughly perverting our views on government, even when dealing with an indisputable public health crisis like obesity. Even the most benign attempts by officials at just about any level of any government to do something about an epidemic that is poised to take as horrendous a toll on our health as smoking did a generation ago is met with the \"slippery slope to socialism/food police/fast-food inquisition\u201d argument.\n\n\u201cI should be free to stuff myself silly and have to be dumped in my grave with a backhoe!\u201d That seems to be the argument, \u00e0 la \u201cYou can pry that Baconator from my cold, dead hands.\u201d\n\nFine. But what the story in the Daily Express conveniently glosses over is that the program in Stoke-on-Trent is a pilot program\u2014and no one is being forced into it. There is no city registry of obese residents, no angular, trim, severe Minister of Food Police tracking what the locals weigh. Residents are being sought to voluntarily sign up to receive the texts, and part of the money being spent will study the outcome\u2014i.e., asking \u201cdoes it work?\u201d and \u201cshould we expand it?\u201d\n\nWho knows? Maybe daily reminders to do healthy things will help people lose weight\u2014and if it doesn\u2019t, then scrap the program. But in an era when Coke and McDonald's are spending untold millions to convince the world that you can be as fit as an Olympic athlete and still gorge on their high-calorie products, a few thousands dollars spent on texts reminding you that fruits and veggies are healthier choices seems like a drop in the bucket.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jason Best", "description": "Conservatives are ridiculing one local government&#039;s novel approach to tackling obesity.", "rights": "TakePart is the Social Action Network\u2122 of Participant Media. \u00a9 2008-2016 TakePart, LLC", "og": {"site_name": "TakePart", "description": "Conservatives are ridiculing one local government&#039;s novel approach to tackling obesity.", "title": "Texting Obese People to 'Eat Fruit': Silly Stunt or Desperate Measure?", "url": "http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/02/12/texting-obese-people-eat-fruit-silly-stunt-or-desperate-measure", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/169132615%20copy.jpg", "height": 427}, "type": "article"}, "abstract": "Conservatives are ridiculing one local government&#039;s novel approach to tackling obesity.", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-13 11:38:25", "fb": {"admins": 1327833247, "pages": 9287842439, "app_id": 247137505296280}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "Food", "MobileOptimized": 320, "sailthru.tags": "food,obesity,health,diet,openpublish_article", "tab-keywords": "Food, Obesity, health, diet", "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives are ridiculing one local government&#039;s novel approach to tackling obesity.", "creator": "@TakePart", "url": "http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/02/12/texting-obese-people-eat-fruit-silly-stunt-or-desperate-measure", "image": "http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/169132615%20copy.jpg", "title": "Texting Obese People to 'Eat Fruit': Silly Stunt or Desperate Measure?", "site": "@TakePart", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8224\"", "article_summary": "There is no city registry of obese residents, no angular, trim, severe Minister of Food Police tracking what the locals weigh.\nIt\u2019s the sort of headline nanny-state-fearing conservatives love to howl about: \u201cCouncil Spends \u00a310,000 Texting Obese Residents Telling Them to \u2018Eat Fruit.\u2019 \u201d But is the attempt by one local government in the U.K. to battle its community\u2019s burgeoning obesity epidemic really that absurd?\nBut what the story in the Daily Express conveniently glosses over is that the program in Stoke-on-Trent is a pilot program\u2014and no one is being forced into it.\nMaybe daily reminders to do healthy things will help people lose weight\u2014and if it doesn\u2019t, then scrap the program.\nHere\u2019s the story: The city council for Stoke-on-Trent, a town of about 240,000 some 50 miles from Liverpool, has launched a pilot program to send obese residents health-conscious text messages, urging them to, say, use the stairs instead of the elevator or (yes) eat more fruit."}
