She also founded \u201cTake Our Daughters to Work Day\u201d in 1993. Recently, she joined the tech startup Personal Blackbox as a director, and in this new company has been working mostly with men.\n\nRelated: Why Men and Women Still Can\u2019t Get Along at Work\n\nGenerally speaking, she says, \u201cMen are quite good at establishing their credentials in the workplace, sometimes over and over again, to inspire confidence in those around them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll jump into a conversation, even talk over each other, and say, \u2018I can help with that. I did it in my last job. I know how to do it.\u2019 They think nothing of conveying their competence that way.\u201d\n\nMerlino stressed that this workplace strength of men\u2019s is not necessarily about tooting one\u2019s own horn \u2013 it\u2019s not bragging, although that can happen and when it does, it can go over the line. \u201cMost of the time, it\u2019s more about articulating the experiences they\u2019ve had, why they\u2019re good at what they do, and how they can be instrumental to their teams at work in order to achieve a common goal,\u201d she told The Fiscal Times in an interview.\n\nRelated: 5 Outrageous Workplace Etiquette Mistakes\n\nWomen, however, \u201cabsolutely do not do this enough,\u201d says Merlino. \u201cThey hang back. They wait to be invited. They don\u2019t keep reminding the managers and leaders around them \u2013 the people who make very important decisions all day long \u2013 about their expertise or how they can be helpful to the team. I see very clearly how the guys at work feel confident and comfortable speaking up about themselves \u2013 women don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThis asset on the part of male workers may be partly responsible for why employers and colleagues tend to have more confidence in men at work than they do women, says Merlino. A Pew Research Center survey last year found that while most Americans said it didn\u2019t matter to them if their co-workers were men or women, those who did have a preference \u2013 22 percent of respondents \u2013 favored working with men over women.\n\nMerlino says the ongoing communication of competence is critical. \u201cUnlike the guys, women tend to assume that once they get the job, it should be obvious who they are and what they bring to the table \u2013 since it\u2019s all there on their resumes. They assume people know their value,\u201d she says. \u201cI really think women have to get more comfortable talking about their expertise in a way that reassures others that they know what they\u2019re doing, that they can lead a group or make key decisions on a project \u2013 as opposed to assuming people know these things.\u201d\n\nThis can be done effectively without turning people off, she advises. \u201cWomen can say, \u2018This is what I\u2019m really good at,\u2019 \u2018here\u2019s how I can help,\u2019 or \u2018I know some people who might help us\u2019 \u2013 all of that works.\u201d\n\nRelated: 6 Wise Ways to Boost Your Career This Year\n\nOther leaders who manage teams and expect to hear from all players second her insights. \u201cIf you get people talking and challenging each other, you\u2019re going to have the ability to arrive at the right decision so much quicker and easier,\u201d Robin Domeniconi, chief marketing officer for Rue La La and former chief brand officer at the Elle Group, told Adam Bryant for his book, Quick and Nimble: Lessons from Leading CEOs on How to Create a Culture of Innovation. Domeniconi added that she manages teams by saying, \u201cLet\u2019s win. Let\u2019s figure it out together.\u201d\n\nSo what can women teach the guys at work?\n\nIn a word: collaboration.\n\n\u201cWomen are often more collaborative in the workplace. Companies that have women on their boards and women in leadership positions often do better,\u201d says Merlino, adding that for every study that says women bosses are harder to work with than male bosses there\u2019s a study saying how collaborative women achieve success.\n\nRelated: More Women Become Household CFOs\n\nJennifer Berdahl, an organizational behavior expert at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management, found, \u201cWork teams made up mostly of women tend to share leadership roles more than teams dominated by men.\u201d In her study published in the March issue of Group Dynamics: Theory, Research and Practice, she says, \u201cWomen tend to prefer egalitarian norms in work groups, whereas men favor hierarchical structures,\u201d adding that this impacts how the two genders work together.\n\nMerlino says the benefits of collaborative work are critical and women get this intuitively. \u201cWomen tend to listen to a wide array of people to decide what\u2019s going to be right for customers, clients, constituents. They apply this skill every day to their families, businesses, and communities. Maximizing collaboration at work is essential to get things done \u2013 and if there were ever a need for collaboration at almost every level of business and society, it is now.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Nell Merlino knows the one thing men do better at work than women.", "title": "What Women Can Learn from Men at Work", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/02/What-Women-Can-Learn-Men-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05052010_LonelyOffice_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/02/What-Women-Can-Learn-Men-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05052010_LonelyOffice_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Nell Merlino knows the one thing men do better at work than women.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd933f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWomen tend to listen to a wide array of people to decide what\u2019s going to be right for customers, clients, constituents.\nNell Merlino knows the one thing men do better at work than women.\nCompanies that have women on their boards and women in leadership positions often do better,\u201d says Merlino, adding that for every study that says women bosses are harder to work with than male bosses there\u2019s a study saying how collaborative women achieve success.\nA Pew Research Center survey last year found that while most Americans said it didn\u2019t matter to them if their co-workers were men or women, those who did have a preference \u2013 22 percent of respondents \u2013 favored working with men over women.\nThe former head of Count Me In for Women\u2019s Economic Independence, a not-for-profit business resource for women, Merlino, 61, worked almost exclusively in female-dominated environments for more than 30 years."}
