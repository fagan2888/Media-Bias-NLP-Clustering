Schaler, Burkley and Grant-Nierman, and I started in the fall of 2012 to make the changes, and I will devote my time, after July 1, to collecting, analyzing and reporting what we have learned back to CMS (Medicare), the major funder of the initiative.\n\nWhile she has enjoyed her 22 years of patient care in Salida, she is excited about the transition to a new aspect of health care, leaving her practice in the hands of Dr. Dan Lombardo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to have participated in the lives of my patients,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cDr. Lombardo and his family will be a great addition to the community, and I have the utmost confidence that my patients will have a wonderful relationship with him in the years to come.\u201d\n\nReeves was Dr. Mary Underwood when she joined First Street Family Health with Drs. Leo Leonardi and William Mehos and physician\u2019s assistant Eileen Van Dyke in July 1993. The mother of 14-year-old twins and a 10-year-old daughter, she was a nontraditional medical student and faced some barriers as an older student, a single mother and a woman in medicine.\n\n\u201cI expected to face some issues with that in Salida, but they never came up,\u201d she said. \u201cDrs. Leonardi and Mehos as well as the physicians in the other practices just saw me as a colleague, and they mentored me from the beginning in a respectful way.\u201d\n\nReeves is probably the first female physician to serve Salida. Back in the late 1800s a female homeopathic physician and her brother had a practice here, but The Mountain Mail was unable to find any other record of a female physician prior to Reeves.\n\nShe graduated from the University of Colorado Medical School and came to Salida from St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Grand Junction after completing her residency and internship. For Reeves, medicine was a second career. She had been a science teacher, working with junior high, high school and community college students.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to practice rural medicine, and Salida was a perfect fit,\u201d she said.\n\nMoving to Salida also brought another change in her life. She met her husband, Bill Reeves, in the process of the move. They were married Jan. 1, 1994.\n\nBill has also contributed to the community as a member of Salida Brass for many years, choir director at First Methodist Church, member of High Country Fine Arts Association, Colorado Mountain College Jazz Project and running for Chaffee County commissioner among other civic projects.\n\nBetween them they have seven children and nine grandchildren.\n\n\u201cThe collegiality of the medical community in Salida was a big part of its attraction,\u201d Reeves said as she recalled her initial impressions of the community.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel that in other towns. I wanted to practice the full spectrum of family medicine, including obstetrics, and in many other areas I couldn\u2019t include obstetrics because someone else was offering it, or there wasn\u2019t as congenial a relationship with the different practices or with the hospital.\n\n\u201cThe community welcomed both Bill and me, and it is a very special community to be a part of.\u201d\n\nOne of the major changes over the years has been the switch from paper charting to electronic medical records. Patients\u2019 records are now typed into a computer and can be accessed quickly for information on medications, allergies, etc.\n\n\u201cIn general, computers have made life better for patients and doctors,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cPatients can also look up a lot of information themselves, and this has empowered patients.\u201d\n\nSince joining First Street Family Health, Reeves has moved to both new offices and a new hospital. The practice moved into the present location at 910 Rush Drive in 2009, a year after Heart of the Rockies Regional Medical Center opened in its new location at 1000 Rush Drive, off Colo. 291 on the west side of Salida.\n\n\u201cWhen we moved into the new office, I wanted a plant, so I bought an orchid at Safeway, and I watered it faithfully from April until July when my stepdaughter came to visit,\u201d Reeves laughed. \u201cI was showing her around the new office and was proud of the orchid since it was doing so well, and then my stepdaughter said, \u2018You know it\u2019s plastic, don\u2019t you?\u2019\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized it was plastic because it was so lifelike! I haven\u2019t watered it since, and it still looks as good as it did when I bought it.\u201d\n\nWith a little more time on her hands, she also plans to do some traveling, visit her children and grandchildren and read a book before book club.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "TheMountainMail.com", "description": "Dr. Mary Reeves is retiring from patient care on July 1.", "title": "Dr. Mary Reeves retires from patient care July 1", "url": "http://www.themountainmail.com/free_content/article_de71b234-ff01-11e4-8438-ab804172aa8e.html", "image": {"width": 432, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/themountainmail.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/57/f571a6e2-ff01-11e4-905c-8f78c4dc81c9/555ca37a3a2ca.image.jpg?resize=432%2C504", "height": 504}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheMtnMail", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Dr. Mary Reeves is retiring from patient care on July 1.", "fb": {"app_id": 135817296433862}, "keywords": "rockies regional medical center,chaffee county,colorado mountain college jazz project,high country fine arts association,salida brass,female homeopathic physician,mary underwood,william mehos,leo leonardi,dan lombardo,bill reeves,eileen van dyke,physician,mary reeves,health_medical_pharma,chaffee county colorado,free_content,business,featured", "news_keywords": "rockies regional medical center,chaffee county,colorado mountain college jazz project,high country fine arts association,salida brass,female homeopathic physician,mary underwood,william mehos,leo leonardi,dan lombardo,bill reeves,eileen van dyke,physician,mary reeves,health_medical_pharma,chaffee county colorado,free_content,business,featured"}, "article_summary": "Dr. Mary Reeves is retiring from patient care on July 1.\nAfter 22 years with First Street Family Health, she is leaving patient care to work part time on policy-making with the Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to have participated in the lives of my patients,\u201d Reeves said.\nWhile she has enjoyed her 22 years of patient care in Salida, she is excited about the transition to a new aspect of health care, leaving her practice in the hands of Dr. Dan Lombardo.\n\u201cColorado is one of seven states and we are one of 71 primary care practices in this state participating,\u201d Reeves explained."}
