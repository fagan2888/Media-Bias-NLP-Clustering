Our campaign finance system is broken.\n\nThere is too much money in politics. There is too little transparency about where that money is coming from. And there may be people who are breaking our election laws and not being held accountable. It\u2019s impacting our ability to elect good and ethical people to office.\n\nMost importantly, it\u2019s impacting progress on the important issues that everyday Mainers care about, such as education, creating jobs and ensuring we have a clean and healthy environment for generations to come. Because when politicians are dependent on wealthy special interests to finance their campaigns, they tend to listen to them. Meanwhile, everyday Mainers who don\u2019t have deep pockets and can\u2019t write big campaign checks get ignored.\n\nThis November, Mainers \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, Greens and independents \u2014 have an opportunity to take a big step forward in fixing our broken campaign finance system by voting yes on Question 1.\n\nQuestion 1 takes on the lack of transparency and rapidly increasing amount of secret money in elections by strengthening Maine\u2019s inadequate disclosure laws. Although the Supreme Court has made it clear that we can\u2019t ban or limit outside money, we can strengthen disclosure requirements and ensure that voters know where that money is coming from. Question 1 does that by requiring that outside groups spending money in support of or opposition to a candidate disclose their top three donors on political ads so Mainers can follow the money and know who is trying to influence the election of a given candidate.\n\nQuestion 1 also increases fines and penalties for those who break our election laws so that those who violate our campaign finance rules are truly held accountable. Right now the largest fine ever levied in Maine was just 2.5 percent of what was spent illegally. Question 1 would allow the state to fine groups and politicians breaking our campaign finance laws up to 100 percent of what they spent illegally.\n\nMost importantly, Question 1 will limit the direct influence of wealthy special interests on politicians by restoring clean election funding so candidates can run competitive races for office without being beholden to big money donors.\n\nStrengthening our public campaign finance system puts the focus on strict spending limits and small dollar donations from everyday Mainers who live in a candidate\u2019s district. This means we can level the playing field, empower candidates and elevate the voice of everyday Mainers in our elections. This will help ensure that politicians are working for the people of Maine and representing their interests.\n\nThere certainly is no silver bullet to fixing our campaign finance system. But Question 1 is a comprehensive approach to campaign finance reform that makes huge progress in disclosing where the big money in our elections is coming from and helps restore the voice of the people in our democracy.\n\nWe have a clear choice in front of us on Nov. 3. We can either do nothing as the playing field tilts even more in the favor of the wealthy special interests, or we can move forward by voting yes on Question 1 and ensuring we truly have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nThis November, I am voting yes on Question 1.\n\nSherry Huber is a former member of the Maine House of Representatives (1976-1982) and the first woman to run in the Republican Party for governor of Maine (1982).
