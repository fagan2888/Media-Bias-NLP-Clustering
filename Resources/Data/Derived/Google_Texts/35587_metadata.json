The two major parties are not only highly polarized ideologically, but as Dan Balz noted in The Washington Post, \u201cpolarization has ushered in a new era in state government, where single-party control of the levers of power has produced competing Americas.\u201d Three-quarters of US states are now controlled by one of the two major parties \u2014 the most in 60 years \u2014 and \u201cofficials in these states are moving unencumbered to enact their party\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nWhen the Supreme Court ruled that states could decline Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion without facing a penalty, the justices set in motion a process that\u2019s now pushing our two countries even further apart as about half of the states passed on the opportunity to insure their poorer residents.\n\nThe overall numbers are in, and for all its warts, Obamacare appears to have extended insurance coverage to about ten million people who didn\u2019t have it before. (The precise number varies from study to study, but as Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo points out, they\u2019re all in the same ballpark.)\n\nAccording to Gallup, the share of Americans who lack health insurance has fallen to the lowest level since before the Great Recession began.\n\nBut the Urban Institute offers a fascinating finding: The rate of uninsured is now almost 50 percent higher in states that refused the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA) Medicaid expansion (18.1 percent) than in those that embraced the policy (12.4 percent).\n\nThis chart tells the story:\n\nThis growing coverage gap isn\u2019t entirely a result of the Medicaid expansion \u2014 the rate of uninsured dropped by four percentage points in expanding states and 1.5 points in states that refused the expansion. Rather, it reflects the fact that \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d states have always had very different budget priorities \u2014 the latter, as a group, have long spent more on health care, education and anti-poverty programs, and Obamacare\u2019s ACA expansion, which offers billions of federal dollars to states that take it, is now deepening that divide.\n\nNow that legislating is all but impossible in a deadlocked Washington, these kinds of differences between \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d America will only grow starker. And it goes well beyond health care \u2014 last week, Maryland joined Connecticut in raising that state\u2019s minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, and a number of other states under Democratic control are expected to follow. The same dynamic is playing out with other issues \u2014 from paid sick leave to prison reform to efforts to tackle climate change.\n\nWe\u2019re witnessing an important real-world experiment in state governance, and as the Urban Institute study shows, the results are already coming in.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rate of uninsured is now about 50 percent higher in states that refused to expand Medicaid.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "The rate of uninsured is now about 50 percent higher in states that refused to expand Medicaid.", "title": "Obamacare Is Widening the Gap Between \"Red\" and \"Blue\" America | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-07-at-1.18.10-PM.png", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2014-06-18T16:52:59-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2014/04/07/obamacare-is-widening-the-gap-between-red-and-blue-america/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The rate of uninsured is now about 50 percent higher in states that refused to expand Medicaid.", "creator": "@JoshuaHol", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-07-at-1.18.10-PM.png", "title": "Obamacare Is Widening the Gap Between \"Red\" and \"Blue\" America | BillMoyers.com", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2014-04-07T15:56:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-18T16:52:59-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20140407, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc03c\"", "article_summary": "Now that legislating is all but impossible in a deadlocked Washington, these kinds of differences between \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d America will only grow starker.\nThe fact that the citizens of \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d states live in what are essentially two countries with very different governments has largely flown under the radar, but it may become the defining story of our time.\n(The precise number varies from study to study, but as Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo points out, they\u2019re all in the same ballpark.)\nThis chart tells the story:This growing coverage gap isn\u2019t entirely a result of the Medicaid expansion \u2014 the rate of uninsured dropped by four percentage points in expanding states and 1.5 points in states that refused the expansion.\nWe\u2019re witnessing an important real-world experiment in state governance, and as the Urban Institute study shows, the results are already coming in."}
