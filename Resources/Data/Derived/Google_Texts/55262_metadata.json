Probably not. But it\u2019s that type of frugal living that helped four everyday people to amass their seven-figure net worth and, along with it, financial security.\n\nMore than 10 million U.S. households have a net worth of $1 million or more, a record high representing nearly 9 percent of all households in the country. While that seems like a small percentage, it\u2019s still one in 11 households, which means a millionaire could be tucked away in your neighborhood rather than leading an extravagant life peppered with luxuries and indulgences.\n\nTFT interviewed four \u201ceveryday millionaires,\u201d including Darrow Kirkpatrick, 55, of Santa Fe, New Mexico; Julie Rains, 55, of Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Jeremy Jacobson, 41, world resident; and Jeff Johnson, 37, of Somerset County, New Jersey. Through disciplined saving and savvy, yet simple investing, they grew their wealth enough to travel the world, retire years earlier than the norm and enjoy peace of mind.\n\nRelated: The 25 Richest People in the US\n\n\u201cThese millionaires next door don\u2019t have lavish lifestyles,\u201d says Farnoosh Torabi a personal finance expert and financial education partner with Chase Slate. She also interviewed these everyday millionaires on her daily \u201cSo Money\u201d podcast. \u201cBut they enjoy their lives. They are very conscious how they want to design their lives to get a lot of financial security.\u201d\n\nSo how did they do it? Some of the commonalities among the four include hyper-saving, smart and consistent investing and thoughtful spending when it comes to homes, cars, vacations and small treats. They also benefited from earning higher salaries during their working years versus the median income along with other blessings when it came to covering education expenses and health care costs.\n\nHere are their secrets.\n\nSave\u2026and Then Save Some More\n\nAmericans on average save 5.5 percent of their after-tax income, according to the latest data available, while conventional wisdom is to put 10 percent away. But these everyday millionaires are socking away a whole lot more. \u201cThey are super savers,\u201d says Torabi. \u201cThey cut it out of their budget and live with what they have left.\u201d\n\nJeff Johnson, who works in pharma marketing and sales, says that he and his family live on less than half of his take-home pay and save the rest. That may not seem like a lot to live on, but it\u2019s enough to allow his wife to stay home to care for their three-year-old son. \u201cWhenever we had an opportunity like a bonus or promotion, we never increased our lifestyle,\u201d says Johnson, who estimates his net worth at $2.5 million, not including his home.\n\nJeremy Jacobson and his wife, Winnie\u2014whose net worth is well north of $1 million\u2014put away more than 70 percent of their income for over 10 years before retiring more than three years ago to travel the world with their baby son. Jacobson said when he first met his wife in Beijing on a business trip, she was already saving half of her income. They worked up to the 70 percent\u2014it didn\u2019t happen all at once\u2014by making small changes in their lifestyle along the way.\n\nRelated: 6 Traits of an Emerging Millionaire: Are You One?\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at after-tax income and you\u2019re saving 10 percent, after about nine years, you roughly have enough money to take one year off,\u201d Jacobson says. \u201cBut if you\u2019re saving 90 percent of income, you can take nine years off after saving just one year.\u201d\n\nInvest Wisely\n\nA large part of these everyday millionaires\u2019 success was investing their savings for the long term. That meant first maxing out contributions to 401(k)s, IRAs and ROTH retirement plans and getting the full company match on employer-sponsored plans, if one existed.\n\nAfter that, the majority of these millionaires kept their investing strategy simple. Darrow Kirkpatrick, who has a net worth between $1 million and $2 million, has only seven holdings for his money. \u201cThey are mostly mutual funds, index or very low-cost managed funds with about 50/50 stock and bond,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much how it\u2019s been since the early 2000s.\u201d\n\nJacobsen and Johnson also use mostly index funds. Interestingly, all three swear by Vanguard\u2019s funds, which are low cost.\n\nJulie Rains, who said her net worth is in the millions but didn\u2019t disclose an amount, prefers mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and individual stocks. \u201cIt does take some time to pick those stocks, but I do like that the best,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I like to look for is a solid performer that is well-priced.\u201d\n\nReduce Large Expenses\n\nKirkpatrick says one of the keys to his success was not overspending on real estate. He and his family owned a modest home in Tennessee for 17 years and only renovated before selling it. \u201cWe weren\u2019t house-swapping. We also didn\u2019t dump a lot of money into the house,\u201d says Kirkpatrick, who retired in 2011. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that people put huge amounts into their homes and that has huge costs for their financial freedom.\u201d Now, he and his wife rent their two-bedroom condo in Santa Fe for $1,500 a month.\n\nRelated: Asia About to Blow Past U.S. as World\u2019s Wealthiest Region\n\nSimilarly, Rains has lived in the same home for decades and when she bought it, she didn\u2019t stretch. Both Kirkpatrick and Rains don\u2019t borrow to buy cars\u2014Kirkpatrick and his wife share only one. They buy recent, used models and keep them for as long as they can.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re making a car loan payment, you\u2019re not investing that money,\u201d says Rains.\n\nJacobson and his wife didn\u2019t buy a home and don\u2019t have a car. They chose rentals in Seattle that were located in a walkable neighborhood, close to the bus line and as cheap as they could find. Jacobson also biked to work to save on commuting costs.\n\nCut Out Frivolous Line Items\n\nEven when Jacobson and his wife went on vacation\u2014which weren\u2019t lavish\u2014they did it with saving in mind. \u201cWe would sign up for a credit card reward program to get free flights and hotel,\u201d he says. \u201cOur honeymoon was 10 days hiking around Mt. Rainier in Seattle. It basically cost us nothing.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2014who lives with his family in the townhouse he bought in 2004\u2014carefully monitors their spending. It\u2019s a practice he started as a senior in high school, which made him realize how much money he spent simply buying lunch.\n\n\u201cI still bring my lunch to work,\u201d he says. \u201cIs it worth spending $2,000 a year on lunch?\u201d\n\nTo get around the urge to eat out, Jacobson\u2019s wife spent a lot of time becoming a serious cook. \u201cNinety percent of our food comes out of our kitchen, and her cooking is better than most any restaurant we could go to,\u201d he says.\n\nThe sacrifices paid off. They now are globetrotting around the world, spending a few months in different countries\u2014now in Malaysia, Europe in the spring\u2014with a $40,000-a-year budget. They have found they can live like kings on that budget in many low-cost countries.\n\nPossibility Starts With a Good-Paying Job\n\nTo be sure, these everyday millionaires were blessed with a few advantages that helped catapult their net worth. For starters, each had jobs that on average make more than the median income. Johnson works in pharma sales and marketing and, his wife, before staying home to care for their child, worked at a university as a department psychologist. Jacobson was an engineer at Microsoft and his wife was a project manager at Dell.\n\nKirkpatrick was a software engineer. He also has affordable health insurance in retirement because his wife, who was a public school teacher, was allowed to buy into her health insurance.\n\nRains\u2019 husband still works as a logistics manager, working toward a full pension, and provides medical insurance through his work. Before, they profited from his company\u2019s stock program \u201cthat did very well,\u201d says Rains, who previously worked for a regional bank and now is a part-time freelance writer.\n\nAs for college expenses, Rains had one son go to in-state university with affordable tuition that was covered by savings. Kirkpatrick\u2019s son ended up getting a full scholarship to a public university, while Johnson himself got a scholarship for his schooling. (His wife, though, ended up with undergraduate and graduate school debt. Both Jacobson and his wife were saddled with huge student loans they paid off.)\n\nManage the Bumps in the Road\n\nThe journey toward a seven-figure net worth wasn\u2019t always smooth. \u201cI did some dumb things in the beginning, fortunately with small sums of money,\u201d says Kirkpatrick. One of his most memorable mistakes was getting involved in the dot-com mania. \u201cI invested a few thousand dollars, quadrupled my money and then watched it go back down to the price I bought it at,\u201d he recalls.\n\nJacobson tried and failed at real estate investing and picking individual stocks. He ended up settling on index investing. \u201cIt\u2019s easy, even if at first it feels like you aren\u2019t getting any traction,\u201d he says.\n\nRains found that she hadn\u2019t saved enough for her youngest son\u2019s college education. He went to an out-of-state school, which cost more. \u201cI definitely would have set aside money in a 529 more quickly when they got popular,\u201d she says. \u201cI would have also taken my child to visit more in-state schools during high school.\u201d\n\nJohnson fell for his weakness for cars, but not too hard. He bought a BMW five years ago with all cash. \u201cIf I take a step back, I could have saved $5,000 or $10,000 buying another car. Was it the smartest thing?\u201d he says. \u201cYou got to live, too, and enjoy life. You can\u2019t always save. I still enjoy driving that car.\u201d\n\nSlideshow: The 25 Richest People in the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When you picture a millionaire\u2019s lifestyle, does townhouse living or budgeting only $4", "title": "How To Become an Everyday Millionaire\u2026From Those Who\u2019ve Done It", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/29/How-Become-Everyday-Millionaire-Those-Who-ve-Done-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11082011_Venture_Growth_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/29/How-Become-Everyday-Millionaire-Those-Who-ve-Done-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11082011_Venture_Growth_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When you picture a millionaire\u2019s lifestyle, does townhouse living or budgeting only $4", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But it\u2019s that type of frugal living that helped four everyday people to amass their seven-figure net worth and, along with it, financial security.\nPossibility Starts With a Good-Paying JobTo be sure, these everyday millionaires were blessed with a few advantages that helped catapult their net worth.\nManage the Bumps in the RoadThe journey toward a seven-figure net worth wasn\u2019t always smooth.\nDarrow Kirkpatrick, who has a net worth between $1 million and $2 million, has only seven holdings for his money.\nMore than 10 million U.S. households have a net worth of $1 million or more, a record high representing nearly 9 percent of all households in the country."}
