The newly revised CSA permits practitioners to carry and administer those drugs when providing medical care in rural areas, making house calls and responding to emergencies in the field.\n\nThe AVMA advises veterinarians who are still unclear about how to comply with the updated regulations to consult the Diversion Control Program Manager at their respective DEA field offices.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.vin.com/images/VNS_avatar_2015.png", "type": "website", "description": "Law allows veterinarians to carry drugs beyond practices"}, "fb": {"admins": 1082106638}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe25dd\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama signed the Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act on Friday, making it legal for veterinarians to transport controlled substances beyond their brick-and-mortar practices.\nThe Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act amends the Controlled Substance Act (CSA) to permit veterinarians to freely transport the drugs they need to euthanize, anesthetize or manage pain in animals as long as they have a license to practice and are registered with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).\nThe new law is two years in the making, representing the lobbying of thousands of practitioners as well as officials with the American Veterinary Medical Association.\nVeterinarians often administer controlled substances for pain management, anesthesia and euthanasia.\nThe AVMA advises veterinarians who are still unclear about how to comply with the updated regulations to consult the Diversion Control Program Manager at their respective DEA field offices."}
