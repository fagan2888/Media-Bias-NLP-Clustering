Barack Obama Secretly Filmed Working Out in Poland

There was a major Secret Service breach this week in Poland ... because someone was able to sneak video ofworking out at the gym ... and it's not pretty.Obama, who is in Poland to rally Eastern European support against Russian aggression, was filmed working out in a hotel in Warsaw ... and somehow whoever took the video managed to do so without being made by Secret Service.The workout is a little scattered -- some arms, some legs, some shoulders -- and his form could use some work.But hey, as long as he's still commander-in-chief of the biggest army in the world ... who cares how much he can bench?
