He is the third this month approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate.\n\nJohn Michael Vazquez won confirmation late Wednesday on a vote of 84-2 to be a U.S. district judge in New Jersey. Vazquez had the backing of New Jersey\u2019s two Democrat senators, Robert Menendez and Cory Booker.\n\nTwo Republicans opposed Vazquez\u2019s confirmation: Sens. James Lankford of Oklahoma and Dan Sullivan of Alaska. Fourteen senators missed the vote on the chamber\u2019s first day back after last week\u2019s blizzard.\n\nOf the six roll-call votes in the Senate so far in 2016, half have been to confirm Obama-appointed judges. The Senate previously confirmed Luis Felipe Restrepo to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals on Jan. 11 and Wilhelmina Wright as a federal district judge in Minnesota on Jan. 19.\n\nHeritage Action for America, a sister organization of The Heritage Foundation, opposed Vazquez\u2019s confirmation and called on the Senate to stop advancing Obama\u2019s nominees.\n\n\u201cOur system of government requires each branch to jealously guard its prerogatives, and President Obama routinely tramples over the legislature\u2019s prerogatives,\u201d William Wolfe, deputy director of government relations for Heritage Action, said in a statement. \u201cSenators should not stand by idly for the next 12 months. They must act to reassert their constitutional prerogatives.\u201d\n\n>>> Senator Sinks Obama Court Nominee Over \u2018Uncomfortable\u2019 Views on Illegal Immigration\n\nVazquez, who currently works at a law firm in New Jersey, was the state\u2019s first assistant attorney general from 2007 to 2008. As the No. 2 official in the attorney general\u2019s office, he served during the administration of New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, a Democrat. Prior to that role, he was an assistant U.S. attorney under then-U.S. Attorney Chris Christie, now the state\u2019s Republican governor.\n\nIn recent years, Vazquez donated to both of New Jersey\u2019s Democrat senators, giving $2,500 to Menendez during his 2012 re-election and $1,000 to Booker during his 2013 campaign.\n\nUnlike Wright, the previous district court nominee to face a Senate vote, Vazquez encountered little opposition. Wright\u2019s accusation that President Ronald Reagan was a \u201cbigot\u201d and other controversial statements prompted 36 Republicans to oppose her confirmation.\n\nAt least two more Obama judicial nominees could soon be considered. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, promised in December that two Iowans nominated by Obama for federal judgeships would get confirmation votes before Presidents Day in February.\n\nGrassley helped broker the deal for the two Iowans\u2014Leonard Strand and Rebecca Ebinger\u2014in exchange for Senate confirmation votes on Restrepo, Wright, and Vazquez.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will advance other judicial nominees beyond February.\n\nAt some point this year, Republicans are expected to invoke the so-called \u201cLeahy Rule\u201d\u2014named after Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.\u2014to halt the judicial confirmation process. The rule generally applies during the last six months of a lame-duck president\u2019s administration, but the time period can vary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama continued to reshape the federal judiciary with the confirmation of another judge to a lifetime appointment.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Barack Obama continued to reshape the federal judiciary with the confirmation of another judge to a lifetime appointment.", "title": "Senate Confirms Obama Judge With Little GOP Opposition", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160127_ObamaBiden.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-28T10:36:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KGsYtX"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Barack Obama continued to reshape the federal judiciary with the confirmation of another judge to a lifetime appointment.", "title": "Senate Confirms Obama Judge With Little GOP Opposition", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160127_ObamaBiden.jpg"}, "creator": "@RobertBluey", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "nominations", "published_time": "2016-01-27T22:50:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-28T10:36:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "John Michael Vazquez, District Court, federal judge, President Obama, Senate, Robert Menendez, Cory Booker, Chuck Grassley"}, "article_summary": "Unlike Wright, the previous district court nominee to face a Senate vote, Vazquez encountered little opposition.\nGrassley helped broker the deal for the two Iowans\u2014Leonard Strand and Rebecca Ebinger\u2014in exchange for Senate confirmation votes on Restrepo, Wright, and Vazquez.\nPresident Barack Obama continued to reshape the federal judiciary Wednesday with the confirmation of another judge to a lifetime appointment.\nJohn Michael Vazquez won confirmation late Wednesday on a vote of 84-2 to be a U.S. district judge in New Jersey.\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, promised in December that two Iowans nominated by Obama for federal judgeships would get confirmation votes before Presidents Day in February."}
