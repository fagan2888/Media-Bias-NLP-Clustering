Last week, TV host Jimmy Kimmel took a little time to share his opinion on childhood vaccination, which happens to be an opinion he shares with a majority of the health care community. Members of the anti-vaccination movement, not so affectionately known as anti-vaxxers, heard Kimmel’s pro-vaccination message loud and clear, so they decided to voice their own opinions via Twitter.

Spoiler alert: Their reactions are not what you would call sensible.

“Last week on the show, we got a group of real doctors together to do a public service announcement urging parents to vaccinate their kids,” the video description reads. “While a lot of people enjoyed it, it also made a small group of people unbelievably angry. Jimmy believes strongly in vaccination, but in the interest of fairness, we gave our community activist team Jack and Becky some air time to express their anti-vaccination views.”

Despite a common belief held by anti-vaxxers that corporations are deliberately trying to poison their children and that pharmaceutical companies knowingly distribute vaccinations that can lead to autism development simply for financial gain, the safety and efficiency of vaccinations have been proven time and again. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that vaccines will prevent over 21 million hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths among children born in the past 20 years.
