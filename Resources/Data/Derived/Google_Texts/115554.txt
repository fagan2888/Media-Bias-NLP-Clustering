A photo of a decorated birthday cake from a Meijer grocery store in Michigan has quickly gone viral for its heartwarming tale of kindness toward those with disabilities.

Lisa Sarber Aldrich didn’t think twice when she asked a grocery worker standing near the bakery section of her local Meijer store to write a special birthday message on a cake she was planning to buy. According to Aldrich, she didn’t even notice the handwriting when the cake was first handed back to her. “I looked [the employee] in the eye and said thank you before I even looked at the cake,” Aldrich wrote in a Facebook post.

It wasn’t until Aldrich was at the checkout counter that she noticed something different about the cake. However, according to Aldrich, the poor handwriting didn’t really matter much to her. “I thought people would think it was funny,” she wrote.

The cashier, however, did not share Aldrich’s light-hearted sentiments toward the cake and called a manager over to assess the situation. It was then that Aldrich learned that the employee who had written on her cake was actually developmentally disabled.

“One cashier put her arm on my shoulder and said ‘the girl who wrote that has autism. Thank you for smiling and thanking her — even though she’s not supposed to write on cakes, you probably made her day,” explained Aldrich. “So I guess the moral of the story is that kindness is important.”

Aldrich was assured that the employee who worked on her cake would not be reprimanded for writing on the cake and so far, the heartwarming Facebook post has been shared more than 107,000 times.
