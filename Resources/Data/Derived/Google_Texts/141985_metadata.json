Payment checks are expected to be mailed in late 2014 or early 2015.\n\nBackground\n\nIn December 2013, Ocwen Financial Corporation, and its subsidiary, Ocwen Loan Servicing, agreed to settle a nationwide lawsuit, brought by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the attorneys general of 49 states, and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that Ocwen had engaged in systematic misconduct in its servicing of home loans, including the practice of \u201crobo-signing\u201d foreclosure documents, charging unauthorized fees, procuring premature and unauthorized foreclosures, and deceiving consumers about loan modifications.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Ocwen will be required to provide $2 billion in loan modification relief to its customers and $125 million in refunds to consumers whose homes were foreclosed. North Carolina consumers will receive $26 million of that total recovery.\n\nNow the deadline for North Carolina consumers to obtain their share of the recovery is fast approaching.\n\nTake Action\n\nNorth Carolina consumers who lost their home to foreclosure between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2012 and whose loans were serviced by Ocwen, Litton, or Homeward (formerly known as American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc. or AHMSI) should have received a package from Rust Consulting, the settlement administrator. The package contained a cover letter, claim form and instructions in English and Spanish in the mail.\n\nConsumers have until September 15 to return their claim form. So far only 35% of the approximately 3,400 North Carolina residents who were sent claim forms have mailed them in.\n\nConsumers can also file claims online at www.NationalMortgageSettlementOcwenClaim.com.\n\nConsumers who believe they are eligible but have not received information about the settlement should contact the settlement administrator at 1-866-783-5382 or settlementadministrator@nationalocwensettlement.com.\n\nFor more information about the Settlement, see https://nationalocwensettlement.com/mainpage/Home.aspx and http://www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com/", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc884\"", "article_summary": "Now the deadline for North Carolina consumers to obtain their share of the recovery is fast approaching.\nNorth Carolina consumers will receive $26 million of that total recovery.\nSo far only 35% of the approximately 3,400 North Carolina residents who were sent claim forms have mailed them in.\nConsumers who believe they are eligible but have not received information about the settlement should contact the settlement administrator at 1-866-783-5382 or settlementadministrator@nationalocwensettlement.com.\nBackgroundIn December 2013, Ocwen Financial Corporation, and its subsidiary, Ocwen Loan Servicing, agreed to settle a nationwide lawsuit, brought by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the attorneys general of 49 states, and the District of Columbia."}
