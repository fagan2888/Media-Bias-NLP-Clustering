Scene of crash on I-135 near 77th street exit

One person was rushed to the hospital with serious injuries following a crash on a stretch of highway.

It happened shortly after midnight Saturday on northbound I-135 near 77th street exit. Troopers say a 41-year old driver was driving northbound on I-135 when the vehicle left the roadway and struck a guard rain in the median. The vehicle then spun around, crossed both lanes of traffic, and ended up in the right lane ditch.

The driver, identified as Ryan Galyardt of Vancouver, WA, was hospitalized with serious injuries.

The Kansas Highway Patrol is still investigating the crash.
