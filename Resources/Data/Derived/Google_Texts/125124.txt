Audax-Backed Winchester Makes Another Add-On in SRI Connector Gage

Audax won Private Equity Firm of the Year and recently closed its 500th deal

Audax Private Equity-backed Winchester Electronics has acquired SRI Connector Gage (SRICG) for an undisclosed amount. The PE firm purchased Winchester in 2006 and SRICG marks Winchester’s 13th add-on under Audax’s ownership.

SRICG, located in Melbourne, Florida, and founded in 1985, manufactures gages. Winchester makes cables and connectors for the broadcasting, technology, aerospace and energy sectors. Norwalk, Connecticut-based Winchester operates the Kings, Source Technology, Bomar and SRC Haverhill brands, among others. Winchester purchased Source Technology in 2014 and Haverhill Cable in 2013.

Audax won Mergers & Acquisitions’ 2015 Mid-Market Award for Private Equity Firm of the Year. While activity in the overall middle market slowed down in 2015, Audax raised its fifth fund, closed 100-plus investments (including 12 platform acquisitions and 91 add-on deals) and selling more portfolio companies than most of its competitors.

In September 2015, Audax completed the firm’s 500th transaction, a small add-on deal made by portfolio company Advanced Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery (ADCS). The addition of Dermatology of Northern Colorado marked the thirty-first acquisition ADCS has made since the PE division of Audax Group bought the physician group in 2011.
