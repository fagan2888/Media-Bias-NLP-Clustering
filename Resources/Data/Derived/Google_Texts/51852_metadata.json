So far, more than $1,400 has been raised on the website FundRazr. Money has also been raised through a coupon deal at Sidetrack, and on Friday, Elkins' friends will present an evening of music and art with an auction of leg-themed works from more than 20 local artists.\n\nThere will also be baked goods for sale, live screen-printing and hair cuts with donations from local businesses, including Mighty Good Coffee, Get Curious with Safety Girl (located in Bongz and Thongz), VG Kids and more.\n\nThe public is invited to the event at Woodruff\u2019s Friday at 36 E. Cross St. in Ypsilanti\u2019s Depot Town, and doors open at 7 p.m.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super awesome,\u201d Elkins said of the benefit show. \u201cIt\u2019s really overwhelming in a positive way.\u201d\n\nElkins said he plans to present money from the fundraiser to bill collectors with the hope of renegotiating or lowering some of the debt.\n\nElkins\u2019 problems started in 2003 when he tore a leg tendon, causing problems in his legs, including blood clots.\n\nDespite being uninsured at the time, he underwent a couple of surgeries, including one which led to complications.\n\n\u201cIt was going to be an hour long, and I woke up eight or nine hours later with a breathing tube in. It was not at all not what I expected. Or what the doctors expected,\u201d Elkins said.\n\nBlood clots recently reformed again in his leg, which he said were so painful that he could barely walk. He now takes blood thinners that are greatly reducing the pain and have helped the condition.\n\nWith no employer-provided insurance and his future employment up in there air, Elkins said he is looking forward to signing up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI'm really encouraged by the fact that I'll be able to purchase insurance now, which previously wasn't an option given that I have a pre-existing condition (chronic deep vein thrombosis) and don't have access to insurance through my employer,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the meantime, Elkins' friends hope to help take a chunk out of his debt.\n\nMark Maynard, who helped organize the event with Jennifer Scroggins, said the number of people involved with the fundraiser speaks to the impact Elkins has on the community.\n\n\"He plays a super vital role in making Ypsi and Ann Arbor the vibrant and arts friendly place that it is. People do good work, but there are few people who others rally around and make magical things happen,\" Maynard said.\n\nEntry for the show is $10 and all money plus 20 percent of the bar tab goes to Elkins. People can also donate at https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/8Zoi6\n\nThe musical lineup for Friday\u2019s festivities at Woodruff\u2019s includes Minus 9, Laser Beams of Boredom, Thom Elliot, Moonhairy, Shells and Fred Thomas, Glass Glue, Izzy Johnson and special surprise guests.\n\nAnd in true Ypsilanti fashion, the band Girth is staging a satirical protest, joking that Elkins really has bionic legs and is holding the fundraiser for personal profit. They'll be playing a \"protest set\" from their car in the parking lot.\n\nTom Perkins is a freelance writer for The Ann Arbor News.
