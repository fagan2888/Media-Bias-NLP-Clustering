This free clinic will operate out the of the Congregational Church in Blue Hill once a week on a first-come, first-serve basis providing consultations, prescriptions and referrals as needed.\n\nThe new clinic comes at an uncertain time in the health care industry. The Affordable Care Act, which is in the midst of a tumultuous rollout, is meant to make clinics like this one obsolete by making affordable insurance available to everyone.\n\nBut the founders of Peninsula Free Health Services feel certain that some will be left behind, at least for the next few years.\n\n\u201cThere is a glaring gap in Maine,\u201d said Lynn Cheney, a certified Affordable Care Act navigator. \u201cThere are people who can\u2019t get get on Medicaid, and they can\u2019t qualify for affordable care. About 25,000 people in Maine fall into this hole.\u201d\n\nCheney, a member of the Peninsula Free Health Services board, explained that the Affordable Care Act was designed with the assumption that states would take up the federal government\u2019s offer to expand Medicaid to individuals who earn up to 133 percent of the poverty level. Maine, however, did not opt to expand, so only people who fall below the poverty line qualify for Medicaid. Those with incomes that put them at 133 percent of the poverty line and above, qualify for financial help under the Affordable Care Act. Mainers who hover just above poverty are excluded from federal health care assistance programs.\n\nAs a navigator, Cheney will be on call at the new clinic to help people sign up for insurance. She anticipates many Mainers will decide to pay the fines that will come as a result of not signing up for health insurance before March 31, at least during the first year before the fines increase dramatically.\n\n\u201cBottom line \u2014 there are going to be a lot of people without health insurance for the foreseeable future, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d Cheney said.\n\nGarfield said that if the clinic turns out to be unnecessary, all the better.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re eventually hoping to put ourselves out of business,\u201d she said.\n\nPlans to open this clinic began a year ago, when Garfield, Cheney and Leslie Goode, the executive director of Maine\u2019s chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, began meeting monthly to make arrangements. They visited other clinics across the state, including the Biddeford Free Clinic, which they consider a model.\n\nThe Biddeford Free Clinic has been offering medical care to patients without insurance since it opened in 1992.\n\nThey see patients like Nancy Mclean, who lost her health insurance in 2008 when she left her job at Calais Federal Savings and Loan Association, and moved to southern Maine. She left work to take care of her mother, who had Alzheimer\u2019s disease and could not be alone. Mclean has diabetes and carpal tunnel, which has become so severe, she said, she sometimes can\u2019t use her arms.\n\nMclean\u2019s insulin for her diabetes cost between $200 and $300 a month. She paid for it out of pocket, eventually using up her entire savings and retirement until she learned about the clinic. Now, she visits regularly and has been signed up for a patient assistance program, which covers the cost of her medication.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say enough about them,\u201d she said of the clinic in Biddeford. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done if it wasn\u2019t for them.\u201d\n\nGarfield said that diabetes, obesity and cancer were health problems she frequently treated when operating her clinic in Ellsworth. She will be the doctor on call at Peninsula Free Health Services, as will Robert Walker, an obstetrician gynecologist who has practiced in Hancock County since 1973 and Sarah Hudson, who teaches emergency medical technicians at Maine Maritime Academy.\n\nPeninsula Free Health Services will be open every 3-6 p.m Monday, starting Nov. 25. Patients will be seen in Pastor Rob McCall\u2019s office at the First Congregational Church of Blue Hill. McCall and Goode will be available to help connect people with social services, such as heat or food assistance. The board members hope to establish a relationship with the Blue Hill Memorial Hospital where they will send patients who need more serious care.\n\nThe clinic has nonprofit status because of it\u2019s partnership with Washington Hancock Community Agency, and it will be funded almost entirely by donations and everyone currently involved is a volunteer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BLUE HILL, Maine \u2014 In her last years running Med Now, a private clinic in Ellsworth, Jane Garfield said she saw an increase in the number of patients coming in without insurance. \u201cThe more I saw patients, the more I saw people with no insurance, and I saw that there [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "BLUE HILL, Maine \u2014 In her last years running Med Now, a private clinic in Ellsworth, Jane Garfield said she saw an increase in the number of patients coming in without insurance. \u201cThe more I saw patients, the more I saw people with no insurance, and I saw that there [...]", "title": "New free clinic in Blue Hill to serve uninsured Mainers", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2013/11/17/health/new-free-clinic-in-blue-hill-to-serve-uninsured-mainers/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Clinic111317-600x337.jpg?strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "BLUE HILL, Maine \u2014 In her last years running Med Now, a private clinic in Ellsworth, Jane Garfield said she saw an increase in the number of patients coming in without insurance. \u201cThe more I saw patients, the more I saw people with no insurance, and I saw that there [...]", "title": "New free clinic in Blue Hill to serve uninsured Mainers", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2013/11/17/health/new-free-clinic-in-blue-hill-to-serve-uninsured-mainers/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Clinic111317-250x250.jpg?strip=all", "site": "@bangordailynews", "card": "summary"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": 5800548, "app_id": 169032116512887}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1602674"}}, "keywords": "Maine, news, elections, election results, politics, sports, Bangor, Portland, Augusta, weather, obituaries, Waterville, Aroostook, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Hancock, Washington, bdn,hancock,health,news,state,new free clinic in blue hill to serve uninsured mainers,is_article,nell gluckman", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f72\"", "article_summary": "Now Garfield is working with other health care professionals in the area to open Peninsula Free Health Services for the uninsured.\nBut the founders of Peninsula Free Health Services feel certain that some will be left behind, at least for the next few years.\nPeninsula Free Health Services will be open every 3-6 p.m Monday, starting Nov. 25.\nThey visited other clinics across the state, including the Biddeford Free Clinic, which they consider a model.\nThis free clinic will operate out the of the Congregational Church in Blue Hill once a week on a first-come, first-serve basis providing consultations, prescriptions and referrals as needed."}
