In fact, the Speaker derided the chief executive by saying that the president shouldn\u2019t be able to pick and choose the parts of the law the president wants to enforce.\n\nWhile the U.S. Constitution states the \u201clegislative power herein granted\u201d in Article I gives the specific powers to the Congress, Article II states that the \u201cexecutive power shall be vested in a President of the United States,\u201d without the laundry list of enumerated, or specified, authority.\n\nThe battle over presidential power harkens back to the beginning of the constitutional republic, with differing visions of executive authority ranging from the general, unfettered authority, under what some would describe as the \u201cunitary executive,\u201d to the fear of an unchecked and uncontrollable leader.\n\nOne way to measure executive power is through the issuing of executive orders, documents that carry the weight of law but are only based on the signature of the president. Of the 1,359 executive orders issued by the past five presidents since 1981, Bill Clinton issued 27% of them, while Ronald Reagan issued 26% of the total orders.\n\nA second way to measure executive authority are presidential signing statements, which allows president, when signing a bill into law, to express their intent and interpretation of the law.\n\nEven though President Clinton issued the most signing statements during his two terms, President George W. Bush\u2019s use of the statements and invoking of executive privilege provoked a great deal of controversy.\n\nDuring the 43rd president\u2019s administration, much was made about the assertion of broad executive powers, such as the failure to disclose the names of energy industry executives on the vice president\u2019s energy task force; the ability to permit warrantless surveillance on certain domestic phone calls; and the presidential power to declare individuals \u201cenemy combatants.\u201d Ultimately, according to one scholar, the second Bush administration claimed the authority to bypass more than 750 statutes in the signing statements.\n\nExecutive orders aren\u2019t just a power of presidents; chief executives of the states also utilize the authority to issue an order without the legislature acting. Most recently, when the chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly could not find a compromise regarding coal ash legislation, Governor Pat McCrory signed \u201cExecutive Order #62\u201d to address the issue.\n\nThe battle over executive power. By compelling different branches of government to share power, be it the power to make laws, to enforce laws, or to interpret laws, the separation of powers principle creates legal controversies among the different actors.\n\nIronically, within a week of the U.S. House of Representatives voting to authorize its leader to sue the chief executive, the nation remembered the claim by the only president to resign the office, who believed that when the president does something, \u201cthat means that it is not illegal.\u201d\n\nPresidential power nowadays falls victim to the partisan polarization infecting all aspects of our governing system. The opposition party proffers characterizations of \u201cmonarchical\u201d power and \u201cdictatorial edicts\u201d as standard denunciations of the chief executive\u2019s actions.\n\nMost likely, today\u2019s Republicans would deride the quote that started this piece if President Obama had issued it.\n\nIn reality, the quote was issued in a signing statement regarding the Homeland Security Act of 2002, signed by President George W. Bush.\n\nIndeed, power, or the abuse of power, is in the partisan eye of the beholder.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Much has been made about the recent vote by the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives to authorize the Speaker to initiate a lawsuit", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wfae.org/post/abuse-power-definition-depends-whos-charge", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wfae/files/styles/medium/public/201405/MichaelBitzer.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Much has been made about the recent vote by the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives to authorize the Speaker to initiate a lawsuit", "title": "Abuse Of Power Definition Depends On Who's In Charge"}, "story_id": 338129902, "twitter": {"site": "@WFAE", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WFAE"}, "author": "Michael Bitzer", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Abuse Of Power Definition Depends On Who&#039;s In Charge"}, "nid": 56326, "datePublished": "2014-08-05", "keywords": "The Party Line, Barack Obama, President George W.
