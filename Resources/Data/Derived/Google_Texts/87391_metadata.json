At times, Cavanaugh\u2019s friends laughed, and at others, their eyes welled with tears.\n\n\u201cThese kids have lost something so significant to them,\u201d said Stuart Foss of Mount Pleasant, the horse\u2019s owner whose nephew was friends with Cavanaugh. \u201cThey needed something real to remember him by. Everything is just so weird about this.\u201d\n\nThe 16-year-old suspect in Cavanaugh\u2019s death, Matthew Joseph Fischer of Old Jay Lane in Mount Pleasant, remains jailed on charges of murder and possession of a knife in a violent crime.\n\nThe circumstances of the slaying have rattled the communities where the suspect and the victim lived. It happened on Baltusrol Lane in the Park West community, where homicides are rare.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Cavanaughs, Jessica Munday, said Friday that the family was mourning in private but that they extended their gratitude for community members\u2019 \u201cthoughts, prayers and support.\u201d\n\nLoved ones laid flowers and a wreath on the hood of the white 1981 Chevrolet Corvette that Cavanaugh had been working to restore in the carport of his condo near Station 18 on the island. He had planned to study automotive engineering and design at the University of Cincinnati.\n\nA sticker in the shape of a guitar \u2014 an instrument he loved to play \u2014 was affixed to a corner of the car\u2019s windshield. \u201cIn memory of Luke,\u201d it said.\n\nHis friends huddled Friday morning at the nearby cannon from Fort Moultrie before they set out with the horse for Cavanaugh\u2019s funeral.\n\nDuring the small procession that needed advance approval from the town, some cars traveling on the main drag pulled over out of respect.\n\nTo those who took part, the tribute was their version of the riderless horse often used in military funerals to symbolize fallen soldiers.\n\nEdward Parker watched as his son, a close friend of Cavanaugh\u2019s, took the reins for the journey.\n\nTo Parker, who lived next door to Cavanaugh, the display was appropriate for a young man who wouldn\u2019t use the typical slang words such as \u201clike,\u201d \u201cdude,\u201d \u201cman\u201d or \u201cyo\u201d so often employed by his generation in conversation. That memory of Cavanaugh stuck with Parker and others who knew him.\n\n\u201cLuke would talk to you and care about what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHe\u2019d talk like an adult. He was mature beyond his years.\u201d\n\nRachel Rutledge of Sullivan\u2019s Island, a teacher at Wando who had Cavanaugh in an entrepreneurship class, shared a similar recollection as she made her way to the church. Cavanaugh was a \u201cfine young man\u201d who will be missed in the halls of the 3,860-student high school, she said.\n\n\u201cHe was very passionate and entertaining,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cHe always had a huge smile on his face. You could count on that.\u201d\n\nBut while the memories would linger for his loved ones, they said they still have struggled to make sense of the tragedy.\n\nThe Mount Pleasant Police Department said Fischer, the suspect, was visiting his girlfriend Sunday night when Cavanaugh contacted her through Snapchat, an app in which messages are designed to disappear up to 10 seconds after it\u2019s received. The app\u2019s role in the case has been captured in news headlines worldwide.\n\nFischer then urged Cavanaugh through messages to \u201ccome over\u201d and said \u201cI\u2019ll kill you, man,\u201d according to detectives.\n\nCavanaugh went to the duplex and was stabbed during a fight. He died in the street in front of the home.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in pain over this,\u201d Parker said of Cavanaugh\u2019s loved ones. \u201cIt was shocking for them. It was not supposed to happen.\u201d\n\nReach Andrew Knapp at 937-5414 or twitter.com/offlede.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Loved ones march through Sullivan\u2019s Island in tribute to slain Wando High student, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Sullivan\u2019s Island \u2014 Only a green knit cap sat on the horse as Luke Cavanaugh\u2019s friends led the animal from the slain 17-year-old\u2019s house through town to a church packed with mourners Friday morning.", "title": "Loved ones march through Sullivan\u2019s Island in tribute to slain Wando High student", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150123/150129728/loved-ones-march-through-sullivan-x2019-s-island-in-tribute-to-slain-wando-high-student", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150123/pc16/150129728/AR/0/AR-150129728.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150123/pc16/150129728/AR/0/AR-150129728.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sullivan\u2019s Island \u2014 Only a green knit cap sat on the horse as Luke Cavanaugh\u2019s friends led the animal from the slain 17-year-old\u2019s house through town to a church packed with mourners Friday morning.", "title": "Loved ones march through Sullivan\u2019s Island in tribute to slain Wando High student", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150123/pc16/150129728/AR/0/AR-150129728.jpg?201501231954", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150129728}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Loved ones march through Sullivan\u2019s Island in tribute to slain Wando High student , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-23T10:38:50Z", "modified_time": "2015-01-23T19:54:00Z", "author": "Andrew Knapp"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Sullivan\u2019s Island \u2014 Only a green knit cap sat on the horse as Luke Cavanaugh\u2019s friends led the animal from the slain 17-year-old\u2019s house through town to a church packed with mourners Friday morning."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04fa\"", "article_summary": "At times, Cavanaugh\u2019s friends laughed, and at others, their eyes welled with tears.\nIt was a solemn tribute to the Wando High School junior who was stabbed Sunday night in Mount Pleasant during a fight with a fellow student over messages sent through the smartphone app Snapchat.\n\u201cThese kids have lost something so significant to them,\u201d said Stuart Foss of Mount Pleasant, the horse\u2019s owner whose nephew was friends with Cavanaugh.\nCavanaugh was a \u201cfine young man\u201d who will be missed in the halls of the 3,860-student high school, she said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re in pain over this,\u201d Parker said of Cavanaugh\u2019s loved ones."}
