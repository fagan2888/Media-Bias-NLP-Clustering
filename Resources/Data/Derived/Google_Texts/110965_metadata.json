This is going to be affecting our entire economy in ways that are extraordinarily significant.\u201d\n\nThe massive hack at Sony, which ultimately led to the studio\u2019s decision to cancel the release of \u201cThe Interview\u201d after threats of violence against some theaters, is the latest in a long string of hack attacks that have plagued companies including Target, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase in recent months.\n\nWhile Congress passed a handful of cyber bills before leaving Washington this month, lawmakers have largely failed to pass major reforms that companies say are critical to protecting U.S. networks.\n\nObama\u2019s call for legislation allowing companies to better share information with the government and other firms mirrors concerns from many executives and advocates of stronger cyber defenses. Being able to effectively communicate without having to fear liability would allow companies to make sure there are no blind spots on the networks, supporters say.\n\nLawmakers in both chambers have introduced major information-sharing bills, but it has largely been stymied by privacy concerns.\n\nCritics of the Senate\u2019s Cybersecurity Intelligence Sharing Act say that it would give spy agencies like the National Security Agency too much information about private citizens.\n\nObama had previously threatened to veto a similar bill in the House, called the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, partly out of concern that it doesn't do enough to protect privacy.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s sort of the Wild West,\u201d Obama said.", "description": "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s sort of the Wild West,\u201d Obama said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s sort of the Wild West,\u201d Obama said.", "title": "President urges cyber law to tame \u2018Wild West\u2019", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/227719-obama-calls-for-cyber-law-to-tame-wild-west", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/227719-obama-calls-for-cyber-law-to-tame-wild-west", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-19T14:58-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Hacking, Sony hack, CISA, CISPA,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-19T14:58:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/227719-obama-calls-for-cyber-law-to-tame-wild-west", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s sort of the Wild West,\u201d Obama said.", "card": "summary", "title": "President urges cyber law to tame \u2018Wild West\u2019"}, "dcterms.title": "President urges cyber law to tame \u2018Wild West\u2019"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe13a5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s sort of the Wild West,\u201d Obama said during his end-of-the-year press conference in the White House briefing room.\nPresident Obama is pointing to North Korea\u2019s massive hack of Sony Pictures as proof that Congress needs to get to work on a new cybersecurity bill.\nObama\u2019s call for legislation allowing companies to better share information with the government and other firms mirrors concerns from many executives and advocates of stronger cyber defenses.\nLawmakers in both chambers have introduced major information-sharing bills, but it has largely been stymied by privacy concerns.\nObama had previously threatened to veto a similar bill in the House, called the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, partly out of concern that it doesn't do enough to protect privacy."}
