Rob Portman, R-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said in his opening statement at the hearing.\n\n\u201cIn some states, these losses will be absorbed by other insurance companies\u2014which means, by the policyholders of other insurance companies who have to pay increased \u2026 premiums,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other states, doctors, hospitals and individual patients stand to suffer large out-of-pocket losses due to the co-op failures\u2014as our report details.\u201d\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\n\nPortman\u2019s statement, first obtained by Fox News, refers to an investigation by the committee\u2019s majority staff.\n\nIt claims the most recent balance sheets provided to the subcommittee show the failed cooperatives owe more than $700 million to doctors and hospitals for plan year 2015.\n\nThe failed cooperatives lost $376 million and exceeded the projected worst-case-scenario losses outlined in their loan applications by more than $260 million in 2014. They lost an additional billion dollars in 2015, according to the report.\n\n\u201cOnce the co-ops got going in 2014, things went south in a hurry\u2014both in terms of financial losses and enrollment figures that wildly deviated from the co-ops\u2019 own projections,\u201d Portman said. \u201cDespite getting regular reports that the co-ops were hemorrhaging cash, HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] took essentially no corrective action for over a year.\u201d\n\nDeloitte Consulting initially granted the cooperatives a passing grade based on an HHS-designed grading scale. However it added seven of the 12 had serious deficiencies in their enrollment strategy, according to the report. Others submitted budgets that were \u201cincomplete, unreasonable, not cost-effective\u201d and several \u201crelied on unreasonable projections about their own growth.\u201d\n\nThe report cited in Portman\u2019s statement also claims that from 2014\u20132015, the administration lent an additional $848 million to the failed cooperatives, as they lost more than $1.4 billion.\n\nIn previous testimony, administration officials have told congressional panels that the administration scrutinized cooperative business plans and then placed them on corrective oversight when necessary.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cIn 2015 we conducted 27 financial and operational reviews, 16 in-person visits, and had 43 formal communications,\u201d Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, told the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year. \u201cNot to mention hundreds of phone calls. And we've kept the states up to speed on every important interaction to help inform their regulatory actions.\u201d\n\nWhen questioned how much money the government could salvage from the failed cooperatives, officials said they were only beginning to determine amounts.\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of recouping that loan money right now,\u201d said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the chief operating officer and chief of staff of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, last month to a House panel. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at their excess revenue and then use all the tools available to us through their loan agreements and state and federal law to pull back federal tax dollars.\u201d\n\nObamaCare provided $2.4 billion in federal loans to establish 23 non-profit cooperatives. A dozen failed and the administration has required eight of the remaining eleven to adhere to a \u201ccorrective action plan\u201d designed to fix business flaws and prevent additional failures. The closed cooperatives account for $1.2 billion in federal loans.\n\nDefenders of the law and cooperatives say these non-profit insurers operated in difficult markets and that it often takes years of financial commitment to build a viable business.\n\nThe failed cooperatives left hundreds of thousands of customers searching for a new insurance company. In some states, the loss was significant.\n\n\u201cHHS gave the New York co-op $90 million to prolong its financial life, rather than allow it to scale down, that co-op went on to lose another $544 million in 2015,\u201d according to Portman\u2019s statement, citing his staff\u2019s report.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential delegate count, pledged she would address the market void left by the failed cooperatives.\n\n\u201cWe need to get more companies, more nonprofits, to fill this space. The ones that knew what they were doing have provided good services, but a lot of them have failed because they didn't have the right support,\u201d she said Monday at a Democratic presidential forum hosted by Fox News.\n\n\u201cEven in those markets where those co-ops had previously operated, we have seen a commitment on the part of those who are administering the markets to try to facilitate greater competition,\u201d said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. \u201cAnd creating the co-ops was just one way to do that, but we certainly are going to be open to other ways to encourage other entities, private or public, to get engaged in this process.\u201d\n\nWhen previously questioned by Congress, administration officials declined to forecast how many of the remaining cooperatives would survive this year.\n\n\u201cThe co-ops themselves are really the ones who are going to be the ones to determine whether or not they ultimately will be successful,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cThey have a lot of work to do to rapidly mature their entities, their small businesses as you know and they\u2019re still getting their foothold on this business.\u201d\n\nRich Edson is a Washington correspondent for Fox News Channel.
