The suspect is in serious but stable condition, Denver police Cmdr. Matt Murray said Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe suspect was attacking a woman near East Colfax Avenue and Downing Street when a man came to her aid and stabbed the alleged attacker, said Sonny Jackson, Denver police spokesman.\n\nWitnesses told police the suspect was sexually assaulting the woman, Murray said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re looking at,\u201d Murray said.\n\n\u201cThere was blood there, and blood there and blood around the corner,\u201d said Bill Hilden, 68, as he pointed at three spots about 20 feet apart at the northeast corner of Colfax and Downing.\n\nHilden was standing about 20 feet from an RTD bus stop while waiting for his bus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen guys picking on people there at the bus stop,\u201d Hilden said. \u201cYou really can\u2019t stop them. They are so damn aggressive.\u201d\n\nDetectives were interviewing the good Samaritan and the woman, Jackson said. The suspect is in custody at a hospital, he said.\n\nThe stabbing happened in front of a parking lot for a Papa John\u2019s restaurant and just west of Paul\u2019s Liquors, which is marked up with gang graffiti.\n\nPerfecto Basurto, 55, the manager of the liquor store, said crime doesn\u2019t happen there nearly as often as it used to.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver good Samaritan stabs man to protect woman during assault", "title": "Denver good Samaritan stabs man to protect woman during assault", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/14/denver-good-samaritan-stabs-man-to-protect-woman-during-assault/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150214__colfaxstabbingp1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150214__colfaxstabbingp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-14T11:04:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T02:15:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca176\"", "article_summary": "A good Samaritan stabbed and seriously injured a man who was allegedly sexually assaulting a woman Saturday morning near a bus stop on East Colfax Avenue, authorities say.\nHilden was standing about 20 feet from an RTD bus stop while waiting for his bus.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen guys picking on people there at the bus stop,\u201d Hilden said.\nWitnesses told police the suspect was sexually assaulting the woman, Murray said.\nThey are so damn aggressive.\u201dDetectives were interviewing the good Samaritan and the woman, Jackson said."}
