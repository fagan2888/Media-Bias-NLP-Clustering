From clinical studies that were less than a week old, to game-changing news in reimbursement, our speakers were unmatched in their knowledge of what is happening in diabetes care. Past News Releases RSS Measurement\u2019s Meaning in Diabetes...\n\nDiabetes Care and Performance...\n\nAJMC\u2019s February Tweetchat to...\n\nHow will technology help Medicare make good on its promise to pay for diabetes prevention? Why is stigma among doctors still a hurdle to obesity treatment, nearly three years after the American Medical Association declared obesity a disease? And how are retail clinics filling gaps in diabetes care?\n\nThese were just some of the questions covered during the fourth meeting of Patient-Centered Diabetes Care, which gathered stakeholders from the payer, provider, pharmaceutical, and policy communities April 7-8, 2016, at the Marriott at Glenpointe in Teaneck, New Jersey.\n\nConference Chair Robert A. Gabbay, MD, PhD, FACP, chief medical officer and senior vice president of Joslin Diabetes Center, which presented the meeting with AJMC, served as moderator for conference\u2019s first-ever session on obesity treatment. The session addressed reimbursement inequities that patients still encounter\u2014and the fact that many providers are reluctant to give referrals for bariatric surgery.\n\n\u201cIf one adds up all the money spent on things that don\u2019t work,\u201d Gabbay said, \u201cWe\u2019d probably have money for the things that do work.\u201d\n\nTechnology is changing the clinical care model and may change the way we answer questions in diabetes, according to Lonny Reisman, MD, CEO of HealthReveal, who served as keynote speaker. Gathering data from multiple sources will allow questions to be answered quickly and at a lower cost than in the past, said Reisman, formerly of Aetna.\n\nRight now, he said, the healthcare system is not doing a very good job of deploying resources in diabetes care. \u201cWe really need to take advantage of what\u2019s available to us, to exploit all these data sources.\u201d\n\nReisman evoked themes offered just a week earlier by a fellow cardiologist, FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, MD, who told an audience at the 65th Scientific Session of the American College of Cardiology that the use of electronic health records could soon change the nature and cost of clinical trials.\n\nIn the short term, technology will play a role in Medicare\u2019s ability to bring the National Diabetes Program (NDPP) to the millions of potential beneficiaries, said Mike Payne, chief commercial officer of Omada Health, who was part of a session on the role of technology in diabetes care. Omada is ready to deliver the NDPP now that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is committed to paying for the program. \u201cThe fact that CMS has taken this step is really encouraging,\u201d he said.\n\nBut when it comes to treatment for those who already have diabetes, coverage for telehealth is uneven\u2014even though a project in Mississippi is showing signs of success, according to a panel led by David Brumley, MD, MBA, senior medical director at Tufts Health Plan.\n\nOther sessions covered clinical and healthcare delivery topics, such as new options in insulin treatment, cardiovascular risk for those with diabetes, and the role of retail clinics in meeting the needs of those who lack insurance or cannot make appointments during the day.\n\n\u201cFrom clinical studies that were less than a week old, to game-changing news in reimbursement, our speakers were unmatched in their knowledge of what is happening in diabetes care,\u201d said Brian Haug, president of Pharmacy and Managed Markets and publisher of The American Journal of Managed Care. \u201cWe continue to set the standard in our ability to bring together stakeholders from across healthcare and to offer the most current information in the field.\u201d\n\nFull coverage of the meeting will appear in a special issue of Evidence-Based Diabetes Management later this year.\n\nAbout the Journals and AJMC.com\n\nThe American Journal of Managed Care is the leading peer-reviewed journal dedicated to issues in managed care.
