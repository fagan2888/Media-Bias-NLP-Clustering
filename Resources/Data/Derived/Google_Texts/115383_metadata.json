Tuesday night to discuss remaining conflicts between their two parties over a trade adjustment assistance bill, which helps domestic workers displaced by trade deals. Democrats didn\u2019t want to cut Medicare to pay for part of that assistance.\n\nBoehner said the two leaders reached an agreement on an alternative to pay for the trade assistance legislation.\n\n\u201cIn terms of fixing the Medicare offset, we worked together to come up with an alternative, and we did. But how we are going to consider this -- the process for considering the four different votes -- is still up in the air,\u201d Boehner said, referring to other trade-related bills.\n\nBoehner said Republicans plan to attach the fix for trade assistance to a different trade bill, not the trade adjustment assistance bill itself, but Democrats aren\u2019t happy about that.\n\n\u201cPelosi and Boehner negotiated the new offsets but there are serious procedural problems,\u201d a senior Democratic aide told The Huffington Post. \u201cShe told Boehner she would take procedural issue to her members. Members were not happy with the prospect of having to carry a [trade adjustment assistance] vote for Medicare cuts with the fix on a separate vehicle with no guarantee of enactment.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on Democrats\u2019 concerns, Boehner quipped, \u201cIf people are looking for an excuse to vote no then I guess they can always find an excuse to vote no.\u201d\n\nThe split between the two leaders is sure to only complicate matters as Republicans attempt to find the needed 217 votes to pass fast-track trade authority for Obama.\n\nIt is unclear how many Democrats will split with the majority of their party and back the president. Congress has been embroiled in a debate on trade over the last month, leaving Democrats in a tough spot as they weigh helping out their president against sticking to their guns on an issue they have long opposed.\n\nWithin the Republican party there is also a significant conservative faction that does not want to be seen doing Obama any favors, and opposes trade, creating a headache for leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are working with both sides to get this done and as soon as we have the votes we\u2019ll be moving the bill,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said on Wednesday.\n\nScenes From Capitol Hill Scenes From Capitol Hill\n\n1 of 79 Standing With Charleston U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), center, hold hands with Sherialyn Byrdsong of Atlanta, Georgia, whose husband Ricky Byrdsong was shot and killed on July 2, 1999, in Skokie, Illinois, during a news conference July 8, 2015, on Capitol Hill.
