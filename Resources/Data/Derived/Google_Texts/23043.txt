As the Oscar-winning drama Still Alice comes to DVD and Blu-Ray on May 12, AARP’s Movies for Grownups has joined forces with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment to host more than 40 screenings of the film nationwide in May and June.

Julianne Moore won an Oscar for her poignant and sympathetic portrayal of the title character, Alice Howland, who develops early-onset Alzheimer’s at age 50. In the exclusive video above, Moore discusses the symptoms of Alzheimer’s, while activist Maria Shriver — an executive producer on the film — details the condition’s surprising global prevalence.

On May 5 in Manhattan, I was thrilled to host our inaugural screening of Still Alice. Afterward, the film’s producer, Pamela Koffler, and Craig Colfelt, the education coordinator for the New York City chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association, answered questions and reacted to the audience’s often-spirited comments.

The screening was preceded by a series of emotional new public-service films designed to support AARP’s I ‘Heart’ Caregivers initiative. I ‘Heart’ Caregivers recognizes the 42 million Americans who are helping their parents or spouses to live independently.

Our Still Alice screening series will continue across the country in June. Watch for announcements of dates and places around the first of the month.
