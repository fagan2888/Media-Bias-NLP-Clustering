Democrats used to think the Republicans could no longer threaten Obamacare. Times change.\n\nIf ISIS attacked the Russian plane, the group has fundamentally changed its mission.\n\nISIS has terrified people worldwide because of its brutality, not its reach. But if, as the group claims, it really did take down the Russian airliner that crashed in Sinai last weekend, the world needs to reassess whom it\u2019s dealing with. ISIS has never before targeted civilian airplanes, nor has it targeted enemies outside its home turf. If the group really did attack the Russian plane\u2014in retaliation for Russia\u2019s increased involvement in the Syrian civil war\u2014that might mean ISIS has changed its policies, and that it is now directly or indirectly (through affiliate groups) targeting its enemies across the globe. That would mean in the air and even in the West. It\u2019s too soon to say whether this shift has occurred; it\u2019s not even clear yet that ISIS really did put a bomb on the plane. But even the prospect of ISIS expanding its scope is pretty scary.\n\nIf you got health care through the ACA, Kentucky\u2019s new governor should scare you, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAccording to Census figures, Kentucky\u2019s uninsured population fell 40 percent between 2013 and 2014, and the number\u2019s still falling. But the state\u2019s new Republican governor-elect, Matt Bevin, ran on removing all traces of Obamacare\u2014which is responsible for those recently insured Kentuckians\u2014from the state. To do so, he would eliminate the state\u2019s successful insurance exchange and take away coverage from at least some of the state\u2019s citizens who became covered under the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which is responsible for most of that drop in uninsured people. That\u2019s all in Bevin\u2019s power, and if he acts on it and his popularity doesn\u2019t suffer, Republican governors elsewhere will probably follow suit. And if a Republican wins the White House in 2016, along with the party\u2019s expected congressional majorities, well, the whole law really could be in danger.\n\nNot worried? Relax with the TPP or Philip Pullman, but probably not with someone else\u2019s spouse.\n\nFinally: You can read the entire Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement online. International trade deals are blatant clickbait, I know, but the TPP actually is one weird trick that will completely transform the global economy.\n\nAn important expos\u00e9 of companies screwing their employees out of workers\u2019 comp.\n\nAn equally important investigation: When is it OK to be alone with someone else\u2019s spouse?\n\nTuesday I mentioned my love for the fantasy series His Dark Materials.
