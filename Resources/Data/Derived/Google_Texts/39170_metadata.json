In another sat Courtney Nelson, The Star-Ledger\u2019s Player of the Year in 2004 when he led Bloomfield Tech to a 25-8 record and a berth in the NSIAA Tournament of Champions final.\n\nAnd although Mariniello said he was able to keep his emotions in check, the fifth-year Hudson Catholic coach admitted that there were some flashbacks running through his mind just minutes before the Hawks began their 73-44 defeat of the Trojans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m far enough removed from the school to the point where it wasn\u2019t as emotional for me,\u201d said Mariniello, who compiled a 186-50 record with Trojans while leading them to two Essex County titles and four Group I state championships. \u201cBut I still have a lot of pride for Bloomfield Tech because I got my start there and we accomplished a lot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a place that will always be important to me.\u201d\n\nWith his old employer in Jersey City, Mariniello said he easily could have rattled off memory after memory from his days in the blue, black and maize -- a tenure that ended amid health issues with Mariniello's father, who died last February. However, once the opening tipoff rolled around, the game became business as usual for the Hawks, ranked No. 9 in the Star-Ledger Top 20.\n\nSlow out of the gate, Hudson Catholic (7-2) used a late first quarter push to separate themselves from Bloomfield Tech (6-1).\n\nThe run began with a steal by freshman Kahmoine Foster that led to a lay-in courtesy of junior forward Sammy Friday and progressed as guard Nassir Barrino made a basket to end the first quarter and then hit another to start the second.\n\nFrom there, the Hawks never looked back, riding the play of Barrino and fellow guard J.R. Lynch \u2013 10 points and a career-high eight assists. Hudson Catholic also received a boost from their big men as Friday scored 14 points alongside senior Safee Sabur, who scored 10 points and pulled down eight rebounds.\n\nAlthough the Hawks were favored to win coming into the game, Barrino still believes the way they set the tone against the previously unbeaten Trojans speaks volumes to the team\u2019s progression.\n\n\u201cWe struggled in the beginning of the season, but we\u2019re trying to get it together now and this win means a lot toward that goal,\u201d said Barrino, who scored a game-high 18 points.\n\nMariniello concurred with his guard\u2019s assessment while also pointing out that it\u2019s been a day-to-day process for a young Hawks' squad.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting better every day and with a young, inexperienced team that\u2019s all I can ask for,\u201d the Hawks\u2019 coach said.\n\nAlthough the defeat sets back what was a strong start to the season for Bloomfield Tech, Mariniello was quick to point out the respect that he carries for the Trojans. He also tipped his hat to Bloomfield Tech coach Brad Howard \u2013 a man who has brought consistency to a program that struggled to find the right fit after Mariniello\u2019s departure.\n\n\u201cI think Brad has done a good job of stabilizing the program,\u201d said Mariniello, who was named The Star-Ledger\u2019s Coach of the Year in 2003 while at Bloomfield Tech. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy, he\u2019s well respected in the community and you can see that his teams are very well coached. It\u2019s good to see someone who wants to continue the success at Bloomfield Tech.\n\n\u201cI think the program is in very good hands.\u201d\n\nBloomfield Tech (6-1) 15 7 10 12 \u2013 44\n\nHudson Catholic (7-2) 20 15 20 18 \u2013 73\n\nBloomfield Tech 44: Malcolm Manning 1-0-4-6, Ramiir Dixon-Conover 2-1-2-9, Dachon Burke 5-0-2-12, Salomon Pierre 0-2-1-7, David Lunsford 0-0-0-0, Marcus Bullock-Harris 2-0-0-4, Devin Jones 3-0-0-6, Rahszad Reid 0-0-0-0, Jalen Bryan 0-0-0-0.
