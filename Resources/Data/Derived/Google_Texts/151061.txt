North Carolina authorities are still searching for suspects following a shooting that left a 7-year-old boy dead and three others wounded during a violent holiday weekend in Charlotte.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Deputy Chief Jeff Estes said at a news conference that a family was having a party in a yard when Kevin Antonio Calderon Rodas was killed around 9 p.m. Saturday.

Authorities say two adults and another child were treated at the scene and their wounds weren't life threatening.

Police say a language barrier led them to initially identify the dead child as a 9-year-old girl.

Investigators have no motive or suspects in the shooting in the southwest part of that city.

Five people have been killed in four separate shootings over the Labor Day weekend in North Carolina's largest city.
