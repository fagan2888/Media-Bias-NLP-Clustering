Martin\u2019s world of dragons, swordplay and gratuitous nudity when the show\u2019s fourth season kicks off on Sunday. However, the epic tales of war and betrayal are not as big a fantasy as they might appear at first glance. American viewers who want to live in a land just like Westeros have an easy option at their disposal: Just vote Republican. The violent, highly sexualized TV world has a number of disturbing parallels to where GOP policy is steering the country:\n\nEnormous class inequities: \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d follows the stories of lords and knights, but most of the population lives in anonymous poverty, like the wretched masses struggling to survive in the Flea Bottom slum subsisting on \u201cbowls o\u2019 brown.\u201d The elite live in opulent luxury, earned through the toil of the working people, most of whom have no hope of escaping their fetid lot.\n\nWe aren\u2019t far from such a scenario in America, where a few families own most of the wealth while the rest of us are told to be content with jobs at Wal-Mart and McDonald\u2019s. We\u2019ve already seen the top 1 percent double their share of the national income since 1980, from 10 percent to nearly 20 percent, and they\u2019ve gobbled up almost all the economic growth since the Great Recession. Republican policies that weaken labor laws, cripple unions and keep the minimum wage depressed, all while cutting taxes for the rich, will only hasten our descent into plutocracy.\n\nThat said, it is possible to climb up from the bottom for the most talented: Thanks to his immense speed and skill, Bronn rose from nothing to become a hired sword to Lord Tyrion, and Davos Seaworth escaped from Flea Bottom by becoming the smartest smuggler in the land. It\u2019s the conservative ideal of pulling oneself up by the bootstraps \u2014 just never mind the struggles of the other 99 percent living in the fields and slums who never make it.\n\nWeapons everywhere: Talk about standing your ground. In war-torn Westeros everybody\u2019s armed, and travelers need to be prepared for a fight at all times. Just about every chance encounter on the road results in a swordfight, someone being captured under threat of violence, or both. Blacksmiths must be making a fortune. It\u2019s like the NRA\u2019s fantasy world.\n\nIn the real world, the gun lobby in alliance with the Republican party has managed to quash just about any legislation that would at all restrict gun access, and has passed Stand Your Ground or \u201cshoot first\u201d laws in numerous states, resulting in multiple instances where white men murdered unarmed black teenagers without repercussion. The Republicans give the impression they won\u2019t rest until every man, woman and child refuses to leave the house without being armed with a handgun, or maybe an AR-15. Just turn on HBO to see what comes next. Kill, or be killed.\n\nLawful succession ignored: When King Robert Baratheon died, the law of succession was clear: His brother Stannis was to ascend to the throne. Ned Stark tried to insist that succession be followed, and lost his head for his troubles. Several would-be kings ignored the law in favor of their own ambitions and the result was a civil war in which untold lives were lost. What matters is the acquisition of power, not the means of acquiring it.\n\nIn the United States, we ostensibly adhere to free and fair elections, with a standard of one person, one vote. Instead, Republicans do everything in their power to keep people they think will vote Democrat away from the polls. That means trashing the Voting Rights Act and implementing voter suppression laws across the nation, including purging voting rolls, limiting early voting days and requiring voters to present a photo ID before casting a ballot. The law doesn\u2019t matter; democratic principles don\u2019t matter; all that matters is rigging the vote to get Republicans into office.\n\nExistential threats ignored too: In the show\u2019s very first episode, Ned Stark, usually one of the more reasonable characters, ignores reports of ice zombies as he executes a solder for desertion. Never mind that those ice zombies will grow into an existential threat against the kingdom. \u201cThe white walkers have been gone for thousands of years,\u201d Stark tells his son afterward. \u201cA madman sees what he sees.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Want to live in Westeros, where there are weapons, massive inequality and violence against women?
