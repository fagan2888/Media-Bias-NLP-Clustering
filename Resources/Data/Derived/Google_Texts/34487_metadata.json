The data suggest openings for the GOP in this year\u2019s midterm elections and in 2016.\n\nRelated: How to Grow the U.S. Economy? Ask a Millennial\n\nThe Reason-Rupe national poll surveyed 2,000 adults between the ages of 18 and 29 online from February 28 to March 11. The results paint a picture of a generation that is socially liberal \u2014 two-thirds favor same-sex marriage, and 57 percent favor legalized pot \u2014 but increasingly doubtful about government competence and wary of being lumped in with a political party. A full two-thirds \u2014 66 percent \u2014 of millennials believe government is inefficient and wasteful, a huge increase from 42 percent in 2009. Only one-fourth of millennials trust government agencies to \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d And 34 percent call themselves independent, more than triple the rate of Americans over the age of 30.\n\nThat lack of trust in government and the two major political parties could carry through to the polling booth. More than three-quarters of millennials say they plan to vote this year, with 53 percent of registered voters saying they plan to back the Democratic candidate in their district, down from the 64 percent of millennials who say they voted for Obama in 2012.\n\nRelated: Millennials vs. Robots\u2014Who Will Win the Jobs?\n\nThose planning on staying away from the polls on Election Day also reinforce the larger point. Forty percent of those planning to sit out 2014 say they would rather vote for a third party candidate, revealing that party affiliation is becoming increasingly less important to them.\n\nThere are paradoxes buried in the poll results, though. More and more millennials say they favor reducing government spending and regulations. The poll found that 64 percent of millennials believe that cutting government spending by 5 percent would help the economy. Nearly 6 in 10 say cutting taxes would help.\n\nAt the same time, millennials support more government involvement and spending in some key areas. Almost three-quarters of those polled say that government has a responsibility to guarantee every citizen has a place to sleep and enough to eat. Over 70 percent are in favor of increasing the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour and 69 percent believe it\u2019s the government\u2019s responsibility to provide all Americans with health care insurance. Two-thirds say raising taxes on the wealthy would help the economy.\n\nRelated: Gallup Poll: 2014 Midterms Not a Slam Dunk for Incumbents\n\nThe poll also found that, even as millennials express their disdain for the partisan politics of the baby boom generation, 53 percent said they would consider voting for Hillary Clinton, by far the highest percentage of any potential candidate in the poll.\n\nWhen likely voters were asked to pick their first choice among potential presidential candidates, Clinton topped the list with 39 percent, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at 9 percent and Vice President Joe Biden at 7 percent. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) were each named by 6 percent of those polled.\n\nFor those candidates or any others eager to target the millennial vote, here\u2019s one tip: 53 percent in the Reason-Rupe poll said they would back a candidate who is socially liberal and fiscally conservative.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The young voters who twice gave overwhelming support to Barack Obama and his promises", "title": "78M Millennials Could Carry the 2016 Election.
