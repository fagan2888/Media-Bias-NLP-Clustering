Probably not many, which is why race directors across the country are questioning whether the presence of elite runners does much to drive registration numbers for huge races such as the Bolder Boulder.\n\n\u201cToday, I don\u2019t even think people know that side of the sport,\u201d said Bolder Boulder race director Cliff Bosley. \u201cThat\u2019s not good or bad, it\u2019s just the landscape. So the question we\u2019ve been asking is: Is what we\u2019re doing still important? Our emphasis on the professional athlete, and on the sport, are we even having an impact?\u201d\n\nWhile those questions are being asked, a whole new genre of events is transforming the landscape of American running. So-called \u201cthemed races\u201d are essentially social, noncompetitive \u201cfun\u201d runs involving paint spatters, mud, costumes, obstacles and even electric shocks.\n\nIn 2013, themed races attracted an estimated 4 million entrants, according to Running USA, as compared with 2.5 million finishers in marathons and half marathons.\n\n\u201cWhen the whole running boom started, everybody was trying to run as fast as they could. It wasn\u2019t a social event,\u201d said Brendan Reilly, a Boulder-based agent who represents about 15 pro runners. \u201cNow the races are billed, \u2018Come to our race and you can hear a band every mile.\u2019 \u2018Come to our race and somebody will throw color all over you.\u2019 \u2018Come to our race and you can get your butt electrocuted as you crawl through mud.\u2019 \u201c\n\nBosley doesn\u2019t see the trend as a threat. He hopes it turns social runners into competitive racers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re great,\u201d Bosley said. \u201cThey\u2019re good news for everybody in the sport, whether you\u2019re a manufacturer of shoes, you own a running store (or) you put on events. They\u2019ve introduced people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t come out and run.\u201d\n\nBut they are a major departure from the influences that shaped the first American running boom in the late 1970s. Most runners of that generation thought of themselves as racers. Part of the attraction of the sport was getting to run in the same event as their role models. Most golfers never get a chance to tee it up with Jack Nicklaus or play tennis with John McEnroe, but you could run in the same race with Frank Shorter and Bill Rodgers.\n\nThat\u2019s still important for many in a town such as Boulder, which has long been a haven for elite American runners and ultra competitive recreational runners. But Sports Illustrated doesn\u2019t put runners on its cover the way it did during the first running boom \u2014 even though there are more runners now than ever.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two very distinct parts of our sport now,\u201d said Boulder\u2019s Mark Plaatjes, the 1993 world champion in the marathon. \u201cThere\u2019s the part of the sport with the Color Run and the Hot Chocolate Run and Tough Mudder for people that are not really interesting in competing. They just want to participate; they want to have fun.\n\n\u201cThen you have the ever- decreasing segment of running that is highly competitive. That has decreased a ton.\u201d\n\nElite runners helped make the Bolder Boulder the third-largest road race in America, with the largest nonmarathon prize purse. It started in 1979 when Ric Rojas beat Shorter, a two-time Olympic marathon medalist, in the inaugural race.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s part of our history, and I suppose in 1979 if you didn\u2019t have pro athletes who were part of your race, you didn\u2019t have a race,\u201d Bosley said. \u201cThe pro athletes helped to legitimize and give credibility to the Bolder Boulder.\u201d\n\nBut what is more attractive to runners today, the presence of elite runners or live music every mile? Is it more fun to set a personal record or get splashed with paint?\n\n\u201cI am very worried about the sport,\u201d Plaatjes said. \u201cParticipation is at an all-time high, the activity of running is very healthy. The competitive side is very sick.\u201d\n\nThe Bolder Boulder spent $218,500 last year on prize money, meals, transportation and accommodations for a field of four dozen pro runners. This year, Bosley has been able to attract Flanagan, who won a bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and holds four American records, as well as Kastor, a bronze medalist in the marathon at the 2004 Athens Olympics, and Hall, a two-time Olympian who has run the fastest marathon by an American-born runner.\n\nWhile Bosley isn\u2019t looking at eliminating elite fields, some race directors are.\n\nFor the elite runners, if there is less prize money to chase, it leaves Olympic hopefuls in a tough spot, and it could be more difficult for the U.S. to be competitive at the Olympics. Only a handful of runners make a good living off endorsements.\n\n\u201cThe Bolder Boulder has been a world stage for Olympians,\u201d Bosley said. \u201cI think people take the Bolder Boulder seriously because we\u2019ve had the reputation of being about professional athletes, wanting the best in the country and the best in the world to come and race here. If we were to give it up, it just feels like the world would be emptier. That\u2019s the hard part for us. Where do they go, if they don\u2019t come here?\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have heroes, professional athletes connected to our sport, do we really have a sport?\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer\n\nAbout the race\n\nThe Bolder Boulder began in 1979 with 2,200 participants.
