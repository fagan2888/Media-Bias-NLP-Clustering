The question of whether the religious rights of business owners also extend to their for-profit companies has been a flashpoint as part of a larger debate over same-sex marriage. For instance, the bill would protect a wedding photographer who objects to shooting a same-sex wedding.\n\nThe Indiana House voted 63 to 31 to approve a hot-button bill that will likely become law, and Republican Gov. Mike Pence said he plans to sign the legislation when it lands on his desk. The state Senate\u2019s version of the bill would prevent the government from \u201csubstantially burdening\u201d a person\u2019s exercise of religion unless the government can prove it has a compelling interest and is doing so in the least restrictive means.\n\nSupporters say the measure supports religious freedom while opponents fear discrimination against LGBT people. The push towards this kind of legislation comes as same-sex marriage becomes legal across the country. In September, a federal court ruling struck down bans on same-sex marriage in Indiana and other states.\n\nWe've previously tackled the typical journalistic framing on this topic (e.g., is \"deny service\" or \"refuse service\" really the right way to describe a baker who declines to make a cake for a same-sex wedding? Or does such wording favor one side of a debate pitting gay rights vs. religious freedom?). The Post, by the way, deserves praise for the relevant, easy-to-understand example of the wedding photographer in the second paragraph.\n\nRather than revisit the service issue again today, however, my question relates to the framing of the bill as \"controversial.\"\n\nThe Associated Press Stylebook \u2014 \"the journalist's Bible\" \u2014 offers this guidance concerning that term:\n\ncontroversial\n\nAn overused word; avoid it.\n\nAlso in the stylebook:\n\nnoncontroversial\n\nAll issues are controversial. A noncontroversial issue is impossible. A controversial issue is redundant.\n\nSo why do so many news reports refer to the Indiana bill as \"controversial\" (with AP being a notable exception)?\n\nIs use of that term a simple matter of stale, clich\u00e9d writing? Or does it signify concern on the part of the media organization \u2014 a sort of red flag to the audience?\n\nA mainstream journalist involved in the coverage responded that the bill is \"definitely controversial.\" That journalist allowed that a different term \u2014 such as \"divisive\" \u2014 might be suitable but maintained, \"I don't think controversial is untrue.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Greg Scott, vice president for media communications for the Alliance Defending Freedom, sees bias in such wording:\n\nA bill in Indiana that was passed by a 4-to-1 margin in the state senate, a 2-to-1 margin in the state house and that will likely be signed by the governor in short order would more properly be described as \u201cpopular\u201d than \u201ccontroversial\u201d if the terms mean anything. AP is obviously correct that the word is overused. But it should add \u201cfrequently abused\u201d and \u201cmisused\u201d if it looks honestly at how these freedom protection bills and laws are being covered.\n\n\u201cControversial\u201d seems to be defined now as \u201canything the elite institutions don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t see \u201ccontroversial\u201d attached to: the passage of Obamacare (it was \u201chistoric\u201d), the Supreme Court striking down DOMA (it was a \u201chistoric victory\u201d), Obama\u2019s executive order on immigration (it was \u201can appeal to a nation\u2019s compassion\u201d), or the PC(USA) spiraling further into apostasy (it was a \u201cfavorable vote\u201d and \u201cmonumental\u201d). You get the point.\n\nScott obviously is an advocate with strong opinions on one side of the debate.\n\nNonetheless, I believe he makes an important point concerning journalistic framing: Words matter.\n\nMedia truly wanting to provide impartial reporting must be extra-careful that the adjectives they choose don't signal \u2014 either intentionally or unintentionally \u2014 an association with a particular side's point of view.\n\nIs the Indiana bill controversial? It depends on which side you ask.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today's word of the day:\u00a0\"controversial.\"\r\n\r\nIf you've seen the headlines, ledes and tweets related to\u00a0a religious \r\nfreedom bill passed by Indiana lawmakers this week,\u00a0you've likely seen that \r\nadjective attached to it.\r\n\r\nMonday's lede from the Washington Post:\r\n\r\n    A controversial religious freedom bill\u00a0that would\u00a0protect business\r\n    owners who want to decline to provide services for same-sex couples was\r\n    passed by Indiana\u2019s State House\u00a0today, the latest in a larger battle\r\n    over same-sex marriage and rights.\r\n\r\n    The bill reflects a national debate over the dividing line between\r\n    religious liberty and anti-gay discrimination.\u00a0The question of\u00a0whether\r\n    the religious rights of business owners also extend to their for-profit\r\n    companies has been a flashpoint as part of a larger debate over\r\n    same-sex marriage.\u00a0For instance, the bill would protect a\u00a0wedding\r\n    photographer who objects to shooting a same-sex wedding.\r\n\r\n    The\u00a0Indiana House voted\u00a063\u00a0to\u00a031\u00a0to approve a hot-button bill that will\r\n    likely become law, and\u00a0Republican Gov.
