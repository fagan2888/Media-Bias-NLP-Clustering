The clinics took care of her asthma, allergies and eczema \u2013 chronic problems, nothing urgent.\n\nRecently, though, she felt sharp pains in her side. Her doctor recommended an MRI and other tests she couldn\u2019t get through IHS. To pay for it, he urged her to sign up for private insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it,\u201d said Jake, 45, sitting on the porch swing of her home in Albuquerque. She didn\u2019t think Obamacare applied to her.\n\n\u201cI thought [IHS] should be responsible for my health care because I am Native American.\u201d\n\nTribes, health care advocates and government officials across the nation are trying to enroll as many Native Americans as possible in Obamacare, saying it offers new choices to patients and financial relief for struggling Indian hospitals and clinics.\n\nUnder the health law, many uninsured Native Americans can get coverage under the expanded Medicaid program for low-income Americans or buy subsidized plans through insurance exchanges. That allows them to receive treatment from private doctors and hospitals rather than rely solely on government and tribal facilities.\n\nAnd the coverage allows Indian health facilities \u2013which tribal leaders say are chronically underfunded \u2013 to bill insurers for care they already provide as well as offer new services.\n\nAdvocates see the health law as a chance to reduce the health disparities that have long afflicted Native Americans, including rates of diabetes that are three times higher than the U.S. population and a life span that is four years shorter. More patients now have access to substance abuse services, mental health treatment and preventive care.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is starting to fill the gap between need and current resources,\u201d said Doneg McDonough, a consultant to tribes on implementation of the health law. \u201cAnd it is a huge gap that has to be filled in.\u201d\n\nThe Indian Health Service provides care to about 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives in 35 states. But the federal agency, with a fixed budget of $4.6 billion, can\u2019t afford comprehensive services at all its far-flung facilities.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Insurance,Medicaid,States,Syndicate,The Health Law,Uninsured,Native American", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "Many Native Americans rely entirely on free care from the financially strapped Indian Health Service.
