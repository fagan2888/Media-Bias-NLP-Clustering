But that's not all. If the insurer lets you stay, reimbursement rates may be cut so much that you will wonder whether being dropped was the better outcome.\n\nUnitedHealth Group confirmed recently that it sent discontinuation letters to thousands of physicians in 10 states that cited \"significant changes and pressures in the healthcare environment\" as the cause. The company issued a statement saying that it expected its Medicare Advantage network, which covers about 27% of people on Medicare, to remain at about 85% of its 2013 size through the rest of 2014. The insurer currently has more than 350,000 providers in the Advantage network.
