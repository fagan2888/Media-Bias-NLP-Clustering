Jeff Sessions (R-AL) is calling on the people of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to very carefully pick a candidate they think can \u201cnegotiate better\u201d when it comes to trade deals.\n\nSessions made the comments in a 45-minute-long, exclusive phone interview with Breitbart News.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHe laid out the case for why Republicans must nominate a candidate who opposes the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the accompanying two global trade deals that would come with it: The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) and the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA). All three deals, along with the fast-track Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) that greases the skids for the eventual easy passage through Congress of each of the deals since TPA lowers the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold to just 51 votes and kills the ability for amendments, have become collectively known as \u201cObamatrade.\u201d\n\nSince the passage of TPA\u2014during which time the text of TPP was kept in a hidden basement classified reading room in the U.S. Capitol where only members of Congress could go to see it in person, without taking notes or copies of the text with them\u2014in 2015, TPP has been on hold.\n\nT-TIP and TiSA text, save for a leak of draft TiSA materials to WikiLeaks, have been unavailable even to members of Congress never mind the public. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration has since released the full text of TPP\u2014which is 5,544 pages long\u2014but the administration is holding the deal back for now, presumably waiting to formally introduce ratification legislation to Congress until a timeframe that would allow them to time it so that a vote in Congress would come up during a lame duck session after the November 2016 elections.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the pro-TPP people understood that there was a strong and growing opposition to this agreement,\u201d Sessions told Breitbart News.\n\nIt is an historic agreement. It is an incredibly colossal trade agreement. I\u2019ve got it on my desk here, it\u2019s about four feet tall\u20145,000 plus pages. It covers a host of issues, beyond what anyone would imagine and it creates an international commission that has extraordinary powers in which the United States\u2014like all the other nations\u2014has only one vote. So this is huge. There\u2019s been a deliberate decision, in my opinion, to quit talking about it, to try to get it off the agenda probably I think even the supporters don\u2019t want to bring it up before the election because voters will then be able to evaluate their elected representatives on how they vote. So, most likely, they\u2019ll do their best to not talk about it. The establishment media will assist in not talking about it during the campaign, not asking about it during debates to keep this off the table, and then there will be an attempt to bring this up during the lame duck\u2014or if a president wins that\u2019s for it, it could be carried over to next year. So, in a fundamental sense, the presidential election will have extraordinary influence on this. If a Republican candidate wins that opposes it, it\u2019s unlikely it would get through Congress. Hillary Clinton has been for it and against it, so if she gets elected they might yet try to get it through. So their best hope is to elect a pro-trade, pro-TPP president and try to move it through in the lame duck session in my opinion. That\u2019s my best political judgment. So there is an awareness that the people do not support it, and there is an attempt to keep the discussion out of the election debate.\n\nSessions said he expects Obama to engage in manipulation of the congressional calendar to introduce the text so he can purposely have the vote in the lame duck session\u2014when members of Congress can\u2019t be held accountable by their constituents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now told it\u2019s going to be filed, or signed, by the president on Feb. 4,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nThen the time limit on the president does not start until he files implementing legislation, which is not directly part of the treaty but implements the treaty. So he could hold that off, we would assume, and would file it in August or September to have it ripen after the election and before the lame duck Congress departs. So nothing can move until the president submits the implementing legislation and he has the power therefore to decide when the vote would occur. It can occur within a 90-day window.\n\nSessions told Breitbart News that when it comes to this matter, the stakes could not be higher.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how important the vote on the Trans Pacific Partnership is. It is representing monumental erosion of American sovereignty and further commits us to international institutions over which we have virtually no control,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nIt is the beginning of a European Union\u2014the European Union began with a trade agreement like this, with a commission. This is historic and monumental. If this is done, we may really have passed the point of no return. After the Pacific agreement is done, they will bring a Transatlantic [Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP)] agreement in the same fashion and a third agreement\u2014the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA). All of these are monumental, worldwide trade agreements in which the United States has one vote. We are the greatest military power in the history of the world, the greatest economic power in the history of the world. We do not need to constrain our ability to defend our American manufacturing and our workers. So, it\u2019s just that important. We deal with small countries and they\u2019ll probably start cheating\u2014and we don\u2019t have the time or the will to hold them to task. We don\u2019t fight very hard. But if we do anything that irritates people, then they scream\u2014we\u2019re a good lawful country, we try to comply with what we agreed to. We just should not be doing this.\n\nSessions said that the trade deal will increase America\u2019s trade deficits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trading now. We have huge deficits now. And yet nobody is saying that our trade deficits will be reduced [if TPP is approved],\u201d Sessions.\n\nThe Obama administration and none of the supporters are saying if we sign this agreement our trade deficit will reduce. It\u2019s going to get bigger, there\u2019s no doubt about that. When we have an increasing trade deficit that means we\u2019re having less American manufacturing and exports and less people with jobs. Our plants will close and their plants will expand. We had exactly that result with Korea, the last trade agreement. We should deal with countries one-on-one, bilateral trade agreements like we did with the Korean one\u2014it just needs to be better.\n\nIt\u2019s because of all that, Sessions told Breitbart News, that the people of Iowa must select a candidate for president on the GOP side who opposes TPP to prevent America from passing that point of no return.\n\n\u201cWe need to negotiate better,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nSo, what I\u2019d say to the people in Iowa: This is a matter of supreme importance that neither party should nominate a candidate who does not oppose this agreement. You can be for trade, you can be for negotiating agreements with countries around the world but not this way and not creating these kinds of transnational commissions that only hamper the United States as we go forward in the decades.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that 2016 GOP frontrunner billionaire Donald Trump has made this type of trade policy Sessions is talking about a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. While Sessions isn\u2019t endorsing anyone at this time officially, he has appeared with Trump at a Trump campaign rally in Alabama earlier this election and also held a meeting with him at the U.S. Capitol during the campaign. Sessions also helped Trump with his immigration reform plan.\n\nMore from Sessions\u2019 exclusive interview with Breitbart News is forthcoming.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exclusive \u2014 Jeff Sessions: \u2019Matter Of Supreme Importance\u2019 GOP Nominee Can \u2018Negotiate Better\u2019 Trade Deals Than Obamatrade", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Exclusive \u2014 Jeff Sessions: \u2019Matter Of Supreme Importance\u2019 GOP Nominee Can \u2018Negotiate Better\u2019 Trade Deals Than Obamatrade", "title": "Exclusive \u2014 Jeff Sessions: \u2019Matter Of Supreme Importance\u2019 GOP Nominee Can \u2018Negotiate Better\u2019 Trade Deals Than Obamatrade - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Sessions-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-01-25T07:18:11-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/25/exclusive-jeff-sessions-matter-of-supreme-importance-gop-nominee-can-negotiate-better-trade-deals-than-obamatrade/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Exclusive \u2014 Jeff Sessions: \u2019Matter Of Supreme Importance\u2019 GOP Nominee Can \u2018Negotiate Better\u2019 Trade Deals Than Obamatrade", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Sessions-Getty.jpg", "title": "Exclusive \u2014 Jeff Sessions: \u2019Matter Of Supreme Importance\u2019 GOP Nominee Can \u2018Negotiate Better\u2019 Trade Deals Than Obamatrade - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump, Jeff Sessions, Obamatrade, T-TIP, TiSA, TPA, TPP, Trade in Services Agreement, Trade Promotion Authority, Trans Pacific Partnership, Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Sessions", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-01-25T05:14:30-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-01-25T07:18:11-07:00", "tag": "Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the pro-TPP people understood that there was a strong and growing opposition to this agreement,\u201d Sessions told Breitbart News.\nIt is the beginning of a European Union\u2014the European Union began with a trade agreement like this, with a commission.\nIt is an incredibly colossal trade agreement.\nWe had exactly that result with Korea, the last trade agreement.\nThe Obama administration and none of the supporters are saying if we sign this agreement our trade deficit will reduce."}
