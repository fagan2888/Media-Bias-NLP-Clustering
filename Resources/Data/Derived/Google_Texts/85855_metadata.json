The sections on payment contained the same refrain: No insurance. No money.\n\nEven so, many of the patients work, often in Savannah\u2019s huge hotel and restaurant industry. Late last month, Donna Atkins, a waitress at a barbecue restaurant, learned from Dr. Guy Petruzzelli, a surgeon here, that she has throat cancer. She does not have insurance and had a sore throat for a year before going to a doctor. She was advised to get a specialized image of her neck, but it would have cost $2,300, more than she makes in a month.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have the money even to walk in the door of that office,\u201d said Ms. Atkins, speaking in a low, throaty whisper.\n\nDr. Petruzzelli has a phrase for her situation: \u201cShe failed the wallet biopsy.\u201d\n\nMs. Atkins had surgery last Friday, two years after her first symptoms. It is unclear whether Ms. Atkins, whose income is right around the poverty line, will be left without Medicaid, or if she earns enough to qualify for subsidies to buy private insurance on the federal exchange. She appreciates the intent of the health law, but does not like the outcome: Her hours are being cut so her employer can count her as part-time to avoid having to offer insurance.\n\nAs she juggled takeout orders at the restaurant, Ms. Atkins said she would have to try to find a second job. \u201cI\u2019m 53,\u201d she said. \u201cNot too many people want to hire someone my age.\u201d\n\nPatients with chronic conditions like hers often go in and out of emergency rooms for years without treatment because doctors are only required to treat immediately life-threatening conditions. Dr. Christopher Senkowski, a surgeon at Memorial, recalled examining a farmer with pancreatic cancer that had spread throughout his body after months of referrals to specialists that he could not afford.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe cuts in subsidies for safety-net hospitals like Memorial \u2014 those that deliver a significant amount of care to poor, uninsured or otherwise vulnerable patients \u2014 are set to total at least $18 billion through 2020. The government has projected that as much as $22 billion more in Medicare subsidies could be cut by 2019, depending partly on the change in the numbers of uninsured nationally.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe cuts are just one of the reductions in government reimbursements that are squeezing hospitals across the country. Some have already announced layoffs. In Georgia, three rural hospitals have closed this year.\n\nMedicaid expansion may not have replaced all of the lost subsidies, but it would have helped, hospital administrators said.\n\n\u201cI understand that the state needs to balance its budget, and control the runaway costs of Medicaid, but to turn a blind eye and say, \u2018Let the chips fall where they may,\u2019 you\u2019ll end up with a gutted health care system,\u201d said Maggie M. Gill, chief executive at Memorial Health.\n\nTraditionally, safety-net hospitals have played a special role in caring for poor people. They make up just 2 percent of acute care hospitals in the country, but provide about a fifth of all uncompensated care, according to Dr. Arthur Kellerman, dean of the F. Edward H\u00e9bert School of Medicine in Bethesda, Md. The subsidy was created in the 1980s to help hospitals with large shares of patients who were uninsured or had government insurance that did not pay very much. Many hospitals came to depend on it.\n\nA full third of Grady\u2019s patients have no insurance, and, if that does not change, the hospital will have no choice but to cut services, said John M. Haupert, Grady\u2019s chief executive. The hospital\u2019s large outpatient mental health program, which handles 58,000 visits a year and is critical to keeping poor patients with behavioral problems from seeking treatment in the emergency room, would most likely be hit, Mr. Haupert said.\n\nSome experts say the cuts in hospital subsidies are part of a larger problem: government programs like Medicaid do not pay enough to cover the actual costs of care. The cheapest private insurance on the new health care exchanges, the Bronze Plan, covers just 60 percent of costs, leaving low-income people who buy it with a lot of out-of-pocket costs that hospitals worry the patients will not be able to pay.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services said that some of the reductions in the subsidy should not hurt safety-net hospitals because states have discretion over how the money is distributed and should be focusing on hospitals with the most uncompensated care. And while there is no special exception for states that did not expand Medicaid, federal officials have said they will revisit that in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut experts and hospital administrators said it was unlikely that the federal government would make adjustments that would reward states that refused to expand Medicaid. And the health care landscape is changing so rapidly, they say, that the subsidies are crucial to keep going over the next few years.\n\nHospitals in Georgia are trying to hang on. Rural hospitals rely heavily on the subsidies and as many as 15 could close in the coming months, their trade association estimated, costing jobs in economically depressed parts of the state.\n\nGeorgia hospital officials hope that the plight of rural hospitals may eventually cause Gov. Nathan Deal to opt for some version of a Medicaid expansion. The state\u2019s politically powerful hospital association late last month called for expansion.\n\nBut for now, the governor is holding firm. His spokesman, Brian Robinson, said Mr. Deal\u2019s opposition to expanding Medicaid was driven by simple math: Georgia cannot afford it. Though the federal government is paying the full costs of the expansion for the first three years, states will have to pay up to 10 percent in later years. States that do not expand should be spared cuts in hospital subsidies, Mr. Robinson said.\n\nThe federal government, not Georgia, is to blame for the predicament, he said.\n\n\u201cThe state is sitting here, a victim of a crime, and you\u2019re asking the victim, \u2018Why did you let yourself get mugged?\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nHospitals are trying to get Congress to delay the subsidy cuts by amending the health law, but House Republicans in Washington have thus far refused.\n\n\u201cThe conversation we are having with the congressional delegation goes like this, \u2018If we don\u2019t expand Medicaid, what is the Georgia solution to indigent care?\u2019 \u201d said Matthew Hicks, vice president for government relations at Grady. \u201cSo far they don\u2019t have an answer.\u201d",
