Most with little to no teaching experience in a high school classroom.\"Hardest thing I've ever done,\" said Andrea Williams, a teacher with an emergency certification. \"From top to bottom, I haven't found an easy part. It's hard.\"\n\nJennifer Hardaway also has an emergency certification.\n\n\"We've got the education, and we've got the love and passion,\" Hardaway said.\n\n\n\nFor McVay, the professionals he hires aren't the issue.\n\n\n\n\"The back story is frustrating,\" McVay said.\n\n\n\nThe back story is the increasing number of applicants.\n\n\n\nIn all of 2012, the state received 98 applications for emergency certifications. In 2013, it increased to 189. This year, in July and August alone, that number jumped to 280.\n\n\n\nThe State Department of Education blames the increase on the statewide teacher shortage, which officials say is generated from the state's teacher salary average, ranked second to worst in the nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe're putting out great candidates for other states that are paying more,\u201d McVay said.\n\n\n\n\"I'd like to think it says there's a lot of people just like us that understand there's a problem, and so we're going to jump in and help,\" Williams said.\n\n\n\nNow, McVay calls on legislators to fix the problem by increasing salaries, while teachers with emergency certifications plan to prove their ability to teach.\n\n\n\nThe State also blames the shortage on a stressful environment, caused by classroom size and political climate.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Oklahoma's loss of the \"No Child Left Behind\" waiver comes amid what instructors are calling a growing problem.", "author": "Justin Dougherty", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/26398490/oklahoma-schools-hiring-teachers-with-emergency-certificates", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4602213_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Oklahoma's loss of the \"No Child Left Behind\" waiver comes amid what instructors are calling a growing problem.", "title": "Oklahoma Schools Hiring Teachers With Emergency Certificates"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4602213_G.jpg", "description": "Oklahoma's loss of the \"No Child Left Behind\" waiver comes amid what instructors are calling a growing problem.", "card": "summary", "title": "Oklahoma Schools Hiring Teachers With Emergency Certificates"}, "wnreadableurl": "oklahoma-schools-hiring-teachers-with-emergency-certificates", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/08/28", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media, education, emergency, teaching, certificates, news 9, news9.com, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS07", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media, education, emergency, teaching, certificates, news 9, news9.com, kwtv"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccaee\"", "article_summary": "Now, McVay calls on legislators to fix the problem by increasing salaries, while teachers with emergency certifications plan to prove their ability to teach.\nIn all of 2012, the state received 98 applications for emergency certifications.\n\"Hardest thing I've ever done,\" said Andrea Williams, a teacher with an emergency certification.\nThe State also blames the shortage on a stressful environment, caused by classroom size and political climate.\nThe State Department of Education blames the increase on the statewide teacher shortage, which officials say is generated from the state's teacher salary average, ranked second to worst in the nation."}
