A man is licking his wounds and is also without his wallet following an eventful walk home early Sunday morning from a southeast Wichita bar.

Wichita police said the victim had been kicked out of the Snug Harbor bar near Lincoln and Edgemoor for being too drunk.

He told arriving officers that as he was walking home an unknown man with curly hair came up and hit him in the face. A scuffle ensued before the man ran off with the victim's wallet. Police estimate the value of the wallet and its contents at about $10.

The victim was not seriously hurt.
