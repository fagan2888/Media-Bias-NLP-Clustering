I followed each day of the tournament through The Baxter Bulletin. I personally watched the Saturday weigh-in at ASU-Mountain Home. I also watched beautiful sponsor boats from my dock on Bull Shoals.\n\nI was impressed by the numerous vendors at the college, the BBQ contest, the drone to monitor ESPN2 and the band. At the start of the tournament, it was estimated that 3,000 to 5,000 people would take part in the festivities, filling motels in town and bringing as much $1.5 million to the Mountain Home area economy. A nice first-place prize to the top angler of $100,000 was also given.\n\nKudos for all involved! I would hope the Chamber of Commerce would try hard to repeat the Bassmaster Elite in the future.\n\nAffordable Care Act a benefit, deserves respect\n\nFrom Johanna Hill,\n\nMountain Home\n\nThank you Baxter Bulletin for bringing back \u201cLetters to the Editor.\u201d\n\nThe letter from Nancy Lewis of April 23, was outstanding; congratulations for expressing your opinion so professionally.\n\nYes, I can indeed imagine those \u201cleft out\u201d feelings of people who are working for a minimum wage, less than 40 hours per week, without access to a proper healthcare plan. But thank God that this situation has finally changed for so many.\n\nThis change was one of our President\u2019s great accomplishments, and it deserves to be called the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d and not \u201cObamacare\u201d any longer. However, the problem remains that far too many politicians and selfish people will continue fighting that law, instead of improving the situation for the \u201clittle people\u201d nationwide.\n\nI personally get that warm-hearted feeling whenever hearing children\u2019s voices among us waiting seniors at the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nAnd may the good Lord bless our wonderful local hospital and our great medical teams.\n\nToo much \u2018Monkey Business\u2019 in politics\n\nFrom Curt Longhenry,\n\nMountain Home\n\nToo much \u2018Monkey Business.\u2019\n\nChuck Berry had a hit with this title. It is a perfect example of politics today.\n\nOur politicians have been operating in this mode for too long. And we the people, who are supposed to be in control of the government, have let the government get control of us.\n\nThe young people of this country need to be taught the real meaning of freedom, or they might see it lost in their lifetime.\n\nI think this is why Donald Trump is so popular. He might just do what he says he will, and actually change things. Politicians probably won\u2019t. The career politicians don\u2019t like him because they love their cushy jobs and the lobbyists\u2019 payoffs that go with the job, and they will do and say anything to keep them.\n\nBut notice they never get done what they promise to do. Remember the government that wants to give you everything, will eventually need to take it all from everyone to keep operating.\n\nCan you see it happening? What can you do?\n\nOur forefathers knew where God belonged and our country was blessed beyond anything the world has ever seen. Maybe God is starting to take America out of his picture. Please pray for the candidates who know what God\u2019s position is.\n\nIn the meantime, pray for them, us and our county. God bless America.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/news/local/2016/05/02/letters-editor/83827580/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Letters to the editor from Twin Lakes Area residents", "og": {"site_name": "The Baxter Bulletin", "description": "Letters to the editor from Twin Lakes Area residents", "title": "Letters to the Editor", "url": "http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/news/local/2016/05/02/letters-editor/83827580/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/baxterbulletin.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Letters to the editor from Twin Lakes Area residents", "title": "Letters to the Editor", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6f58a4937afeb90947180583b7a7120f736c013/c=25-0-181-156&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/02/MountainHome/B9321949180Z.1_20160502124420_000_GR6E78P8G.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@BBNewsroom", "site": "@BBNewsroom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=875264530", "fb": {"app_id": 183082181717378}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "I personally watched the Saturday weigh-in at ASU-Mountain Home.\nI was impressed by the numerous vendors at the college, the BBQ contest, the drone to monitor ESPN2 and the band.\nBassmasters event impresses readerFrom Dr. Jerry Kinder,Mountain HomeWhat a wonderful weekend of April 21-24 for Mountain Home.\nI would hope the Chamber of Commerce would try hard to repeat the Bassmaster Elite in the future.\nRemember the government that wants to give you everything, will eventually need to take it all from everyone to keep operating."}
