The October 18, 2013 edition of The Huntsville Times quotes the governor of Alabama as saying his \"long-term goal is to resist the implementation of the Affordable Care Act ...\" That alone should be enough to impeach the man or at the very minimum to not re-elect him next year.\n\nThe article cites a study by the Kaiser Foundation, reporting that Alabama has about 191,000 people who will fall into the \"coverage gap\" between Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. These are people who by present standards earn too much to be covered by Medicaid, but too little for the tax credits of the Affordable Care Act. A maximum annual income of $3,221 is too much!\n\nExpansion of Medicaid in Alabama would help these people and at no cost to the state for the first three years and then only 10 percent in subsequent years. For the governor of this state to say his goal is to deny almost 200,000 people health care is an abomination. He claims to be a doctor. Physician, heal thyself!\n\nI was told recently that our local hospital loses $750K per month on indigent care. With expanded Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, hospitals could stop the bleeding - literally. More jobs will be created \u2013 another goal of the governor; and people will be healthier. Expanding Medicaid is the right thing to do for all Alabamians. It is the moral thing to do. It is the economic thing to do.\n\nThe governor needs to do what he was elected to do \u2013 help the residents of Alabama. That should be his first and last goal. Expanding Medicaid should be done now.\n\nToni H. McGriff\n\nDutton, AL\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Reader opinion", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "opinion", "title": "Gov.
