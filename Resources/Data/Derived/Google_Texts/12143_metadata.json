Forensic evidence reportedly backs Wilson\u2019s account that Michael Brown was attacking, not that Brown had his hands raised in the air as some witnesses suggested.\n\nThe Washington Post also reported that \u201ca half-dozen unnamed black witnesses\u201d testified to the grand jury supporting Wilson\u2019s account of the incident.\n\nIt is unclear when a decision could take place, but Ferguson police are already preparing for the possibility of riots.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of anxiety, there\u2019s a lot of fear, anticipation\u201d about that announcement, said Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson.\n\nBut protesters are already prepared for the announcement, and are anticipating that Darren Wilson will not be charged.\n\n\u201cThe moment I learn that there is, in fact, a non-indictment, then there\u2019s going to be an organized protest,\u201d said Eric Vickers, a black St. Louis attorney and civil rights activist.\n\nThere are still intermittent clashes between protesters and police in Ferguson. CNN reported that on Tuesday there was a small group of 50 peaceful protesters, but the next night protesters hurled rocks, water bottles, and a metal rod at police officers. They also tore down barricades outside a Ferguson police department station.\n\nPolice have reportedly been preparing for the possibility of riots, and some believe that the grand jury leaks have come from law enforcement sources with the intention of readying people for the news that Darren Wilson will not be indicted.\n\nPolice are not the only ones predicting riots in Ferguson. One protester told CNN this week that if Wilson is not indicted for the shooting death of Michael Brown, \u201call hell is going to break loose.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ferguson police are preparing for what could be riots after an announcement whether police officer Darren Wilson will face charges for fatally shooting 18-year", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Ferguson police are preparing for what could be riots after an announcement whether police officer Darren Wilson will face charges for fatally shooting 18-year", "title": "Ferguson Update: Riots Expected After Darren Wilson Grand Jury Announcement", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1560633/ferguson-update-riots-expected-after-darren-wilson-grand-jury-announcement/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ferguson-Riots.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-24T15:30:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-24T15:36:42+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ferguson-Riots.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-10-24T15:30:41+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "darren wilson,darren wilson grand jury,fergusion protest,ferguson,ferguson riots,michael brown,michael brown shooting,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ferguson-Riots.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ferguson police are preparing for what could be riots after an announcement whether police officer Darren Wilson will face charges for fatally shooting 18-year"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Many of the protestors want Darren Wilson to face murder charges, but legal experts believe that leaked information from the secret grand jury proceedings indicate that he will not be charged.\nThe Washington Post also reported that \u201ca half-dozen unnamed black witnesses\u201d testified to the grand jury supporting Wilson\u2019s account of the incident.\nBut protesters are already prepared for the announcement, and are anticipating that Darren Wilson will not be charged.\nFerguson police are preparing for what could be riots after an announcement whether police officer Darren Wilson will face charges for fatally shooting 18-year-old Michael Brown.\nPolice have reportedly been preparing for the possibility of riots, and some believe that the grand jury leaks have come from law enforcement sources with the intention of readying people for the news that Darren Wilson will not be indicted."}
