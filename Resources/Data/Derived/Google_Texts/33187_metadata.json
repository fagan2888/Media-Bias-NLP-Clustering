Inc. was begging for workers and struggling to hire candidates who could simply pass a drug test.\n\nGood jobs, paying $15 to $20 per hour, went unfilled. The company even hesitated to expand because it could not find enough drug-free applicants.\n\nTimes have changed.\n\nCompany president Jim Hatt said the economy is so slow the market has begun to attract more qualified workers. Business still is not where he would like to see it, but now he can find employees who can pass a drug test, which he says the company is forced to do by its insurance company.\n\nGov. Scott Walker appears to be taking such concerns to heart.\n\nThe Republican governor on Sunday unveiled his jobs plan for his next term, should he survive what polls show is his dead-heat gubernatorial race against Mary Burke, a Democrat, former commerce secretary under Walker\u2019s predecessor Jim Doyle and member of the Madison Metropolitan School Board.\n\nWalker\u2019s 62-page plan proposes more property and income tax cuts, increased tax relief for manufacturing and agriculture and reduced barriers to business creation, according to Walker\u2019s campaign.\n\nBut the most controversial points are the governor\u2019s proposals to require drug testing for individuals filing for unemployment and for \u201cable-bodied, working-age adults requesting food stamps\u201d through the state\u2019s FoodShare public assistance program.\n\nThe bottom line, Walker says, is the bottom line: Taxpayers shouldn\u2019t have to pay for public assistance programs for individuals who can\u2019t pass a drug test.\n\nBurke and her supporters have ripped Walker for missing the mark on his 2010 campaign pledge that Wisconsin\u2019s economy would create 250,000 jobs during his first term. The number, to date, is north of 100,000, but it\u2019s a long way from the massive contraction under Doyle, Walker\u2019s allies point out.\n\n\u201cWisconsin is back on under Governor Walker, and voters cannot forget the poor results and extreme mismanagement of the Doyle-Burke Administration that caused 133,000 jobs and 27,000 businesses to flee the state,\u201d said Republican Party of Wisconsin Executive Director Joe Fadness in a statement.\n\nRead More on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scott Walker\u2019s New Job Plan Includes Drug Testing for Unemployment Benefits", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Scott Walker\u2019s New Job Plan Includes Drug Testing for Unemployment Benefits", "title": "Scott Walker Proposes Drug Testing for Those Filing for Unemployment Benefits, Food Stamps", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/13290716214_962a7d726c_k.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-19T15:54:07+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1v0Rm2e"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Scott Walker\u2019s New Job Plan Includes Drug Testing for Unemployment Benefits", "title": "Scott Walker Proposes Drug Testing for Those Filing for Unemployment Benefits, Food Stamps", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/13290716214_962a7d726c_k.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "welfare", "published_time": "2014-09-20T03:01:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-19T15:54:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "drug testing, scott walker, scott walker, scott walker jobs plan,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbca4\"", "article_summary": "But the most controversial points are the governor\u2019s proposals to require drug testing for individuals filing for unemployment and for \u201cable-bodied, working-age adults requesting food stamps\u201d through the state\u2019s FoodShare public assistance program.\nThe bottom line, Walker says, is the bottom line: Taxpayers shouldn\u2019t have to pay for public assistance programs for individuals who can\u2019t pass a drug test.\nMADISON, Wis. \u2014 Three years ago, Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry Co.
