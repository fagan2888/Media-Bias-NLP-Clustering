She goes on to assure her listeners that she has faith in her husband, that she believes in him. Her speech is brief, maybe 90 seconds, and then she steps off to the side as Weiner sweeps into frame, his speech longer and faster and louder.\u201d If she were the candidate, \u201d he smiles, \u201cI\u2019d be getting crushed.\u201d\n\nThe irony of his observation cannot be overstated. Weiner is running for the 2013 Democratic nomination for New York City\u2019s mayor, a campaign that you already know ended in spectacular failure. And yet the camera in Weiner turns\u2014for a moment\u2014back to Abedin. She watches him. She doesn\u2019t smile. And you\u2019re transfixed.\n\nMade by former Weiner chief of staff Josh Kriegman with Elyse Steinberg, Weiner shows its titular subject a lot. He speaks in interviews, at press conferences, with his staff, and to New Yorkers, in crowds and one on one. If he\u2019s not always assured, he is mostly quick and argumentative, ready to take on whoever comes at him, to answer questions, to make his case. The campaign, he says, is undertaken as a joint decision by him and Abedin, a calculation to allow them to restore the rhythm of their lives after the sexting scandal that brought on his resignation from Congress. A New York Times Magazine cover story trumpets the comeback. They\u2019re ready, Weiner says in the film, to \u201cget out of the defensive crouch,\u201d adding that running for mayor seems the best way.\n\nEven as you might wonder about that assessment, whether he\u2019s \u201cfit\u201d to run or whether he knows why he\u2019s doing it, you see how eager he is for the fights, if not necessarily the taunts and the trivialization. \u201cThe punch line of me is true,\u201d he admits, \u201cI did those things, and I did a lot of other things.\u201d\n\nThe film, in select theaters 20 May and on VOD 26 May, reminds you\u2014and lets Weiner remind you\u2014of some of those other things, with brief clips of his hard-charging speeches on behalf of 9/11 first responders, the middle class, and Obamacare. But for all the focus on Weiner, you\u2019re aware of Abedin, on and off screen, in the forms of their young son Jordan, their apartment and even their lumpy orange cat.\n\nThese images don\u2019t tend to show Weiner and Abedin together, but rather, on opposite sides of the frame, his face fierce, hers dubious, his shirtsleeves rolled, her arms crossed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do this if you\u2019re going to be unpleasant,\u201d she instructs him during a session with the staff. He nods and rolls on, less unpleasantly.\n\nThey\u2019ve got a pattern, or at least that\u2019s what you might guess from what you see on screen. As much as both Weiner and Abedin insist the marriage is their business, they embark on a project that inevitably makes it public, again. As much as the filmmakers might think their documentary concerns the comeback campaign, they\u2019ve got aa new project when more stories about Weiner\u2019s sexting as \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d emerge.\n\nExplode might be a better word for what happens here. In one moment, you\u2019re seeing time-lapsed sequences and montages of the headquarters expanding and adorned with banners, \u201cTeam Weiner\u201d members busy on the phones, crowds gathering at sidewalk speeches. In the next moment, Weiner\u2019s the subject of threats and analysis, as well as some stalking by one of the sexting partners, Sydney leathers, urged to confront him by Howard Stern (footage of Ms. Leathers\u2019 thwarted attempt to catch Weiner at an event is almost cartoonish, part harrowing and part horrific, as the film cuts back to Weiner and his wife, huddled in a hallway, waiting for the chance to get away in a car).\n\nWhen the news breaks, Weiner looks caught, in more than one way. In an office with his senior staff and Abedin, he does his best to speed-talk the coming strategy, the cycle and the end of it, and then he stops, looks at his people and says, \u201cCan we just have the room for a second?\u201d They file out, and he remains behind with Abedin\u2014and the camera. As they drop their heads to consult, you hear them. He asks, \u201cDo you know the timing of this?\u201d She nods, \u201cIt\u2019s when you and I were talking about getting separated.\u201d\n\nThis feels like too much access, like you\u2019re peeping a scene you\u2019d rather not, that there\u2019s something wrong, not only with Weiner but with all of this, his ambition, politics, media. This also feels like a show, like part of a campaign but for something other than the nomination. You can\u2019t know what\u2019s going on between them, or what\u2019s already happened. If you can\u2019t fathom how they come to their choices, you do at least see the costs, the past that won\u2019t be past and the damage on their faces.\n\nWhen she speaks in public again, at the instantly notorious July 23 press conference. He speaks, as he must, and then she does, apologizing for being nervous, as it\u2019s her first time doing a press conference. She smiles, enchanting. Journalists fill the room, on the floor, in the doorways, in front of and behind the couple, cameras click, bulbs flash.\n\nShe leans toward the mic and reads from a paper. \u201cWe discussed all of this before he decided to run for mayor\u201d she says, \u201cSo really what I want to say is, I love him, I have forgiven him, I believe in him, and as we have said from the beginning, we are moving forward.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t look away. Even if you\u2019ve seen the scene before, even if you\u2019re too aware of its painfulness and its bizarre theatrics, even if you cringe at the tabloidization of politics that has only ballooned since 2013, you can\u2019t look away. What can she be thinking?\n\nCertainly, you can ask the same of Weiner, as Kriegman, does late in the film. \u201cWhy have you let me film this?\u201d he asks, but what could anyone say? Even the question seems reductive at this point. Weiner shifts and says little, probably too fast. In the background, Abedin sits at the end of a long table, a pizza box before her, a slice on her plate. Her son\u2019s in the next room, she\u2019s got a big day tomorrow.\n\nShe remains at the back of the frame, she says nothing. You might think she\u2019s exactly right.\n\nWeiner Rating:", "article_metadata": {"description": "For all Weiners focus on the mayoral campaign, on the media everywhere, and on Anthony Weiner, youre never not thinking of his wife, Huma Abedin.", "title": "Why Make a Film About Anthony Weiner?", "og": {"site_name": "PopMatters", "description": "For all Weiner's focus on the mayoral campaign, on the media everywhere, and on Anthony Weiner, you're never not thinking of his wife, Huma Abedin.", "title": "Why Make a Film About Anthony 'Weiner'?", "url": "http://www.popmatters.com/review/why-make-a-film-about-anthony-weiner/", "image": "http://images.popmatters.com/misc_art/k/ks-weiner-650.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 117106511637048}, "keywords": "Josh Kriegman, Elyse Steinberg, Weiner, Sundance Selects, Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin, congress, documentary, elyse steinberg, josh kriegman, scandal, weiner, Articles, PopMatters", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Made by former Weiner chief of staff Josh Kriegman with Elyse Steinberg, Weiner shows its titular subject a lot.\nWeiner Director: Josh Kriegman, Elyse Steinberg Cast: Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin (Sundance Selects)US theatrical: 20 May 2016 (Limited release)2016 Official Site\u201cPutting yourself out there is hard.\u201d As Huma Abedin addresses a living room full of Anthony Weiner\u2019s would-be supporters, her face is a perfect mask.\nThey\u2019re ready, Weiner says in the film, to \u201cget out of the defensive crouch,\u201d adding that running for mayor seems the best way.\nCertainly, you can ask the same of Weiner, as Kriegman, does late in the film.\nBut for all the focus on Weiner, you\u2019re aware of Abedin, on and off screen, in the forms of their young son Jordan, their apartment and even their lumpy orange cat."}
