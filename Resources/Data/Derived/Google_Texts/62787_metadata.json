The center near Loop 410 and Callaghan Road was designed as a place for nursing mothers to receive free breast-feeding help and support from lactation consultants, dietitians, peer counselors and each other in a nonclinical environment.\n\nThe Baby Caf\u00e9 is part of a larger push to encourage breast-feeding in Texas and around the country because of its short-term and long-term effects on the health of babies and mothers.\n\nThe Baby Caf\u00e9 model began in England in 2000, and dozens more have sprung up around the world, including more than 40 in the United States. Metro Health launched the site through the Texas Medicaid 1115 Waiver program, which funds efforts to prevent health problems. Breast-feeding has been shown to reduce the risk of a child being overweight.\n\nMetro Health also has set up satellite Baby Caf\u00e9 sites at five WIC clinics throughout the city.\n\n\u201cThere is a great need for education in San Antonio,\u201d said Christina Padilla, a dietitian and certified lactation consultant at the Baby Caf\u00e9.\n\nBesides obesity, experts said, breast-feeding helps protect against diabetes, sudden infant death syndrome, asthma, childhood cancers and other chronic health conditions and diseases. Mothers who breast-feed have a decreased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Breast-feeding also helps with weight management.\n\n\u201cBreast-feeding is one of the most cost-effective and effective preventive health measures that are out there,\u201d said Julie Stagg, state breast-feeding coordinator at the Texas Department of State Health Services. \u201cBetween the cost of moms not breast-feeding at optimal rates and of children not being breast-fed, it's estimated that about $13 billion in excess costs are accrued in the United States every year, and a conservative estimate of about 900 pediatric deaths that could otherwise be prevented.\u201d\n\nBut while 81 percent of women in the United States who deliver babies attempt to breast-feed, only 25 percent are exclusively breast-feeding after six months, according to a 2012 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report.\n\nMore Information Breast-feeding resources The Baby Caf\u00e9, 4538 Centerview Drive, Suite 151, is open 8 a.m.- 4:30 p.m. Monday-Friday. 210-207-7138 or sanantonio.gov/Health/HealthServices/BabyCafe.aspx La Leche League holds meetings throughout South Texas. texaslll.org/group/south-texas The San Antonio Breastfeeding Coalition can direct mothers to many resources, including breast-feeding classes and a directory of lactation consultants. sabctx.org The Texas Department of State Health Services WIC Program offers a one-stop breast-feeding resource. breastmilkcounts. com or 800-514-6667 The National Breastfeeding Helpline connects women to peer counselors who can answer questions in English or Spanish. 800-994-9662 Jessica Belasco\n\n\n\nAbout the San Antonio Baby Caf\u00e9\n\nFind a directory of Mother-Friendly Worksites\n\nAbout the Texas Ten Step Program\n\nFind a La Leche League meeting\n\nBreast-feeding may be a natural process that's hardwired into mothers and babies, but there's a learning curve.\n\nMothers may need to learn proper latching so nursing won't hurt and the baby is receiving sufficient milk; they also can learn different types of holds to make the process more comfortable. The Baby Caf\u00e9 counsels mothers about such topics and offers literature, such as a guide to examining a baby's diaper to determine whether it's getting enough to eat.\n\nOne of the top barriers to continued breast-feeding is the difficulties in pumping when women return to work. In the 1990s, the state began a program to recognize workplaces that make it easier for women to pump as Texas Mother-Friendly Worksites. These workplaces offer flexible scheduling so mothers can pump and provide them with a lactation space, access to a clean water source and hygienic storage for the breast milk, among other requirements. More than 1,700 worksites have received the designation.\n\nWorkplaces here that received the designation include Baptist Health System, Broadway Bank, Whole Foods Market and Tesoro. The city of San Antonio was the first municipality in Texas to receive the designation, Stagg said.\n\nSouthwest General Hospital, another Texas Mother-Friendly Worksites, offers a private lactation room designed for comfort with recliners, a refrigerator and sink.\n\n\u201cWe want that to be their last worry when they come back to work in the hospital after maternity leave,\u201d said Christina Rivera, the hospital's director of human resources.\n\nWhat happens to babies right after birth also can affect breast-feeding rates. That's why the Department of State Health Services and the Texas Hospital Association developed the Texas Ten Step Program to promote the practice.\n\nThe steps include placing the baby in skin-to-skin contact with the mother immediately after birth for at least an hour, giving the baby no other food or drink unless medically indicated, allowing mother and child to stay together 24 hours a day and not giving the infant a pacifier.\n\nIn San Antonio, 11 hospitals have been designated as Texas Ten Step facilities, including San Antonio Military Medical Center, Children's Hospital of San Antonio, Methodist Children's Hospital and University Hospital.\n\nHospitals also are putting more lactation consultants in post-partum units. In August, North Central Baptist Hospital opened a Mother's Milk First Lactation Center, which offers breast-feeding consultations, bra fittings and assistance with breast pump reimbursement.\n\nSome help for nursing mothers is mandated by law. The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers to provide breast-feeding counseling and equipment for nursing mothers.\n\nBut mothers also need social support to stick to breast-feeding. That's where Baby Caf\u00e9 and La Leche League, a mother-to-mother support group that also offers phone consultations and house calls, come in.\n\nHolly Holmes had difficulty breast-feeding and found that La Leche League meetings were her \u201csaving grace,\u201d so now she leads meetings to help others in San Antonio.\n\n\u201cIt can put them in touch with other moms who have been there,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cSometimes there's not really something you can say specifically, like, 'Here, do A, B and C, and this will solve your problem.' Because sometimes when it comes to parenting, what you get from other moms is just, 'I've been there, hang in there, you'll make it through.'\u201d\n\njbelasco@express-news.net", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "vf": {"section": "lifestyle", "unique_id": "mysa-article-5377673"}, "og": {"site_name": "San Antonio Express-News", "description": "The Baby Caf\u00e9 in San Antonio is part of a larger push to encourage breast-feeding in Texas and around the country because of its short-term and long-term effects on the health of both babies and mothers.", "title": "S.A. making strides toward breast-feeding education", "url": "http://www.mysanantonio.com/lifestyle/health-family/article/S-A-making-strides-toward-breast-feeding-5377673.php", "image": "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/27/26/12/6120088/4/rawImage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@mySA", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jbelasco"}, "fb": {"admins": 100006394927810, "app_id": 618477354914868}, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "9451CA04ABC9D1D5C6419C73B4C4F7B7", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd78e\"", "article_summary": "texaslll.org/group/south-texas The San Antonio Breastfeeding Coalition can direct mothers to many resources, including breast-feeding classes and a directory of lactation consultants.\nIn San Antonio, 11 hospitals have been designated as Texas Ten Step facilities, including San Antonio Military Medical Center, Children's Hospital of San Antonio, Methodist Children's Hospital and University Hospital.\nS.A. making strides toward breast-feeding educationPhoto: Helen L.
