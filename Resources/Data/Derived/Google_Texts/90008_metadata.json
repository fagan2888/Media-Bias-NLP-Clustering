Those roads are going to change some traffic patterns in the Lowcountry.\n\nPaid for through $36 million in Charleston County\u2019s half-cent sales tax receipts set aside for transportation and other uses, Northside Drive Extension and Future Drive are being cut through the property. They will eventually serve as connections to a proposed interchange on I-26 that will take traffic straight to the industries lining Palmetto Commerce Parkway.\n\nThey will also bring development to Ingleside Plantation, growth stunted five years ago when financial markets collapsed in the Great Recession and developers unveiled ambitious plans for the property.\n\nIn November 2008, as banks sought bailouts and businesses buckled, developers laid out huge plans to transform the old plantation into a $750 million commercial and office project.\n\nThey shrugged off the roiling economy at the time, saying the economic pendulum would swing back into positive territory before too long.\n\nDevelopers expected the first $250 million phase of Ingleside Plantation at the heavily traveled juncture of Interstate 26 and U.S. Highway 78 to include new buildings, most likely restaurants and hotels. About 1.12 million square feet of retail, office, hotel and residential space was going to rise after about two years, soon after roads were cut.\n\nFive years later, the slow slog back from the deep recession proved them wrong, though some development did occur on the property\u2019s fringes.\n\nNear the interstate, an apartment complex rose and another is on the way beside it on about 40 acres altogether. On the other side of the property along Palmetto Commerce Parkway, about three dozen acres were sold for three separate industries: Tighitco, Streit Armoring and Immedion.\n\nThe rest of the projected development, slated over several years in phases, failed to materialize. \u201cThat was an ill-fated venture,\u201d said Eric Meyer, Fritz\u2019s father and president of Weber USA.\n\nThe property, which Weber once called \u201ca hidden jewel,\u201d is owned by an affiliate of Weber Automotive, which has a manufacturing plant in Summerville.\n\nConstruction ahead\n\nWith the economy slowly regaining its footing and some significant road development now taking shape on the property, Ingleside\u2019s future is looking a little rosier.\n\nTrees are being cleared for a 2.5-mile extension of Northside Drive to U.S. Highway 78. A one-mile crossroad called Future Drive will connect the Northside extension to Palmetto Commerce Parkway and eventually Patriot Boulevard.\n\nA $10 million sewer line, financed by the city of North Charleston, is also being installed from a new pump station near I-26 to Palmetto Commerce Parkway and eventually to Wescott Plantation off Dorchester Road.\n\nOnce the roads are completed in less than two years and development sprouts up, developers can use the tax proceeds from new businesses to help pay for side roads built and paid for by the developer. That\u2019s part of the tax increment finance district local government set up for the property.\n\nAt one point, Weber planned to put his North American headquarters on the tract. That didn\u2019t happen, but Eric Meyer said the German industrialist still wants to build a 180,000-square-foot automotive parts manufacturing building on Palmetto Commerce Parkway at some point.\n\nIn a more concrete development, the Bank of South Carolina hopes to move into part of a planned two-story, 40,000-square-foot building at the north end of Northside Drive Extension, where it intersects U.S. 78, Eric Meyer said. Talks are underway with medical offices for a good chunk of the rest of the new structure.\n\nThe planned residential buildings do not include single-family homes. Condominiums, townhouses and apartments are slated for areas set aside for housing.\n\nFitting in\n\nWeber\u2019s son, Daniel Weber, chief financial officer and vice president of sales for Weber Automotive, expects the property to be developed over 15-20 years, the same amount of time announced five years ago.\n\n\u201cWe want to have a mix of industry, commercial and very high quality projects,\u201d Daniel Weber said. \u201cWe have a lot of deals already proposed to us. We are not in any rush. It\u2019s very important that it fits in the community and the overall picture.\u201d\n\nOn a drive through the property last week, Fritz Meyer pointed out the property fronts 2.25 miles of interstate, an attractive feature to prospective tenants. Other plusses include power provided by different utilities and a Norfolk Southern rail line bisecting the tract.\n\nMounds of chopped up trees sit in the middle of clear-cut swaths about 150 feet wide. That\u2019s where the two new major arterial roads will go. A 30-foot-high overpass over the rail line is slowly taking shape with sloped stacks of earth.\n\nThe planned new interstate interchange that will eventually connect to Future Drive is not part of the current Roadwise-financed project.\n\n\u201cThe interchange is not being built for our development, but we will benefit from it,\u201d Fritz Meyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s planned as an access to the interstate for industries along Palmetto Commerce Parkway.\u201d\n\nWhile no major commercial developments have been announced, Fritz Meyer said, \u201cThere has been a lot of discussion with big-box retailers.\u201d\n\nAbout 140 acres have been sold. They include land for the apartments near the interstate and industries along Palmetto Commerce Parkway and 60 acres bought by Daimler for future expansion beside its van assembly plant. Another 60 acres are being used for highway right of way.\n\n\u201cWe hope we can develop it in a way that\u2019s aesthetically pleasing,\u201d Fritz Meyer said.\n\nReach Warren L.
