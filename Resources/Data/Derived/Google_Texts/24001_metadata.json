Screaming was inappropriate and embarrassing. If it had also been effective it might have been worth it, but it wasn\u2019t, and I knew it but could not stop. It was as if inside me some hidden beast was waking up, wounded and stirring. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to scream,\u201d the woman said to me. But I was not in control. I was not myself.\n\nOctober 2014, Knoxville, Tennessee. The woman and I were standing just beyond the requisite 100 feet from an early voting station, each of us holding our opposing signs. At that time, Tennessee\u2019s constitution contained stronger privacy rights than the country\u2019s, which you would think would make Tennesseans proud, and it might have if not for abortion. The stickiest of sticking points. The hottest of hot topics. Privacy provisions in our state constitution were keeping our deeply conservative, Republican majority legislators from enacting restrictions on abortion. What they were doing in Texas, they couldn\u2019t do in Tennessee. The solution? Change the constitution. To that end, they managed to get Amendment 1 on the ballot, which, if passed, would strip away abortion from those protected rights. My sign said, VOTE NO. The woman\u2019s sign said, VOTE YES. We should have agreed to disagree, that tiresome pabulum another VOTE YES sign holder had cheerfully quipped at me earlier that day as she pretended to believe my opinion was as legitimate as hers, just different. At the least, we should have kept our mouths shut.\n\nShe started it. I had brought a friend with me to the polling station because around here it doesn\u2019t feel safe to stand alone if you\u2019re going to publicly come out as pro-choice. If that sounds slightly paranoid, it does to me, too. However, in a place where many people think abortion is murder, you never know if somebody might decide to become a vigilante for the cause. Six years ago, a man walked into a local Unitarian Church with a gun hidden in a guitar case because he wanted to kill some liberals. He managed to kill three. That\u2019s why you never know.\n\nMy friend saw the woman approaching before I did so maybe she was better prepared than I was to stay calm. The woman was friendly as she invited us to explain why we were against the amendment, but the way she asked, it was not as if she really wanted to know. Her voice was silky with feigned cordiality but behind it was the cocksure certainty of people who know they\u2019re right and you\u2019re wrong because God is on their side. To my ears she did not sound interested in our opinions, only in baiting us. She was looking for an opportunity to win an argument. Does this suggest I might have been bracing for a fight?\n\nAs my friend began calmly explaining our reasons for opposing the amendment, I noticed the woman was holding some fliers, and I asked to see one. Essentially, the flier asserted that our poor state legislators were hamstrung by \u201cactivist\u201d judges who wouldn\u2019t let them enact \u201ccommon sense\u201d regulations on abortion, outlined in neat bullet points: a waiting period, informed consent, and then something about licensing clinics, but my eyes never got to the third bullet point because the instant I saw \u201cinformed consent,\u201d that beast inside me stirred. Wait a minute.\n\nBecause, like all code words, \u201cinformed consent\u201d does not mean what it says. It does not mean telling patients what they need to know about the procedure. Abortion providers in the state of Tennessee are required to be physicians with active hospital privileges and they already do that. They do that in the same way gastroenterologists inform patients about colonoscopies. Informed consent is what doctors do. Only in the context of abortion does \u201cinformed consent\u201d mean legally requiring physicians to read a script written by non-medically trained politicians telling patients all kinds of factually challenged scary stories designed to induce second thoughts. What got that beast so quickly stirring inside me was the audacity, the disingenuousness, the callous pretense written in black and white: The same people whose goal has always been to make abortion illegal were now claiming all they wanted was to make it safer? They were lying to get their way. (It is not inappropriate at this moment to ask why, oh why, at the age of 58, for Pete\u2019s sake, should I have been surprised.)\n\nInstead of patiently laying out the argument against the amendment, as my friend was doing, I began pointing to the flier, intending to refute with facts and reason each bullet point, except that something, my dumbfounded brain, my outraged tongue, that uninvited beast inside, took over. The women claimed I was screaming, as in, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to scream!\u201d\n\nBut yes, I did. I can scream all I want to! I will scream bloody murder if I want to, I will scream and scream and scream some more because you are trying to take away my rights!\n\nOr something like that. I can\u2019t remember exactly everything I said, although I won\u2019t deny my outburst may have included I don\u2019t give a damn what you think and many other things that might or might not have been prudent. Blinding rage is not conducive to prudence or a reliable memory. The more interesting question to me is not what I said, but why. What caused such a raging, overwhelming, immature, unapologetic, visceral and primal reaction? I say visceral and primal because I remember what it felt like to talk to that woman: It felt physically threatening. It felt like the emotional equivalent of being hauled off to a cell for a crime I did not commit.\n\nWhy?\n\n* * *\n\nI have lived all my life as a liberal in the South, which means I\u2019m a member of a minority in a place inhabited by people whose worldview is profoundly different from mine. I am not alone, of course. There are a great many of us, if you take by way of a loose measure the fact that in 2012 almost a million people voted for Barack Obama in Tennessee alone, but we tend to be wary. It is not uncommon when meeting a fellow liberal to hear something along the lines of, thank goodness I found you, I thought I was the only one. Many of us tend to keep our mouths shut in social or professional settings whenever politics or religion come up. Many of us would not dare write a letter to the editor of the newspaper, where it is not unusual to read letters arguing for the existence of God and the sanctity of the Confederate flag. The people we vote for generally don\u2019t win. We do put bumper stickers on our cars but we think about it first. Guns are everywhere, not that anyone\u2019s ever been shot over a bumper sticker that I know of. The fight to keep prayer out of the public schools has long been surrendered. You are not considered crazy if you think the president is the anti-Christ. You are not considered odd if you don\u2019t believe in evolution. Fox News is playing in most public waiting rooms. But more than any specific example, it\u2019s in the air, a subtle sense that this is a government hating, gun-loving, God-fearing, kind-of-racist, kind-of-sexist, kind-of-homophobic, big-car-driving, live-free-or-die kind of a place. Like any stereotype, exceptions abound, but like any stereotype, there is some truth to this one, and if you happen to be deeply conservative and deeply Christian, you will feel right at home here. It\u2019s a culture, it\u2019s a climate, it\u2019s a prevailing wind.\n\nSo as a liberal in the South, it\u2019s easy to feel like you don\u2019t have a voice. Nobody\u2019s listening: Why even try? It makes sense to stay in a bubble with people who think like you and grumble. In recent years I have often wondered if it\u2019s even possible anymore to sit down and talk with somebody from the other side. Have we grown so far apart in our politics and religious convictions, have we become so rigid in our opinions, have we swallowed the media\u2019s interpretations of each other to the point where \u2014 forget talking \u2014 it\u2019s hard even to be civil? Is there any common ground? Is compromise possible? Is it even desirable? How do we stop screaming? Or should we be screaming louder? I don\u2019t know. What does it mean to be a citizen of a country? What do we owe our fellow citizens? How hard is it to listen?\n\nWith that in mind, I went looking for somebody from the opposite side of the abortion argument willing to sit down with me to see if we could have a conversation, and that\u2019s how I found Sue.\n\n* * *\n\nHer name is not Sue, but I\u2019m not going to use her real name because she\u2019s a private person and it seems unnecessary and, frankly, cruel to expose her. For my purposes, what she said is more important than who she is, although whom she works for, the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, matters a great deal. She was introduced to me as someone who is \u201cpro-life,\u201d but just how extreme I had no idea until after our conversation when I looked it up. The Center for Bio-Ethical Reform is an antiabortion organization that likens abortion to the Nazi genocide and displays graphic images of aborted fetuses on college campuses and in other public places. To call her \u201cpro-life\u201d wasn\u2019t the half of it. But I found her, and she was willing to talk to me.\n\nSue is a thin, well-dressed, poised and attractive woman somewhere around her early 60s, so close to my age. Over coffee one morning at Panera Bread we structured our chat so she could explain her position while I listened without interrupting, then it would be my turn. At the time I saw some benefit to simply being heard by the other side rather than arguing over every single point. So Sue talked and I listened and did not interrupt, which you might think would have been hard, and it was in a way. In another way I was too stunned to speak.\n\nSue\u2019s core belief is that a fertilized egg, at the instant of conception, is exactly the same as a human being, so abortion is exactly the same as murder, and that means no exceptions. Not for rape, not for incest, not for anything except ectopic pregnancy.\n\n\u201cI know I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve talked to everyone in the whole wide world,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I haven\u2019t, but I\u2019ve talked to women who\u2019ve been raped and actually gotten pregnant. I think there\u2019s a misconception; not everybody who gets raped gets pregnant, and I\u2019m thankful for that, but there\u2019s a young lady who works for us who was raped at 19. She went to her pastor, and her pastor said, I think it\u2019s OK to have the abortion, and she did. Her testimony is: It was harder for me to get over the abortion than the rape because, in the rape, I was the victim, I was victimized. But in the abortion, I victimized \u2026 I don\u2019t think a woman has to parent a child, but I do think she needs to deliver the child. A baby doesn\u2019t come into this world with a big R on its forehead so that forever he\u2019s going to be known as a rape baby.\u201d Sue used similar anecdotal evidence to tell the story of a female victim of incest who apparently said she wanted to stay pregnant because \u201cthat was the only way anyone would believe what had happened to her.\u201d\n\nSue conceded she would allow abortion to save the life of a woman, but don\u2019t go looking for compassion in her narrow definition of what constitutes a threat. \u201cI\u2019m not a medical doctor,\u201d she said, \u201cbut this is what I have understood over the years. Her life [the woman\u2019s] is at risk early on if she has an ectopic pregnancy, and you remove the tube, which means you also remove the life. The life is too young to save. You\u2019re saving the mother. Later on, she can have toxemia, where the baby and she become incompatible. She could die, but at that point you still have two patients, so you do a C-section. You remove the baby, and usually by that time the baby is very viable, so the baby goes to the NICU [neonatal intensive care unit], where it\u2019s allowed to grow in that little incubator we\u2019ve got. You treat the baby, you treat the mother, and we all live happily ever after.\u201d\n\nSo, no exceptions. Also no birth control pills.\n\nBefore talking to Sue, I knew that many of the same people who oppose abortion also oppose birth control, but I never understood how that wasn\u2019t hypocritical since birth control is an awfully good way to prevent unwanted pregnancies and thereby reduce abortions. How can you be against abortion and birth control?\n\nThis is how. Sue does not accept the concept of an unwanted pregnancy. Somebody wants it, she said. The only person who doesn\u2019t is the mother.\n\nTo be fair, she said she was not opposed to the concept of birth control as long as it is not what she termed an \u201cabortifacient.\u201d In other words, if the birth control method prevents the sperm from reaching the egg, she\u2019s OK with that, but \u201cif the pregnancy happens, and it [the pill] ends the pregnancy, then I oppose that because it\u2019s the same thing as taking a life \u2026 I\u2019m not Catholic but I\u2019m a big proponent of natural family planning. I think people can do that real successfully.\u201d\n\nConsistent, rigid, utopian, extreme, honorable, cultish, cruel, honest, noble, tyrannical, simplistic, unhinged: However you want to categorize it, Sue\u2019s position holds that, regardless of the circumstances of a pregnancy, or the condition of a woman or of a fetus, or what a woman needs or wants or believes or can or cannot do, or whether there will be anyone at all who is remotely prepared to take care of an actual baby after it\u2019s born, or any one of the millions of individual stories and situations and predicaments and tragedies that people find themselves in at particular moments in their lives, there is only one uncompromising option. Don\u2019t mess with a fertilized egg.\n\nI suppose if she had stopped there I might have understood. I would have disagreed, but I would have understood. But she didn\u2019t stop there.\n\n* * *\n\nSue traced the origin of her own anti-choice activism to working for the pastor of a Baptist Church in a small town in Florida where she moved with her husband after two years of missionary work in Kenya. \u201cI worked part-time for the pastor and spent long hours just talking to him and letting him help me grow up some,\u201d she explained. (I stop here to mention how often in our conversation Sue used language suggesting that pro-choice advocates and women who seek abortions are immature, and if they would just grow up, they\u2019d see things her way.) \u201cDuring that time,\u201d she continued, \u201che [the pastor] showed a video to our church. It was a seven-part series by Francis Schaeffer, and it was called \u2018Whatever Happened to the Human Race.\u2019 I can still remember parts of that. He [Schaeffer] was such a prophet about what he foresaw was coming to America if we went down some of these roads, and one of them was abortion. I was so compelled by the things he said, things that he saw, things that he foresaw, and what he found in scripture \u2026 What he stressed were the effects on our society when we choose not to defend the most defenseless. I think he was dead on. I\u2019ve seen the increase in child abuse, I\u2019ve seen divorce, I\u2019ve seen the increase in sex trafficking, I\u2019ve seen the increase in violence against women, I\u2019ve seen the increase in school shootings and workplace shootings \u2026 Why would the student sitting in the classroom who knows they all could have been aborted, that they are all here just by happenchance, why would he not think, if he\u2019s having a bad day, that it\u2019s not OK to kill his classmates?\u201d\n\nWhy indeed.\n\nAll this havoc! And all because of legal abortion? Yes, according to Sue. No hint that things in this country were all hunky-dory until 1973 when Roe v. Wade had to go and mess everything up. No mention of how great life is in countries where abortion actually is illegal: Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Angola, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, Uganda, Afghanistan, Egypt, Iran, Libya, Syria, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka, to name a few. No evidence, whatsoever.\n\nShe has studies, she said.\n\nEverybody\u2019s got studies, I said, without mentioning, to take but one, the study Steven Levitt used in \u201cFreakonomics\u201d to suggest the drop in crime rates in the 1990s was due to the legalization of abortion in the 1970s, but I was tempted. You name it, you can find a study to prove it; has she ever watched cable news? If I claim school shootings are caused by fluoride in the water, and if I shout it loud enough and long enough and can get enough people to believe me, then who\u2019s to say it isn\u2019t true?\n\nSue\u2019s more potent and anecdotally supported scare tactic, and the one the pro-life movement nationwide seems to have embraced, is that abortion is bad for women. \u201cThere are risk factors [to abortion],\u201d she said, \u201cof ever being able to conceive again, a high rate of drug abuse and alcohol abuse, a high rate of divorce and unemployment because they [women who\u2019ve had abortions] can\u2019t keep a job, and the inability to connect with their next children. You know, I\u2019ve met too may women and talked to too may women to not think that this is a reality.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know where to start dismantling that argument except by lining up the women who\u2019ve had abortions and then, inconveniently, did not become addicts or unemployed or depressed or divorced, and who went on to lead productive, happy lives and to conceive and successfully raise healthy children. I don\u2019t know whether Sue has never met such women or if she ignores them or if she does not believe them, but again and again, she used language to suggest that women by nature are fragile, clueless, helpless, confused victims who are somehow \u201cpressured\u201d into having abortions by boyfriends and husbands and parents and Planned Parenthood. And not just abortions. Sex, too.\n\n\u201cSo I just have felt like over these years that abortion has become a way for girls to be promiscuous,\u201d she said, \u201cand not necessarily because they really want to be but because they think they have to be that independent woman on campus. And these guys who just whip out their posters saying, \u2018I love pro-choice': I know what they are saying. I love you because you are going to sleep with me, and then if you get pregnant we\u2019re going to take care of this, and we just have this vicious cycle of men abusing women for their own enjoyment. So I don\u2019t see any real positives from killing our offspring.\u201d\n\nI must concede: It\u2019s brilliant to equate antiabortion with being \u201cpro-women\u201d as if protecting women from themselves is somehow the same as feminism. As if protecting women from making personal decisions that you happen to disagree with has any place in a free society. It is exactly that kind of bait and switch they use to pretend that all they want with these mandated waiting periods and informed consent laws is to protect women, when the true goal is to shut down access to safe abortions. And for all her talk of helping women, Sue placed little value on the relationship between an actual woman and her uterus. Speaking in terms of how the mother \u201cmay have participated in the pregnancy\u201d (but doesn\u2019t have the right to end it), and using such terminology as a fetus being \u201choused\u201d in a woman\u2019s body, she made no distinction that I could hear between a uterus and a free-standing incubator.\n\nIf Sue is serious about protecting women from those selfish boyfriends and hard-hearted parents who might pressure them into abortions, and no doubt there are some, isn\u2019t it better for everyone if those abortions are kept legal and safe? But Sue\u2019s solution is to reverse Roe v. Wade and then, for citizens in states that don\u2019t end up criminalizing abortion, \u201ceducate them.\u201d She was less certain, or at least less willing to tell me, how criminalization would work, but for sure, she said, it would be \u201cthe abortionist or the medical doctor\u201d who would go to jail. She also laid out a vision of how, somehow, adoption and parenting classes would solve the problem for each and every woman who finds herself unwillingly pregnant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like us to work very seriously on making adoption affordable and easier,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like us to work on how many chances do parents get before they lose their parental rights. People need to be encouraged to adopt. There are churches doing a good job teaching their people about foster care and bringing foster care children into their homes \u2026 I don\u2019t want us to demonize that young woman who is in a crisis pregnancy. I don\u2019t want her to feel like she\u2019s done something wrong. I feel like the church should be at the forefront of this. We\u2019ve done a very poor job telling our girls we don\u2019t want you to have sex before marriage. But, if you do, we love you, and we\u2019re not tossing you out as a, you know, putting an A on your forehead and sending you out from us. We will come around and help you whether it be, you can live in my home, whether it be, I will find an adopter who is willing to help at no cost or little cost, or I\u2019ll take you for parenting classes. I just think there\u2019s so much for life that we as a nation can do, and I think if we are going to value that child from the moment of conception through natural death then it says to the child, I\u2019m valuable and the kid sitting next to me is valuable and therefore I\u2019m not going to shoot him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "I tried to have a civil conversation about abortion with someone who called herself \"pro-life.\" Here's how it went", "title": "A liberal in the South: I didn\u2019t mean to scream at that woman about abortion rights, but I was not in control", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "I tried to have a civil conversation about abortion with someone who called herself \"pro-life.\" Here's how it went", "title": "A liberal in the South: I didn\u2019t mean to scream at that woman about abortion rights, but I was not in control", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/22/a_liberal_in_the_south_i_didnt_mean_to_scream_at_that_woman_about_abortion_rights_but_i_was_not_in_control/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/abortion_protest_sides.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I tried to have a civil conversation about abortion with someone who called herself \"pro-life.\" Here's how it went", "title": "A liberal in the South: I didn\u2019t mean to scream at that woman about abortion rights, but I was not in control", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/abortion_protest_sides.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Catherine Landis", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, antiabortion, Editor's Picks, The South", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaedc\"", "article_summary": "And for all her talk of helping women, Sue placed little value on the relationship between an actual woman and her uterus.\nHowever, in a place where many people think abortion is murder, you never know if somebody might decide to become a vigilante for the cause.\nBut in the abortion, I victimized \u2026 I don\u2019t think a woman has to parent a child, but I do think she needs to deliver the child.\nI don\u2019t know.\nTopics: Abortion, antiabortion, Editor's Picks, The South, Life NewsI did not mean to scream."}
