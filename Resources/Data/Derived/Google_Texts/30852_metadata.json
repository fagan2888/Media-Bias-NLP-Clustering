But the Planned Parenthood abortion business thinks what is really disrespectful is pro-life Speaker Paul Ryan inviting them to attend Obama\u2019s State of the Union address.\n\nAs LifeNews reported, Ryan hosted the very Catholic nuns Obama is attempting to force to pay for abortion drugs under the HHS mandate.\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor are asking the nation\u2019s highest court to ensure they do not have to comply with Obamacare\u2019s abortion mandate. The mandate compels religious groups to pay for birth control and drugs that may cause abortions. Without relief, the Little Sisters would face millions of dollars in IRS fines because they cannot comply with the government\u2019s mandate that they give their employees free access to contraception, sterilization, and abortion-inducing drugs.\n\nSIGN THE NEW PLEDGE: I Pledge to Vote for a Pro-Life Candidate for President\n\nBut reminding President Obama how he is disrespecting the religious liberties of the Catholic nuns is apparently itself disrespectful. Here\u2019s how the abortion company sees it:\n\nNever missing an opportunity, @SteveKingIA & @SpeakerRyan used tonight\u2019s #SOTU address to send an anti-abortion message. The disrespect. \u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPact) January 13, 2016\n\nThe tweet also condemned pro-life Congressman Steve King for leaving his guest seat open to the 57 million unborn babies killed in abortion.\n\nAfter President Barack Obama made the symbolic political gesture of leaving an open seat at his State of the Union speech for victims of gun violence, a pro-life Congressman is responding with a gesture of his own. Congressman Steve King, an Iowa Republican, told LifeNews he would leave his gallery seat open for the 57 million babies who have been victimized by abortion in the United States since Roe v. Wade.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood Slams Speaker Ryan Inviting Catholic Nuns to SOTU. \"That's Disrespect\"", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "President Barack Obama is disrespecting the deeply-held religious views of the Little Sisters of the Poor by forcing them to pay for abortion-causing drugs unde", "title": "Planned Parenthood Slams Speaker Ryan Inviting Catholic Nuns to SOTU.
