Rick Scott in June signed a $78 billion budget into law. Nearly $500 million was vetoed, including money meant to go to a network of free clinics that provide health care for uninsured Floridians.\n\nIn a small room covered with posters for diabetes prevention and free eye clinics, and a physician\u2019s desk stacked with papers, Karen Cascone meets with her nurse practitioner.\n\nThe 58-year-old, who has a thyroid condition and high blood pressure, is following up from the previous week. She suspects her cholesterol is high.\n\n\u201cI quit smoking,\u201d Cascone tells Trudy Grossman, the nurse practitioner.\n\n\u201cCongratulations!\u201d\n\nBut, Cascone continues, \u201cI\u2019ve put on a little over 25 pounds, so I\u2019m sure my cholesterol has gone up a bit.\u201d\n\nThis kind of appointment \u2013 ones Cascone attends a few times a year to keep her conditions in check -- is critical to the St. Pete Beach resident, she said. But since she can't afford a nearly $500 monthly premium she would have to pay for insurance through HealthCare.gov, Cascone said she leans on the St. Petersburg Free Clinic for blood work and prescription refills.\n\n\"I can't afford that,\u201d Cascone said of insurance the Affordable Care Act created to make coverage more affordable. \u201cMy husband is on Social Security. I work, but only makes about $1,000 a month, so a $500 premium is a lot of money to me.\"\n\nThe St. Petersburg Free Clinic is one of 87 programs participating in the Florida Association of Free and Charitable Clinics. Last year, when the group received $4.5 million from the state budget, the clinics served 125,000 uninsured Floridians. The state money bought new equipment, expanded services and allowed some of the clinics to hire additional staff.\n\nThis year, clinic leaders said they expected double that amount. A total of $9.5 million passed both the House and Senate, for the fiscal year that started July 1. But Governor Rick Scott vetoed the line item a week before the budget went into effect.\n\nThe clinics got nothing.\n\nThe veto led to immediate cuts, said Mark Cruise, executive director of the Florida Free and Charitable Clinic Association.\n\n\"Because the veto happened a week before the fiscal year without an prior notice, many people had to be laid off,\u201d he said. \u201cSo finding the money to replace that loss of state money is not as easy task, and for some clinics, they'll never replace it.\u201d\n\nBefore 2014, the clinics had spent years stitching together a budget from various donors, churches, businesses and grants. They also partner with hospitals and drug companies for discounted services and in-kind donations.\n\nIn Miami-Dade County, the Good News Care Center gets help from Baptist Health South Florida and other organizations, but executive director Michael Daily said it's not enough.\n\n\"To receive funding from the state legislature is amazing,\u201d Daily said. \u201cIt's a tremendous thing because it represents a source of sustainability that we can depend on. It's also great that the state would come alongside us and partner with us and provide care for the people that otherwise provide a great strain on the health care system.\"\n\nBeth Houghton, executive director of the St. Petersburg Free Clinic, said like many other clinics, the first cuts affected patients with a common chronic disease: diabetes. Now, fewer insulin supplies and diabetes education classes are available.\n\nAnd Houghton said some patients will suffer.\n\n\"You have consequences like loss of sight, loss of limbs, circulatory problems, nerve pain, people not able to work,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition the cuts to diabetes programs, Houghton said the $200,000 cut to the St. Petersburg clinic canceled plans to buy an electronic medical records system and plans to expand dental services.\n\n\"All of those are real consequences of not being able to touch more patients,\u201d she said.\n\nStephanie Garris, executive director of Grace Medical Home in Orlando, said a third of her county is uninsured. Those patients often end up in the emergency room, and that costs the state money, she said.\n\n\u201cIt's not appropriate that the uninsured have to utilize the emergency room for primary care services,\u201d Garris said. \u201cThere are much more cost effective ways for patients to get care. And my clinic is an example of that.\"\n\nIn January 2016, members of the Florida Association of Free and Charitable Clinics will go before the Florida legislature to once again plead their case for funding. Until then, they're tightening their purse strings and hoping that private donors will step in to fill the gap left by the state.\n\n--Daylina Miller is a reporter with WUSF in Tampa.
