More than 300 U.S. nationals were part of the landmark terrorism trial that began last month in New York.\n\nSome Israelis refer to Arab Bank as the \u201cGrand Central Station of terrorist financing.\u201d The plaintiffs or their family members were injured or killed in terrorist attacks while visiting Israel between 2000 and 2005 during the second intifada or Palestinian uprising.\n\n>>> Arab Bank Accused of Helping Reward Hamas Suicide Bombers in Terrorism Case\n\nIn finding the bank guilty of violating anti-terrorism laws by providing material support to Hamas, jurors rejected Arab Bank\u2019s key defense that it had no way to know some of its clients were using its accounts to provide payoffs for terrorist acts.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that a dozen Middle Eastern charities with links to Hamas and other radical Islamic groups transferred $32 million to Arab Bank during the second intifada. They alleged that money then was paid out to families of suicide bombers and other Palestinians as rewards for acts of terrorism against Jews.\n\nFamilies of suicide bombers were entitled to a $5,300 payment.\n\n\u201cI said before this trial that there is nothing worse than people in suits who incentivize terrorism for profit. This bank is the worst,\u201d said Tab Turner, one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. \u201cThey deserve to be put out of business for what they did to these victims.\u201d\n\nIn a statement after the verdict, Arab Bank said it has \u201cvery strong grounds for appeal\u201d and that the trial \u201cwas infected by scores of errors.\u201d\n\nLandmark Terrorism Case\n\nIt\u2019s taken a decade for the case to make it to the trial stage.\n\nAmong the victims are New York attorney Mark Sokolow, his wife and two of his teenage daughters. They were shopping in Jerusalem in 2002 when Wafa Idris, the first female suicide bomber in the conflict, detonated a backpack bomb.\n\nBank documents showed a payment, through an account serviced by Arab Bank, to her surviving family. Also among the evidence was the confession of Abbas al-Sayed, the mastermind behind a Hamas suicide bombing at the Park Hotel in Netanya, Israel, in 2002 that killed 30 people and injured 140. Al-Sayed\u2019s signed confession stated that he bought weapons for the attack with money transferred to his private Arab Bank account.\n\n>>> Arab Bank Mounts Its Defense in Landmark Terrorist Financing Case\n\nThe federal judge presiding over the case instructed the jury that, to prevail, the plaintiffs had to prove that the business the bank conducted with Hamas-linked clients was the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of the terrorist attacks involved, and that the bank should have reasonably foreseen the potential for injury. In each of the 24 attacks at issue, the jurors agreed that it was.\n\nArab Bank: \u2018A Show Trial\u2019\n\nAfter the verdict, Arab Bank called the trial \u201cnothing more than a show trial.\u201d It accused the court of eliminating its defenses, permitting weeks of inadmissible and inflammatory testimony and rejecting the Supreme Court\u2019s causation standard.\n\nIn Arab Bank\u2019s view, it was found liable for \u201clegitimate and routine financial services.\u201d\n\nBank documents introduced by the plaintiffs into evidence revealed an intricate network that rewarded terrorist acts through use of Arab Bank accounts.\n\n\u201cThe trial was infected by scores of errors,\u201d Arab Bank said of the guilty verdict.\n\nIn addition to other charities, the Saudi Committee for the Support of the Intifada al Quds sent nearly $100 million through Arab Bank. Plaintiffs alleged that an estimated $32 million of that was distributed as cash payments to \u201cmartyrs\u201d and their families, including the families of suicide bombers; the rest was distributed to other Hamas-controlled charities.\n\nFamilies of suicide bombers were entitled to a $5,300 payment, wounded \u201cmartyrs\u201d received $2,655 and the families of jailed \u201cmartyrs\u201d received a payment of $1,325.\n\n>>> Paycheck for Terrorism: $5,300 for Suicide Attack\n\nDuring the trial, terrorism financing expert Juan Zarate, author of \u201cTreasury\u2019s War,\u201d told The Daily Signal that a loss for Arab Bank \u201ccould trigger further political, regulatory, and enforcement scrutiny from U.S. authorities.\u201d\n\nSeveral top banks contacted prior to the verdict declined comment on the impact a guilty verdict would have on their relationships with Arab Bank.\n\nThe issue of damages \u2014 how much the bank will have to pay the victims \u2014 will be decided during a separate court proceeding.\n\n\u201cThe trial was infected by scores of errors, and the bank has very strong grounds for appeal,\u201d an Arab Bank spokesman said in a prepared statement. \u201cIt will seek prompt review by the Second Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals].\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a unanimous verdict, a federal jury agreed that Arab Bank violated U.S. anti-terrorism laws in conducting business with Hamas-linked \u201ccharities.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In a unanimous verdict, a federal jury agreed that Arab Bank violated U.S. anti-terrorism laws in conducting business with Hamas-linked \u201ccharities.\u201d", "title": "U.S. Terrorism Victims Win Landmark Case Against Arab Bank", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140922_Hamas.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-22T11:54:41+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/ZEo1AK"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In a unanimous verdict, a federal jury agreed that Arab Bank violated U.S. anti-terrorism laws in conducting business with Hamas-linked \u201ccharities.\u201d", "title": "U.S. Terrorism Victims Win Landmark Case Against Arab Bank", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140922_Hamas.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2014-09-22T23:12:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-22T11:54:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "arab bank, terrorism, hamas, suicide bombers, israel, palestinians, west bank, gaza, Saudi Committee for the Support of the Intifada al-Quds, middle east"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd708\"", "article_summary": "Bank documents showed a payment, through an account serviced by Arab Bank, to her surviving family.\nMore than 300 U.S. nationals were part of the landmark terrorism trial that began last month in New York.\nAl-Sayed\u2019s signed confession stated that he bought weapons for the attack with money transferred to his private Arab Bank account.\nIn addition to other charities, the Saudi Committee for the Support of the Intifada al Quds sent nearly $100 million through Arab Bank.\nArab Bank: \u2018A Show Trial\u2019After the verdict, Arab Bank called the trial \u201cnothing more than a show trial.\u201d It accused the court of eliminating its defenses, permitting weeks of inadmissible and inflammatory testimony and rejecting the Supreme Court\u2019s causation standard."}
