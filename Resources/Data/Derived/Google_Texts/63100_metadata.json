It was Jamie, calling from \u2014 was it Uganda that time? Rwanda?\n\n\u201cIt was somewhere in Africa, the one time I didn\u2019t go with him, and he calls me in the middle of the night to say he\u2019s on a bus in the middle of an infectious-disease zone, and the bus just slid off the road,\u201d said Birch, executive director of Colorado\u2019s health care policy and financing department.\n\n\u201cHe woke me up to say, \u2018Here are our coordinates; can you call the Centers for Disease Control to see what we should do? We have all these people on the bus, and they\u2019re exhausted and cranky.\u2019 So I had to call the CDC, and then call Jamie back and tell him, \u2018Keep everyone on the bus! Don\u2019t get off! Don\u2019t touch anything!\u2019 He\u2019s always out there, on the edge of doing great things, and I\u2019m the one he calls. And I can never say no, because he\u2019s always dead-on with the assessment of a problem that needs attending.\u201d\n\nBirch and other friends of Van Leeuwen, Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s senior policy adviser, coined a verb for this sort of thing. They call it \u201cgetting Van Leeuwened.\u201d\n\nTall, with a swath of red-blond hair and a high-wattage smile, Van Leeuwen, 40, is the son of two Denver educators. A 2013 Fulbright scholar, he graduated in 1996 from Tulane University and has two master\u2019s degrees, plus a Ph.D. in public policy from the University of Colorado at Denver.\n\nIn 2006, the Denver Business Journal named him in its \u201cForty Under 40 to Watch,\u201d and in 2011, Out Front magazine named him a leader in the gay and lesbian community.\n\nHe began drawing national attention shortly after Roxanne White, then president of Urban Peak, recruited him to lead the agency\u2019s street outreach program for homeless youths.\n\nIn 2003, his interest in what he calls \u201cinnovating interventions\u201d led him and White to establish non-clinic-based services to research and test for intravenous drug use and sexually transmitted disease as part of Van Leeuwen\u2019s doctoral dissertation.\n\n\u201cI met Jamie when he was still with Urban Peak, and I just saw this remarkable young man who was filled with optimism about solving the problems of the world,\u201d said Sage Hospitality CEO Walter Isenberg.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just his youth. Optimism is in his DNA. Jamie will do just about anything to help a philanthropic cause.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, then-Denver Mayor Hickenlooper appointed Van Leeuwen as executive director of Denver\u2019s Road Home, part of the mayor\u2019s Ten Year Plan to End Homelessness.\n\nVan Leeuwen seems to live his life at a dead sprint between tightly scheduled policy meetings and ambitious events. He sleeps only three or four hours a night. The rest of his waking hours are divided between his work for the governor\u2019s office, his leadership retreat in Uganda, and training for marathons: He\u2019s run the New York City marathon twice.\n\nThrough Denver\u2019s Road Home, he helped organize Project Homeless Connect, an annual jobs and services fair where homeless families get medical evaluations, haircuts, prospects for affordable housing, job leads, meals and other services. Van Leeuwen waded in there with the other volunteers, wearing a giant grin and an extra-large Project Homeless Connect Volunteer T-shirt over his button-down shirt.\n\nThis was not how he envisioned himself when he was a pre-med student at Creighton University. Back then, Van Leeuwen aimed to be a \u201cfabulously wealthy surgeon.\u201d\n\nBut his Creighton mentor, Gilles Monif, suggested he get a master\u2019s degree in public health before he applied to medical schools. That\u2019s how Van Leeuwen ended up at Tulane University, where his project on DNA testing for malaria took him to Ghana.\n\n\u201cIt was humbling,\u201d Van Leeuwen said. It was the first time he grasped how closely social policy problems are interwoven with poverty. He dropped his medical ambitions in favor of public policy.\n\n\u201cI tell people, \u2018Hey, by not becoming a surgeon, I actually saved many lives.\u2019 \u201c\n\nIn 2009, after winning a Livingston Fellowship along with longtime friend Sue Birch, Van Leeuwen founded the Global Livingston Institute, which grew out of his work with Come Let\u2019s Dance, a Ugandan non-government organization that helped students working in Kampala\u2019s slums. Through the Global Livingston Institute, Van Leeuwen has supervised the building of a retreat in rural Uganda that hosts student and community leadership workshops, and trips through Uganda and Rwanda.\n\n\u201cJamie is a very large flame, and he\u2019s got courage like you can\u2019t believe,\u201d Birch said.\n\n\u201cOnce, I was in Africa with him, and we were crossing the Nile on this ferry boat that was just a sheet of metal. The clouds were building, and I was thinking we shouldn\u2019t get on this boat\u2026. Jamie looks at me and says, \u2018Birch, you keep everyone alive.\u2019 I was thinking that we were all going to go down and the crocodiles are going to eat us. And here is Jamie, singing \u2018Row, Row, Row Your Boat\u2019 in the rain.\u201d\n\nClaire Martin: 303-954-1477, cmartin@denverpost.com or twitter.com/byclairemartin\n\nJamie Van Leeuwen\n\nThe man who helped galvanize Urban Peak\u2019s work with homeless youth and led Denver\u2019s Road Home now helps shape policy and develop leaders in Colorado and Africa.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jamie Van Leeuwen helps with policy change in Colorado and Africa", "title": "Jamie Van Leeuwen helps with policy change in Colorado and Africa", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/26/jamie-van-leeuwen-helps-with-policy-change-in-colorado-and-africa/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141126__20141127_C1_FE20STVANLEEUWENp1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141126__20141127_C1_FE20STVANLEEUWENp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-26T16:10:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:14:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd249\"", "article_summary": "When Sue Birch describes Jamie Van Leeuwen as \u201ca force of nature, like hurricanes and cyclones,\u201d she\u2019s not exaggerating.\nThey call it \u201cgetting Van Leeuwened.\u201dTall, with a swath of red-blond hair and a high-wattage smile, Van Leeuwen, 40, is the son of two Denver educators.\nVan Leeuwen seems to live his life at a dead sprint between tightly scheduled policy meetings and ambitious events.\nThat\u2019s how Van Leeuwen ended up at Tulane University, where his project on DNA testing for malaria took him to Ghana.\n\u201cIt was humbling,\u201d Van Leeuwen said."}
