The U.S. Treasury Department recently made billions of dollars in payments to insurance companies without the approval of Congress.

On February 3rd, Congressman Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, sent a letter to Secretary of the Treasury, Jack Lew, asking why the Center for Medicare and Medicaid made $2.7 billion in payments to insurance companies that compensate them for the “cost-sharing subsides” outlined in the Affordable Care Act.

The point of contention is that Congress, specifically the Ways and Means Committee, never approved the payments to be made; a provision that must be followed according to The Constitution:

“Congress has never appropriated any funds to permit the administration to make any Section 1402 Offset Program payments to insurance companies.”

To make “free” healthcare possible, Obamacare forces insurers to cap their costs, including co-payments and deductibles, for certain low-income people. In exchange, insurance companies that eat some of those costs, will receive compensation from the government.

Secretary Lew’s answer to Ryan’s inquiry referred the Congressman to a lawsuit carried out by Speaker John Boehner, on behalf of the entire House, last November:

“As you know, The House of Representatives has filed a lawsuit against the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Health and Human Services asking the court to end these cost sharing reduction payments. Your letters relate to matters that are the subject of the House lawsuit. For matters raised in this litigation, we refer you to the Department of Justice.”

The Department of Justice disagrees with Boehner, according to the Washington Examiner:

“In a brief filed on Jan. 26, DOJ lawyers wrote that the Boehner lawsuit was incorrect in saying that the payments required annual appropriation. ‘The cost sharing reduction payments are being made as part of a mandatory payment program that Congress has fully appropriated’ the brief read.”

Rick Moran at American Thinker believes the Department of Justice has a fundamental misunderstanding of how programs like this are funded:
