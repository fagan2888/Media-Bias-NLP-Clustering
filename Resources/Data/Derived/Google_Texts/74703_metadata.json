Ronald Rabin (R-Lee, Harnett, Johnston) said the legislature was busy working toward a finalized budget, but that he was uncertain how it would affect teacher\u2019s assistants. \u201cTeacher\u2019s assistants perform a valuable function,\u201d Rabin, who voted for the Senate\u2019s proposed budget, told the Herald on Saturday. \u201cEveryone\u2019s aware of that. The fact is we can\u2019t afford everything everybody wants. We have a balanced budget mandate by law, and we have a finite number of revenues to spread across that.\u201d Rep. Brad Salmon (D-Lee, Harnett) and Rep. Robert Reives II (D- Lee, Chatham) didn\u2019t respond to calls for comment, but both voted for the House\u2019s proposed budget. Lee County Schools Superintendent Andy Bryan maintained that teacher\u2019s assistants provided a valuable function in kindergarten, first-, second- and third-grade classrooms. \u201cOur board has taken the stance that they want to protect the classroom,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cWe see teacher\u2019s assistants as a very important part of making sure our classrooms are served well and are successful for our students.\u201d Lynn Smith, chairman of the Lee County Board of Education, agreed, adding that the Senate\u2019s proposal to reduce class sizes to ease the burden on elementary teachers would not be enough to serve students. \u201cI know there\u2019s been a conversation about putting money back in the budget to reduce classroom size,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut the fact is that not having someone in there for grades K-3 really makes it difficult for teachers to meet all the diverse needs of the kids that they\u2019re serving.\u201d Smith also pointed out that many teacher\u2019s assistants, like Womble, served as bus drivers as well. \u201cIf we lose teacher\u2019s assistants, I guess you\u2019d have to go out and hire part-time employees to drive the buses,\u201d Smith said. \u201cGoodness, I don\u2019t know how we\u2019d deal if we lose our bus drivers.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the NC Association of Teacher Assistants, Aim Higher Now, along with dozens of parents and educators will speak out against the North Carolina Senate\u2019s plan to slash 8,500 teacher assistant jobs.\n\nThe group is hoping to have an impact on the budget discussions before lawmakers adjourn for a week-long summer recess.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cTeacher\u2019s assistants perform a valuable function,\u201d Rabin, who voted for the Senate\u2019s proposed budget, told the Herald on Saturday.\n\u201cIf we lose teacher\u2019s assistants, I guess you\u2019d have to go out and hire part-time employees to drive the buses,\u201d Smith said.\nLee County Schools Superintendent Andy Bryan maintained that teacher\u2019s assistants provided a valuable function in kindergarten, first-, second- and third-grade classrooms.\nOne issue that educators are watching closely is how lawmakers will fund teaching assistants in the final spending bill.\nThe group is hoping to have an impact on the budget discussions before lawmakers adjourn for a week-long summer recess."}
