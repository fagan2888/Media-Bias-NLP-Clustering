It was only six months into Sherman D. Baskerville Jr.’s two-year probation sentence for aggravated assault when he was arrested again for assaulting a woman and a child, according to court documents.

Baskerville of Gary Drive, Neptune, threatened a woman and said, “I will kill you before I go away (to jail) again,” according to the domestic violence criminal complaint filed June 17 by Tinton Falls Police Corporal Chris Grimm charging him with a threat to kill and aggravated assault.

Baskerville was sentenced in January to two years probation for an aggravated assault conviction by state Superior Court Judge John T. Mullaney Jr. in Freehold, court records show.

After threatening to kill the woman, Baskerville turned his attention on the 13-year-old boy, police said. The boy was cut on the back of the neck, then Baskerville beat the boy, causing facial swelling on his eye and scratches on the boy’s chest, police said. Finally, Baskerville, according to the complaint, held the boy’s “face under a running bath tub faucet.”

He was issued $30,000 bail and was released after posting.

The Asbury Park Press asked Tinton Falls Police for a photo of the Baskerville, but they did not respond to the request. State law allows authorities discretion in releasing suspect photos, but they often refuse to do so, saying they are prohibited by the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office.
