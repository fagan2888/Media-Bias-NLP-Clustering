Lisa Murkowski says she is a \u201csupporter of Planned Parenthood,\u201d and that she thinks none of the federal taxpayer dollars that the nation\u2019s largest provider of abortions receives actually go toward abortions.\n\nMurkowski is one of four Republican senators whose votes will be key in the defunding of Planned Parenthood that is included in the House budget package. The measure is expected to be voted on under the rules of reconciliation, a budgetary process whereby no filibuster in the Senate is permitted, but Republicans will need the required 51 votes to approve the package.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe moderate Republican senator from Alaska told local NBC affiliate KTUU about her prior vote against the defunding of Planned Parenthood. \u201cI did not believe and I do not believe that Planned Parenthood should be defunded.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Murkowski admits the videos produced by the Center for Medical Progress are disturbing and suggestive of illegal activity.\n\nShe said:\n\nWhat I was concerned about and remain concerned about was that Planned Parenthood, through some of its affiliates, may have been engaged in illegal activity when it came to the collection of fetal tissue. We don\u2019t know yet if illegal activity was conducted. The head of Planned Parenthood has come before congressional committees and said there was none. I would like an independent investigation of that. Because if there was illegal activity it not only needs to be stopped, it needs to be punished, because that\u2019s a violation of the law and there needs to be consequences for it.\n\nSeveral congressional committees are investigating Planned Parenthood in the wake of the release of videos exposing the organization\u2019s apparent practice of harvesting the body parts of unborn babies for sale on the open market. The Obama administration\u2019s Department of Justice has not agreed to an investigation into Planned Parenthood\u2019s activities, and, in fact, has been supportive of the abortion business in its lawsuits against states that have attempted to eliminate the organization\u2019s Medicaid funding.\n\nMurkowski said she and two other GOP Planned Parenthood supporters \u2013 Sen. Susan Collins and Sen. Mark Kirk \u2013 joined together in an amendment requiring another investigation into the organization\u2019s activities, but it was defeated.\n\nThe next vote on the defunding of Planned Parenthood, however, is tied to must-pass legislation \u2013 the House budget package. Additionally, the budget measure provides for federal funds to be redirected from Planned Parenthood to thousands of other federally qualified health care centers that do not perform abortions.\n\nThis is \u201ca full, complete defund everything so that the men and women across this country and here in Alaska who receive many of the benefits, whether it\u2019s sexually transmitted disease screening, or any level of screenings, or birth control, that would be lopped off immediately,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cI said \u2018we should not be shutting down the government over Planned Parenthood or for other reasons. We should not be shutting down the government. We did that in 2013.\u2019 I believe it was a horrible mistake.\u201d\n\nThe House budget legislation package also includes a gutting of Obamacare \u2013 a repeal of the individual mandate, the employee mandate, the medical device excise tax, the tax on employee health insurance premiums and health plan benefits and related reporting requirements, and the Independent Payment Advisory Board \u2013 also known as the \u201cdeath panel.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the House budget panel includes both the defunding of Planned Parenthood and a repeal of Obamacare presents a dilemma for the GOP senators who have vowed to repeal Obamacare but support the abortion business.\n\n\u201cI have not supported the defunding [of Planned Parenthood],\u201d Murkowski told The Hill recently. \u201cI\u2019ve supported the repeal of ObamaCare. I\u2019ve got to look at it as a whole.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican Sen.
