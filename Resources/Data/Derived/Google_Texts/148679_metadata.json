America now has a government that views work as a trap and celebrates those who escape it.\n\nThat is the upshot of last week\u2019s remarkable exchange over ObamaCare. It began when the head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported that the interplay of taxes and subsidies in the law \u201ccreates a disincentive for people to work.\u201d The report predicted the mix would lead to fewer hours worked, costing the equivalent of nearly 2.5 million jobs.\n\nIn response, President Obama\u2019s spokesman pleaded guilty \u2014 with pride and pleasure.\n\n\u201cOpportunity created by affordable, quality health insurance allows families in America to make a decision about how they will work, or if they will work,\u201d Jay Carney said. Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi applauded the law for freeing people from \u201cjob-lock.\u201d\n\nThey never mentioned the implications of this distinctly Obama-ish New Deal. The subsidies that enable some Americans to decide \u201cif they will work\u201d mean higher taxes from those who must or want to work.\n\nRepublicans immediately jumped on the finding as proof that the law is a jobs killer and cited earlier discoveries about its destructive impact. These include Obama\u2019s lie that \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d and the fact that many new insurance plans come with higher premiums and \u00addeductibles and fewer doctors.\n\nPay more, get less will be the experience for tens of millions by the time the law is fully implemented. And don\u2019t forget its \u00adassault on religious freedom.\n\nAll true and yet, as Carney\u2019s defense showed, something much, much larger is at play. The impacts are symptoms. The disease is that leading Democrats view fewer workers and more dependency as a good thing. That attitude largely explains slow economic growth, record-low labor rates and the explosion of handouts over the last five years.\n\nThis anti-job, pro-dependency tilt is the crux of the nation\u2019s polarization. In essence, it pits those who believe in the sanctity of work against those who believe in penalizing wealth and redistributing its fruits.\n\nNot all Democrats agree with that approach, but the party is now controlled by those who do. It is the party that celebrates subsidies and rewards states for getting more people on food stamps. It opens the door wider for disability payments and fights for unemployment benefits like it once fought for jobs. It does these things not because of an emergency but because of a warped ideology.\n\nAs such, it has broken with the heritage celebrated on the postage stamps and in the hearts and minds of generations. In that America, work, any work, was honorable while being on the dole was cause for shame. Still is.\n\nYes, work itself has changed and many manufacturing and factory jobs have disappeared. Yet the most troubling change has nothing to do with the kind of work and everything to do with attitudes and values about work.\n\nThe stigma attached to getting something for nothing is being replaced by an endless demand for more free stuff. One party is stoking that demand as it moves from being the working-class party to the entitlement party.\n\nThat revelation counts as the silver lining of ObamaCare. We now have it straight from the White House and Congress that creating jobs is not really their goal. Instead, the president\u2019s singular piece of legislation is a success because it helps people get healthcare while avoiding work.\n\nThat is the Obama legacy. It should be celebrated with postage stamps featuring couch potatoes dozing in front of televisions.\n\nTeachers ploy is rotten to core\n\nRemember that big fight last year over teacher evaluations? Remember how the failure of City Hall and the union to agree cost the city $250 million in state aid and led Albany to impose its plan?\n\nNever mind. Forget the fight, forget the details, forget talk of a new era of standards that would lead to better teachers and better student performance.\n\nThe revolution has been canceled. The teachers are turning back the clock to zero all across the state.\n\nUnder the cover of complaints from politicians, parents and others about the impact of Common Core on test results, city and state unions are close to winning a moratorium on evaluations.\n\nClever, they are. Honest, not so much.\n\nThe public\u2019s criticism of Common Core is real, but the unions\u2019 use of it is as phony as a $3 bill. Although city boss Michael Mulgrew echoed then-Mayor Bloomberg in hailing the settlement, the union never gave up the fight. It sees evaluations, based in part on student performance, as a trap to separate good teachers from bad.\n\nThey can\u2019t have that. According to the union, there is no such thing as a bad teacher, only unfair standards.\n\nTheirs is a mighty voice and already the Legislature is leaning toward a moratorium. Gov. Cuomo says the move is premature, and he\u2019s right, but he\u2019s not happy with the roll-out, either. He bought time by naming a panel to make recommendations, but he\u2019s not devoted to the patron saint of lost causes. A moratorium is coming.\n\nThat will make the unions winners and students and taxpayers losers. What else is new?\n\nPlayed like a cheap fiddle\n\nThat\u2019s quite a scandal involving famed Japanese composer Mamoru Samuragochi. It turns out he didn\u2019t write the classical songs that made him famous, and he\u2019s not deaf, either.\n\nThe public is furious and so are the newspapers that unknowingly hyped the fraud. The editor of Asahi Shimbun wrote that \u201cwe want him to explain his behavior\u201d but added, \u201cThe media must also consider our tendency to fall for tearjerking stories.\u201d\n\nSelf-criticism is so Japanese, and so un-American.\n\nBlasio slaps Biden\u2019s yap\n\nProps to Mayor de Blasio \u2014 he\u2019s the first Democrat to tell Joe Biden to stuff it. The vice president routinely gets away with saying stupid things, but his comment that La Guardia Airport belongs in \u201ca Third World country\u201d was \u201cinappropriate,\u201d de Blasio said.\n\nConceding the airport \u201cneeds an upgrade,\u201d the mayor said, \u201cAs a proud New Yorker, I didn\u2019t like that comment, and I think it was not the right way to talk about it.\u201d\n\nBravo.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Among its many stamps, the Postal Service has a series called \u201cMade in America, Building a Nation.\u201d The strip of \u201cforever\u201d stamps is a collection of iconic photographs of 20th-century industry", "title": "Obama Democrats\u2019 troubling view on work", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/obama9.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@mgoodwin_nypost", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-2880217\"}", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,democrats,obamacare,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-09 01:34:47", "sailthru.title": "Obama Democrats\u2019 troubling view on\u00a0work", "nypost-section": "News", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/obama9.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "Among its many stamps, the Postal Service has a series called \u201cMade in America, Building a Nation.\u201d The strip of \u201cforever\u201d stamps is a collection of iconic photographs of 20th-century industry featuring men and women toiling on railroads, skyscrapers and factory floors.\r\n\r\nA celebration of work and workers, the series quotes Helen Keller saying, \u201cThe world is moved along, not only by the mighty shoves of its heroes, but also by the aggregate of the tiny pushes of each honest worker.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy, oh, my, how times have changed.
