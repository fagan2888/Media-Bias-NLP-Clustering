Palestinians seek to establish a state in those areas and fear that settlements, which most countries view as illegal and an obstacle to peacemaking, will deny them a viable country.\n\nMore than 500,000 Israeli settlers live among 2.4 million Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. In 2005, Israel pulled its troops and settlers out the Gaza Strip, now controlled by Hamas Islamists opposed to the U.S.-brokered peace efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Allyn Fisher-Ilan; Editing by Jeffrey Heller and Steve Orlofsky)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will insist that Jewish settlers in the West Bank have a right to remain under Palestinian rule in any future peace deal, a government official was quoted as saying on Sunday.", "title": "Netanyahu would let Israeli settlers live in future Palestine: report", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140126&t=2&i=832853514&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA0P1R3E00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
