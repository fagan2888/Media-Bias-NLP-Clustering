Cory Booker, D-N.J.\n\nThe U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with nearly one-third of Americans carrying an arrest record. The result is a steep financial burden on all levels of government, hitting communities with excessive price tags to incarcerate criminals for sentences disproportionate to their crimes.\n\n\u201cThe financial costs of oversentencing are significant,\u201d said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. \u201cThey are, however, far less significant than the human cost.\u201d\n\nCurrently, 2.2 million people are in U.S. prisons or jails, a 500 percent increase over the past 30 years, according to the Edward M. Kennedy Institute, the group hosting Tuesday\u2019s panel.\n\nIn addition, a disparate number of African-American and Hispanic men are locked up for nonviolent drug crimes\u2014more than 60 percent of those currently incarcerated are ethnic minorities.\n\n\u201cWhen I walk past the Supreme Court, and see those words \u2018equal justice under law,\u2019 I know in my heart we\u2019re just not living up to those words,\u201d Booker said.\n\nHe added the U.S.\u2019s failure to reform the criminal justice system \u201ccasts a long shadow over the soul\u201d of America.\n\nMomentum to reform the U.S. criminal justice system has been building over the last few years, as a bipartisan coalition in Congress is banding together to push forward with legislation that would relax sentencing policies put in place in the 1980s by politicians wanting to be tough on crime.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee is finalizing two bills that would reform the system. Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who both sat on Tuesday\u2019s panel, drafted legislation that would reduce sentences for nonviolent offenders who take part in programs such as rehabilitation and job training.\n\nCornyn said the programs would give criminals an alternative to a \u201clife of crime,\u201d which would lead to a reduction in repeat offenders.\n\n\u201cEventually the people who go to jail or our prisons get out. The question is, are they going to acquire the skills they need in order to become productive members of our society?\u201d he said.\n\nLee and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., are pushing a sentencing reform package that would reduce minimum mandatory sentences in specific nonviolent drug cases. Lee and Cornyn said they hope to bridge the two bills into one once final revisions are made in committee.\n\n\u201cThis is not about pampering. This is about making sure that when we devote scarce resources that we have within our government to fighting crime, we want to make sure it\u2019s actually doing that,\u201d Lee said.\n\nCornyn said it is very likely a final package could be sent to President Obama\u2019s desk for a signature this year.\n\nThe president is already promoting the issue on his own, using this week to call for an overhaul of the criminal justice system.\n\nHe commuted the prison sentences of 46 drug offenders Monday and focused his speech before the NAACP\u2019s annual convention in Philadelphia Tuesday on the need for reform.\n\nHe is also traveling to a federal prison in Oklahoma Thursday to further highlight a need for reform, becoming the first sitting president to make such a visit.\n\n\u201cOur criminal justice system isn\u2019t as smart as it should be. It\u2019s not keeping us as safe as we should be. It is not as fair as it should be,\u201d Obama said before the NAACP. \u201cMass incarceration makes our country worse off and we need to do something about it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senators from both sides of the aisle sat together during a panel to discuss growing bipartisan momentum to overhaul the nation\u2019s criminal justice system.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senators from both sides of the aisle sat together during a panel to discuss growing bipartisan momentum to overhaul the nation\u2019s criminal justice system.", "title": "Senators, Obama Unite on Push for Criminal Justice Reform", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150714_Crim.JusticeReform_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-15T13:23:28+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1V0ASpb"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senators from both sides of the aisle sat together during a panel to discuss growing bipartisan momentum to overhaul the nation\u2019s criminal justice system.", "title": "Senators, Obama Unite on Push for Criminal Justice Reform", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150714_Crim.JusticeReform_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-07-14T21:21:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-15T13:23:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "criminal justice reform, Mike Lee, John Cornyn, Sheldon Whitehouse, Cory Booker, prison overcrowding, President Obama, NAACP"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcafa9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cCriminal justice reform is not just a policy urgency, for many communities it is a matter of life and death,\u201d said Sen.
