Rates for Blue Cross and Blue Shield New Mexico customers will not go up by more than 50 percent in 2016.

The Office of the Superintendent of Insurance denied the company's 51.6 percent rate increase request last week.

But Blue Cross Blue Shield told the Albuquerque Business First they might leave the New Mexico Health Exchange.

The insurance company says it isn't able to offer sustainable rates without increasing premiums. They serve about 35,000 New Mexicans.
