Organizer Cindy Schrock started the Queen City Race for Life and Street Strut five years ago in honor of her sister, who battled breast cancer and lost that battle almost two years ago.\n\n\"It's just been overwhelming, the support that we've had,\" Schrock says. \"I never dreamed that it would just continue this long. But I am very blessed and I took a leap of faith five years ago and it just keeps growing each year.\"\n\nThere was also the annual Queen City Street Strut, which is an umbrella decorating contest that honors breast cancer survivors. Proceeds from Saturday's events will go the American Cancer Society and the local cancer benevolence fund.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Walkers and runners filled the streets of downtown Meridian on Saturday morning.", "language": "english", "og": {"description": "Walkers and runners filled the streets of downtown Meridian on Saturday morning.", "title": "Large Participation in Queen City Race for Life and Street Strut", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Large-Participation-in-Queen-City-Race-for-Life-and-Street-Strut--278144191.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/D89/FC3/D89FC3798AD74268AAFA9F263A6475BF", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/52C/327/52C327DA2CBA42F584700B2D2E48F5E7.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Walkers and runners filled the streets of downtown Meridian on Saturday morning.", "title": "Large Participation in Queen City Race for Life and Street Strut", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Large-Participation-in-Queen-City-Race-for-Life-and-Street-Strut--278144191.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Queen+City+Race+for+Life+Street+Strut+2014.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Large Participation in Queen City Race for Life and Street Strut", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Large Participation in Queen City, Race for Life and Street"}, "article_summary": "There was also the annual Queen City Street Strut, which is an umbrella decorating contest that honors breast cancer survivors.\nOrganizer Cindy Schrock started the Queen City Race for Life and Street Strut five years ago in honor of her sister, who battled breast cancer and lost that battle almost two years ago.\nThe cool start to the day made for a perfect run and walk to raise money for breast cancer awareness.\nWalkers and runners filled the streets of downtown Meridian on Saturday morning for a 5K run and walk, 1-mile fun run, and the infamous high heel dash.\nProceeds from Saturday's events will go the American Cancer Society and the local cancer benevolence fund."}
