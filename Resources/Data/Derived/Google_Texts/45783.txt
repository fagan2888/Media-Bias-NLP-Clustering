The American population is getting heavier. From the 1960s to the present, obesity has almost tripled. In fact, experts predict that if current trends continue unchanged, by 2030 more than half of the U.S. adult population will be obese, according to research published in the medical journal The Lancet. These same experts expect skyrocketing obesity to be accompanied by an increase in diabetes and its related comorbidities. The obesity trend can only lead to poorer health for the U.S. population and higher costs for the healthcare industry.

It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the federal government is taking steps to nip obesity in the bud. An update to the Affordable Care Act requires health plans to cover a new preventive service as of this January: Regular nutritional counseling for millions of overweight Americans with other health risks. Specifically, a recommendation by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which the ACA mandates must be adopted by private health insurers, requires them to provide no-cost coverage of nutrition counseling for Americans who are overweight and have at least one cardiovascular risk factor. According to statistics from the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 50% of American adults fall into this risk category and so will need to see a dietitian, with self-insured employers picking up the tab.
