It was her first race back and her 18th World Cup win, secured despite deteriorating course conditions and poor visibility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a good comeback day,\u201d said Shiffrin, 20. \u201cThat was a pretty incredible race. It\u2019s weird, I\u2019m kind of glad it\u2019s over, but I enjoyed skiing that last run. It was a challenge every single gate. I kept thinking, \u2018Did I miss a gate?\u2019 I finally came to the finish re-thinking it. It was like, \u2018No, I made every gate, wow, that\u2019s amazing,\u2019 because it was bumpy and a wild ride. A good fight, and that\u2019s probably the way it should be.\u201d\n\nShiffrin injured her knee Dec. 12, warming up for a giant slalom in Sweden. Surgery was not required and she spent eight weeks getting physical therapy in Colorado. She resumed training on snow Jan. 30, returned to Europe last week and picked up where she left off \u2014 she won the first two slalom races of the season before getting injured.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was training well,\u201d Shiffrin told reporters in the finish area. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I would be able to bring that skiing into this race. There were some scrappy turns, that\u2019s for sure. I think that probably none of the girls skied their best and I didn\u2019t ski my best. It was just one of those things where you have to be tough. I\u2019m glad my mental side is there. That component is tough to get back.\u201d\n\nShiffrin said she went to Europe with one primary goal: to see how many races she can win before the season ends March 20.\n\n\u201cI kind of have an opportunity to branch out a little bit, focus maybe more on (giant slalom) now,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to set my goals too high. There\u2019s realistic but high, and there\u2019s high and you\u2019re just going to disappoint yourself no matter what.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Olympics", "description": "Mikaela Shiffrin wins her first race back on the World Cup since injuring her right knee Dec. 12.", "title": "Mikaela Shiffrin wins her first race back after knee injury", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/2016/02/15/mikaela-shiffrin-wins-first-race-back-knee-injury/27066/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/files/2016/02/4e0a643257328608900f6a706700c0bc-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Mikaela Shiffrin wins her first race back on the World Cup since injuring her right knee Dec. 12.", "title": "Mikaela Shiffrin wins her first race back after knee injury", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/2016/02/15/mikaela-shiffrin-wins-first-race-back-knee-injury/27066/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/files/2016/02/4e0a643257328608900f6a706700c0bc-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@johnmeyer", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It was her first race back and her 18th World Cup win, secured despite deteriorating course conditions and poor visibility.\n\u201cI kind of have an opportunity to branch out a little bit, focus maybe more on (giant slalom) now,\u201d Shiffrin said.\nNine weeks after injuring her right knee, EagleVail\u2019s Mikaela Shiffrin demonstrated her decision to return to the World Cup was a sound one, winning a slalom Monday in Crans Montana, Switzerland.\nIt was like, \u2018No, I made every gate, wow, that\u2019s amazing,\u2019 because it was bumpy and a wild ride.\n\u201cI felt like I was training well,\u201d Shiffrin told reporters in the finish area."}
