But when it comes to actual hate rhetoric and the kind of fear-mongering that could get someone hurt, no one is worse than the elite media. Case in point: Friday, on the front page of the New York Daily News, the NRA\u2019s Wayne LaPierre is attacked in big red letters as a \u201cTERRORIST.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nLaPierre\u2019s mug shot resides right next to actual terrorists Syed Farook, Robert Dear, Adam Lanza, James Holmes, and Dylann Roof.\n\nThis is only the most recent example of the elite media spewing hate at those of us they disagree with.\n\nAs the media sees its influence wane in public opinion polls looking at guns, Syrian refugees, Donald Trump, ObamaCare, and Global Warming, their obvious frustration is bubbling over into outright rage.\n\nTen days ago, on no less than \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d much of the hour was spent comparing Republicans to Nazis.\n\nEarlier this week The Washington Post\u2019s Chris Cillizza fear-mongered by smearing Donald Trump as a \u201creal danger.\u201d\n\nJust because we\u2019re concerned with the screening process for Syrian refugees that ISIS has promised to seed with terrorists, CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo is comparing a majority of everyday Americans to anti-Semites.\n\nFor the last two days, the elite media has been openly mocking the Faithful who offered their \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to the victims of Islamic terrorism in San Bernadino.\n\nFinally, in the wake of last week\u2019s Planned Parenthood terror attack, the media coordinated a blood libel by laying the blame for the attack at the feet of the pro-life movement.\n\nIn the midst of all this, the media is aggressively working to convince the government to disarm us. The gun control push is now wide-open and 24/7.\n\nBetween the media\u2019s frustration, hate and ongoing assault on our Second Amendment civil rights\u2026\n\nI can\u2019t think of a better time to purchase some firearms.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hate Rhetoric: New York Daily News Labels NRA's LaPierre 'Terrorist'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Hate Rhetoric: New York Daily News Labels NRA's LaPierre 'Terrorist'", "title": "Hate Rhetoric: New York Daily News Labels NRA's LaPierre 'Terrorist' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 598, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/CVWQD1NWcAAX7IF1.jpg", "height": 449}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/12/04/hate-rhetoric-new-york-daily-news-labels-nras-lapierre-terrorist/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hate Rhetoric: New York Daily News Labels NRA's LaPierre 'Terrorist'", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/CVWQD1NWcAAX7IF1.jpg", "title": "Hate Rhetoric: New York Daily News Labels NRA's LaPierre 'Terrorist' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "New York Daily News, NRA, San Bernardino California, Wayne LaPierre,Big Journalism, Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "tag": "Wayne LaPierre", "published_time": "2015-12-04T07:07:27-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism,Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "But when it comes to actual hate rhetoric and the kind of fear-mongering that could get someone hurt, no one is worse than the elite media.\nThis is only the most recent example of the elite media spewing hate at those of us they disagree with.\nBetween the media\u2019s frustration, hate and ongoing assault on our Second Amendment civil rights\u2026I can\u2019t think of a better time to purchase some firearms.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROur beloved elite media loves to fabricate a major freak-out over \u201crhetoric\u201d whenever a Republican says something they don\u2019t approve of (like the truth).\nFor the last two days, the elite media has been openly mocking the Faithful who offered their \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to the victims of Islamic terrorism in San Bernadino."}
