It is. I should know. I'm a S.O.B. (son of a butcher) and grandson of a butcher, a second generation American who graduated Columbia University alongside my classmate Barack Obama\u2026and became a self-made successful small business owner, conservative politician, Vice Presidential nominee and conservative media commentator. Only in America!\n\nI'm living proof that capitalism, American exceptionalism, Judeo Christian values, faith in God, country and work ethic and the great American Dream all work. But there is an evil plot to destroy them all.\n\nAmerica, the greatest nation in world history, is being destroyed, plundered and looted by the premeditated \u201cmurder of the middle class.\u201d This is no accident, mistake, or coincidence. This is a purposeful plan. This is the boldest, grandest criminal conspiracy in world history.\n\n\n\nAlthough the man at the center of this massive world-class fraud is Barack Obama, there are many moving parts and co-conspirators. These include famous billionaire businessmen, corporate CEOs, the Federal Reserve, Wall Street bankers, central bankers, government employee unions, the IRS, EPA, NSA, the Bar Association, assorted communists and America-haters, and even some well-known D.C. establishment Republicans. It\u2019s quite a shocking list of conspirators.\n\n\n\nLies and fraud are at the center of this \u201cmurder of the middle class.\u201d President Obama and various big government politicians need to distract the middle class from their real agenda. Lies are their WMD- weapon of mass distraction.\n\n\n\nSo they claim ObamaCare is about \u201csaving the sick and uninsured\u201d\u2026when the real objective is income redistribution (through higher taxes and higher premiums) to make the middle class poor and dependent on government.\n\n\n\nThey claim environmental regulations and green energy will save us from global warming\u2026when the real objective is bankrupting the middle class by tripling utility bills, gas bills and grocery bills.\n\n\n\nThey claim immigration reform is about \u201cprotecting innocent children\u201d\u2026when the real objective is to create 12 million new low-wage employees in the labor force\u2026depress middle class wages for generations to come\u2026and create 12 million future Democratic voters.\n\n\n\nThey claim higher taxes are to \u201ccreate equality\u201d\u2026 when the real objective is income redistribution and starving the biggest donors to conservative causes and candidates- small business and the middle class.\n\n\n\nThey claim higher education spending is \u201cfor the kids,\u201d \u2026when the real objective is enriching teachers unions so they can funnel hundreds of millions back to Democrat politicians.\n\n\n\nThe Fed claims quantitative easing is \u201cto save the economy\u201d\u2026when the real goals are printing enough fake money to pay for $3.7 trillion in government handout bribes to Obama's voters\u2026and making billionaire crony capitalists like Warren Buffett far richer last year, by turning Wall Street into a fixed craps game that makes bankers and CEO's filthy rich\u2026while our children and unborn grandchildren owe back trillions in debt. By the way Obama's buddy Warren Buffett made $12.7 billion last year. How'd you do?\n\n\n\nIt's always about lying to cover-up the real agenda of murdering the middle class; redistributing wealth; making it impossible for small business to compete with big business; rewarding lobbyists, lawyers and crony capitalists; keeping politicians in office for life; and putting big government in control of our every move.\n\n\n\nBut the biggest lie of all is when politicians like Obama claim, It\u2019s all OK. Things are getting better. We\u2019re in a recovery. Look away, there\u2019s nothing to see here.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not OK. This author was just notified by his health insurance company that my family\u2019s policy has been cancelled. Because of the lies of ObamaCare my family will have no insurance. Tens of millions of middle class Americans will soon receive the same notice. This is no mistake. This was premeditated fraud upon the middle class.\n\n\n\nMy grocery bills have skyrocketed. How about yours? My electric bills are at all-time highs. How about yours? Gas prices have doubled since Obama became president.\n\nHow can middle class people survive, without becoming dependent on government? Ah, that\u2019s the point. Government acts exactly like a drug dealer, hooking you on government checks for survival, just like drug dealers addict you to cocaine.\n\n\n\nThe economy is in crisis and collapse. The GDP for the first quarter was NEGATIVE 2.9%, one of the worst showings in history, six years after Obama\u2019s trillion dollar stimulus promised to \u201csave\u201d the economy. That stimulus went to Obama\u2019s voters (the poor) and Obama\u2019s donors (the super rich). But the bill (in the form of debt) goes to the middle class for decades to come.\n\nAnd jobs? You were told in June we created 288,000 new jobs. What the media forgot to tell you is that 525,000 full-time middle class jobs were LOST in June and 800,000 part-time crappy low wage jobs were created. Does that sound like good news to you? No, it's more murder of the middle class.\n\n\n\nNo, things are not all right. Here are just a few of the facts that support, the middle class is being murdered:\n\n\n\nChina is set to pass America as the world's #1 economy based on consumer spending. THIS YEAR. It will be the first time since 1872 that America has not been the #1 economy in the world.\n\n\n\nFor the first time in history America\u2019s middle class isn\u2019t #1 in the world. Canada's middle class has passed us.\n\n\n\nFor the first time in American history more businesses are closing each day than starting up.\n\n\n\nThere are now 70% more Americans collecting entitlement checks than working in the private sector (148 million \u201ctakers\u201d vs. 86 million \u201cmakers\u201d)\u2026 a fact provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\n\nThe average full-time male employee now earns less (adjusted for inflation) than 40 years ago.\n\n\n\nTwenty percent of U.S. families don\u2019t have a single member who is employed.\n\n\n\nRecord numbers of Americans are not in the workforce (over 92 million).\n\nMore On This... Boom times or bust ahead?\n\nThe number of working age Americans without a job has increased by about 10 million in Obama\u2019s first 5 years as president. That means each and every year of Obama\u2019s Presidency, 2 million more Americans disappeared from the workforce.\n\n\n\nAmerica\u2019s second largest employer is a temp agency.\n\nSeventy of Americans believe we are still in the middle of the economic crisis, or that the worst is yet to come. And, I fear they are correct.\n\nThere is no doubt the great American middle class is being murdered. My new book, \u201cThe Murder of the Middle Class\u201d launches this week across America.\n\nThis fight is just getting started. I will not go down without a fight. Will you? Get informed and join the battle.\n\nIn \"The Murder of the Middle Class\" I present unique ideas and policies for how to save America, the U.S. economy; create millions of middle class jobs; protect your family; and instantly turn this economic bust into the greatest boom of all time -- by giving the power and the money back to the people\u2026and taking it away from government.\n\nGod Bless America and save us from \"the murder of the middle class.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-01-31 04:50:40 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "America, the greatest nation in world history, is being destroyed, plundered and looted by the premeditated murder of the middle class.", "twitter": {"description": "America, the greatest nation in world history, is being destroyed, plundered and looted by the premeditated murder of the middle class.", "title": "Protecting the American Dream: The murder of the middle class", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/07/13/murder-middle-class.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/071414/0/0/071414_ff_war_640.jpg?ve=1", "creator": "@foxnews", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"Protecting the American Dream: The murder of the middle class\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/071414/0/0/071414_ff_war_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-14T09:00:40Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/07/13/murder-middle-class.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"33232371-9c17-4eb6-ae5d-00a195715de8\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "America, the greatest nation in world history, is being destroyed, plundered and looted by the premeditated murder of the middle class.", "dc.description": "America, the greatest nation in world history, is being destroyed, plundered and looted by the premeditated murder of the middle class.", "dc.identifier": "33232371-9c17-4eb6-ae5d-00a195715de8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "pagetype": "article", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "opinion", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "Protecting The American Dream: The Murder Of The Middle Class", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-31 04:50:40 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "America, the greatest nation in world history, is being destroyed, plundered and looted by the premeditated murder of the middle class.", "title": "Protecting the American Dream: The murder of the middle class | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/07/13/murder-middle-class.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/071414/0/0/071414_ff_war_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-07-14", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"Protecting the American Dream: The murder of the middle class\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/071414/0/0/071414_ff_war_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-14T09:00:40Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/07/13/murder-middle-class.html\",\"post_id\":\"33232371-9c17-4eb6-ae5d-00a195715de8\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea01\"", "article_summary": "Lies and fraud are at the center of this \u201cmurder of the middle class.\u201d President Obama and various big government politicians need to distract the middle class from their real agenda.\nThere is no doubt the great American middle class is being murdered.\nTens of millions of middle class Americans will soon receive the same notice.\nBut the bill (in the form of debt) goes to the middle class for decades to come.\nMy new book, \u201cThe Murder of the Middle Class\u201d launches this week across America."}
