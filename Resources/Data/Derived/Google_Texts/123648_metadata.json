She states, \u201cWe live here in Marin County, which is a liberal place \u2026 it\u2019s a well-educated group of people, it\u2019s a thoughtful group of people, and I think if parents are choosing not to vaccinate, it\u2019s probably for a reason.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say after a quote like that, Jon Stewart\u2019s claim to the people of Marin practicing \u201cmindful stupidity\u201d is unwarranted. After all, Skytt is just another one of those hippy liberal Californians, munching down kale, and trying to give the rest of us the measles, right? Stewart seems to think so, telling California, \u201chave all the Fair Trade, organic espresso enemas you want,\u201d but cautioning them to be weary when their decisions affect other people.\n\nMany of us can agree to that. But of course, this isn\u2019t the whole truth.\n\nThe Daily ShowGet More: Daily Show Full Episodes,The Daily Show on Facebook,Daily Show Video Archive\n\nIn the actual clip released by CNN discussing the vaccinations of a child with leukemia, Skytt\u2019s entire interview can be found at about 1:15 at this link. It turns out \u201cfor the most part\u201d does not mean a resounding \u201cno\u201d as Stewart previously determined; in fact, Skytt had her children vaccinated for the measles, the exact virus in question.\n\nAccording to gawker.com, a quick Google search on Skytt will make you feel bad for judging her so quickly. She runs a company known as TSJ Design Group, which she started with her husband, Johan Skytt, who unfortunately passed away last June of pancreatic cancer. He was 48 years old, and they had two children, ages 6 and 9.\n\nWhether Skytt was the proper face of anti-vaxxers is up for debate, along with the stereotype of California liberals being the main perpetrators. What can be seen, though, is the evidence definitely lies in favor of getting vaccinated, whether some people choose to or not. The recent measles outbreak Stewart seeks to cover is definitely a testament to this.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "jon, stewart, rips, liberal, anti, vaxxer, mother, leaves, important, info, out", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Jon Stewart is hysterical, and he has a point, but is he going too far?", "title": "Jon Stewart's Bit On Anti-Vaxxers Leaves Out Whole Truth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/jon-stewart-rips-liberal-anti-vaxxer-mother-leaves-important-info-out-321190", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/02/06/jon-stewart_0.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jon Stewart is hysterical, and he has a point, but is he going too far?", "title": "Jon Stewart's Bit On Anti-Vaxxers Leaves Out Whole Truth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/jon-stewart-rips-liberal-anti-vaxxer-mother-leaves-important-info-out-321190", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/02/06/jon-stewart_0.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/06/jon-stewart_0.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-06T14:33:58-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-06T14:38:48-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Jon Stewart is hysterical, and he has a point, but is he going too far?"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5e07\"", "article_summary": "The recent measles outbreak Stewart seeks to cover is definitely a testament to this.\nAfter all, Skytt is just another one of those hippy liberal Californians, munching down kale, and trying to give the rest of us the measles, right?\nWhat can be seen, though, is the evidence definitely lies in favor of getting vaccinated, whether some people choose to or not.\nAccording to gawker.com, a quick Google search on Skytt will make you feel bad for judging her so quickly.\nStewart seems to think so, telling California, \u201chave all the Fair Trade, organic espresso enemas you want,\u201d but cautioning them to be weary when their decisions affect other people."}
