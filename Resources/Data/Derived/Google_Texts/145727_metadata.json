Skateboarders from all over the CSRA rolled around downtown Aiken this afternoon in a parade.\n\n\n\nBo Mitchell started an annual Skateboarding parade last year. He said it's to celebrate global go skateboarding day, and bring awareness about the sport to the community.\n\n\n\n\u201cSkateboarders are normal kids just like anyone else. Just because we skate doesn't mean that we're bad people trying to tear something up. So that's the main reason, bring everyone together, and show that we're here for a good cause,\u201d said Mitchell.\n\n\n\nDaniel Acheson said having fun is the best skill you can have in this sport.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere's no other sport that you can do this with. Like, everybody is cool with everybody. As long as you're out there skating and trying. It doesn't matter how good you are, It doesn't matter how long you've been skating, as long as you're out there trying, everybody's gunna be cool with you. And, that's one of my favorite parts about skating,\u201d said Acheson.\n\n\n\nMany skaters at the event today said there's not many places to skate around town. They said it was nice to skate in an area they are usually not allowed to. The parade today also allowed them to skate with a police escort for safety.\n\n\n\nDavid Lyell and his son came out to be a part of the large group today. He said he grew up skating and now shares his love for the sport with his son.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's just a great community of people. Anywhere you go in the world, you're gunna have something in common with another skateboarder there,\u201d said Lyell.\n\n\n\nAbout 50 skaters showed up to be in the parade today with their friends and families.\n\n\n\nAfter the parade skaters made their way back Mitchell's HIC Warehouse Indoor Skate Park for a free day of skating, food and fun.\n\n\n\nNext year, Mitchell said he hopes to have an even bigger parade with floats and even more skaters.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015 WFXG.
