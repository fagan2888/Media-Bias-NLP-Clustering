We spent many weekend afternoons walking the showroom floor, carefully picking the right piece for the right price. The first piece of furniture my husband and I bought together was a dark red corduroy Metro chair.\n\nLogin required We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us.

WEST ELM!\n\n(Pause for applause)\n\nI love, love, love West Elm, a modern store from the same company that owns Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma.\n\nIn the interest of being prepared, I made a list of 10 things that I want to buy right now.\n\n1. Party in a Box: So, the real question is, who doesn't want a party in a box? Not anyone I want to know. And it's even for sale. The kit includes decor, drinkware and serveware for $74.99! Seriously, five paper balls, two paper fans, six champagne coupes, a stainless steel cocktail shaker, a lacquered serving tray, six votive holders and confetti. All I need to do now is pick a date and get this party started. bitly.com/wepartybox\n\n2. Zigzag Floor Pouf: The one I like is black and white and awesome all over. If I have a party with my new party supplies, I'm going to need more seating. bitly.com/wepouf\n\n3. Brass Base Terrarium: So, my guests at this party are going to need something to talk about. A terrarium is a perfect conversation piece. And I just redid my dining room with dark gray walls and brass accessories. Win, win. bitly.com/weterr\n\n4. Mercury Glass Octagonal Hurricanes: My new favorite thing to do is put battery-operated candles in glass vases. It makes a lamp without ugly wires. And there's the added benefit that you can fall asleep and not worry about burning your house down. bitly.com/wehurricanes\n\n5. Organic Cotton Pintuck Duvet Cover: This is a West Elm classic. The duvet is soft and fluffy and just makes the bed look so inviting. I think I want one in slate. bitly.com/weduvet\n\n6. Capiz Orb Pendant light: There's a dark corner in the dining room that is just crying out for a pendant light. bitly.com/wecapiz\n\n7. Confetti Jersey Bath Mat: I have a bath mat, but they don't last forever, you know. This mat is fuzzy and has diagonal white and gray stripes. bitly.com/webathmat\n\n8. Rochester Swivel Armchair: Here's how West Elm describes this square-shaped chair: \"a modern take on the clubby Chesterfield, with a tuxedo-inspired profile, deep seat cushions and comfy grid-tufted back.\" Sold. bitly.com/wechair\n\n9. Agate Bookends: I am loving the natural wood and stone pieces that are popular in home decor. These agate bookends are gorgeous and would make a unique addition to my black cube-shaped bookshelf. bitly.com/weagate\n\n10. Mirrored Serving Trays: More things should be mirrored. I truly believe the furniture industry had a stroke of genius when it started making mirrored accent pieces and furniture. And I am still regretting the fact I failed to buy a mirrored cabinet from Bombay Trading Company before it closed in Tulsa. bitly.com/wetray\n\nCheck this stuff out at westelm.com and make your own list.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "When Storehouse Furniture closed at the Farm Shopping Center, I felt like a good friend moved away.", "title": "Ten things I want to buy from West Elm right now", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/food/ten-things-i-want-to-buy-from-west-elm-right/article_465bde41-9bf6-5aff-a0fc-188bdbddf7ab.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/e9/be93e9c4-a5d3-58bf-a816-2509e99201a1/52f5e5550e143.preview-500.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "com,mat,bitly,west,party,elm,furniture,mirrored,dark,love,food,style,scene,scenehomepage3,scenelatest", "news_keywords": "com,mat,bitly,west,party,elm,furniture,mirrored,dark,love,food,style,scene,scenehomepage3,scenelatest", "description": "When Storehouse Furniture closed at the Farm Shopping Center, I felt like a good friend moved away."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a39\"", "article_summary": "We spent many weekend afternoons walking the showroom floor, carefully picking the right piece for the right price.\nIn the interest of being prepared, I made a list of 10 things that I want to buy right now.\n(Pause for applause)I love, love, love West Elm, a modern store from the same company that owns Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma.\nThe first piece of furniture my husband and I bought together was a dark red corduroy Metro chair.\nI truly believe the furniture industry had a stroke of genius when it started making mirrored accent pieces and furniture."}
