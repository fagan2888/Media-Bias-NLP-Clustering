Another winter storm churns northward along the East Coast and many of our elders turn to trusted meteorologists for evermore detailed forecasts, almost as if they feel it. In the coming hours, some will suffer stroke and die.\n\nIs there a connection? Evidence presented by researchers at the American Stroke Association\u2019s annual conference this month shows a connection between abrupt changes in the weather \u2014 the rise and fall of temperature and dew point \u2014 and increased stroke hospitalizations and deaths.\n\n\"Weather is not something people would typically associate with stroke risk,\u201d Judith H. Lichtman, an associate professor of epidemiology at Yale University\u2019s school of public health. \u201cHowever, we\u2019ve found weather conditions are among the multiple factors that are associated with stroke hospitalizations.\u201d\n\nThe researchers compared a national sample of more than 134,000 U.S. adults hospitalized between 2009-2010 for ischemic stroke with meteorological data on temperature and dew point during that time. Among findings, larger swings in temperature along with a higher dew point \u2014 indicating moisture in the air \u2014 were linked with greater hospitalizations for stroke. Likewise, unseasonably low temperatures coincided with increased stroke hospitalizations and death.\n\nConversely, the stroke rate fell with just slight increases in temperature. For every temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit, hospitalizations for stroke fell by 0.86 percent, while deaths fell by 1.1 percent. They also found that greater fluctuations in temperature and dew point were associated with increased hospitalizations, though not with more deaths.\n\n\"This study suggests that meteorological factors such as daily fluctuations in temperature and increased humidity may be stressors that increase stroke hospitalizations,\" Lichtman said. \"People at risk for stroke may want to avoid being exposed to significant temperature changes and high dew point and, as always, be prepared to act quickly if they or someone they know experiences stroke signs and symptoms.\u201d\n\nThough Mother Nature\u2019s thermostat remains beyond our reach, many adults may mitigate stroke risk by exercising, eating healthy, and staying away from tobacco and alcohol, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms of stroke include facial drooping, weakness in the arms or legs, severe headache, and trouble seeing and talking.\n\nFuture research may investigate closer the connections between weather and stroke, among other health issues.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "stroke and weather, stroke risk and weather, stroke risk and temperature drops, stroke and temperature, stroke and dew point", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Weather has long been a favored and fascinating subject for the elderly.
