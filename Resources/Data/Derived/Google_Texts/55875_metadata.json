His routes, his one-hand grabs, his exits in his Lamborghini. So practice represents a contradiction. He remains on the sidelines working with trainers as his hamstring heals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s day to day, that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d Sanders said Tuesday afternoon. \u201cJust day to day.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos took a conservative approach after Sanders sat out the preseason opener. He missed the Houston Texans game last Saturday, but should return to practice this week.\n\n\u201cThat is the expectation,\u201d coach Gary Kubiak said.\n\nQuarterbacks prefer to gain timing with receivers in the preseason, but it is weighed against common sense. The Broncos don\u2019t want to Sanders to suffer a setback that would jeopardize his availability for the season opener on Sept. 13.\n\nWATCH: Trending Now: When will Emmanuel Sanders come back?\n\nSanders set career highs last season with 101 receptions, 1,409 yards and nine touchdowns.\n\nCenter of attention Kubiak remains impressed by the development of the Baby Blockers, especially center Matt Paradis. But he said something interesting Tuesday that foreshadowed the agreement with Evan Mathis.\n\n\u201cYou watch them individually, but the thing that is important is how they play as a group,\u201d Kubiak said.\n\nCenter Matt Paradis, left tackle Ty Sambrailo and left guard Max Garcia represented the Broncos\u2019 youngest offensive line since 2010. Mathis buys time to develop Garcia, whom the team views as a future starter. It also pairs Mathis with Paradis, who continues to draw raves.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really encouraging right now is that Paradis has become the leader, getting everybody on the same page and playing really well,\u201d Kubiak said.\n\nThere was one significant change among the linemen. Sambrailo\u2019s long locks are gone. After a horrible rookie haircut left odd side patches and a mullet, Sambrailo shaved his head.\n\nAbout those 49ers? The Broncos pushed to land joint practices with the 49ers, believing they help the development of young players since the starters are expected to play half this Saturday. However, the two-day workouts arrive in week three of the preseason, which demands concessions. The teams won\u2019t practice in full pads either day.\n\n\u201cWe have a job to do, they have a job to do, it doesn\u2019t matter who we go against as long as we get the work in,\u201d running back C.J. Anderson said.\n\nAdded linebacker Brandon Marshall, \u201cIt would have been cool to have it when the fans were out here.\u201d\n\nFootnotes Linebacker Danny Trevathan\u2019s return from surgery on his kneecap should reach another milestone this week. He\u2019s on track to play in his first game since injuring the knee for a third time against the San Diego Chargers on Dec. 14. \u2026 Kubiak plans to give plenty of opportunities to Montee Ball and Kapri Bibbs this week. Bibbs is the only running back on the depth chart who has yet to carry the ball in the preseason \u2014 not a great sign when attempting to make the team. \u2026 Linebacker Lerentee McCray (groin) remains sidelined. \u2026 Another day ending in \u201cy,\u201d another interception for cornerback Aqib Talib. In a summer of strong performers, Talib ranks near Von Miller at the top. \u2026 The second-string offensive line rebounded against the Texans, with the entire group receiving positive game grades from Pro Football Focus.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Emmanuel Sanders expected to practice this week; unsure when he plays", "title": "Emmanuel Sanders expected to practice this week; unsure when he plays", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/25/emmanuel-sanders-expected-to-practice-this-week-unsure-when-he-plays/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150825_031223_emmanuel-sanders.jpg", "height": 486}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150825_031223_emmanuel-sanders.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-25T15:24:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T05:56:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde11\"", "article_summary": "He missed the Houston Texans game last Saturday, but should return to practice this week.\nCenter of attention Kubiak remains impressed by the development of the Baby Blockers, especially center Matt Paradis.\n\u201cJust day to day.\u201dThe Broncos took a conservative approach after Sanders sat out the preseason opener.\n\u201cIt\u2019s day to day, that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d Sanders said Tuesday afternoon.\nThe Broncos don\u2019t want to Sanders to suffer a setback that would jeopardize his availability for the season opener on Sept. 13."}
