This year\u2019s theme was \u201cMission H2O.\u201d\n\nWhy they entered: Sophia\u2019s teacher showed her class videos that introduced environmental and conservation topics, including one on mountaintop removal. \u201cI saw the devastation and chose it for my topic,\u201d she said. She then read \u201cabout the impact\u201d and created her essay from various points of view that she read about in her research.\n\nBrian became concerned about pollution on a canoe trip on Elkhorn Creek with his Boy Scout troop. \u201cWe wound up cleaning up the creek,\u201d he said, mentioning \u201ca set of tires, pieces of a plastic playhouse, and a toilet seat\u201d as among the items they removed from the creek that day.\n\nIn his research Brian identified two main causes for poor water conditions in Kentucky: the coal mining industries and everyday choices made by ordinary people. \u201cFactories release chemicals into the air, which become toxic rain, which ends up in the waterways,\u201d he said.\n\nTheir messages: Sophia hopes that after reading her essay, people will \u201cthink twice about using electricity, and the different ways they use it. Turning on a switch means more coal is used and more mountaintop removal.\u201d\n\nBrian agrees that everyday choices \u2014 such as choosing whether to throw a soda bottle out a window or disposing of it properly, or driving \u201call across town instead of making efficient trips\u201d \u2014 can have an impact on water quality and the environment.\n\nWhy they like to write: Sophia said, \u201cI read a lot of books, and I love getting into stories, characters, and plots. The authors inspired me to write, and I want to inspire other as they have inspired me.\u201d\n\nBrian said he likes to write personal narrative and stories, adding that when he is writing he can \u201cthink about it and perfect the way I express a point. And I can put my personality into it.\u201d\n\nSophia\u2019s home life: Sophia lives in Shelby County with her parents, Tricia and David Biagi, and her younger brother Leo.\n\nBrian\u2019s home life: Brian lives in the small city Westwood off Westport Road with his parents, Eileen and Bruce Schweinhart, and his younger sister Kimberly. His older brother is a junior at the University of Louisville.\n\nFuture plans: Sophia is considering careers that involve writing, science, and design. Brian plans to study aerospace engineering.\n\nThey enjoy: Sophia likes cross country, golf, tennis, hiking, spending time in nature and reading. Brian likes soccer, participating on the Science Olympiad team, model rocketry, piano and camping with his Boy Scout troop.\n\nSophia Biagi\n\nAge: 13\n\nGrade: 7\n\nSchool: St. Aloysius School\n\nBrian Schweinhart\n\nAge: 17\n\nGrade: 11\n\nSchool: Manual High School\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1ncaIgQ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Sophia is the Oldham County and Brian the Jefferson County winner in the writing division of the 2013 Jim Claypool Art and Conservation Writing Contests.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Sophia is the Oldham County and Brian the Jefferson County winner in the writing division of the 2013 Jim Claypool Art and Conservation Writing Contests.", "title": "Achievers | Sophia Biagi and Brian Schweinhart", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/northeast/2014/05/18/achievers-sophia-biagi-brian-schweinhart/9267189/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sophia is the Oldham County and Brian the Jefferson County winner in the writing division of the 2013 Jim Claypool Art and Conservation Writing Contests.", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/40ca3afaf97e1558e165456b0f614b0ddc00672f/c=0-300-1500-1800&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/19/sophiabiagi1.jpg", "title": "Achievers | Sophia Biagi and Brian Schweinhart", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local/northeast", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e9c76406e2cc255455f8a784eb318461f02bba3b/c=0-50-1500-2050/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/19/sophiabiagi1.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2caf8bbae9d6776f293c7e99fada12d4f6574b76/c=0-300-1500-1800/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/19/sophiabiagi1.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/998711010a1328f0a1e6b7393b48272d6608ca28/c=0-488-1500-1613/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/19/sophiabiagi1.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e9b71dcf9629c82e51d42e06be23147550efcda2/c=0-628-1500-1472&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/19/sophiabiagi1.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-05-18T22:40:08-04:00", "shorthed": "Achievers | Sophia Biagi and Brian Schweinhart", "articleid": 9267189, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b66f3ae7cf61a6e71f968274336d31a8d268a2f/c=0-628-1500-1472/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/19/sophiabiagi1.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a92d3fe39ba3e08354111f84f0fbaeff11fa9ff1/c=160-0-1341-2100/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/19/sophiabiagi1.jpg"}, "author": "Elaine Rooker Jack", "title": "Achievers | Sophia Biagi and Brian Schweinhart", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8902\"", "article_summary": "Achievement: Sophia Biagi and Brian Schweinhart are the Oldham County and Jefferson County winners, respectively, in the writing division of the 2013 Jim Claypool Art and Conservation Writing Contests.\nBrian likes soccer, participating on the Science Olympiad team, model rocketry, piano and camping with his Boy Scout troop.\nThey enjoy: Sophia likes cross country, golf, tennis, hiking, spending time in nature and reading.\nWhy they like to write: Sophia said, \u201cI read a lot of books, and I love getting into stories, characters, and plots.\nBrian\u2019s home life: Brian lives in the small city Westwood off Westport Road with his parents, Eileen and Bruce Schweinhart, and his younger sister Kimberly."}
