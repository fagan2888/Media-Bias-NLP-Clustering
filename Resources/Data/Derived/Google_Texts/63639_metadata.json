We\u2019re always on the go and in need of more storage, so portable hard drives go to the top of the list when new ones come out. Though it\u2019s not that new, Western Digital\u2019s newest and largest portable 3 TB, single-drive offering is still sometimes out of stock, but the 3 TB My Passport Ultra is certainly not alone in its segment.\n\nThe past couple years have allowed us to become accustomed to the standard 2 TB limit of portable, single-drive, bus-powered storage solutions. But in the last few months, the market has witnessed a jump in storage capabilities, from the previously reviewed 2x2 TB RAID 0 drives by Seagate and Western Digital to the also new single-drive, not-quite-so-slim 4 TB Seagate Backup Plus Slim. Meanwhile, the 2 TB relatives have slimmed down quite a bit.\n\nFirst Impressions and Context Within the Market\n\nAt first glance, the 3 TB My Passport Plus is a normal drive with a slightly thicker-than-standard appearance. Its 20.96 millimeter thickness does, however, stay under that of Seagate\u2019s dual-drive 4 TB Backup Plus Fast, which rises 22.35 mm above the desk. Interestingly, Seagate\u2019s relatively new single-drive 4TB Backup Plus Slim comes in as the thinnest drive at 20.5 milimeters. Seagate\u2019s drives also have a slightly larger footprint for the most part, but at these numbers, who really cares? They\u2019re all on the slightly thicker side, but still very portable and close enough in size to where you wouldn\u2019t plan your packing any differently at all.\n\nThe iPhone 5 is about half the thickness of the Western Digital 3 TB My Passport Ultra, which is just a hair smaller than the 4 TB Seagate Backup Fast. Not pictured here is the 4 TB Seagate Backup Slim, which is even a hair slimmer than the My Passport Ultra. These aren't massive hard drives by any means, but they are each thicker than the standard 1 TB or 2 TB portable hard drives we may have gotten used to.\n\nThis, however, brings us to an interesting question? Why go for the 3 TB Western Digital at all when you can get a 4 TB drive in the same space? Honestly, at about the same dollar-per-gigabyte cost as the nearest 4 TB equivalent, it\u2019s not even \u201ccheaper\u201d (that\u2019s assuming you get the same deal I did at $129.99 for the 3 TB drive; street price is usually about $20 more). So, in the end, it comes down to how much space you need, since you\u2019ll still certainly pay more for the 4 TB drives, even if you also get more storage for the extra payment.\n\nSpeed\n\nIf you need more than 2 TB, but less than 4 TB, you might still care about the speed of this drive. As a single-drive model, the 3 TB My Passport Ultra can\u2019t compete with the dual-drive 4 TB options out there. But it\u2019s still as fast as your average USB 3.0 rotating hard drive should be.\n\nThere are no surprises with these speeds for a Western Digital 3 TB My Passport Ultra. It's a fair speed for what it is, but nothing special in the transfer rate area.\n\nBlackmagic Disk Speed tests showed read and write speeds averaging around 115 MB/s, with peaks of up to 120 MB/s. A transfer of a 2.86 GB folder of individual raw images finished in just over 26 seconds, performing at a reasonable 110 MB/s, considering it wasn\u2019t just one large file being transferred (which is almost always faster than transferring many individual files).\n\nRecommendations and Other Options\n\nWhen it comes down to it, there\u2019s nothing exciting enough about Western Digital\u2019s new 3 TB drive to warrant investing in one unless you need that exact amount of storage. For the money and physical size, you\u2019re better off getting any of the 4 TB options or simply sticking with the cheaper and much thinner 2 TB models that have essentially replaced the 1 TB models as the new goto standard for bus-powered portable drives.\n\nFirst, Seagate\u2019s Backup Plus Fast and 4 TB Backup Plus Slim have unfortunately confusing names, but they are different in one important way. The Backup Fast houses two 2 TB hard drives that are linked together via RAID 0 within the drive, splitting all the data you send to the unit across two hard drives. This theoretically (and realistically, just about - read below) doubles the read and write speeds of a single drive, but puts data at a higher risk: if one drive fails, you lose the data on both, since neither of the drives within the enclosure has all of the data. This makes it a poor choice for backup (and simultaneously makes Seagate\u2019s naming of the \"Backup Fast\" drive an equally poor choice), but it makes for a fantastic and extremely portable live work drive with all 4 TB of storage available and with speeds up to 245 MB/s in my Blackmagic speed tests. The same 2.86 GB folder transferred in a mere 14.5 seconds, performing at a comparatively lower, but still incredibly fast 197 MB/s.\n\nFor a portable hard drive packing 4 TB of storage, these new 2x2 TB RAID 0 drives are a killer combination, especially when considering cost-effective options.\n\nThe 4 TB Backup Plus Slim, however, is simply a single, huge 4 TB hard drive housed in a very similarly sized package (and is therefore an equally poorly named device - sorry, Seagate\u2026 but, come on). While the 4 TB drive has greater platter density, which increases read and write speeds over those of lower capacity drives, this drive will still perform very similarly to any other single, portable, bus-powered hard drive on the market today.\n\nSeagate recently released a repackaged version of the Backup Plus Fast with their new logo, so it\u2019s now even harder to distinguish the two models. A price difference of only 15 percent also makes things difficult, but we\u2019ll try to simplify it, here:\n\nSeagate 4 TB Backup Plus Fast \u2014 2x2 TB @ ~245 MB/s | About $200\n\nSeagate 4 TB Backup Plus Slim \u2014 1x4 TB @ ~115 MB/s | About $170\n\nMeanwhile, Western Digital\u2019s 4 TB My Passport Pro (also available with 2 TB) competes with the 4 TB Seagate Backup Plus Fast with a similar setup, but features Thunderbolt instead of USB 3.0. Still, while there might be some speed differences, these hard drives are limited by their own internal transfer rates and not by their connection type. Therefore, I couldn\u2019t recommend the My Passport Pro to a friend given its rather pricey ask of $319.99 (or just under $275 right now for the 2TB version) and its noticeably thicker form.\n\nA quick note: LaCie also makes a 2x2 TB RAID 0 hard drive, but at literally double the cost of the Seagate 4 TB Backup Plus Fast, even its rugged, rubberized, orange shock-protective housing and dual Thunderbolt and USB 3.0 connections aren\u2019t enough to make it worth my while. Whether it\u2019s worth it for you is something only you can know, of course.\n\nThe newest version of Seagate's 4 TB Backup Fast Portable features its new logo \u2014 and with about a 10 percent increase in speed over its predecessor (at least in my admittedly unscientific, but quite real-world tests), you're going to want to look out for that.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nI pride myself on doing what\u2019s most cost-effective. But I look at cost-effectiveness as getting the most I possibly can while still not being wasteful. With that in mind, I bought the 3 TB Western Digital drive out of curiosity and for this review and I\u2019ll keep it because I can always use more portable storage. However, I also bought my second Seagate Backup Plus Fast and those two will continue to be my most loved and prized portable workhorses. What of the potentially higher failure rate? That doesn\u2019t bother me so much, since I naturally have each of those drives backed up in the office. But for what it\u2019s worth, the first Backup Plus Fast drive I have now features a nice dent in the top of it and it still works beautifully. For $200, it\u2019s a hard combination to beat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Every now and then, it\u2019s good to have a quick update to know what the biggest, fastest, or most affordable drives are for the money.
