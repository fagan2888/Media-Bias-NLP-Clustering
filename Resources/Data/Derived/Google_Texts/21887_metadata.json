Imagine, then, what life is like for people suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease, who witness their motor skills and ability to hold a fork gradually deteriorate.\n\nNow, scientists are offering Parkinson\u2019s patients hope with a new pen called the ARC Pen, which was designed to prevent the shakiness that occurs when patients write or draw. People with Parkinson\u2019s experience hand cramping when attempting to write, which makes their letters extremely small and difficult to read; it's a condition known as micrographia. While writing seems like a simple thing to most of us, being unable to do this task can become bothersome and frustrating to Parkinson's patients.\n\n\u201cWe heard stories of how frustrating it was for people who were still working, or who wanted to write a card, sign documents, anything that had to do with writing,\u201d Lucy Jung, the product designer of the ARC Pen, told Wired UK.\n\nDesigned by the company DOPA Solution, the ARC Pen uses high-frequency vibrations to massage the hand and prevent cramping. It also makes it much easier for the pen to roll across the paper. In a trial testing it on 14 people with Parkinson\u2019s, scientists found that the ARC Pen boosted writing 86 percent of the time.\n\nDOPA Solution notes on its website that the ARC Pen is the first \u201cspecifically designed for people with Parkinson\u2019s living with Micrographia,\" adding that \"many people with this motor control difficulty give up the practice of writing or drawing altogether. Dopa Solution\u2019s aim is to focus on higher level needs in order to have the greatest impact on people\u2019s lives.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "arc, pen, helps, parkinsons, patients, write, draw, without, shaking", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Scientists have designed a special pen for Parkinson\u2019s patients that would allow them to write normally, without cramping or shaking.", "title": "Special Pen Helps Parkinson's Patients Write Without Shaking [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/arc-pen-helps-parkinsons-patients-write-draw-without-shaking-328062", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/03/arc-pen.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists have designed a special pen for Parkinson\u2019s patients that would allow them to write normally, without cramping or shaking.", "title": "Special Pen Helps Parkinson's Patients Write Without Shaking [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/arc-pen-helps-parkinsons-patients-write-draw-without-shaking-328062", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/03/arc-pen.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/03/arc-pen.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-04-03T12:58:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-03T12:58:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Scientists have designed a special pen for Parkinson\u2019s patients that would allow them to write normally, without cramping or shaking."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc889\"", "article_summary": "Now, scientists are offering Parkinson\u2019s patients hope with a new pen called the ARC Pen, which was designed to prevent the shakiness that occurs when patients write or draw.\nIn a trial testing it on 14 people with Parkinson\u2019s, scientists found that the ARC Pen boosted writing 86 percent of the time.\nDesigned by the company DOPA Solution, the ARC Pen uses high-frequency vibrations to massage the hand and prevent cramping.\nWhile writing seems like a simple thing to most of us, being unable to do this task can become bothersome and frustrating to Parkinson's patients.\nPeople with Parkinson\u2019s experience hand cramping when attempting to write, which makes their letters extremely small and difficult to read; it's a condition known as micrographia."}
