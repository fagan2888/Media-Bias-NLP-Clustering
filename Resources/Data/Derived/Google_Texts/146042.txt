Kids and parents outside Panama City Mall witnessed a special treat Saturday morning, a visit from Santa himself.

Traveling all the way from the North Pole, Santa swooped in by helicopter to greet little boys and girls this holiday season.

After making his grand entrance, kids got the chance to sit on Santa's lap and tell him a few of their Christmas wishes.

Along with taking a photo with Santa, kids could enter for a chance to win a number of prizes, including free bike giveaways and other fun toys.

"He's very excited to meet all the little boys and girls, he's got his list, he's checking it twice finding out who's naughty who's nice, and we're just so excited about the crowd that turned out," said Panama City Mall Marketing Director Kim Wise.

Santa will be stay center court at the the Panama City Mall until Christmas Eve.
