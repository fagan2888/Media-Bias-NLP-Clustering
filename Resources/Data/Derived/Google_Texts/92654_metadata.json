He can handle himself on the tricky surfaces.\n\nSo when the University of Denver senior center was tripped from behind and onto his stomach beside the net late in Saturday night\u2019s game against Wisconsin, he was not out of the play.\n\nDoremus produced one of the most remarkable assists you will see in hockey, centering the puck from his stomach to linemate Danton Heinen for the game-winning goal in the Pioneers\u2019 3-2 win over the Badgers at Magness Arena.\n\n\u201cDanny led us last year \u2014 he was MVP of the NCHC Tournament. He knows what it takes to win,\u201d DU coach Jim Montgomery said of Doremus, who had a team-high six shots and was plus-2. \u201cHis heart and will to win is phenomenal, and he\u2019s a great role model for our underclassmen.\u201d\n\nAs unusual and improbable as Doremus\u2019 pass was, Heinen\u2019s goal was as easy as they get. He just tapped in the puck as goalie Joel Rumpel and two defensemen were focused on the situation around Doremus.\n\n\u201cI think Heinen might have called for it, because he wasn\u2019t surprised by the pass. It\u2019s the second and third efforts,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cWe were relentless on the puck, and Danny leads us in that department every game.\u201d\n\nHeinen\u2019s goal gave DU a 3-1 lead 9:08 into the third period, but the Badgers\u2019 Adam Rockwood scored at 14:38, and it was an intense final five minutes.\n\nDenver (8-3) held on for its fifth victory in its past six games. Wisconsin fell to 0-8. The Badgers lost 5-2 at Colorado College on Friday.\n\nDU beat Air Force 7-0 on Friday and has outscored its last three opponents 18-3.\n\nDoremus scored Denver\u2019s first goal against the Badgers and easily was the game\u2019s No. 1 star. Fellow Colorado native Quentin Shore, a junior forward who had three goals and an assist Friday, produced the Pioneers\u2019 second goal Saturday in his best collegiate weekend thus far.\n\nThe Pioneers took a 2-1 lead into the third period after they traded second- period, power-play goals with the Badgers. Wisconsin senior Joseph LaBate scored at 40 seconds with Joey LaLeggia in the box for contact to the head, and DU regained its lead on Shore\u2019s man-advantage goal at 5:36. LaBate and Shore both pounced on rebounds between the circles.\n\nOn a lucky bounce, Denver got the early lead on Doremus\u2019 goal 9:29 into the game. The puck came off Doremus\u2019 stick and bounced off traffic in front of Rumpel, who ultimately had the puck rainbow over him.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "DU Pioneers stay hot with victory over Wisconsin", "title": "DU Pioneers stay hot with victory over Wisconsin", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/22/du-pioneers-stay-hot-with-victory-over-wisconsin/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141122__du-pioneersp1.jpg", "height": 409}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141122__du-pioneersp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-22T22:02:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:42:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "NCAA hockey, University of Denver"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0bac\"", "article_summary": "On a lucky bounce, Denver got the early lead on Doremus\u2019 goal 9:29 into the game.\nFellow Colorado native Quentin Shore, a junior forward who had three goals and an assist Friday, produced the Pioneers\u2019 second goal Saturday in his best collegiate weekend thus far.\nDoremus scored Denver\u2019s first goal against the Badgers and easily was the game\u2019s No.\nThe Pioneers took a 2-1 lead into the third period after they traded second- period, power-play goals with the Badgers.\nThe puck came off Doremus\u2019 stick and bounced off traffic in front of Rumpel, who ultimately had the puck rainbow over him."}
