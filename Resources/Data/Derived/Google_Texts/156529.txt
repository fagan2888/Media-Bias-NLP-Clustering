We’re documenting our hunt for the best latte art in the Denver coffee scene, as well as expert tips on how to do coffee better.

Location: Rooster & Moon Coffee Pub, 955 Bannock St., Denver

Barista: Jason “Bird” Calloway, co-owner/operator; and Kelsey Lundie

Pro tip: Never freeze whole coffee beans, Calloway said. Ever.

“One of the biggest mistakes I ever see: People go out and spend good money on good coffee and then they get it back home and freeze it,” Calloway said. “Never freeze your coffee.”

“There is water in coffee beans and when you put water in the freezer, it crystallizes. So what you’re doing is getting crystallized water in your coffee beans, which is breaking up your beans, allowing the oils to release their gases before they’re even brewed,” he said. “If you get a pound of whole bean and you make sure it’s sealed properly, you can sit it out on the counter for three weeks. It’s good to go.”

“Another thing is the oils in the bean itself are very absorbent. They’re going to absorb every odor and flavor in your freezer. Whether or not you think it there, it’s there,” Calloway said. “If you have fish in your freezer or you have meat in your freezer, it’s absorbing all those flavors and odors. So, when you brew it and it tastes a little funky, that’s why. It was sitting right next to your salmon that you were supposed to have next week.”
