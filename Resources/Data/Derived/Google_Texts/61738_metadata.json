One deleted section would have mandated certified EHRs be able to conduct \u201ctrusted exchange\u201d of information with multiple other EHRs. But in the latest draft of the bill obtained by Morning eHealth, the committee instructs HHS to issue guidance on \u201ccommon legal, governance and security barriers\u201d that prevent trusted exchange. The draft also drops a proposal to combine the Health IT Standards and Policy committees into one body. It also makes several small changes to the TRUST IT Act, which creates a star-rating system for EHRs based on security, usability and interoperability. While it\u2019s not immediately clear what moved the drafters\u2019 hands, many health IT groups told the committee they feared elements in the original draft, released Jan. 20, would stifle innovation and disrupt industry progress toward interoperability. Pros get the latest version of the bill here: http://bit.ly/1Q2Avol\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 A few other news and notes \u2026 the name of the bill will be the \u201cImproving Health Information Technology Act\u201d\u2026the whole bill was trimmed from 68 pages to 51\u2026the section on \u201cinformation blocking\u201d is largely unchanged\u2026ONC and OCR may refer accusations of health information exchange refusal to the HHS Office of Inspector General for possible prosecution\u2026a GAO report on patient matching is still included\u2026HHS is ordered to submit to the Health IT Policy Committee a report on meaningful use attestation to help guide policy making. If you find other notable differences and changes, please drop us a line.\n\nDRIVING THIS WEEK: The White House on Tuesday will release its fiscal 2017 budget request to Congress. While it\u2019s likely to be largely ignored by a Republican-controlled Congress, Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan gave a preview in a blog post over the weekend. The budget request will include $1 billion for the cancer cure \u201cmoonshot.\u201d We don\u2019t know what\u2019s in store for health IT related activities at ONC \u2013 which had a $90 million budget request last year \u2013 and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n\neHealth tweet of the day: Leslie Krigstein @lmirvine: Who else in the #healthIT world hoping for an @athenahealth #letdoctorsbedoctors commercial? #SuperBowl\n\nWelcome to Monday morning eHealth where we had a curious and different way to spend the first half of the Super Bowl: locked out of the House. All was well as we still caught the halftime show. Pass along favorite commercials from both halves to dpittman@politico.com and connect with us on Twitter @David_Pittman, @arthurallen202, @DariusTahir @ POLITICOPro, @Morning_eHealth.\n\nSUBSTANCE ABUSE RECORDS RULE RELEASED: HHS released the first major update to how patients\u2019 substance abuse and addiction treatment records are shared since 1987. The proposed rule from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration authorizes a \u201cgeneral description\u201d patient consent form, which permits the sharing of sensitive medical records by research institutions, data repositories, health information exchanges, accountable care organizations, and health homes. Currently under 42 CFR Part 2, patients must sign off each time their records are shared with another provider. The purpose of the proposed rule is to \u201cmodernize\u201d 42 CFR Part 2 \u201cwhile ensuring appropriate confidentiality protections for records,\u201d HHS said. The rule: http://bit.ly/1NUPuzd\n\n\u2014 Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Penn.), the longtime advocate of mental health reform, said the rule doesn\u2019t go far enough. \"This regulations continues the redundant multiple-step process that makes it a huge burden for patients, providers, and health care professionals that could make it difficult for a provider to get relevant information quickly and it is a barrier to integrated care,\" Murphy's office said in an email.\n\n\u2014 Lobbyists for the behavioral health IT industry said the rule, which was substantially broader than expected, is HHS\u2019s response to congressional pressure to change the rule. Legislation by Murphy and Sens. Bill Cassidy and Chris Murphy would also alter how 42 CFR Part 2 is handled.\n\nTELEMEDICINE BILL WAS YEARS IN THE MAKING: Last week\u2019s introduction of the CONNECT for Health Act was the culmination of years of learning from past legislative failures, developing coalitions of support and building congressional network. And while the future of the bill is far from certain, it probably represents the best chance of any telemedicine bill of late, with plenty of momentum on and off the Hill and legislative vehicles it could hitch a ride on. The bill started with the formation of a lobbying group, the Alliance for Connected Care and advanced by crafting legislation that inserts telemedicine into value-based models. Read the story from me here: http://politico.pro/1mn6MyS\n\nONC SEAKS TO CLARIFY HIPAA: As part of HHS\u2019s ongoing mission to demystify HIPAA, ONC and HHS\u2019s Office for Civil Rights have published two fact sheets on when patient information can be shared \u201cwithout first requiring an authorization or a writing of some type from the patient, so long as other protections or conditions are met,\u201d the office said in a blog post last week. ONC wants to make it clear that HIPAA supports interoperability, rather than limiting it. The blog post: http://bit.ly/1SWQoBY Fact sheets are here: http://bit.ly/1S9jY8n and http://bit.ly/1T6MyaD\n\n\u2014 Somewhat related: Miami\u2019s Jackson Memorial Hospital fired two employees for giving an ESPN reporter copies of New York Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul\u2019s medical records last summer following a fireworks accident that severed a finger and left Pierre-Paul\u2019s football future in doubt. http://bit.ly/1L8PGuR\n\nWORTH A READ: A Southern California doctor penned an intriguing piece in the Sunday New York Times questioning the balance between privacy concerns and the power of data mining medical records. \u201cWe also must block attempts to discriminate based on health information for work or other pursuits with continued legislation, and portray those who participate in the sharing of health data as heroes,\u201d David B. Agus wrote. The piece: http://nyti.ms/20CFqYn\n\nLEFT OVER: The issues of medical licensing, antitrust and Teladoc\u2019s lawsuit against Texas arose in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week. The panel examined the issue of occupation licensing, and Texas Sen. John Cornyn brought up last year\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court decision supporting FTC\u2019s ruling against the North Carolina dental board. The court said a majority of non-market participants must sit on state boards that regulate a particular field. Teladoc has cited the case in its lawsuit against the Texas Medical Board. \u201cWhile I think we all have sympathy to the concept in general, it seems to me it\u2019s led to absurd results when you talk about non-lawyers regulating lawyers, non-doctors regulating doctors,\u201d Cornyn said. The Republican asked witnesses what Congress could do. \u201cSince we wrote the anti-trust laws, I guess we can change them, but that\u2019s not an easy thing to do\u2026Maybe there\u2019s a way for us to address this.\u201d Background: http://1.usa.gov/1nw5TFy\n\nAHA\u2019S THOUGHTS ON eCQMS: CMS should base future electronic clinical quality measures on the experience of pilots and demonstrations, the American Hospital Association told the agency Friday. Problem: \u201cTo date, CMS has not shared insights from these efforts,\u201d the group said. The Hospital Association also recommends that CMS clearly state its plans for transitioning from chart-based reporting to electronic reporting across CMS programs. The letter: http://bit.ly/1nWmQJx\n\nBOXER HOPS ON DEVICE SECURITY: Sen. Barbara Boxer wrote the five leading medical device companies on Friday asking them to address the growing threat of cybersecurity of their products. Her letter went to the chief executives of Johnson & Johnson, GE Healthcare, Siemens, Medtronic and Philips, which together control more than a quarter of the global medical device market. \u201cThe actions your companies take to reduce medical device vulnerabilities exponentially reduce the global risk of medical device cyberattacks and send a powerful signal to the entire industry of the importance of good cybersecurity practices,\" the California Democrat wrote. The letter: http://1.usa.gov/1SD97UO\n\nTHERANOS RECEIVES NEW DEADLINE: The troubled lab startup has until this Friday to reply to CMS\u2019s concerns about the condition of its blood testing labs. It received a week\u2019s extension just before last Friday\u2019s deadline.\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE CLICKING:\n\nMillennials\u2019 demand for immediate medical services is changing health care with telemedicine: http://usat.ly/1XbEFjs\n\nPro-telemedicine bill introduced in Indiana state senate: http://bit.ly/20CxINJ\n\nThe importance of provider directories: http://bit.ly/1NYmN4x\n\nNintendo halts sleep tracking device: http://tcrn.ch/1XcEYdH\n\nTips, comments, suggestions?
