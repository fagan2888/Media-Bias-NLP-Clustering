Memorial Health employs about 4,650 people or the equivalent of 3,800 full-time employees, plus about 600 people on the medical staff and 140 individuals employed by physicians and 141 residents.\n\nGill said the move opens the \u201cpossibility of increasing reach in resources, services and capability.\u201d\n\nThe proposed partnership would not be Memorial\u2019s first such venture. In 2012 it entered into a shared-services agreement with Novant Health Inc., which is based in Winston-Salem, N.C. Gill said that move placed Memorial in a lead position in the changing health care environment.\n\nHarry Haslam Jr., who chairs Memorial\u2019s 18-member governing board, said the newest move is a proactive effort that has been discussed by board members for the past two years.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the changing environment in health care,\u201d Haslam said. \u201cLike everyone else we are facing the headwinds of the Affordable Care Act, and we need to be proactive.\u201d\n\nIncluded in Memorial\u2019s needs is access to capital to allow the system to support clinical services unique in this region such as a neonatal intensive care nursery and the hospital\u2019s trauma center.\n\n\u201cAbove all else we want to fulfill our mission at the very highest level of quality for all patients, which include the uninsured,\u201d Haslam said. \u201cWe have a very strong system. I believe we\u2019re a very attractive entity for someone to partner with.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nChatham County input\n\nA core element in the proposed partnership is to support the health system\u2019s debt, including the Chatham County Commission\u2019s agreement in 2011 to guarantee $195 million in bonds.\n\nThat action included an independent review of Memorial\u2019s finances, an analysis to evaluate certain risks such as a reduction in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements and a determination of whether the county\u2019s bond rating would be affected.\n\nCommissioners\u2019 support for the health care provider\u2019s bond proposal included recognition of almost $18 million in health care services that the hospital provided for the area\u2019s indigent population.\n\nAs a result of the agreement, the hospital was able to free up about $60 million in capital improvement projects, including a $15 million emergency room expansion.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for us to stop and relieve Chatham County of the obligation and make our own way,\u201d Gill said.\n\nMemorial officials said the move will not materially alter what a patient sees \u2014 Gill and her leadership team will remain in place and physicians will continue as will staff.\n\nBut additional resources would allow Memorial to increase its reach in services and capability and would fund infrastructure needs for the facility that opened in 1955 as Memorial Hospital of Chatham County, a 300-bed general hospital, which was dedicated to the memory of the county\u2019s World War II veterans.\n\nSince 2008, it has included Mercer University medical school\u2019s Savannah campus and is the region\u2019s only Level One Trauma Center.\n\n\u201cWe view it (a potential partnership) as a very positive thing that will strengthen Memorial Health,\u201d said Don Waters, chairman of the nine-member Chatham County Hospital Authority that owns the land and leases it to Memorial.\n\nAmong various obligations in the lease is a commitment to community benefit and the mission of the hospital, Waters said.\n\nMemorial\u2019s total community benefit for 2013 \u2014 the most recent year available \u2014 was about $54 million, including almost $30 in charity care.\n\n\u201cWe feel that anything that strengthens Memorial Health will further our mission and allow the community access to health care and the community benefit of the institution,\u201d Waters said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNational trend\n\nThe trend nationally, and in Georgia, is for independent hospitals to seek partners to help them stay competitive, Gill said.\n\n\u201cThis is happening all around us and all around the country,\u201d she said. \u201cWe believe this is a proactive step to be able to grow and expand.\u201d\n\nThe board will act only if it can find an appropriate partner, she said, adding there is no guarantee it will be in place by year\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cThis is a board decision,\u201d Gill said. \u201cWe want to get ahead of the curve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not at a point where we can provide any further details,\u201d Gill said, adding it is a process that involves many stakeholders.\n\nThose include several major donors:\n\n\u2022 Curtis and Elizabeth Anderson: The Curtis and Elizabeth Anderson Cancer Institute at Memorial University Medical Center\n\n\u2022 Judith Thomas Solomon: The Heart and Vascular Institute at Memorial\n\n\u2022 Gulfstream Aerospace: Children\u2019s Wellness Program\n\n\u2022 Greg Parker and Parker\u2019s Emergency and Trauma Center at Memorial\n\nMemorial also has forged clinical partnerships with several regional hospitals, including Meadows Regional Medical Center in Vidalia, Bacon County Hospital in Alma, Jeff Davis Hospital in Hazlehurst and Liberty Regional Medical Center in Hinesville.\n\nAdditional factors include a reduction in the number of uninsured patients as more people enroll in health exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, affiliations with regional partners such as HealthSouth and Apple Care urgent care, and increases in the number of residents and facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nGill factor\n\nGill, who became president/CEO in April 2011, inherited a $27 million gross operating loss at the end of a string of five years when the system operated in the red.\n\nWithin a year, Gill and the board were able to report a $29.1 million turnaround and an operating income of $1.5 million with a system net income of $4.8 million.\n\nBut Gill repeatedly has cautioned that margins were slim and would need constant attention to preserve the turnaround.\n\nKey to the financial picture have been repeated reductions in reimbursements for services the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, federal budget issues, high-deductible health care plans and penalties having to do with patients who have to return to the hospital after receiving care.\n\nOver a six-year period beginning in 2013, Memorial will have lost $42 million in reimbursements, Gill said.\n\nMemorial University Medical Center timeline:\n\n\u2022 1955- Memorial Hospital of Chatham County opens doors as a 300-bed general hospital on Waters
