Ted Cruz (R-TX) is calling out President Obama for being a hypocritical Nobel Peace Prize winner. Cruz introduced a bill to rename the plaza in front of the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. the \u201cLiu Xiaobo Plaza\u201d to honor the memory of pro-democracy dissident Dr. Liu Xiaobo. It passed unanimously in the Senate on Friday. Yet, the White House was clearly not impressed with Cruz\u2019s efforts, likening his bill to a \u201clegislative stunt.\u201d There are other, more productive ways to improve human rights in China and around the world, an official argued.\n\nCruz pushed back in an emailed statement Wednesday morning, arguing that the Obama administration is demonstrating once again their \u201ceagerness to coddle an authoritarian Communist regime.\u201d\n\nThe most ironic part about Obama threatening to veto Cruz\u2019s bill, the senator notes, is that, like the president, Xiaobo was also a Peace Prize winner back in 2010.\n\n\u201cSadly, President Obama and his administration would rather stand with the communist Chinese than with Dr. Liu, whose only crime was to peacefully protest for basic political freedoms. What Obama and Clinton didn't understand in 2009 and they don't understand today is that the moral high ground enjoyed by the United States is an advantage when dealing with a country like China, not something to be voluntarily abandoned. How ironic it is that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate is threatening to veto a bill honoring the 2010 one. The PRC should be on notice that the obsequiousness of the U.S. administration will end in January, 2017.\u201d\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize coalition received an overwhelming amount of criticism for granting Obama the award in 2009. The panel itself eventually came to regret the decision, noting that they should have considered Obama's past accomplishments instead of hoping the title would boost his future efforts.\n\nAnd now, according to a new memoir by the former director of Norway\u2019s Nobel Institute, the committee believes it may have made a mistake. \u201c[We] thought it would strengthen Obama and it didn\u2019t have this effect,\u201d Geil Lundestad told the Associated Press in an interview..\n\nBy ignoring Cruz\u2019s important piece of legislation that honors a man who fearlessly promoted freedom, Obama continues to prove that he didn\u2019t deserve that Nobel Laureate title.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He may have a point..05/27/2016 10:11:33AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "He may have a point.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien -  Cruz: It\u2019s Hypocritical for Nobel Peace Prize Winner Obama To Dishonor Chinese Dissident", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/02/17/cruz-its-hypocritical-for-nobel-peace-prize-winner-obama-to-dishonor-chinese-dissidents-n2120660", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/47/010624bf-a0c7-48bc-91b5-7e13fcb6dcde.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "He may have a point.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien -  Cruz: It\u2019s Hypocritical for Nobel Peace Prize Winner Obama To Dishonor Chinese Dissident", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/02/17/cruz-its-hypocritical-for-nobel-peace-prize-winner-obama-to-dishonor-chinese-dissidents-n2120660", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/47/010624bf-a0c7-48bc-91b5-7e13fcb6dcde.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Cruz: It\u2019s Hypocritical for Nobel Peace Prize Winner Obama To Dishonor Chinese Dissident, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Presidential candidate Sen.
