administration pointing to North Korea as the culprit behind the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment is hardly conclusive, a number of private security researchers told The New York Times.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nLast week, both President Obama and the FBI accused North Korea of hacking Sony\u2019s computer systems.\n\nObama said he would take action, pledging a \u201cproportional response\u201d a few hours before North Korea\u2019s Internet went offline.\n\nNorth Korea denies any involvement in the Sony hack, called Obama \u201ca monkey\u201d and accused the U.S. of shutting down its Internet.\n\nBreitbart News reports that \u201ccomputational linguists at Taia Global, a group of cyber security consultants, performed a linguistic analysis of online messages from the Guardians of Peace, and concluded that, based on translation errors and phrasing, the group is more likely Russian than Korean.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration alleges that the cyberattack against Sony was in retaliation for \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a comedy film depicting a satirical plot to assassinate Kim Jong-Un, North Korea\u2019s leader.\n\n\u201cSecurity researchers remain skeptical, with some even likening the government\u2019s claims to those of the Bush administration in the build-up to the Iraq war,\u201d reports The New York Times.\n\nThe article adds:\n\n\u201cFueling their suspicions is the fact that the government based its findings, in large part, on evidence that it will not release, citing the \u2018need to protect sensitive sources and methods.\u2019 The government has never publicly acknowledged doing so, but the National Security Agency has begun a major effort to penetrate North Korean computer networks.\u201d\n\nSecurity researchers suggest more proof is necessary to make a conclusive determination on who was behind the cyberattack.\n\n\u201cEssentially, we are being left in a position where we are expected to just take agency promises at face value,\u201d Marc Rogers, a security researcher at CloudFlare, a top mobile security company, wrote in a Dec. 24 post for The Daily Beast. \u201cIn the current climate, that is a big ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Rogers, who doubles as the director of security operations for DefCon, an annual hacker convention, and others like Bruce Schneier, a prominent cryptographer and blogger, have been mining the meager evidence that has been publicly circulated, and argue that it is hardly conclusive,\u201d notes the Times.\n\nThe article points out that some private security researchers do support the government\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike, a California security firm that has been tracking the same group that attacked Sony since 2006, believes they are located in North Korea and have been hacking targets in South Korea for years,\u201d reports the Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers Question Obama's Claim That North Korea Hacked Sony",
