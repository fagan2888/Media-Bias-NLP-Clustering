To qualify for the maximum amount of state tax credits, Ford agreed that it would have to spend an additional $3.1 billion over the next 10 years on its Michigan sites. According to the Detroit Free Press, those investments must be \u201cmostly focused on manufacturing\u201d and solely on electric car development. As its name suggests, the REC campus is not a manufacturing site, so it is difficult to know if the tax deal will have any impact on Ford\u2019s plans.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ford\u2019s Media Center website, the Dearborn REC focuses on \u201cadvanced electronics, human-machine interface, materials science, big data and analytics.\u201d Although locally-known as the REC, it is one of three of the company\u2019s \u201cResearch and Innovation Centers.\u201d The other two are located in Aachen, Germany and Palo Alto, Calif., according to the site.\n\n\n\nBarry Murray, director of Dearborn\u2019s Department of Economic and Community Development, said he had not heard the rumor, but any investment in a Dearborn business is good for the city. The REC is located within the triangle of Rotunda Drive, Village Road and Oakwood Boulevard. That location puts it within two to three miles of the John D. Dingell Transit Center and the west downtown Dearborn shopping district. The main entrance to the REC faces that of The Henry Ford on Oakwood Boulevard.\n\n\n\nIf Ford does invest in the REC, it will only further enhance the city\u2019s existing plans for this area, said Murray. Murray was referring to the city\u2019s 2030 Master Plan, which was published in September. The plan calls for transit-oriented development around the transit center and transitioning the shopping districts into \u201ctown centers.\u201d Transit-oriented development and town centers are intended to be mixed-use development sites with \u201cpedestrian orientation.\u201d\n\n\n\nFord\u2019s potential investment in REC is a \u201cfight for an industry,\u201d said Mike Kirk, an architect for Neumann/Smith Architecture and a former chair of the Dearborn Area Chamber of Commerce\u2019s board of directors. Ford\u2019s adversaries in this fight are Silicon Valley tech companies, according to Kirk. \u201cTo win the war for the driverless car,\u201d he said, Ford needs the \u201cbest IT geeks in the world\u201d to work in Dearborn. Ford knows its \u201c1950s vintage\u201d workspaces will not attract that kind of talent, said Kirk.\n\n\n\nA single site overhaul will not be enough, though. Ford needs to \u201creinvent the home where their R&D gets done,\u201d he said. \u201cDearborn has the potential to be more cosmopolitan\u201d than Detroit, said Kirk. As evidence, he highlighted the city\u2019s cultural diversity of people, food, and music; its \u201cstrong blue and white collar heritage;\u201d its \u201cworld class waterway;\u201d and its \u201cgreenways.\u201d Most importantly, Kirk said, Dearborn needs to be thought of as a \u201cregional transportation hub.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe new transit center is creating a buzz, said Jackie Lovejoy, president of the Dearborn Area Chamber of Commerce. Because of its larger size and new location along Michigan Avenue, people can see how busy it is, and they are surprised, she said. Yet, said Lovejoy, the ridership of 80,000 to 100,000 per year is the same as at the old train station. Lovejoy expects those numbers to increase when the pending high-speed commuter rail, linking Ann Arbor with Detroit, is completed.\n\n\n\nFord\u2019s potential investment in the REC coincides with a real estate awakening in Dearborn. Many of Dearborn\u2019s commercial properties had been \u201ctied up in a four-year bankruptcy,\u201d said Lovejoy. It is only within the last year that they are coming out of receivership, she said. In her two years on the job, Lovejoy said Dearborn has not lacked for interested businesses, but the properties were not available. 1\n\n2\n\nSee Full Story It is rumored that Ford Motor Co.plans to invest $1 billion in its Research and Engineering Center campus. Unnamed real estate sources told Crain\u2019s Detroit Business that Ford issued a request for proposal in November. Crain\u2019s obtained a copy of the RFP which called for the creation of a 10-year master plan for the REC campus. The RFP called for ultramodern buildings, footpaths, relocating workers from other sites to the REC, and energy-conscious infrastructure, according to the business publication..An inquiry submitted by the Press & Guide was directed to Dawn Booker of Ford Land, Ford\u2019s real estate arm.
