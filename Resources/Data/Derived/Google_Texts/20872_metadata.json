(AP) - A northeastern Indiana lawmaker who was defeated in May\u2019s Republican primary amid a backlash over her vote that helped keep a gay marriage ban off Indiana\u2019s November ballot has resigned from her seat to join a medical industry trade group.\n\nState Rep. Kathy Heuer, R-Columbia City, announced her resignation Friday to become executive director of the Indiana Medical Device Manufacturing Council, which lobbies state and federal lawmakers and regulators on behalf of medical device companies.\n\nHeuer had served as District 83 representative since 2010, representing parts of Allen and Whitley counties. She lost her re-election bid in the Republican primary in May to Christopher Judy, a Fort Wayne union autoworker who received help from tea party groups. His name will appear on the November ballot.\n\nHeuer had faced a backlash over her vote that helped keep a gay marriage ban off Indiana\u2019s November ballot, as well as her votes to support the Common Core education standards that Indiana pulled out of earlier this year.\n\nHeuer said Friday she doesn\u2019t want to play the what-if game in regard to her votes and primary loss. She said that loss gave her the opportunity to actively seek a new position, The Journal Gazette reported (http://bit.ly/1AHDT2L ).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met some wonderful people and had some wonderful learning opportunities,\u201d Heuer said of her time as a lawmaker.\n\nHeuer said now that she\u2019s joining the medical device lobbying group, she will abide by a state law that requires former lawmakers to refrain from any lobbying for 365 days.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d she told the newspaper.\n\nHeuer believes her background in business, education, sales and government policy helped her land her new post. She said education and business often work together to prepare the workforce needed for economic growth and sustain high-paying manufacturing jobs.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Journal Gazette, http://www.journalgazette.net", "article_metadata": {"description": "A northeastern Indiana lawmaker who was defeated in May's Republican primary amid a backlash over her vote that helped keep a gay marriage ban off Indiana's November ballot has resigned from her seat to join a medical industry trade group.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/23/state-rep-heuer-resigns-post-after-primary-defeat/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A northeastern Indiana lawmaker who was defeated in May\u2019s Republican primary amid a backlash over her vote that helped keep a gay marriage ban off Indiana\u2019s November ballot has resigned from her seat to join a medical industry trade group.", "title": "State Rep.
