Today, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) added a new page to HealthCare.gov directly addressing issues facing transgender people accessing health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

This page provides consumers with guidance regarding successful application for marketplace coverage, as well as information describing important new rights of transgender patients under the ACA. Under the ACA market place, health plans must provide preventative care including routine shots and screenings. As this new page makes clear, the ACA also requires plans toprovide all sex-specific preventative services available that are medically appropriate. This means that under the ACA a plan can't limit a preventative service like a pap smear, mammogram, or prostate exam, based on an individual's sex assigned at birth, gender identity, or their recorded gender. This page also provides important information for transgender consumers regarding plan exclusions. In addition to encouraging consumers to investigate a plan's coverage prior to enrolling, HHS also urges consumers to report incidents of discrimination by carriers to the Office of Civil Rights.

HRC applauds HHS for providing this new tool. Educating and informing transgender consumers about their rights under the law is critical to fully implementing these protections, and moves us one step closer to ending discrimination in healthcare.
