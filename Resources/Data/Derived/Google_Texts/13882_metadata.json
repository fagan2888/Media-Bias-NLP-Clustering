It\u2019s just a fun place to come in and eat.\u201d\n\nBut come Dec. 27, the midtown Nashville location of the restaurant, one of two Loventhal owns, will be closing its doors in part because of Obamacare, he said.\n\n\u201cHaving more than 50 full-time employees means you have to comply with the Affordable Care Act, and it was an unknown risk of how much it was going to cost,\u201d he told The Daily Signal. \u201cBut it was going to be significant, and take a lot of time and labor to take care of the transition and the reporting and the forms.\u201d\n\nLoventhal originally planned to shutter the location within the first few months of 2016 after a developer purchased the building where Noshville\u2019s has sat for the last 19 years.\n\nBut when Loventhal learned he would be faced with the added expense of providing his more than 50 employees with health insurance come Jan. 1\u2014he estimated it would cost between $70,000 and $100,000 annually\u2014Loventhal decided to close Noshville\u2019s doors before the provision of Obamacare overseeing businesses, the employer mandate, goes fully into effect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an onerous bill, and for a small business, it\u2019s a lot of time [to comply],\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been studying this for three years, and I really couldn\u2019t come up with a good answer, and I feel sorry for closing this business.\u201d\n\nA \u2018Healthy Dose of Reality\u2019\n\nUnder Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate, businesses with more than 50 employees working more than 30 hours per week will be required to provide health insurance to its workers.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2015, the employer mandate went into effect for businesses with more than 100 employees, and on Jan. 1, 2016, those rules will apply for those with more than 50 employees.\n\nSo far, the effects of the law differ according to who one talks to: President Obama and congressional Democrats argue Obamacare has caused the uninsured rate to drop to unprecedented levels. Republicans, meanwhile, say Americans are facing higher premiums and deductibles because of the law, and businesses are grappling with how to abide by its costly mandates.\n\n\u201cI want to go to their districts and hear what their constituents are saying,\u201d Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., told The Daily Signal of her democratic colleagues. \u201cThey can\u2019t be saying things so differently than what I\u2019m hearing in my district. Are they really listening? Are they going out in the community and listening to the everyday working person and the small business employers? Are they going out and hearing it?\u201d\n\nBlack, who represents Nashville\u2019s neighboring 6th Congressional District, spoke about Noshville on the House floor earlier this week and said the deli serves Democrats a \u201cgood meal and a healthy dose of reality\u201d regarding the impact of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI hear from especially the small business owners about how difficult the health care coverage is for them. They\u2019re trying their best, but they\u2019re also having insurance companies come into the office saying they\u2019re going to have to increase their employees\u2019 premiums by 35 percent which means they have a decision to make,\u201d she said. Black continued:\n\nDo they pass that [added cost] onto the employee? Do they take that up themselves? And many of them are saying, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve done that for the last couple of years where we absorb these increases, but we can\u2019t afford to keep on doing that.\u2019 And so they\u2019re having to pass them on to the employees.\n\nIn addition to Noshville\u2019s decision to close, Black pointed to a recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office as further proof of Obamacare\u2019s negative effects on the labor market.\n\nAccording to the CBO, 2 million workers will decide to leave the workforce in 2025 because of the health care law and the incentives it gives people not to work.\n\n\u201cSome people would choose to work fewer hours; others would leave the labor force entirely or remain unemployed for longer than they otherwise would,\u201d the CBO said in its report.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Ed Haislmaier, a health policy expert at The Heritage Foundation, said the employer mandate\u2019s impact on smaller businesses, or those with more than 50 employees, will likely vary by company.\n\nA 55-person law firm, for example, may not feel the effects of the law too strongly, particularly if the cost of health care goes up for its employees. By contrast, businesses like a restaurant with lower-wage workers and smaller margins would be impacted more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant increase in the business\u2019 labor cost, and that may have an adverse affect on the economics and profitability of the business,\u201d Haislmaier said.\n\nSome businesses, he continued, may be forced to alter their hiring practices or scheduling of employees to ease the burdens of the employer mandate.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the squeeze comes,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you do what you\u2019re doing today by reducing your labor elsewhere, getting by with fewer people, shifting them from full time to part time, or do you think that the customers can bear a price increase to cover the cost?\u201d\n\nTo mitigate the negative effects of the employer mandate, Haislmaier said the entire health care law would have to be dismantled, which Republicans in Congress have come one step closer to doing.\n\nBlack and her fellow GOP lawmakers have been working to roll back the health care law since its implementation, and for the first time, the Senate passed a reconciliation package repealing key provisions of Obamacare, including the employer mandate.\n\nThe Tennessee Republican said she\u2019s confident the House will take up and pass the Senate\u2019s version of the bill, sending the Affordable Care Act\u2019s repeal to Obama.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be taking that back up and passing it and putting it onto the president\u2019s desk and letting him make that decision about how this is hurting people,\u201d Black said.
