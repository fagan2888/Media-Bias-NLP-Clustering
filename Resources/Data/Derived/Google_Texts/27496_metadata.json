City officials expected to spend $426,000 on ballpark subsidies during the last fiscal year, according to court papers.\n\nThe Stockton Ports were shut out 11-0 on Monday by the Modesto Nuts in their final game of the season, ending the year with a 69-71 record.\n\nAccording to negotiation documents written before Stockton filed for bankruptcy last year, city officials wanted to tweak the team\u2019s 25-year lease, along with the city\u2019s other sports-related agreements, to cut their roughly $1.2 million annual cost in half.\n\nBut before pressing for cuts, Stockton\u2019s bankruptcy attorneys said they need more information\u2014such as average paid attendance and ticket prices\u2014from the Stockton Ports\u2019 owner, 7th Inning Stretch LLC. After team officials didn\u2019t respond to information requests, city bankruptcy attorneys requested to use the examination power of the bankruptcy court to force that information.\n\n\u201cIn order to determine the best course of action, the city requires basic financial information regarding the performance of the Ports and their use of the stadium under the agreement,\u201d the city\u2019s attorneys said in court papers.\n\nSince the city\u2019s bankruptcy, Stockton leaders have tried to cut back expenses, including those owed to retired firefighters, police officers and city workers. (Hard times in Detroit have prompted discussions over whether now is the appropriate time to spend $650 million on a new home for the Detroit Red Wings hockey team.)\n\nThe team\u2019s ballpark, which can seat more than 5,200 fans, has been blamed for some of the city\u2019s financial problems. City leaders built the stadium and a 10,000-seat arena in 2005 as they tried to revitalize its downtown waterfront with the 24-acre project.\n\nThe complex is losing money and \u201crequires a significant general fund subsidy just to remain in operation,\u201d city officials said in court papers.\n\nBut according to Stockton\u2019s pre-bankruptcy papers, municipal bondholders who extended more than $45 million for the project are expected to be fully repaid by the city, unlike other bondholders who could be forced to take less than what they\u2019re owed as a result of the city\u2019s bankruptcy.\n\nCity officials are preparing to file a bankruptcy-exit plan within weeks that could show exactly how the city will cut its debts and stabilize its operations. If the city makes those cuts without bondholders\u2019 consent, Stockton would be the first city to use the power of Chapter 9 to make involuntary cuts on bondholders.\n\nThe city, located about 80 miles inland from San Francisco, was declared to be \u201cground zero\u201d for the subprime-mortgage crisis by Judge Klein. He also blamed the city\u2019s financial woes on former leaders who had offered overly generous pay to city workers.\n\nSince the case began on June 28, 2012, Stockton leaders have been pressured to sell off city hall even after officials imposed harsh cuts on its departments and its roughly 1,300 workers in recent years.\n\nCity attorneys have said Stockton, which ranks as one of the state\u2019s most dangerous cities, employs about 1.2 police officers for every 1,000 residents\u2014a ratio almost half of what is recommended by a national study.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
