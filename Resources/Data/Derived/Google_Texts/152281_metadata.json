Fuller Torrey, founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center, told Kaiser Health News. \u201cWe are doing an abysmal job of treating people with serious mental illnesses in this country. It is both inhumane and shocking the way we have dumped them into the state prisons and the local jails.\u201d\n\nThe report found 44 states and the District of Columbia have at least one jail that holds more people coping with a mental illness than the largest state psychiatric hospital in the US does.\n\nAs states have drastically cut funding for mental health services in the last several years, the number of available beds in psychiatric hospitals has plunged to the lowest level since 1850.\n\nThus, many of these patients are shuffled into the prison system simply because there is nowhere else for them to go. The US prison population has steadily increased as mental health funding has decreased, the National Alliance on Mental Illness has found.\n\nPrisoners with mental health issues are often put in solitary confinement for long periods of time, stay incarcerated longer than other prisoners, and are disproportionately abused, beaten, and raped by other inmates, the new report noted. Without treatment, the condition of ill inmates often worsens.\n\nSince 1970, the percentage of prisoners with mental illnesses in each state has risen an average of about 5 to 20 percent, the report found.\n\n\u201cThere is not a single state in the United States where you want to go to a jail or prison and be severely mentally ill,\u201d said Torrey.\n\nState laws often hamper care that a facility can offer a prisoner.\n\n\u201cJail officials can thus be legally sued in many states if they forcibly medicate mentally ill prisoners without their consent, yet can also be held legally responsible for the consequences of such prisoners\u2019 psychotic behavior,\u201d including suicide, the report said.\n\nThough, ultimately, prisons and jails are not equipped to handle those that need mental health treatment, especially those that are persistent in refusing the reduced care that an incarceration facility can offer, the report found.\n\n\u201cWe have placed more than 300,000 severely mentally ill individuals in prisons and jails that are neither equipped nor staffed to handle such problems,\u201d the report stated. \u201cWe subsequently have made it very difficult to treat the mentally ill inmates, put restriction on other options for controlling their behavior, and then blamed the prison and jail administrators when they fail. It is a situation that is grossly unfair to both the inmates and the corrections officials and should be the subject of public outrage and official action.\u201d\n\nAnother recent study found that housing mental health patients in jails is not cheaper than funding hospitals, as many states have insisted. Giving adequate psychiatric mental health care saves money over time and keeps patients out of jail, according to researchers from North Carolina State University and the University of South Florida.\n\nThinkProgress noted that many states have refused to expand Medicaid coverage offered through the federal Affordable Care Act, thus preventing around 1.2 million Americans from receiving mental health care, according to the National Alliance on Mental Health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 356,000 people with mental illnesses are incarcerated in the United States, as opposed to around 35,000 receiving treatment in state hospitals, a new study found, highlighting the dire state of the nation\u2019s mental health care system.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "More than 356,000 people with mental illnesses are incarcerated in the United States, as opposed to around 35,000 receiving treatment in state hospitals, a new study found, highlighting the dire state of the nation\u2019s mental health care system.", "title": "\u200bUS prisons hold 10 times more mentally ill people than state hospitals \u2013 report", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/24/ef/10/00/us-prisons-hold-10-times-more-mentally-ill-people-than-state-hospitals.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/mental-illness-jail-hospital-281/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "More than 356,000 people with mental illnesses are incarcerated in the United States, as opposed to around 35,000 receiving treatment in state hospitals, a new study found, highlighting the dire state of the nation\u2019s mental health care system.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/24/ef/10/00/us-prisons-hold-10-times-more-mentally-ill-people-than-state-hospitals.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The US prison population has steadily increased as mental health funding has decreased, the National Alliance on Mental Illness has found.\nGiving adequate psychiatric mental health care saves money over time and keeps patients out of jail, according to researchers from North Carolina State University and the University of South Florida.\nThinkProgress noted that many states have refused to expand Medicaid coverage offered through the federal Affordable Care Act, thus preventing around 1.2 million Americans from receiving mental health care, according to the National Alliance on Mental Health.\nAs states have drastically cut funding for mental health services in the last several years, the number of available beds in psychiatric hospitals has plunged to the lowest level since 1850.\nMore than 356,000 people with mental illnesses are incarcerated in the United States, as opposed to around 35,000 receiving treatment in state hospitals, a new study found, highlighting the dire state of the nation\u2019s mental health care system."}
