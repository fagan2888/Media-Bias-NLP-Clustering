But it doesn\u2019t have to.\n\nBy historical standards, health spending growth has been low since 2002. As the federal and state governments expand health insurance coverage, will this relatively low growth continue? The answer depends in large part on how investments in health care technology are encouraged.\n\nHealth economists have shown that both insurance expansion and technology drive health spending upward. A few studies have teased out a deeper relationship between the two: By increasing the market for health care products (like prescription drugs and medical devices), coverage expansion encourages investment in health sector research and development. And, depending on what technologies are subsequently brought to the market, this can lead to more costly, though often better, care.\n\nBy increasing coverage, the Affordable Care Act will expand the market for prescription drugs and medical devices, so we might expect growth in new products. For example, Daron Acemoglu and Joshua Linn, in a study published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, found that a 1 percent increase in a drug category\u2019s potential market size was associated with a 6 percent increase in the number of new drugs entering the market in that category.\n\nWe might also expect to spend more for new health technology encouraged by coverage expansion. Indeed, the expectation of greater drug and device manufacturers\u2019 revenue was an argument for Obamacare\u2019s reduction in prices paid for prescription drugs by government programs and its excise tax on medical devices. (Though in reality, consumers, not the medical device industry, will pay most of that excise tax.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut it need not be the case that technology encouraged by coverage expansion increases per person costs. In an insightful paper published in 1991 in the Journal of Economic Literature, Burton Weisbrod distinguished between two types of health care technologies: those that enhance quality at potentially high cost and those that reduce cost without substantially sacrificing quality. Historically, quality-enhancing but cost-increasing innovations were relatively common, particularly before the managed care era of the 1990s. Studies from the 1980s found that when hospitals competed, they tried to outdo each other on high-cost amenities and technologies rather than reduce prices.\n\nThis \u201cmedical arms race\u201d partly explains the historical rapid growth in health care spending. However, it\u2019s also the case that much of health care\u2019s cost-increasing technology increased the quality of health care. In the New England Journal of Medicine, David Cutler, Allison Rosen and Sandeep Vijan showed that from 1960 through 2000, life expectancy grew almost seven years and at a cost of nearly $20,000 per year of life gained. The vast majority of gains were because of improvements in care for high-risk, premature infants and better treatments for cardiovascular disease, both of which can be costly.\n\nPhoto\n\nHistory also offers examples of cost-reducing health care technology. Some did not degrade quality. For instance, when Medicare reduced payments for kidney dialysis in the mid-1970s, new equipment emerged that halved treatment time, saving labor costs. Others sacrificed quality. When changes to Medicare payment policy in the early 1980s made cochlear implants less profitable, 3M ceased making them and ended research on a more advanced, and presumably more costly, model.\n\nSo how, historically, have policy makers and insurers driven health care costs downward? Mr. Weisbrod argued that shifting the cost risk onto providers is one traditional means. For instance, H.M.O.s that did so were more likely to encourage investment in cost-reducing health care technologies. Additionally, paying a fixed, diagnosis-based price for treatment \u2014 as Medicare began to do in the early 1980s, with private insurers following \u2014 increased the profitability of drugs that substitute for more costly treatments, like beta blockers instead of coronary bypass surgery and cimetidine instead of ulcer surgery.\n\nWhat does all of this suggest about the future of health care spending growth? We know that coverage expansion increases the profitability of certain kinds of health care technology. The market for costly but effective new drugs for hepatitis C \u2014 Sovaldi and Harvoni \u2014 is certainly larger under coverage expansion than it would otherwise be. Correspondingly, revenue of Gilead Sciences, the drugs\u2019 manufacturer, has soared, along with its stock price.\n\nBut we also know that the new cost-conscious climate could put the brakes on other kinds of costly technology. Medicare\u2019s Accountable Care Organizations \u2014 which incentivize cost saving by providers \u2014 higher cost sharing for the privately insured, and other new arrangements between private insurers and providers all might slow the adoption of certain high-cost medical devices.\n\nOne example is the proton beam accelerator, used to treat certain kinds of cancer. Construction of facilities for them has grown in recent years. Proton beams can substitute for more traditional radiation treatment of prostate cancer, but at twice the cost and with no evidence of better outcomes. For this reason, insurers like Blue Shield of California and Aetna have stopped covering it, and others may follow.\n\nPutting these and other factors together, Amitabh Chandra, Jonathan Holmes and Jonathan Skinner, in a paper for the Brookings Institution, made a quantitative prediction. Health spending will grow at a pace above that of the overall economy, but slower \u2014 1.2 percent above gross domestic product \u2014 than it has historically \u2014 2.4 percent \u2014 though the authors also express caution about this prediction.\n\nThe uncertainty in predictions like this is vigorously debated in health policy circles. Will deductibles and other cost sharing continue to grow larger, hold steady or decrease, for example? Higher cost sharing would weaken the market for certain new health care technologies. Another issue is the payment level of Medicaid programs, which has typically been well below that of private plans and Medicare, leading to reduced access to care for Medicaid enrollees. (A temporary increase in Medicaid payments for primary care expired at the end of December.) Lower Medicaid payments would reduce the rate of adoption of technologies applicable to the population it serves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe may not be able to precisely predict the extent to which health care technology will drive health spending in the future. What\u2019s clear, however, is that changes in technologies brought about by the shifting market for them will play a central role in health care spending growth in the future.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150309103049, "twitter": {"description": "The ability to sustain lower growth in costs will depend in large part on how investments in health care technology are encouraged.", "title": "In Forecasting Health Costs, Let Technology Be Your Guide", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/in-forecasting-health-costs-let-technology-be-your-guide.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003545789"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "afrakt", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/10/upshot/10UP-Health/10UP-Health-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/in-forecasting-health-costs-let-technology-be-your-guide.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003545789", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/in-forecasting-health-costs-let-technology-be-your-guide.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 9, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Drugs (Pharmaceuticals),Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Innovation,Medical Devices,Medicare,Medicaid", "news_keywords": "Medicare,Medicaid", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Austin Frakt", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/10/upshot/10UP-Health/10UP-Health-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By AUSTIN FRAKT", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The ability to sustain lower growth in costs will depend in large part on how investments in health care technology are encouraged.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/10/upshot/10UP-Health/10UP-Health-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The ability to sustain lower growth in costs will depend in large part on how investments in health care technology are encouraged.", "CN": "the-new-health-care", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 9, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-08-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Medicaid", "published": "2015-03-09", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "10up-health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150824154617, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/upshot/in-forecasting-health-costs-let-technology-be-your-guide.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/10/upshot/10UP-Health/10UP-Health-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The ability to sustain lower growth in costs will depend in large part on how investments in health care technology are encouraged.", "title": "In Forecasting Health Costs, Let Technology Be Your Guide"}, "pdate": 20150309, "des": "Medicaid", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "news", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/the-new-health-care", "tagline": "Informed by research, Austin Frakt and Aaron Carroll explore and explain the changing landscape of health care.", "uri": "/column/the-new-health-care", "display-name": "The New Health Care", "identifier": "the-new-health-care", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003545789, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "In Forecasting Health Costs, Let Technology Be Your Guide", "col": "The New Health Care", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "The expansion of health care insurance can drive the development of new technologies that can drive up health care spending.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyWe may not be able to precisely predict the extent to which health care technology will drive health spending in the future.\nThe answer depends in large part on how investments in health care technology are encouraged.\nHealth economists have shown that both insurance expansion and technology drive health spending upward.\nHowever, it\u2019s also the case that much of health care\u2019s cost-increasing technology increased the quality of health care."}
