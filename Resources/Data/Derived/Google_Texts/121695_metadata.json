For Sioux falls bike enthusiasts, it\u2019s perfect ingredients for an afternoon bike ride. The Ride began in 1987, and local bike shop Spoke-n-Sport has kept the tradition going strong. However, this year the purpose of the ride is a little different. Owner Chad Pickard explains what separates the 2014 ride from years past. \"This year were doing something a little different. We want to get some clothes and bikes to donate to the Center of Hope, and also we\u2019re suggesting that if you can, a five dollar donation will go a long way to that charity,\" said Pickard.\n\nLed by a police escort, the riders traveled around Sioux Falls and toured the city in unique New Year\u2019s Day fashion. Although it was cold, slushy, and at times slow, you can bet the riders themselves look forward this event. They feel it\u2019s the perfect way to pedal into 2014. \"Oh yeah, I\u2019m logging this first ride. It will be part of the yearly total for 2014. I\u2019m excited to get in that first 10 or 15 miles in today. It will be great,\" said Phil Tau.\n\nThe Riders were bundled up in flashy gear and many looked forward to the challenge of riding in these winter conditions. Pickard says regardless of your set of wheels or sense of style, the importance of the ride comes back to two main ideas. Giving back locally and increasing awareness about the great cycling community. \"This year the purpose is to give to the Center of Hope, but also to create more cycling community. We have a great community in-town among cyclists, if there\u2019s ever a need it seems like it gets taken care of, it\u2019s just a really good group,\" says Pickard.\n\nAfter the ride everyone gathered back at Spoke-n-Sport for hot coco, apple cider, and chilli \u2013 a great way to warm up after a chilly afternoon.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Subzero temperatures, snow falling, and ice cover.
