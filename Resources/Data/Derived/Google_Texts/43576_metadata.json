Trial courts in these states had previously reversed the bans on same-sex marriage and recognition of marriages performed in other states.\n\nThis is the first time an appeals court has sided against marriage rights. Now that there\u2019s a circuit split\u2014all other appeals courts to hear these cases have ruled in favor of same-sex marriage\u2014the issue could head to the Supreme Court.\n\nWhile acknowledging that gay and lesbian people face discrimination in the United States, Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote in his opinion that \u201cthe institution of marriage arose independently of this record of discrimination. The traditional definition of marriage goes back thousands of years and spans almost every society in history. By contrast, \u2018American laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until the last third of the 20th century.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSame-sex marriage should be decided by states, rather than courts, Sutton wrote.\n\nIn the dissenting opinion, Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey pointed out that the ruling will likely have the effect of pushing the issue to the Supreme Court: \u201cBecause the correct result is so obvious, one is tempted to speculate that the majority has purposefully taken the contrary position to create the circuit split regarding the legality of same-sex marriage that could prompt a grant of certiorari by the Supreme Court and an end to the uncertainty of status and the interstate chaos that the current discrepancy in state laws threatens.\u201d\n\nIn other news\u2026\n\nGOP Takes Aim at Obamacare: Some Republicans attribute their midterm success to promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
