HealthCare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan called the new rules a "major overhaul of the special enrollment process," which "will enhance program integrity and contribute to a stable rate environment."



The new rules are a reaction to insurers' claims that many uninsured people who were not signing up for health coverage during the open enrollment period were using special enrollment periods to enroll in health plans once they got sick or otherwise needed medical treatments, only to drop that coverage once they received treatment that their plan paid for.

Insurers said that practice was hurting the profitability of their Obamacare plans because people who used the special enrollment periods in that manner were costing more in benefits paid out than what the customers paid in in premiums.

America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, responded to the announcement of rules by saying, "This new documentation process is a much-needed step in the right direction."

"While we are still reviewing the operational details, including the timing associated with verification, this latest effort will ensure qualified enrollees have access to coverage during important life transitions while also cutting down on the abuse and misuse of special enrollment periods which lead to higher costs for consumers," said Clare Krusing, AHIP's spokeswoman.
