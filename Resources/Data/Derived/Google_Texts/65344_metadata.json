The homes are intended to care for relatively independent, healthy seniors, but that doesn\u2019t describe a lot of the people living in them today.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a seismic shift in the population they serve,\u201d says Deborah Schoch of the California HealthCare Foundation Center for Health Reporting. Schoch says the system was set up to meet the needs of people who could use some extra help with the tasks of daily living \u2013- and it does. But many of those people need a lot of help.\n\nThe system, she says, is caring for people \u201cwho are frail, who may have dementia, who may be wheelchair bound, who may not be able to turn on their own in bed.\u201d\n\nAssisted living facilities are not designed to deliver skilled nursing care, and they do not typically have people with those qualifications on staff. There are no staff-to-resident ratios or many of the other rules that govern nursing homes. While many assisted living facilities do a fine job of delivering care, others are overwhelmed \u2013- or worse. Schoch was the lead reporter for a series called \u201cDeadly Neglect\u201d that detailed 27 deaths in San Diego County assisted living facilities from abuse and neglect.\n\n\u201cI worked with UT San Diego, and we were able to get access to a lot of inspection reports: deaths, injuries, elder abuse, people left on the floor for 48 hours in assisted living facilities in San Diego County.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s since come out with more stories detailing more troubling incidents, but that first series had a politically explosive effect. In San Diego, Supervisors voted to fund a special unit in the District Attorney\u2019s office to target crime in the facilities.\n\n[Related: Crime in Assisted Living: What Happens After]\n\nIn Sacramento, where regulations haven\u2019t changed much in close to 30 years, lawmakers held hearings featuring reform advocates like Aaron Byzak, who started a group called \u201cHazel\u2019s Army\u201d after his grandmother Hazel died in assisted living. \u201cIf somebody parked in my grandmother\u2019s disabled parking lot illegally, they\u2019d be fined $450,\u201d he told reporters in the state capitol. \u201cBut they kill her, and it\u2019s $150.\u201d\n\nLawmakers were also keenly aware of recent headlines from Castro Valley, where 14 bed-ridden residents were discovered abandoned after the state ordered the facility closed. It turned out the operators had a long list of violations.\n\nYou\u2019ll get no argument from the agency charged with oversight of these facilities that it\u2019s time for a revamp. A number of recommendations made in its last annual budget proposal mirror reform bills now pending in the legislature, such as raising the $150 maximum fine to $15,000, and upgrading the online database available to the public. That\u2019s not all. Pat Leary is the Chief Deputy Director of the California Department of Social Services.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to create a medical expertise unit, with a nurse,\u201d Leary said. \u201cWe\u2019re establishing a corporate accountability unit. There are a number of these facilities that are owned by corporations that are making decisions on a statewide basis. But the way that we track facilities is on a one-facility-at-a-time basis \u2014 we\u2019ve been missing trends.\u201d\n\nTwo women in San Diego were so frustrated with the lack of data and analysis, they created their own non-profit, and their own database for roughly 700 assisted living facilities in San Diego and Imperial Counties, as well as rural Northern California. CARR, the Consumer Advocates for RCFE Reform, (RCFE stands for residential care facility for the elderly) has managed to do what the state hasn\u2019t yet \u2013 build a publicly accessible online database with 30,000 documents, including inspection, complaint, and civil penalty reports. Their documents formed the basis of \u201cDeadly Neglect.\u201d\n\nCARR co-founder Christina Selder echoes a sentiment heard commonly among consumer advocates. \u201cWe find that they\u2019re more of a facility protection agency than a consumer protection agency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a number of cases where facilities will have repeat noncompliance meetings for atrocious activities,\u201d Selder said.\n\nWithout providing its name, she mentions a facility CARR uses as an example.\n\n\u201cThis particular facility had one resident who was left on the floor in their apartment for more than 24 hours and bled to death,\u201d she said. \u201cSame facility, a dementia resident who was unable to consent to have sexual relations with another resident but that repeatedly went on. There was a culture of fear among the staff, and so they weren\u2019t cooperating during the investigation with Department of Social Services. That was the third one for this facility. Now, this facility remains open today. There\u2019s no caution tape on the door.\u201d\n\nHer partner in CARR, Chris Murphy, chimes in. \u201cI mean it\u2019s almost like \u2018what do you have to do to get closed?'\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve developed some strong opinions after reviewing so many DSS reports. For instance, despite the claims of some that the worst abuses are likely to be more common in big facilities, especially those owned by corporate chains, Selder and Murphy say small homes are just as likely to fail their residents.\n\nBoth Murphy and Selder have degrees in gerontology. Both say they\u2019re heartened by all the legislation in Sacramento, especially the bill they sponsored, AB 1523, requiring all facilities to carry liability insurance. [UPDATE: That bill passed, and Governor Jerry Brown signed it into law.] But Murphy worries about the fine print on all the legislation. \u201cIf it\u2019s not clearly stipulated within the bill, then it\u2019s left to the regulators, then the regulators are going to come up with whatever they come up with. So I would hope that they get serious about having stakeholders meetings, using all of the expertise that\u2019s available in this state.\u201d\n\nSelder worries lawmakers are tweaking a system that is fundamentally dysfunctional. If a growing number of elderly need medical care, Selder says, maybe they shouldn\u2019t be in assisted living. Or maybe assisted living should deliver tiered levels of care, with tiered levels of regulation. But that\u2019s not the discussion on the table in Sacramento \u2013 at least, not this year.\n\n\u201cWe are behind the curve,\u201d Selder says. \u201cOther states have rating systems. Other states have assisted living regulated under the Department of Public Health. We\u2019re not there. We\u2019re not even talking about it in the right way yet.\u201d\n\nPolly Stryker contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"We are behind the curve.
