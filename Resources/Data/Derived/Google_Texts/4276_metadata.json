Melancon had to sweat, but he notched his 43rd save.\n\nPHOTOS: Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Colorado Rockies at PNC Park\n\nDespite a solid, rebound performance by starter Chris Rusin, the Rockies (51-76) lost for the 15th time in their last 20 games. Streaking Pittsburgh (79-49) won for the 17th time in its last 20 games, staying 3\u00bd games behind St. Louis in the race for the National League Central title.\n\nRusin was coming off a disastrous start at Coors Field against the New York Mets. He was scorched for a career-high 11 runs on a career-high 12 hits in just two-plus innings. He allowed eight doubles to the Mets, the most by a Rockies pitcher in franchise history.\n\nSaturday night\u2019s first inning looked like a flashback. Harrison and Andrew McCutchen hit back-to-back singles, setting the stage for Aramis Ramirez\u2019s three-run homer to left.\n\nBut Rusin settled in, allowing no more runs in his final five innings.\n\n\u201cI did OK, but I threw one bad pitch (to Ramirez) and it cost us the game,\u201d Rusin said. \u201cYou can say a lot of things, but the bottom line is that we didn\u2019t win the game.\u201d\n\nManager Walt Weiss wasn\u2019t surprised that Rusin rebounded.\n\n\u201c(Pittsburgh) got three runs on one swing, but other than that he performed very well,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nPittsburgh starter J.A. Happ wasn\u2019t flashy, just incredibly consistent, efficient and effective. Happ \u2014 3-1 since being traded to the Pirates from Seattle \u2014 has allowed only two earned runs in his last four starts.\n\nRockies Mailbag: Pose a question for Patrick Saunders\n\n\u201cHe had a really lively fastball, tonight and he used it well,\u201d Hundley said. \u201cThat was the big thing.\u201d\n\nOnce the Pirates\u2019 relievers took the mound, there was little hope for Colorado. Pittsburgh relievers have won 19 consecutive decisions. The last time they lost a game was June 25. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, that\u2019s the longest such streak by any major-league bullpen since 1909, when the World Series champion Pirates relievers had 22 consecutive winning decisions.\n\nColorado left-hander Jason Gurka, making his major-league debut, gave up a run on two hits in the seventh inning.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pittsburgh Pirates remain hot, halt Rockies\u2019 rally in ninth", "title": "Pittsburgh Pirates remain hot, halt Rockies\u2019 rally in ninth", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/29/pittsburgh-pirates-remain-hot-halt-rockies-rally-in-ninth/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150829__rockies-rusinp1.jpg", "height": 473}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150829__rockies-rusinp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-29T20:32:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T09:24:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat was the big thing.\u201dOnce the Pirates\u2019 relievers took the mound, there was little hope for Colorado.\nNick Hundley hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning off Pirates closer Mark Melancon to take a bite out of the Pirates\u2019 lead.\nAccording to the Elias Sports Bureau, that\u2019s the longest such streak by any major-league bullpen since 1909, when the World Series champion Pirates relievers had 22 consecutive winning decisions.\nPHOTOS: Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Colorado Rockies at PNC ParkDespite a solid, rebound performance by starter Chris Rusin, the Rockies (51-76) lost for the 15th time in their last 20 games.\nIt wasn\u2019t quite enough, and the Rockies lost 4-3."}
