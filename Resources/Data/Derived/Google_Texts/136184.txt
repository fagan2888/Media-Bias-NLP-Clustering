The Penguins signed center Dominik Simon, a fifth-round pick in last month's draft, to a three-year entry-level contract.

Simon, 20, played for HC Plzen in the Czech Republic's ELH last season. In 52 games, he scored 30 points (18 goals, 12 assists).

A native of Prague in the Czech Republic, Simon played for his country in the IIHF World Championship tournament this spring. Simon, who will turn 21 in August, skated alongside former Penguins right winger Jaromir Jagr. Simon played in 10 games and had six points (one goal, five assists).

Simon (5-feet-11, 176 pounds) is the first member of the Penguins' 2015 draft class to sign a contract. He is expected to play in North America next season.
