OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Alex Caruso scored 25 points as Texas A&M overcame a 10-point deficit with less than 30 seconds remaining in regulation to come back for a 92-88 double overtime victory over Northern Iowa in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Sunday night.

The win puts the third-seeded Aggies (28-8) in the Sweet 16 for the third time in school history, the first since 2007.

Danuel House scored all 22 of his points in the second half and overtime, while Jalen Jones finished with 16 for Texas A&M — which has now won 10 of its last 11 games.

Jeremy Morgan had career highs of 36 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Panthers (23-13), who led 69-59 in the final minute of regulation before committing four turnovers in the final 29 seconds to spark the Aggies comeback.

Texas A&M’s spot in next week’s Sweet 16 against Oklahoma looked all but impossible when it trailed 69-59 with less than 30 seconds remaining in regulation.

However, Admon Gilder’s steal and layup with 1.9 seconds remaining tied the game at 71-71 for the Aggies — capping a remarkable last-minute comeback.

House then scored the first eight points of the first overtime for Texas A&M, while Caruso sent the game to a second extra period with his drive and layup with 5.9 seconds remaining to tie the game at 83-83.

In the second overtime, the Aggies led by as many as four points before House finally made the comeback stick with a free throw with 12.6 seconds remaining to give Texas A&M a 92-88 lead.

Klint Carlson scored 17 points to match his career high for Northern Iowa, which was seeking only the second Sweet 16 appearance in school history, while Paul Jesperson had 11 points and Wes Washpun 10 assists.
