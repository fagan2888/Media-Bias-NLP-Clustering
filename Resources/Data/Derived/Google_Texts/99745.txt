What’s that phrase again… Keep your friends close and keep your political frenemies closer?

Well, Ben Carson apparently lives by this credo.

Carson, who is one of the more popular candidates in a wide-open GOP race for 2016, just made more waves by agreeing to speak at Al Sharpton’s upcoming conference.

National Action Network—the Al Sharpton-founded civil rights organization—announced the news on Twitter:

Join @TheRevAl & these speakers at our convention April 8-11 in NYC. Free registration: http://t.co/FMJyyavPVq pic.twitter.com/Xp3KR9ZxlE — NationalActionNet (@NationalAction) February 17, 2015

Soon enough, Twitter started going nuts. Some users aren’t fans of Sharpton’s politically-charged convention:

R U helping to further legitimize a race-hustling, cop-bashing, GOP-hating tax fraud. by appearing before NAN, @BenCarson? Explain decision — Carole Gilman (@CaroleGilman) February 18, 2015

Some are fantastic at wordplay:

@seanhannity is it true Dr. Ben Carson speaking at Al Sharlaton NAN convention — Michael Moore (@13Dolphinmike) February 18, 2015

There are innumerable reasons why conservatives are distrustful of Al Sharpton. For one, many consider his railing against the rich pretty hypocritical. Then there’s that whole ‘race-baiting‘ issue.

Carson, of course, has a penchant for the dramatic. He’s the one who likened the Affordable Care Act to slavery.

There was also the now-famous National Prayer Breakfast event in 2013 where he spoke up, mere feet from the President. Politico describe that moment as “a politically charged invocation” that transformed Carson into “a darling of the right-wing media.”

Some folks on Twitter are expecting the April event with Sharpton’s friends as a 2013 National Prayer Breakfast Redux, of sorts:

Ben Carson and Al Sharpton together? Either the weather is so bad hell has frozen over or Dr. Carson is gonna go "prayer breakfast" on Al. — Carmine Sabia (@CarmineSabia) February 18, 2015

Others say you can’t impact opponents unless you engage with them:

No evidence that Carson is one to cave. You can't do outreach by only appearing on Fox! 'Is Carson with Sharpton?!' http://t.co/nUrxVvLFWQ — Uncle Odie (@OdieMoats) February 18, 2015

Recently, Sharpton has been seen at public events hanging out with popular conservatives like Sarah Palin and Rand Paul:

I am in Senate Dining Room having breakfast meeting with Sen. Rand Paul. We don't agree on much but he is an interesting guy. — Reverend Al Sharpton (@TheRevAl) November 20, 2014

So, maybe his unlikely partnership with Carson is evidence that Reverend Sharpton’s just trying to find common ground with the other side of the aisle. But that doesn’t mean Ben Carson won’t drop some truth bombs in April.
