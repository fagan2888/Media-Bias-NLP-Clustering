Yet, he also emphasized that he\u2019s not out to take anybody\u2019s guns away. This isn\u2019t a slippery slope to mass confiscation, and the president reiterated that he\u2019s a supporter of the Second Amendment; Katie eviscerated this claim earlier this afternoon.\n\nToday, background checks are required at gun stores. If a father wants to teach his daughter how to hunt, he can walk into a gun store, get a background check, purchase his weapon safely and responsibly. This is not seen as an infringement on the Second Amendment. Contrary to the claims of what some gun rights proponents have suggested, this hasn\u2019t been the first step in some slippery slope to mass confiscation. Contrary to claims of some presidential candidates, apparently, before this meeting, this is not a plot to take away everybody\u2019s guns. You pass a background check; you purchase a firearm.\n\nLast October, the president also repeated the claim that he isn\u2019t looking to take anybody\u2019s guns away at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Chicago. The president may say he\u2019s for the Second Amendment, but his policies say otherwise. Moreover, the president\u2019s party seems to be totally fine with passing legislation that manifests itself as de facto confiscation in the name of safety.\n\nIn California, a new law has gone into effect, where people can petition the court to have someone\u2019s firearms confiscated, or prevent them from buying them, if they feel the person could be a threat to the public. Of course, the language regarding \u201cimmediate family members\u201d is vague, and like the Obama administration policy of integrating terror no-fly lists into background checks, there are questions about due process. A provision of the law says that when the restraining order is issued, law enforcement can confiscate legal firearms for 21 days (via the Guardian):\n\nTo request a firearms restraining order, a petitioner has to tell the court why they believe someone presents a danger to themselves or others because they are in possession of a gun or intend to get one. The petitioner also has to explain why a restraining order is necessary to keep the subject of the order from harming anyone. If the order is granted, a judge can issue a temporary firearms restraining order within 24 hours. The subject would then be served with the order and would have to surrender their guns and ammunition within 24 hours. Before the order expires, a judge decides at a hearing attended by both parties whether to terminate the order and return the subject\u2019s firearms and ammunition, or extend the order for a year. [\u2026] \u201cIn California we have no more loopholes. They have already tried and done everything regarding gun control,\u201d said Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California. \u201cIt\u2019s a kneejerk reaction that would do nothing to prevent the incident that inspired it.\u201d The term \u201cimmediate family member\u201d, according to the new law, includes a range of relatives, blood ties or not. It also includes anyone who has \u201cwithin the last six months, regularly resided\u201d in the same household. Additionally, court documents state that even if you don\u2019t have the necessary relationship, you may notify law enforcement of a potential problem, and an officer could investigate and file a petition for the order.\n\nYes, a hearing is set during the period of confiscation, but for 21 days? Additionally, let\u2019s not kid ourselves that this law is probably going to be abused. I have no problem with keeping firearms out of the hands of people who shouldn\u2019t have them\u2013and maybe California has something here (it certainly makes room for debate)\u2013but this is a sloppy first draft of a law that will be easily mangled by anti-gun Democrats in one of the most liberal states in the country. Sadly, the debate here, as with most gun control policies, is whether this policy hurts the law-abiding more than those who intend to do harm.\n\nAs for any Obama policy that could lead to confiscation, that\u2019s not in the cards. He knows that\u2019s overreach, though it wouldn\u2019t shock me in the slightest if he doesn\u2019t find anything problematic with California\u2019s soft confiscation law. And that is the reason why Americans have bought over 100 million guns since the beginning of his presidency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"this hasnt been the first step in some slippery slope to mass confiscation\".05/27/2016 11:13:14AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"this hasnt been the first step in some slippery slope to mass confiscation\"", "title": "Obama: My Anti-Gun Agenda Isn't A 'Slippery Slope' To Confiscation", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/01/05/obama-my-antigun-agenda-isnt-a-slippery-slop-to-confiscating-guns-n2100133", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/1/5/41.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"this hasnt been the first step in some slippery slope to mass confiscation\"", "title": "Obama: My Anti-Gun Agenda Isn't A 'Slippery Slope' To Confiscation", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/01/05/obama-my-antigun-agenda-isnt-a-slippery-slop-to-confiscating-guns-n2100133", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/1/5/41.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama: My Anti-Gun Agenda Isn't A 'Slippery Slope' To Confiscation  , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "He knows that\u2019s overreach, though it wouldn\u2019t shock me in the slightest if he doesn\u2019t find anything problematic with California\u2019s soft confiscation law.\nIf the order is granted, a judge can issue a temporary firearms restraining order within 24 hours.\nThe petitioner also has to explain why a restraining order is necessary to keep the subject of the order from harming anyone.\nThis isn\u2019t a slippery slope to mass confiscation, and the president reiterated that he\u2019s a supporter of the Second Amendment; Katie eviscerated this claim earlier this afternoon.\nContrary to the claims of what some gun rights proponents have suggested, this hasn\u2019t been the first step in some slippery slope to mass confiscation."}
