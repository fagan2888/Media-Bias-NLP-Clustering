WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — A.J. Hammons scored 19 points to lead five Purdue players in double figures, and the 20th-ranked Boilermakers held on for an 83-79 victory over No. 10 Maryland on Saturday.

Sophomore guard Dakota Mathias added a career-best 17 points for Purdue (22-7, 10-6 Big Ten), Rapheal Davis and Vince Edwards each scored 11 points and Caleb Swanigan had 10 points in Purdue’s second victory over a top-10 opponent in 18 days.

The Boilermakers defeated No. 6 Michigan State on Feb. 9. It is also Purdue’s school record-tying 16th home victory this season.

Hammons made a free throw with 1:49 left to break a 76-76 tie, and a layup by Johnny Hill made it 79-76 with 1:16 to go.

Davis and Edwards each made two free throws in the final 23.1 seconds to help the Boilermakers withstand a late charge from Maryland (23-6, 11-5 Big Ten).

Melo Trimble led the Terrapins with 19 points, Diamond Stone scored 18 points and Jake Layman added 15 points.

The Terrapins used a 12-2 run to tie it at 76-76 on a layup by Layman with 2:12 remaining. That 12-2 burst was fueled by five Purdue turnovers in two minutes after building a 10-point lead.

A 9-3 burst helped Maryland cut the Purdue lead to 58-56 with 10:36 to play, but Swanigan hit a 3-pointer and a layup off a perfect pass from Mathias to push the lead to 63-56 with 9:49 left.

Purdue extended its lead to 71-62 with 6:02 left on a putback by Hammons and to 74-64 on a 3-pointer by Hammons with 4:13 remaining.

With Mathias making five consecutive shots and scoring 12 first-half points, the Boilermakers led, 44-39, through 20 minutes, during which they shot 57.6 percent from the field. Purdue outrebounded the Terrapins, 21-9, in the first half.
