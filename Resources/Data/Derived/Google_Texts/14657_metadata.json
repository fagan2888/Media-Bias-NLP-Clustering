Wind chills will remain at 20 to 30 below, according to the weather service.\n\nThe wind chill watch remains in effect for through Wednesday morning.\n\n\u201cIt's not too often that the very cold air from Canada comes this far south, especially because we have the lakes to moderate those temperatures,\u201d Miller said.\n\nLake Erie, with water temperatures at about 33 degrees, could start to freeze \u2014 something it hasn't done in several years, Miller said.\n\nThe weather system heading toward Western Pennsylvania looks similar to a pattern that swept through the region in January 1994, bringing Pittsburgh its lowest temperature ever, minus 22, Miller said. The last time Pittsburgh hit minus 10 was January 2009.\n\nSchools in Wisconsin have announced closings for Monday as wind chills there were expected to plummet to minus 40 to minus 55 degrees by Monday and Tuesday mornings, according to the weather service.\n\nPittsburgh Public Schools officials had not decided on Saturday whether to close schools here or operate on a delay, spokeswoman Ebony Pugh said.\n\n\u201cYou definitely do begin to worry when you have wind and temperatures so cold and kids waiting outside,\u201d Pugh said.\n\nWhen wind chills drop to 30 below, frostbite can set in in 30 minutes, Miller said. Frostbite can form in as little as 10 minutes when the wind chill drops to 40 below. People who have to go outside should dress in layers, wear a hat, cover skin as much as possible and limit time spent in the elements.\n\nRobert Gerlach, emergency management coordinator for the Hempfield Emergency Management Agency, suggested staying inside if at all possible.\n\n\u201cThe main way to prevent cold-related injury or illness is to not go into that environment, obviously,\u201d he said.\n\nMayor-elect Bill Peduto, who moved his inauguration ceremony scheduled for Monday indoors because of the predicted cold, said the city could open warming centers.\n\nAllegheny County Emergency Services chief Alvin Henderson said the county will consider opening warming centers as well.\n\n\u201cUse common sense. Keep your wits about you, and please check on the elderly,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cIt's times like this where neighbors have to help neighbors.\u201d\n\nHenderson warned against using alternative heating methods indoors, like kerosene heaters or make-shift fires.\n\nBortz Do It Best Hardware in Greensburg got a large shipment of ice-melt products Saturday, according to manager Heather Foster, 30, of Greensburg.\n\n\u201cWhen it gets this cold, we sell calcium chloride pellets more than anything,\u201d Foster said.\n\nThe pellets work to temperatures as low as minus 25 degrees.\n\nDon Williams, 46, of Greensburg said his concerns were for emergency medical staff who have to work outdoors in cold temperatures.\n\n\u201cThey don't have a choice,\u201d said Williams, a member of the Fort Allen Volunteer Fire Department in Hempfield, who was purchasing rock salt at Bortz on Saturday afternoon.\n\nGerlach said those staying at home should be prepared for any possible power outage by having extra blankets and extra heating sources, as well as an emergency kit with three to seven days' worth of medication, food and water.\n\nMiller had a few tips for those trying to freeze water in midair: Use a pot of boiling water, throw the water away from people and bundle up.\n\nStaff writers Bill Vidonic and Nicole Chynoweth contributed to this story.
