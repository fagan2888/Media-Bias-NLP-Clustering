The \u201chub\u201d was designed to electronically connect insurance marketplaces across the country with a handful of federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration, in order to determine the identity and eligibility of applicants for coverage.\n\nThe majority of these incidents during the 17-month period studied involved the electronic probing of CMS systems by \u201cpotential attackers\u201d and the electronic mailing of sensitive information to the wrong recipients. While GAO investigators failed to turn up evidence that outside hackers had succeeded in compromising the system or extracting personally identifiable information, the federal watchdog clearly views the situation as a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management and other major federal agencies have been victimized by hackers in the past, as have major private insurance companies. Last October, OPM notified 21.5 million people that their personal data may have been stolen in a massive data breach. GAO has raised concerns about the potential for similar data thefts from HealthCare.gov, which has been wracked by computer problems from the time of its formal launching in October 2013.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Obamacare Is So Important to Hillary Clinton\n\nLate last year, GAO pinpointed \u201csignificant weaknesses\u201d in the data security controls at three selected state-operated Obamacare insurance marketplaces. The shortcomings that GAO turned up included \u201cinsufficient encryption and inadequately configured firewalls,\u201d among others. The three states responded that they generally agreed with the GAO and were taking steps to address the problems.\n\nCMS has also responded with a number of fixes to previous complaints from GAO. However, the new GAO report identifies other problems and vulnerabilities in the technical controls that protect the highly sensitive information that flows through the data hub. Those problems include \u201cinsufficiently restricted administrator privileges\u201d for the hub system, \u201cinconsistent application of security patches\u201d and \u201cinsecure configuration of an administrative network.\u201d\n\nRelated: Two Big Problems for Obamacare: Cost and Confusion\n\nCMS officials insisted that none of the 316 incidents cited by GAO could be classified as having \u201cextensive\u201d or \u201cwidespread\u201d impact, although they agreed that one episode clearly had potential for \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201clarge impact. In that case, \u201ca list of CMS employee account IDs, including passwords that had not yet been assigned to employees and phone numbers, was transmitted to CMS staff via an unencrypted e-mail message.\u201d\n\nIn order to address the problem, CMS technicians created new passwords for the impacted employees and advised them to log on and change their passwords. But the snafu had left the government vulnerable to hacking \u2014 if ever so briefly.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Federal officials have been lucky until now, but the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Internet we", "title": "Obamacare Website Still Vulnerable to Hackers, Federal Watchdog Warns", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/24/Obamacare-Website-Still-Vulnerable-Hackers-Federal-Watchdog-Warns", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10302015_Obamacare_signup_laptop.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/24/Obamacare-Website-Still-Vulnerable-Hackers-Federal-Watchdog-Warns", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10302015_Obamacare_signup_laptop.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Federal officials have been lucky until now, but the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Internet we", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Here\u2019s Why Obamacare Is So Important to Hillary ClintonLate last year, GAO pinpointed \u201csignificant weaknesses\u201d in the data security controls at three selected state-operated Obamacare insurance marketplaces.\nThe Office of Personnel Management and other major federal agencies have been victimized by hackers in the past, as have major private insurance companies.\nHowever, the new GAO report identifies other problems and vulnerabilities in the technical controls that protect the highly sensitive information that flows through the data hub.\nThe majority of these incidents during the 17-month period studied involved the electronic probing of CMS systems by \u201cpotential attackers\u201d and the electronic mailing of sensitive information to the wrong recipients.\nWhile GAO investigators failed to turn up evidence that outside hackers had succeeded in compromising the system or extracting personally identifiable information, the federal watchdog clearly views the situation as a disaster waiting to happen."}
