A slice or mishit meant his ball was lying in a black mass of rock, otherwise known as cooled lava to the locals.\n\n\u201cYou gotta hit the fairway,\u201d Arnorsson said. \u201cLava is just rock. If you hit it, it can come back right at you or bounce in the fairway or bounce out of bounds. You can\u2019t really compare it [to any other hazard].\n\n\u201cThose conditions get you prepared.\u201d\n\nThe 23-year-old sophomore is prepared for another strong season, which begins Sunday with the Gopher Invitational at Windsong Farm in Independence. Last season he played in all 11 tournaments and had a 74.78 stroke average.\n\nThe plush green courses throughout the Big Ten present different challenges for Arnorsson, but he always reminds himself: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve had a worse lie than this.\u201d\n\nArnorsson returned to Minnesota early this summer to work on his short game. He\u2019s also spending extra time studying.\n\nRunar Arnorsson had a 74.78 stroke average for the Gophers as a freshman.\n\n\u201cI spend a lot of time studying at Bierman [athletics building]. I have to keep balance in my life, and one of the things is I have to feel good while playing, so it\u2019s important knowing everything is going well in school.\u201d\n\nJASON GONZALEZ", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Runar Arnorsson is a 23-year-old sophomore preparing for another strong season, which begins Sunday with the Gopher Invitational at Windsong Farm in Independence.
