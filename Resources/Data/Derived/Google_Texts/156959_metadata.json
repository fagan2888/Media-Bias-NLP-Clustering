Chiu/AP) President Barack Obama is seen waving to the audience after speaking about the Affordable Care Act last week. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) Former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told a trade group last week that he didn\u2019t think the employer mandate would ultimately go into effect. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\n\u201cWe have to continue implementing the law,\u201d he said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d The President has told us we have to keep our eye on the ball every day to make sure this law is implemented as well as possible.\u201d\n\nThe comments come after former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs claimed that the mandate, which has already been delayed twice, would be \u201cone of the first things to go,\u201d as different facets of Obama\u2019s signature health care law continued to run into hurdles.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the employer mandate will go into effect. It\u2019s a small part of the law,\u201d Gibbs told a trade group during a speech last week.\n\nIn February, the White House delayed the employer mandate to 2016. Officials had previously delayed the mandate to 2015.\n\nCountless other measures of the law have also been postponed, including the enrollment deadline for people who had difficulty signing up prior to the previous March 31 deadline, and the enrollment deadline for a special temporary pool for people with serious conditions.\n\nNevertheless, the White House, and many of the legislation\u2019s proponents, have deemed the law\u2019s trouble-plagued rollout a success, because the administration was still able to get 7.1 million Americans to sign up for insurance through its exchanges before April 1.\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
