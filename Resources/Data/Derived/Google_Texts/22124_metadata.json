It allows certain immigrant youth to remain in the country and obtain a work permit, without fear of deportation.\n\n\u201cThis is a temporary stop-gap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely, while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven and patriotic young people,\u201d Obama said, when he announced the program in June 2012.\n\nUnder the Deferred Action policy, some young people would have qualified for new health care options under the Affordable Care Act. That is, until the Obama administration announced last August a new federal policy that excluded these youth from participating in the expanded Medicaid program, or purchasing insurance on the state exchanges.\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d says Alvaro Huerta, with the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles. \u201cThey are excluding a population of very young, healthy individuals \u2013 generally \u2013 from the insurance pool, and that makes it more expensive for the rest of us, not to have those folks included.\u201d\n\nHere in California, though, there\u2019s a wrinkle in the law and it dates back more than a decade. The 1996 federal welfare reform law barred lawfully present immigrants, who have been here for less than five years, from receiving any public benefits, from food stamps to health insurance.\n\nThe Golden State, though, took a different approach.\n\n\u201cWe have made a policy that for individuals that meet certain requirements, if they are here as legal immigrants, but they are under the five-year bar, we have awarded full-scope services, we pay for it with state general funds, some services can claim federal funds,\u201d explains Rene Mollow, deputy director of health care benefits and eligibility for the state Department of Health Care Services.\n\nEssentially, that means that some young Californians who qualify for Deferred Action are already eligible for Medi-Cal and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program - so long as it\u2019s funded by the state, and not the federal government.\n\nAnd even more will be eligible for expanded Medi-Cal in 2014, says Ron Coleman with the California Immigrant Policy Center. But, he says, they still can\u2019t buy insurance through the state exchange, called Covered California, because it includes federal subsidies and tax credits.\n\n\u201cThey are eligible for Medi-Cal now, if they\u2019re blind or disabled, and as part of the newly eligible population that will get coverage starting in January, if they are single, childless adults up to 138% of the federal poverty level, they will also qualify for Medi-Cal,\u201d Coleman says.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for Deferred Action youth. But Luis Ojeda, with California Youth Immigrant Justice Alliance, says many of them don\u2019t know about this opportunity. Ojeda, who\u2019s 23, is from Colima, Mexico and now lives in Fresno. He was approved for Deferred Action status in May.\n\n\"We haven't take advantage of this opportunity, simply because of lack of knowledge\" - Luis Ojeda\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been told that Obamacare doesn\u2019t apply to us, and we still won\u2019t have access to health insurance,\u201d Ojeda says. \u201cI think part of the reason we\u2019re uninsured, is because we haven\u2019t take advantage of this opportunity, simply because of lack of knowledge.\u201d\n\nAs an advocate for the immigrant community, Ojeda says he\u2019s focused on pushing for immigration reform, the Trust Act, and driver\u2019s licenses. But he says it\u2019s important to get the word out about the health insurance benefits available to youth with Deferred Action status.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of advocacy work that goes on in our community, in terms of trying to improve the well-being of our community, but it\u2019s important to understand that in order for us to do that, we really need to take care of ourselves,\u201d he says.\n\nColeman, with the California Immigrant Policy Center, agrees there needs to be more outreach to these youth.\n\n\u201cI do think that in California, a lot of these eligible categories that had been preserved are not known to a lot of people, and there will need to be a lot of community education for Deferred Action approved individuals to sign up for Medi-Cal, and get the access they need,\u201d he says.\n\nAs Obamacare enrollment begins today, Mollow, with the Department of Health Care Services, encourages everyone who needs health care services to apply for insurance. She emphasizes that the information collected is only used to determine eligibility.\n\nThis story was first reported by New America Media.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Last summer, President Obama announced a new policy, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
