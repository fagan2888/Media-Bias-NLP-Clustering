There are tactful responses to tragedy — and then there’s the letter PETA sent to a Pennsylvania hunter who got mauled by a bear.

Camille Bomboy, 18, recently survived being attacked by a mother bear last Monday while she was out hunting with her stepdad, according to local news station WTAJ. On Friday, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sent a letter to young woman, urging her to “reflect” on the attack and stop hunting.

“This seems to be a good opportunity to put yourself in the place of the individuals you and the rest of your hunting party were trying to kill,” the letter read. “As terrifying as it must have been to be attacked by a bear, please consider the frightening and painful experiences that hunters set out to impose upon animals.”

Alicia Woempner, a PETA special projects division manager and the author of the letter, wished Bomboy a quick recovery before explaining that animals form strong bonds with their offspring. She also pointed out that sometimes animals aren’t killed outright by hunters, but must suffer long, painful deaths.

“Now that you’ve experienced the horror of an attack — although this one was in self-defense — we hope you will choose to enjoy nature in only nonviolent ways,” the letter closed.

The bear attacked Bomboy on her family’s farm. The 18-year-old almost lost an ear and suffered bites to her arms and shoulders before her stepfather was able to fire his rifle and scare the animal off. Bomboy has no intention of giving up hunting.
