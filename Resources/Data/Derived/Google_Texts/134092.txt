A man is in the hospital with life-threatening injuries following a morning skirmish with Tucson Police officers.

Around 6:45 Saturday morning, officers were dispatched to an apartment complex in the 3200 block of North Alvernon Way – near East Fort Lowell Road – to check on a man's welfare, according to police.

The man armed himself with several weapons and charged the officers, both of whom fired at the man, striking him several times, according to a press release from TPD Sgt. Pete Dugan, a department spokesman.

Then the officers administered first aid until the Tucson Fire Department responded to take the man to Banner University Medical Center with life-threatening injuries, according to the press release.

Neither officer was injured.

Homicide detectives and Internal Affairs officers will continue the investigation.

Anyone with information about the incident should call 911 or the 88-CRIME anonymous tip line.
