Two years after he lost his bid to be vice president, Ryan said, there were a lot of reasons to be optimistic.\n\nRyan hit the left for focusing on income inequality. \"[What that] really shows is that [the left] is out of ideas... They have spent five long years in power and all they have to show for it is this lousy website.\"\n\nRyan\u2014neatly dressed in a navy suit and powder blue striped tie\u2013dismissed the notion of a civil war within the Republican Party. It was just \"creative tension,\" he assured the crowd with a wink. He boasted that \"the center of gravity is shifting\" in favor of the GOP. \"Let the other party be the party of personalities. We will be the party of ideas.\"\n\nIdeas\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014remained a focus for Ryan. \"The left isn't just out of ideas. They're out of touch.\" \"Take Obamacare. Okay, don't take Obamacare,\" he laughed along with the crowd. He repeated the same trick later on in his speech, starting a riff with \"Take Obamacare\u2014not literally, but figuratively.\" The crowd ate it up.\n\nRyan insinuated that the Democratic Party is selling the American people a welfare state. \"What the left is offering people is a full stomach and an empty soul...People don't just want a life of comfort. They want a life of dignity...\"", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "olivianuzzi"}, "keywords": "CPAC, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201403061538, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/us-news", "description": "Mitt Romney\u2019s old running mate rips liberals over income inequality, saying they want to hook people on welfare.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Paul Ryan: Democrats Offer Americans a Full Stomach and an Empty Soul", "tags": "entity:politicalevent/cpac,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Paul Ryan: Democrats Offer Americans a \u201cFull Stomach and an Empty Soul\u201d\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/06/paul-ryan-democrats-offer-americans-a-full-stomach-and-an-empty-soul.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/06/paul-ryan-democrats-offer-americans-a-full-stomach-and-an-empty-soul/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46470727.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/06/paul-ryan-democrats-offer-americans-a-full-stomach-and-an-empty-soul\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-06T15:38:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"U.S. News\",\"author\":\"Olivia Nuzzi\",\"tags\":[\"cpac\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "CPAC, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "us-news", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Olivia Nuzzi", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-03-06T15:38:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/olivia-nuzzihtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/06/paul-ryan-democrats-offer-americans-a-full-stomach-and-an-empty-soul", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Mitt Romney\u2019s old running mate rips liberals over income inequality, saying they want to hook people on welfare.", "title": "Paul Ryan: Democrats Offer Americans a \u2018Full Stomach and an Empty Soul\u2019", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/06/paul-ryan-democrats-offer-americans-a-full-stomach-and-an-empty-soul.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/06/paul-ryan-democrats-offer-americans-a-full-stomach-and-an-empty-soul/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1394121821538.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/o/olivia-nuzzi", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04a9\"", "article_summary": "Mitt Romney\u2019s old running mate rips liberals over income inequality, saying they want to hook people on welfare.\nRyan hit the left for focusing on income inequality.\n\"What the left is offering people is a full stomach and an empty soul...People don't just want a life of comfort.\nTwo years after he lost his bid to be vice president, Ryan said, there were a lot of reasons to be optimistic.\nRyan insinuated that the Democratic Party is selling the American people a welfare state."}
