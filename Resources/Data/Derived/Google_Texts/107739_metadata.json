The law, co-sponsored by Republican senator Tom Libous, will take effect in 120 days. It makes it \u201cillegal to tattoo or pierce companion animals unless performed by or under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian for identification or medical purposes only,\u201d according to a statement released by Rosenthal\u2019s office.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We didn't know it was legal in the first place...", "title": "Pet tattooing will soon be banned in New York", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "We didn't know it was legal in the first place...", "title": "Pet tattooing will soon be banned in New York", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/15/pet_tattooing_will_soon_be_banned_in_new_york/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_135436175.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We didn't know it was legal in the first place...", "title": "Pet tattooing will soon be banned in New York", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_135436175.jpg", "creator": "@@joannarothkopf", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joanna Rothkopf", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Animal cruelty, Pets, piercing, Tattoos", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2462\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Animal cruelty, Pets, piercing, Tattoos, Sustainability News, News, Politics NewsOn Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill which officially bans the tattooing and piercing of pets.\nThe bill was introduced in 2011 by Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal after she read an article about a local woman who was selling kittens with pierced ears (a.k.a.\n\u201cThis is animal abuse, pure and simple,\u201d said Cuomo.\nThe law, co-sponsored by Republican senator Tom Libous, will take effect in 120 days.\nIt makes it \u201cillegal to tattoo or pierce companion animals unless performed by or under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian for identification or medical purposes only,\u201d according to a statement released by Rosenthal\u2019s office."}
