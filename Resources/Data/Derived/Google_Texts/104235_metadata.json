Yet recent studies reveal that for some people, feeling good is what scares them. Recognizing this fear and targeting it with therapy may be a critical first step before other mental illnesses can be treated.\n\nPeople fear positive emotions for many reasons, such as feeling unworthy or believing good fortune inevitably leads to a fall, according to two new studies. Mohsen Joshanloo, a psychology graduate student at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, developed a Fear of Happiness Scale, on which participants indicate their level of agreement with statements such as \u201cHaving lots of joy and fun causes bad things to happen.\u201d Such beliefs can plague people in many countries, according to a study by Joshanloo published online in October 2013 in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology. The study found the scale to be reliable in 14 different cultures.\n\nUsing a similar scale, psychiatrist Paul Gilbert of Kingsway Hospital in England and his colleagues found in 2012 that a fear of happiness correlates highly with depression\u2014but that the dread manifests in numerous ways. \u201cSome people experience happiness as being relaxed or even lazy, as if happiness is frivolous and one must always be striving; others feel uncomfortable if they are not always worrying,\u201d Gilbert says. \u201cIt is not uncommon for people to fear that if they are happy about something, it will be taken away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research suggests it's one of our biggest fears -- and could underlie some mental illnesses", "title": "Are you afraid of happiness?
