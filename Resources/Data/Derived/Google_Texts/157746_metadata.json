At the press conference, Woolf announced his platform of supporting paid leave and childcare and the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nHe also called for raising the minimum wage and passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n\n\u201cWe still have not assured the same opportunities as men,\u201d said Woolf. \u201cA female, full-time worker makes only 77 cents for every dollar that a man earns. This adds up to a yearly wage gap of nearly $11,000.\u201d\n\nWoolf made little mention of Funiciello, singling out his Republican opponent in the race for the district that stretches across Northern New York and is considered one of a handful of swing districts in the state.\n\n\u201cBut Elise Stefanik said during her primary that she wouldn\u2019t support raising the federal minimum wage. Now she\u2019s backpedaling. This is becoming a pattern. She still refuses to take a firm stance, though, one way or the other.\u201d\n\nStefanik has said she would support a raise in the minimum wage if there was support from small business.\n\nStefanik previously served as an advisor to Congressman Paul Ryan during his run for the vice presidency. Ryan has endorsed Stefanik. Woolf has repeatedly characterized Stefanik as an author of a 2012 Republican platform that excluded the Paycheck Fairness Act and restricted a woman\u2019s right to choose. An animated Congressman Paul Tonko of the neighboring 20th district also took to the podium.\n\n\u201cIf someone has been in a leadership role that denies a number of these dynamics, then let that speak to us. But sometimes the strongest voice for women may happen to be men in the legislative process. This man is not going to hold back women, he\u2019s going to promote women in the effort,\u201d said Tonko.\n\nStefanik\u2019s campaign has said she \u201cdid not have editorial control or responsibility for the platform document.\u201d Stefanik has also expressed her support for the Paycheck Fairness Act and equal pay for women.\n\nCarrie Woerner, a Democratic candidate for New York\u2019s 113th Assembly district seat, also spoke at the meeting. State Senate candidate Madelyn Thorne was also in attendance.\n\nBut in a question and answer period, reporters called on Woolf to clarify his own stance on several issues, including Social Security, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWoolf said he would not make any changes to Medicare or Social Security. He said growing the economy and raising the minimum wage would be the best way to protect Social Security.\n\n\u201cI think the economy is growing. I think it\u2019s really important that growth extend to all working families in this district, and I think those are very strong ways of growing our Social Security trust fund. As I mentioned also, cutting loopholes for millionaires and billionaires.\u201d\n\nWoolf criticized Stefanik\u2019s own lack of clarity on her position to maintain or raise the retirement age. Stefanik abruptly ended a Monday interview with reporters when pressed on the same question.\n\nIn an email to WAMC, Stefanik campaign spokeswoman Charlotte Guyett wrote:\n\n\u201cElise does not support any changes or reductions for Social Security for those in or near retirement. However, Aaron Woolf's do-nothing approach will bankrupt the program for future generations.\u201d\n\nWoolf did not answer a question on whether he would have voted for the Affordable Care Act, but called the law flawed. He supports making changes to it.\n\nGuyett wrote Woolf\u2019s support for Obamacare hurts North Country women by raising healthcare costs. She also mentioned the Stefanik campaign\u2019s Women Advisory Team and support from GOP State Senators Betty Little, Kathy Marchione, and Patty Ritchie.\n\nUpdate 8/28/14: In response to a request by the Stefanik campaign, this story has been updated to clarify Elise Stefanik's stance on minimum wage and the Paycheck Fairness Act", "article_metadata": {"category": "New York News", "description": "Democrats gathered in Glens Falls Tuesday, where Congressional candidate Aaron Woolf discussed his platform on protecting women\u2019s rights, healthcare, and", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "Midday Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://wamc.org/post/democrats-hold-women-woolf-rally-glens-falls", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wamc/files/styles/medium/public/201408/Aaronwoolf.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Democrats gathered in Glens Falls Tuesday, where Congressional candidate Aaron Woolf discussed his platform on protecting women\u2019s rights, healthcare, and", "title": "Democrats Hold \"Women For Woolf\" Rally In Glens Falls"}, "story_id": 343715916, "twitter": {"site": "@WAMCRadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WAMCRadio"}, "author": "Lucas Willard", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Democrats Hold &quot;Women For Woolf&quot; Rally In Glens Falls"}, "nid": 97943, "datePublished": "2014-08-27", "keywords": "Aaron Woolf, Elise Stefanik, Matt Funicello, 21st Congressional District", "wordCount": 794, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Democrats gathered in Glens Falls Tuesday, where Congressional candidate Aaron Woolf discussed his platform on protecting women\u2019s rights, healthcare, and Social Security.\nHe also called for raising the minimum wage and passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act.\nHe said growing the economy and raising the minimum wage would be the best way to protect Social Security.\nThis man is not going to hold back women, he\u2019s going to promote women in the effort,\u201d said Tonko.\nSaratoga Springs Mayor Joanne Yepsen opened Tuesday\u2019s press conference on Women\u2019s Equality Day, where Woolf\u2019s campaign introduced his \u201cWomen for Woolf\u201d platform."}
