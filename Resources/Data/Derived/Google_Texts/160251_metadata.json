If they don\u2019t, they will face a penalty.\n\nThe fee in 2014 is 1% of your yearly income or $95 per person for the year, whichever is higher. The fee increases every year. In 2016 it is 2.5% of income or $695 per person, whichever is higher.\n\nIn 2014 the fee for uninsured children is $47.50 per child. The most a family would have to pay in 2014 is $285.\n\nThe Florida Republican said people should not be punished for not buying the insurance when major technical problems have plagued the online sign-up process.\n\n\u201cIt is clear the ObamaCare rollout has been a disaster that has further eroded the American people\u2019s confidence in the federal government\u2019s ability to keep basic promises,\u201d Rubio said Monday in a statement. \u201cWith all the problems and errors with the ObamaCare website, people should collect as much evidence as they can from their experiences in order to protect themselves from potential fraud, double billing, and penalties once the mandate is enforced.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, President Barack Obama acknowledged technical problems that he described as \u201ckinks in the system.\u201d\n\nThe most expensive health insurance premiums for individuals in Florida are in the Florida Keys, and the cheapest premiums are for a bare-bones plan offered in Broward County, according to federal data.\n\nThe state\u2019s cheapest monthly premiums were for plans covering only catastrophic emergencies in Broward County. Those plans offered by insurer Coventry One in Broward County would cost a 27-year-old almost $86 a month and a 50-year-old would pay $146 monthly. The state\u2019s most expensive premiums, for a plans offered by Florida Blue, have the highest level of benefits, known as a platinum plan. It would cost a 27-year-old individual almost $460 a month and a 50-year-old Floridian $782 a month.\n\nRoughly half of Florida\u2019s 3.5 million uninsured residents may be eligible for federal subsidies to help them purchase insurance, according to the liberal advocacy group Families USA. But the amount will vary widely depending on income, location, the plan, family size, age, and even tobacco use. Florida residents can choose from 102 plans, the second-highest of any state.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
