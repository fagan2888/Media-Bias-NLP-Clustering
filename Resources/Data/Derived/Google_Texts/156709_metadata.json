Lew said last week that back when he was in the private sector enjoying six- and seven-figure pay packages, \u201cMy own compensation was never in the stratosphere.\u201d\n\nLew made that pronouncement as he sought to defend President Barack Obama\u2019s embattled Treasury undersecretary nominee Antonio Weiss from charges that as a financial executive, he is out of touch with the interests of regular people. Lew was seeking to cast his own lot with the ranks of ordinary Americans at a time of growing economic inequality.\n\nBut in doing so, Lew shed light on a uniquely American phenomenon \u2014 the tendency of extraordinarily rich people to cast themselves as everyday members of the middle class.\n\nEarlier this year, for example, Hillary Clinton made headlines when, in response to a question about her personal fortune, she claimed her family was \u201cdead broke\u201d when they left the White House. That statement followed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s top aide casting those making $500,000 a year as merely upper middle class.\n\nAccording to IRS data, 99 percent of American households make less than $388,000 a year, and 95 percent make less than $167,000 a year. The true middle in terms of income \u2014 that is, the cutoff to be in the top 50 percent of earners \u2014 is roughly $35,000 a year.\n\nWhile Lew claims his private-sector compensation was not \u201cin the stratosphere,\u201d the data suggest otherwise.\n\nAccording to New York University records, Lew was usually paid between $700,000 and $800,000 a year as the school\u2019s vice president, while also receiving a $440,000 mortgage subsidy. Lew also earned $300,000 a year from Citigroup, with a \u201cguaranteed incentive and retention award of not less than $1 million,\u201d according to an employment agreement obtained by Businessweek.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recent remarks from Treasury Secretary Jack Lew help shed light on a troubling phenomenon", "title": "That\u2019s rich!
