He expects overall industry sales in the region to grow by 1 percent this year.\n\nSome 70 percent of Toyota's vehicles sold in Europe last year were produced in the region. The carmaker expects to increase that percentage this year by adding two localized models, the C-HR crossover that will be manufactured in Turkey and the RAV4 that will be assembled in Russia.\n\nVan Zyl said Toyota was committed to the Russian market, despite the challenges there. In 2015, total car industry sales in Russia plunged by 36 percent to 1.6 million.\n\n\"We will not give up on the Russian market ... we will keep on investing to prepare ourselves for when the market recovers,\" he said.\n\nVan Zyl said Toyota expected hybrid vehicles to make up half of its sales in Europe by 2020 from 24 percent last year.\n\n(Reporting by Agnieszka Flak; Editing by Alison Williams)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BMW and Toyota have for some years been collaborating on fuel cell technology, lightwe", "title": "Toyota, BMW strongly motivated to collaborate on sportscar: Totoya executive", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/29/Toyota-BMW-strongly-motivated-collaborate-sportscar-Totoya-executive", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/autoshow-detroit_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/29/Toyota-BMW-strongly-motivated-collaborate-sportscar-Totoya-executive", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/autoshow-detroit_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BMW and Toyota have for some years been collaborating on fuel cell technology, lightwe", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a41\"", "article_summary": "Van Zyl said Toyota expected hybrid vehicles to make up half of its sales in Europe by 2020 from 24 percent last year.\nSome 70 percent of Toyota's vehicles sold in Europe last year were produced in the region.\nVan Zyl said Toyota was committed to the Russian market, despite the challenges there.\nSpeaking ahead of the Geneva auto show, Toyota executive vice president Didier Leroy said all three projects were going very well and there was strong support for the sportscar from both firms.\n\"On both sides we have strong motivation to make it successful, we want to make the car,\" Leroy said."}
