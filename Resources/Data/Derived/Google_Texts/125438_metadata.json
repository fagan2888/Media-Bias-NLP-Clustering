The pro-life leader notes that while there are real problems the administration could tackle, it has instead decided that access to public bathrooms by a new sexual minority has suddenly become a high priority under federal civil rights laws. As a result, the country is \u201cheaded for disaster,\u201d King says.\n\nThis is not an accident. Cultural Marxism, the subject of the new book, The Devil\u2019s Pleasure Palace, explains the grip that this fanatical ideology has on so many elites in America today. If you doubt how pervasive this has become, watch or read the remarks of Attorney General Loretta Lynch on how transgenderism has suddenly become the wave of the future. Describing the North Carolina bathroom bill, which restricts restroom access by objective measures of DNA and biology, Lynch said, \u201cThis is not the first time that we have seen discriminatory responses to historic moments of progress for our nation.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThis action is about a great deal more than just bathrooms. This is about the dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens and the laws that we, as a people and as a country, have enacted to protect them\u2014indeed, to protect all of us. And it\u2019s about the founding ideals that have led this country\u2014haltingly but inexorably\u2014in the direction of fairness, inclusion and equality for all Americans.\u201d\n\nOur founders regarded homosexuality as a crime against nature. General George Washington ordered the court-martial of homosexuals.\n\nStatements from Lynch about \u201cfounding ideals\u201d and \u201cfairness, inclusion and equality for all Americans\u201d get reported in a matter-of-fact manner by the media. But they have no basis in law. The lawsuit filed by North Carolina notes that the position of the Justice Department \u201cis a baseless and blatant overreach\u201d and \u201can attempt to unilaterally rewrite long-established federal civil rights laws in a manner that is wholly inconsistent with the intent of Congress and disregards decades of statutory interpretation by the Courts.\u201d\n\nSo what is happening here? Lynch\u2019s reference to historical \u201cprogress\u201d is Marxist jargon for the dialectical process that will somehow achieve pure social equality by moving the nation into a structure of government dictates and special benefits for preferred members of certain groups, seen as disadvantaged by the capitalist power structure. This is Obama\u2019s view. It means that the definitions of \u201cman\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d are being stripped of their objective reality. The process obviously undermines America\u2019s traditional values and morality, and will inexorably lead to all kinds of perverted practices being treated as new breakthroughs in human sexuality and progress.\n\nCultural Marxism is called \u201ccritical theory\u201d in many universities today. At Occidental College in California, where a young Barack Obama went after being tutored in Marxism by communist Frank Marshall Davis, \u201cCritical Theory and Social Justice\u201d is now an interdisciplinary department, \u201cdrawing on ideas from across traditional academic disciplines.\u201d The official department website describes Critical Theory as referring to \u201cvarious bodies of theory and method\u2014Marxism, psychoanalysis, the Frankfurt School, deconstruction, critical race studies, queer theory, feminist theory, postcolonial theory, and intersectionality\u2014that interrogate the essentialist assumptions that underlie social identities.\u201d\n\nCourses include:\n\nMother Goose to Mash-Ups: Children\u2019s Literature and Popular Texts\n\nPsychic Life of Violence\n\nQueer Los Angeles: Cruising the Archive\n\nBodies for Exchange\n\nWhiteness\n\nIf you are as curious as I was, you\u2019re wondering about the content of the course \u201cMother Goose to Mash-Ups: Children\u2019s Literature and Popular Texts.\u201d Here\u2019s the official description:\n\n\u201cWhy did the London Bridge fall down? Is Rub-a-dub-dub really about bath time? Why didn\u2019t an old man live in a shoe? Who is more imperialist, Babar or Peter Pan? Is Tinky Winky gay? Is South Park a children\u2019s show? Is Harry Potter a Hero? How tired was Rosa Parks? Using different critical approaches, this course will examine children\u2019s poetry, picture books, novels, cartoons, feature films, and music videos. Analysis will include topics related to gender, race, culture, and nation, as they play out in the aesthetics, images, and poetics of children\u2019s texts.\u201d\n\nThe course \u201cWhiteness\u201d is described this way:\n\n\u201cThis course seeks to engage the emergent body of scholarship designated to deconstruct whiteness. It will examine the construction of whiteness in the historic, legal, and economic contexts which have allowed it to function as an enabling condition for privilege and race-based prejudice. Particular attention will be paid to the role of religion and psychology in the construction of whiteness.\u201d\n\nA central aspect of progressive ideology is that women have a \u201cright to choose.\u201d When Hillary Clinton declared that \u201cThe unborn person doesn\u2019t have constitutional rights,\u201d she undermined this false narrative. She let a truth slip out, an offense that could be regarded as verbal aggression toward women on some campuses. According to progressive ideology, the unborn baby is not a person entitled to any rights. The right to life no longer exists for the child in the womb. Only the \u201crights\u201d of the woman have value.\n\nIn his book, The Devil\u2019s Pleasure Palace, Michael Walsh describes how the left, to its \u201ceverlasting shame,\u201d has \u201cconvinced women to murder their own babies in the name of \u2018rights\u2019\u2026\u201d This is the secret of their success\u2014to mask brutal murder through dismemberment and chemical poisoning with flowery language about the \u201crights\u201d of those complicit in the killing.\n\nBy subverting the motherly instinct to have and care for children, the Cultural Marxists have laid the groundwork for other branches of the tree of Critical Theory\u2014radical feminism and lesbianism.\n\nOccidental highlights the fact that its first alumnus to become a United States senator was Barack Obama. Indeed, the \u201cBarack Walk\u201d is now featured on the Occidental campus, including where he lived during his freshman year, where he made his first political speech, and where he played JV basketball. Obama transferred from Occidental College to Columbia University in 1981.\n\n\u201cThe two years President Barack Obama spent at Oxy from 1979 to 1981 played a major role in determining his future,\u201d the college website declares. Eric Newhall, a professor of English and comparative literary studies, is described as a regular at the lunchtime pick-up basketball games played by students and faculty. \u201cI think Occidental\u2019s greatest contribution to American politics lies in persuading Barack Obama that his future did not lie in basketball,\u201d Newhall says.\n\nWhile his basketball skills have clearly deteriorated over the years, Obama\u2019s ability to fundamentally transform the United States shows no signs of slowing down.\n\n\u201cSometimes where you start out is more important than where you end up,\u201d the Occidental website says about Obama. In his case, both are equally important. The damage is not yet done.\n\nInterestingly, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, has indicated no problem with the \u201cprogressive\u201d course America is on. \u201cDonald Trump said I could use any bathroom I wanted in the Trump Tower,\u201d declared Caitlyn/Bruce Jenner at the Time 100 Gala in New York City. \u201cSo of course I veered right in there\u2014took care of myself.\u201d Jenner was being honored as one of 2016\u2019s most influential people.\n\nIn a demonstration of New York values, Trump was in attendance with wife Melania.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Accuracy In Media", "description": "Occidental highlights the fact that its first alumnus to become a United States senator was Barack Obama.", "title": "America Takes the \u201cBarack Walk\u201d on the Wild Side", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lisa-jack-barack-obama-occidental-college-no.-32.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-11T23:51:46+00:00", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/america-takes-the-barack-walk-on-the-wild-side/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AccuracyInMedia/", "section": "AIM Column", "published_time": "2016-05-11T23:51:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T23:51:46+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Occidental highlights the fact that its first alumnus to become a United States senator was Barack Obama.", "title": "America Takes the \u201cBarack Walk\u201d on the Wild Side", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/america-takes-the-barack-walk-on-the-wild-side/", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lisa-jack-barack-obama-occidental-college-no.-32.jpg", "site": "@AccuracyInMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe two years President Barack Obama spent at Oxy from 1979 to 1981 played a major role in determining his future,\u201d the college website declares.\nOccidental highlights the fact that its first alumnus to become a United States senator was Barack Obama.\n\u201cI think Occidental\u2019s greatest contribution to American politics lies in persuading Barack Obama that his future did not lie in basketball,\u201d Newhall says.\nCultural Marxism is called \u201ccritical theory\u201d in many universities today.\nInterestingly, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Donald J.
