There are two facts that every investor should understand right now:

First, the Affordable Care Act has changed the U.S. healthcare system forever. Not just its attempt to provide coverage for every citizen, but it’s focus on quality of care over quantity of care. These new metrics mean new opportunities for select healthcare companies.

Second, we’re looking at another muddling year in the global economy. Most nations are still lowering rates and priming the pump of their economies. The U.S., after an optimistic rate hike, has now backed off because it wasn’t helping the domestic economy or the global economy.

That means we’re in a period of slow growth. And healthcare is great place to be in a slow growth economy because it’s one sector people will continue to use, regardless of economic cycles. You can wait to buy a car, but you can’t wait on a bypass operation, or a host of chronic medical conditions where long-term care is necessary.

These seven healthcare stocks are in great shape, making each stock an ideal way into these two massive trends.
