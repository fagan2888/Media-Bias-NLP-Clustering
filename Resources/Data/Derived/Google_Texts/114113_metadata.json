The state earmarked $478,000 in tobacco settlement funds for the program this fiscal year.\n\nCHAP recipients are ineligible for Medicaid either because they are undocumented immigrants or make more than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, Delaware's cutoff for Medicaid assistance. The federal poverty level is $11,670 a year for an individual.\n\nState officials said they will offer an alternative to CHAP on a case-by-case basis, only for those who can prove they are ineligible for other plans or are exempt from the federal insurance mandate.\n\nThe news came as a surprise \u2013 and a concern \u2013 to the Medical Society of Delaware, which has partnered with the state to provide a corps of physicians and specialists willing to provide free care to CHAP enrollees. Almost 600 medical professionals are on that list of volunteers.\n\n\"Maybe they feel it needs to be refocused,\" said Dr. Nancy Fan, president of the Medical Society of Delaware and a physician at St. Francis Hospital. \"Or maybe we assume we're providing a greater service than is needed.\"\n\nThere are 7,060 people enrolled in CHAP, about 6,000 of whom are undocumented immigrants. The others have incomes that range between 138 percent and 200 percent of the federal poverty level \u2013 a range that goes from $16,100 for an individual to $47,700 for a family of four.\n\nOfficials say the end of the CHAP program is part of a long-term push to get people to enroll in consistent coverage, rather than for charity care.\n\n\"This is charity care and charity care more or less will be going away based on the mandate that everyone must have health insurance,\" said Rita Langraf, secretary of Delaware's Department of Health and Social Services, referencing the 2010 Affordable Care Act's requirement that everyone should have health insurance.\n\nThe department is taking that mantra seriously. Landgraf said the state will continue to offer coverage for the undocumented population past Feb. 1, but CHAP recipients who make up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level will need to find new coverage.\n\nShe expects some may be eligible for Medicaid when their situations are reviewed, but individuals who make more than $16,100 a year will be pushed out to the online health care marketplace or they will have to pay out of pocket for services.\n\n\"We've been informing [them] of this transition for probably a year. Now we are actually giving them a hard stop,\" Landgraf said.\n\nIn September, 571 doctors and specialists throughout the state were on the list of CHAP volunteers, according to Mark Thompson, Medical Society spokesman. Since 2001, the Medical Society has made almost 54,000 referrals to those doctors and specialists, he said, and since 2007, the program has saved patients about $4.3 million in prescription costs.\n\n\"Our concern is \u2013 where will this take some of these patients who aren't going to be able to make the cutoffs?\" said Fan. \"We'd be more than happy to work with the state to still care for those patients, but obviously we don't know how that will work yet\u2026. That's going to be an extensive discussion.\"\n\nThose enrolled in CHAP have few financial options, she said.\n\n\"It's a small pie for these people. What are they going to be paying for? Food. Housing. Probably many are in positions and jobs \u2013 if they're working at all \u2013 where the employer is not providing insurance. And the way the [insurance] marketplace is going, employers will have less and less inclination to provide insurance.\"\n\nThe program was growing before the Affordable Care Act took effect. In 2011, the Delaware Health Care Commission's director predicted the number of CHAP enrollees that year would rise from 10,300 to 13,000.\n\nNeither Christiana Care Health System nor Westside Health Center could say Monday how the state's changes would affect their programs.\n\nMany questions went unanswered Monday.\n\n\"What does this mean for the patient?\" Fan said. \"How does funneling them somewhere else \u2013 how does the state save money? How will they restructure the program to meet the needs of those who get left behind? We can't answer those questions.\"\n\nJen Rini can be reached at 324-2386 or jrini@delawareonline.com.
