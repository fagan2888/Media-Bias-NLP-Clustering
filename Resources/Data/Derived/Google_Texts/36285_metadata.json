But she says she didn't know about the retail giant's potential arrival until a few weeks ago.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know that it was going to be a 24-hour superstore,\u201d said Miller. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not too concerned about it. As long as the people keep their fences up and keep the traffic out of here, I\u2019m good with it,\u201d said nearby resident, Wayne Scott.\n\nBut homeowners in Wayne's neighboring subdivision would rather the Wal-Mart go elsewhere. They've started a petition to keep the supercenter out.\n\n\u201cThe issue for me as a council member is not that, so much as do I know when it becomes public, so that I can let the public know,\u201d said Miller.\n\nNow, some residents wonder if Norman city officials locked them out of the majority of the public vetting process.\n\n\u201cNo one was kept in the dark,\u201d said Norman's Director of Planning and Community Development, Susan Connors.\n\nConnors admits the application for the new supercenter did not identify it as a Wal-Mart.\n\n\u201cWhich isn\u2019t required. There\u2019s no requirement that the application specify who will be the retail business,\u201d said Connors. \u201cThe application came in, and the applicants identified it as a large retail discount center with a gas station, and that\u2019s how they preferred to have it go through the process.\u201d\n\nConnors also says neighbors were mailed notices about the proposal and there was an advertisement in the newspaper complete with a site plan.\n\n\u201cIt went through the process, and people were notified as any other zone change occurs, or any other development case,\u201d said Connors.\n\n\u201cThere no project that\u2019s totally good, or totally bad for some people, and that\u2019s one of the hard things about making these decisions,\u201d said Miller.\n\nThe Norman City council will vote on the new Wal-Mart after a public hearing, August 12.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The plan to build a new Wal-Mart supercenter has some people in Norman fighting to stop it.", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/26195815/controversy-surrounds-plans-for-new-wal-mart-supercenter-in-norman", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4393549_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The plan to build a new Wal-Mart supercenter has some people in Norman fighting to stop it.", "title": "Controversy Surrounds Plans For New Wal-Mart  Supercenter In Norman"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4393549_G.jpg", "description": "The plan to build a new Wal-Mart supercenter has some people in Norman fighting to stop it.", "card": "summary", "title": "Controversy Surrounds Plans For New Wal-Mart  Supercenter In Norman"}, "wnreadableurl": "controversy-surrounds-plans-for-new-wal-mart-supercenter-in-norman", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/08/04", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,norman,wal-mart,supercenter,neighbors,fighting,controversy,evan anderson,kwtv,cbs,news9", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS22", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,norman,wal-mart,supercenter,neighbors,fighting,controversy,evan anderson,kwtv,cbs,news9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc12b\"", "article_summary": "A new Wal-Mart supercenter will essentially be in the heart of Councilwoman Lynne Miller's district.\nThe plan to build a new Wal-Mart supercenter has some people in Norman fighting to stop it.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know that it was going to be a 24-hour superstore,\u201d said Miller.\nBut she says she didn't know about the retail giant's potential arrival until a few weeks ago.\n\u201cThe issue for me as a council member is not that, so much as do I know when it becomes public, so that I can let the public know,\u201d said Miller."}
