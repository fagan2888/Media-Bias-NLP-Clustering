By Ernie Smith / Nov 6, 2014 (iStock/Thinkstock) (iStock/Thinkstock)\n\nBelieving healthcare plans that fail to cover inpatient hospital stays are not in the spirit of the law, two federal agencies this week said they would work to deny access to such policies within the next year.\n\nThe Obama administration is ready to close one of the more notable loopholes in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Treasury Department announced in a fact sheet [PDF] that they would begin to more heavily scrutinize extremely basic health plans that do not cover inpatient hospitalization. More details:\n\nThe skinny on \u201cskinny\u201d healthcare: The so-called skinny healthcare plans, designed to get around the penalties mandated for large businesses by the 2010 law, cover only basic preventive health services, leaving workers on the hook for the full cost of any other medical expense. However, the low level of coverage receives a passing grade through a \u201cminimum value calculator\u201d offered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) [PDF]. The approach is generally allowed for large businesses, but small businesses can opt into such plans by joining associations offering health plans, USA Today reported.\n\nClosing the loophole: When the calculator\u2019s deficiencies were first reported by Kaiser Health News in September, groups such as the National Retail Federation suggested that the health plans wouldn\u2019t pass federal scrutiny. They were right. In their statement, HHS and the Treasury Department emphasized that relying on the calculator wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThe Departments believe that plans that fail to provide substantial coverage for in-patient hospitalization services or for physician services (or for both) \u2026 do not provide the minimum value intended by the minimum value requirement,\u201d the agencies said, adding they they would make changes to the regulations starting next year.\n\nIndustry reactions: The move by the agencies largely received approval from business groups and medical groups alike. The American Hospital Association, which expressed alarm to CMS \u201cthat plans could offer health insurance that did not include inpatient hospital benefits,\u201d welcomed the move by HHS and the Treasury to fix the situation. National Business Coalition on Health CEO Brian Klepper also welcomed the move, suggesting that the prior plans were predatory in nature. \u201cThe purpose of insurance is to cover the services that most of us cannot afford when we desperately need it,\u201d Klepper told USA Today.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, the American Staffing Association, which represents temporary staffing agencies and had endorsed the previous skinny policies, emphasized to The Washington Post that the move was a \u201cpositive, constructive, sensible step\u201d and credited the agencies for not penalizing companies that had offered such plans or employees who had taken them.\n\nShare this article", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two federal agencies this week said they would work to deny access to healthcare plans that fail to cover inpatient hospital stays.", "pocket-site-verification": "f7059b70f081a1e1ced322fc1d9787", "og": {"site_name": "Associations Now", "description": "Two federal agencies this week said they would work to deny access to healthcare plans that fail to cover inpatient hospital stays.", "title": "Obama Administration Says No to \"Skinny\" Healthcare Plans", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1106_health.jpg", "url": "http://associationsnow.com/2014/11/obama-administration-says-no-to-skinny-healthcare-plans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Associations Now", "description": "Two federal agencies this week said they would work to deny access to healthcare plans that fail to cover inpatient hospital stays.", "title": "Obama Administration Says No to \"Skinny\" Healthcare Plans", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1106_health.jpg", "creator": "@associationsnow", "site": "@associationsnow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 502961619}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AssociationsNow", "section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2014-11-06T16:14:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Money & Business, healthcare"}, "article_summary": "Obama Administration Says No to \"Skinny\" Healthcare Plans AND What's this?\nMore details:The skinny on \u201cskinny\u201d healthcare: The so-called skinny healthcare plans, designed to get around the penalties mandated for large businesses by the 2010 law, cover only basic preventive health services, leaving workers on the hook for the full cost of any other medical expense.\nThe approach is generally allowed for large businesses, but small businesses can opt into such plans by joining associations offering health plans, USA Today reported.\nClosing the loophole: When the calculator\u2019s deficiencies were first reported by Kaiser Health News in September, groups such as the National Retail Federation suggested that the health plans wouldn\u2019t pass federal scrutiny.\nThe Obama administration is ready to close one of the more notable loopholes in the Affordable Care Act."}
