REUTERS/Mike Segar (UNITED STATES - Tags: HEALTH SOCIETY POLITICS) - RTR3FIUC\n\n4656058\n\nBleeding cash, the Louisiana Department of Insurance (LDI) announced Friday that Louisiana\u2019s Obamacare health insurance co-op will be closing its doors by the end of 2015.\n\nIt will be the second collapse of an Obamacare health care co-op this year and the third since the Obama administration rolled them out in 2012 as a competitor to commercial health insurance companies.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Louisiana co-op was fraught with high-paid consultants who were not even from Louisiana, but Georgia. It also suffered from an apparent conflict of interest. George Cromer, its CEO, simultaneously served the Louisiana House of Representatives as chairman of that legislative body\u2019s insurance committee.\n\nRoughly 18 months into its existence, in September 2012, the Louisiana co-op received $66 million from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. By 2014, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners reported that the co-op had burned through half of its cash and suffered a net operating loss of $23 million.\n\nThe co-op had only enrolled 17,000 paid subscribers out of a total state population of 4.6 million, according to state census data.\n\nAM Best, the insurance rating company, reported in the third quarter of 2014 that the Louisiana co-op\u2019s indebtedness was 198 percent, among the worst performing Obamacare nonprofits in the nation.\n\n\u201cThe onerous burdens of Obamacare have shocked health insurance markets and caused instability in pricing and predictability, and as a result, we\u2019ve seen premiums spike upward,\u201d Louisiana Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon wrote in a press statement July 24 when he announced closure plans for the co-op.\n\n\u201cStart-ups in insurance, especially health insurance, are always a tough row to hoe. Obamacare has made that even more difficult,\u201d the commissioner noted in a press release.\n\nThe LDI\u2019s Office of Financial Solvency will be examining the financial issues that led to its decision to close, and the commissioner has said that the department is \u201con-site at the co-op.\u201d\n\nThe Louisiana Health co-op began with controversy over Terry Shilling, its first CEO. Shilling arranged a lavish contract with his own Atlanta-based consulting firm, Beam Partners, LLC, an arrangement approved by federal Obamacare CMS officials.\n\nFederal officials also approved Shilling as original founder and \u201cinterim CEO\u201d for the co-op, even though in 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission sanctioned him for insider trading as a health executive. Shilling\u2019s consulting firm received more than $3 million from the co-op in 2013 for \u201chealth plan development,\u201d according to its IRS Form 990 filing.\n\nLouisiana insurance documents obtained by the Washington Examiner in August 2013 showed that Beam would receive a separate $4 million contract from the start-up co-op. On top of the contract, the Atlanta firm would receive a 20 percent \u201cperformance fee,\u201d according to the documents. Finally, Beam additionally reaped a \u201cbenefit payment services\u201d that began at $66,667 per month in 2013, culminating in $72,917 in 2016, according to Louisiana co-op insurance filing documents.\n\nSeparate from the preferential contract with Shilling, the co-op represented a potential political conflict of interest. After Shilling\u2019s relationship with the co-op went public, the Atlanta businessman stepped down as interim CEO, to be replaced by Louisiana Rep. George Cromer.\n\nCromer, a Republican, also was the chairman of the Louisiana House committee on health insurance. He did not step down from the position after assuming the co-op post.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to Cromer\u2019s office, but has yet to receive a response.\n\nThe Louisiana co-op is not the first to fold.\n\nIn February, the Iowa Insurance Department assumed receivership and closed the doors of Co-Opportunity Health, an Obamacare co-op that served more than 100,000 customers in Iowa and Nebraska. Co-Opportunity had a loss ratio of 140, which meant that for every dollar it received in premiums, it had to pay out $1.40 in benefits.\n\nThe first failure occurred in 2013, when the Vermont Insurance Commissioner refused to grant a license to a new Obamacare health co-op.\n\nThe Commissioner refused to license the co-op because the president had steered as much as $500,000 of the co-op\u2019s money to his own firm. CMS had approved the loan to the Vermont co-op despite the conflict of interest.\n\nShe also said the co-op\u2019s math was inadequate and failed to meet the state\u2019s financial standards.\n\nFollow Richard Pollock on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
