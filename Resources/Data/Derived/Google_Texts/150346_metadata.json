Traffic on the web site and at the call center continues to be high, suggesting a strong interest by consumers in learning about their health coverage options,\" HHS said in a statement to FoxNews.com last week.\n\nHowever, Gibbs told MSNBC he does not believe that is the case.\n\n\u201cThis was not a server problem, like, right, just too many people came to the website,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cThis is a website architecture problem.\u201d\n\nGibbs said he does not believe that the problems currently plaguing ObamaCare will prove fatal for the law, as the open enrollment will continue through the end of March. However, he expressed worry that those trying to access the website would eventually give up after multiple failed attempts.\n\n\u201cI hope they are working day and night to get this done,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cAnd when they get it fixed, I hope they fire some people that were in charge of making sure this thing was supposed to work. We knew there were going to be some glitches. But these were glitches that go, quite frankly, way beyond the pale of what should be expected.\"", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Cabinet,/FOX
