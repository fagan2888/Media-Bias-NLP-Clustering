Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele from the comedy show of the same last names, are the guest editors and cover guys for Entertainment Weekly‘s comedy issue.

Key & Peele handpicked the comedy articles and interviews that they wanted to see in the special edition of EW. They arranged a joint interview with Chelsea Peretti of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” and Ike Barinholtz from “The Mindy Project”, plus an interview with Bob Odenkirk and David Cross talking about their classic sketch comedy HBO series, “Mr. Show”.

Besides interviews, Key & Peele worked on some features of their own including a complete guide to “The State” and a list of 28 people, bits, sketches and scenes that every comedy fan should know.

The also handled some of Entertainment Weekly’s regular features like “Bullseye” which you find at the back of the magazine and this week’s “Must List”. On the “Must List”, Peele really likes “The Boxtrolls” and Key is into “Gotham”.

The guest editors also sit down for their own interview with EW. In it, they talk about how President Obama approached them to help with a comedy short to promote the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. Key & Peele could not fit the President into their schedule while working on the new season of their show. President Obama ended up turning to Zach Galifiankis and Funny or Die’s “Between Two Ferns”. That episode would go on to win an Emmy Award.

New episodes of “Key & Peele” can be seen Wednesdays at 10:30 pm et on Comedy Central.
