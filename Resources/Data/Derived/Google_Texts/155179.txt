Head to your nearest pharmacy and grab a sympathy card for RNC chairman Reince Priebus: Conservative media celebrity Glenn Beck announced Wednesday that he’s leaving the Republican Party.

“I’ve made my decision – I’m out. I’m out of the Republican Party,” the founder of The Blaze announced on his radio show. “I am not a Republican; I will not give a dime to the Republican Party. I’m out. I highly recommend – run from the Republican Party. They are not good.”

As you might guess, Beck isn’t quitting the GOP because he’s disillusioned with its ever-rightward drift. Instead, Beck asserted, the Republican Party is no longer a home for True Conservatives™.

“They ran and they said they were doing all of these great things and they were going to stand against Obamacare and illegal immigration – they set us up. They set us up. Enough is enough. They’re torpedoing the constitution and they’re doing it knowingly. They’re taking on people like Mike Lee and Ted Cruz and they are torpedoing them. Knowingly,” Beck said.
