The race for president: The Republicans

Following his resounding 60 percent win in last week's New York primary, Donald Trump is looking to Pennsylvania (and four other states) this week to help him inch closer to claiming the mantle of “presumptive Republican presidential nominee.”

Mr. Trump holds a 20 percentage point lead in the Keystone State. But Pennsylvania's unbound delegates rule will make hollow even a winning vote ratio that is a laugher. And whether he can secure the necessary 1,237 delegates to win the nomination before this summer's convention in Cleveland remains an iffy proposition.

Challengers Ted Cruz and John Kasich can't win the nomination outright; their paths clearly involve a contested convention. Who emerges as the nominee from that is anybody's guess.

Today, a few thoughts on the Republicans.

• Trump, the billionaire New York business mogul, supports affirmative action and gun and gay rights; opposes abortion, crony capitalism and “green” energy; believes “free trade” is a charade; would dramatically crack down on legal and illegal immigration (think border wall); vows to “save” Social Security; is strident in his foreign policy pronouncements; favors school vouchers and charter schools; and opposes Common Core. He would roll back ObamaCare.

•Mr. Cruz, the U.S. senator of Texas, is a staunch Second Amendment defender; opposes gay rights and affirmative action; opposes abortion, corporate wealthfare and believes the Export-Import Bank should be scuttled; favors very stringent immigration controls; vows to privatize Social Security; and calls for renewed U.S. leadership in world affairs. He would seek the repeal of ObamaCare.

•Mr. Kasich, the Ohio governor, supports gun and gay rights but straddles the affirmative action fence; opposes abortion; believes lower taxes for all spur growth; and appears to be more of a conservationist than an environmentalist. He likes some of the ideas of Common Core but not the program, per se; supports free trade as long as it is “fair”; would lower Social Security benefits to shore up the program; and favors personal retirement savings accounts. He opposes ObamaCare but accepted Medicaid expansion.

While some Republicans argue that there's small choice in rotten apples and no choice among stinking fish, choices will be made Tuesday. Vote your principles and choose wisely.
