The college sophomore secured an internship with a Maryland-based print company in March 2012, putting her well on her way to fulfilling a degree requirement mandated by the university\u2019s Graphic Communications program of completing two internships.\n\nThe internships could be either paid or unpaid, and interns are required to work full-time \u2014 40 hours each week. The company she planned to work for would pay her $10 an hour and provide her with housing, she told Red Alert Politics.\n\nBut the Clemson student received an email in October saying her internship had been cancelled \u2014 because of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI have some bad news,\u201d the email stated. The program\u2019s internship coordinator \u201cbrought up some issues to the employers at [Clemson\u2019s job fair] about Obamacare. With the current uneasy state of what is going on with the government and what wasn\u2019t foreseen by [the company], there is a chance that we may have to suspend our internship program temporarily to avoid a $7,000 fee.\n\n\u201cSince there is no clause about internships, we are not sure what to do,\u201d the email continues. \u201c\u2026 I will keep you updated when we know what is going on with the ACA. Sorry about this inconvenience, as it was very unexpected.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an unforeseen consequence of Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate and a subject neither the Internal Revenue Service nor the Department of Health and Human Services has broached, at least not publicly. Many interns work more than 30 hours each week, and if they\u2019re completed during the fall or spring semesters, interns work a minimum of 90 days. Under the employer mandate, they\u2019re considered full-time employees, and companies are therefore required to provide them with health insurance.\n\nAccording to Sarah Swinehart, communications director for the House Ways and Means Committee, paid interns are considered employees, and companies would therefore have to cover them under the employer mandate.\n\nAfter the Affordable Care Act was passed by Congress in 2010, the IRS released more than 18 pages of regulations specifically to help employers determine the difference between part-time and full-time employees, and whether or not they would be required to provide workers with health insurance.\n\nAccording to the document, some employees are exempt from receiving coverage because of a labor statute called the safe harbor exemption. The provision includes seasonal and agricultural workers, and the IRS uses the example of a ski instructor. But interns are neither included nor defined in the exception.\n\n\u201cSeasonal right now, according to the IRS, is agricultural seasonal workers or holiday retail,\u201d Robert Olson, a San Diego-based labor attorney, said.\n\nOlson added he has not seen interns categorized yet, \u201cand the only way interns have been classified is through that Supreme Court opinion and the Department of Labor\u2019s opinion. And if you don\u2019t meet those qualifications, then you\u2019re considered an employee.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Labor classification mentioned by Olson is in reference to a six-pronged test to work as an unpaid intern.\n\nTo be deemed full-time, the IRS states employees must work more than 30 hours each week for 120 days. Those days, however, do not have to be consecutive but must be within 360 days. And for some interns, including Montgomery, internships last beyond that time frame.\n\nAt General Electric, for example, interns work more than 30 hours each week. The program is offered in the fall, spring and summer semesters, and some stay on for consecutive terms \u2014 even working as long seven months. The company, a spokeswoman told Red Alert, has not yet broached the topic of healthcare for their interns.\n\nEdmund Haislmaier, a healthcare policy expert at The Heritage Foundation, said interns generally would qualify for the safe harbor exception. But he, too, said the agency has not yet included them.\n\nThis uncertainty, Haislmaier said, is one of many surrounding the employer mandate and an aspect of why it was delayed.\n\n\u201cThe proposed rule on the employer mandate of Jan. 2, 2013 does not specifically address how paid interns are to be treated for purposes of the employer mandate,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe Administration has not yet issued a final rule that will, presumably, [be] addressing this and other issues relating to the employer mandate.\u201d\n\nNeither the IRS nor HHS returned Red Alert\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOlson, though, said this issue also affects companies that employ less than 50 workers and take on paid interns, too.\n\n\u201cThe more unchartered territory is those that are on the cusp, the 50-employee cusp,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more cautious in creating an internship program.\u201d\n\nIf paid interns do, indeed, qualify for coverage under the employer mandate, companies may think twice before taking on a number that would push them over the 50-employee threshold.\n\nThe Obama administration has more than a year before the employer mandate takes effect, but Olson noted the issue of providing paid employees health insurance is not one many companies are aware of.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t thought of it yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey only know as much as what the media might put out but don\u2019t know how they will be affected. \u2026 It\u2019s just a matter of being aware and trying to keep up with what\u2019s coming up from the government.\u201d\n\nMontgomery, in the meantime, said Clemson University is looking into altering its internship requirements in anticipation of the employer mandate\u2019s regulations. The university did not return Red Alert\u2019s request for comment.\n\nBut until 2015, all companies can do is wait.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Heather Montgomery had the upcoming spring semester at Clemson University all planned out.
