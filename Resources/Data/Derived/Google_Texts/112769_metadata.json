We did good work \u2013 it\u2019s very much not completed yet, but I\u2019m not in government any more so I can\u2019t fix that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSomething I don\u2019t think we did adequately enough in government is looking beyond the clinical and the NHS sphere and looking at the environmental and the social factors.\u201d\n\nLaunched this week, the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute is funded and chaired by MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis, who has given the venture \u00a32m.\n\nFor Mackenzie \u2013 the daughter of a clinical psychologist, whom she credits with first sparking her interest in mental health \u2013 focusing on a practical, fixable problem is a bonus after five years of firefighting in the coalition. \u201cIn government, you wake up every day and you\u2019ve got at least 3,000 problems you ought to be trying to fix,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able to say, actually, I can\u2019t fix that. I\u2019m just going to focus on the stuff where I can make a difference.\u201d\n\nShe admitted it was easier to look openly at some of the social effects on mental health now she was no longer part of a government imposing welfare cuts. \u201cI think there is something in that, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cI think one thing that was a mistake is this idea that you want to treat people who are benefit claimants as the same as anybody else, to be given more and more responsibility for money management.\n\nRelated: Mental health problems aren\u2019t all in the brain | Clare Allan\n\n\u201cThe assessment was that to make it easier for people to move into work it had to be harder to live on benefits. But being in financial anxiety \u2026 has an impact on your IQ equivalent to losing an entire night\u2019s sleep,\u201d she added, citing the book Scarcity by economist Sendhil Mullainathan and psychologist Eldar Shafir. \u201cSo we were asking people in financial anxiety to do more to manage their money, even though their cognitive bandwidth is demonstrably reduced simply by the anxiety.\u201d\n\nAlthough the institute will cover diagnosed disorders as well as general mental health issues such as stress, short-term chaotic spending is the first target. Mackenzie and Lewis plan to push for a change in regulation, allowing a person to register as suffering from a mental health issue and offering banks a trusted friend to contact if they spot unusual spending patterns in an account.\n\nLewis said that was an issue raised time and again by people who sought his help as they faced financial disaster. \u201cPeople have conditions which are temporary and those short episodes \u2026 go on to ruin their lives,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cTheir financial lives are permanently crippled.\u201d\n\nLewis, who met Mackenzie as she prepared one of former Lib Dem leader Clegg\u2019s speeches in the wake of the 2008 financial crash, said he himself had had moments where he \u201creally, genuinely found it difficult to get out of bed \u2026 I thought, \u2018Thank heavens I\u2019ve got money. Thank heavens that I can take a few days off.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re five times more likely to have debt crisis if you have a mental health issue. It really started to hit me: bloody hell, we have to do something. And then I got in the position where I was able to do something.\u201d\n\nRelated: Six things students can do to boost their mental health\n\nCreating a register where there is no potential for exploitation of vulnerable people is a difficult task. But Lewis said the financial services companies he spoke to were broadly in favour, though current regulation must change.\n\nThere was also no legal basis for a \u201ctrusted friend\u201d, Mackenzie admitted, and close friends and spouses could often be enablers of crisis spending. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be scared to shut off my husband\u2019s credit card but there are lots of wives who would be, especially during a period of manic episode,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need someone close enough to know what you are doing, but not who might indulge you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time I have written this on social media, I am swamped with people saying, \u2018please do this\u2019,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI think we would get 10,000 [sign-ups] on day one \u2026 six figures easily in a few years.\u201d\n\nLonger-term, Mackenzie said she hoped to look at one of the opportunities she felt was missed when the coalition tackled welfare reform \u2013 the use of new technology to help people in dire poverty manage their finances more easily.\n\n\u201cIain [Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary] was very keen on doing trials of benefit cards, which we [the Lib Dems] blocked routinely,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of using policy to improve lives, it was very much [for] stigmatising \u2013 like the red door [on homes of asylum seekers], the Azure card [given to refugees in place of money], the worst of those experiments.\n\n\u201cBut, actually, I do think there was an opportunity there. Mental health and finance are both being radically shifted by technology, and we may be able to do that better.\u201d\n\nRelated: Paul Donnachie\u2019s benefits were suspended. Months later, he killed himself | Frances Ryan\n\nWhen, like so many others in the Lib Dems, Mackenzie found herself a political outsider after the general election last year, it would have perhaps been natural for her to turn her attention to criticising the Conservatives\u2019 cuts; the Lib Dems always claimed to have a softening influence upon their colleagues in the coalition.\n\nOnly last week, ministers again sought to take up to \u00a31,500 a year in benefit payments from people with psychiatric conditions, a measure struck out last year by the House of Lords.\n\nBut Mackenzie is not prepared to make enemies at the expense of making real change. \u201cI can\u2019t turn up at the door of No 10 and say \u2018treble benefits!\u2019 because you won\u2019t win.\n\n\u201cBut if you can demonstrate that during the course of a depressive episode it\u2019s hard to comply, and say \u2018wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could create a different sort of compliance regime for people with mental health issues on jobseeker\u2019s allowance\u2019, then there are plenty of sensible people in government who will say, \u2018that\u2019s interesting, sure\u2019, as long as it was based on actual evidence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not setting up another voice to complain about fiscal policy. I have views on it, but that\u2019s not my job. I\u2019d rather do whatever it is that can directly improve as many people\u2019s lives as possible \u2013 without sounding too much like John Stuart Mill.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "MoneySavingExpert Martin Lewis and ex-Lib Dem adviser Polly Mackenzie to study link between mental health issues and debt", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Jessica Elgot", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "MoneySavingExpert Martin Lewis and ex-Lib Dem adviser Polly Mackenzie to study link between mental health issues and debt", "title": "Mental health and debt crisis: we have to act, say thinktank founders", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/05/mental-health-debt-crisis-martin-lewis-polly-mackenzie", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e3ba75d16c233a625057a985d2a10f0e532cb59/0_113_4291_2575/master/4291.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=dcb80cc9e37f21e38652905fe591f067", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://society/2016/mar/05/mental-health-debt-crisis-martin-lewis-polly-mackenzie?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/05/mental-health-debt-crisis-martin-lewis-polly-mackenzie", "iphone": "gnmguardian://society/2016/mar/05/mental-health-debt-crisis-martin-lewis-polly-mackenzie?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0e3ba75d16c233a625057a985d2a10f0e532cb59/0_113_4291_2575/master/4291.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://society/2016/mar/05/mental-health-debt-crisis-martin-lewis-polly-mackenzie?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Mental health,Health,Society,UK news,Politics,Benefits,Money", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2016-03-05T09:00:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jessica-elgot", "section": "Society", "modified_time": "2016-05-07T14:14:50.000Z", "tag": "Mental health,Health,Society,UK news,Politics,Benefits,Money"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e3ba75d16c233a625057a985d2a10f0e532cb59/0_113_4291_2575/4291.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=bc970c564a19ff7fb5d264757b5a5513", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Mental health,Health,Society,UK news,Politics,Benefits,Money"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16b5\"", "article_summary": "One of Nick Clegg\u2019s closest advisers, credited with pushing mental health as a focal point for the Liberal Democrats during their time in power, is to head up a new thinktank to examine the potentially life-long effect that mental health issues can have on a person\u2019s finances.\nThank heavens that I can take a few days off.\u2019\u201cYou\u2019re five times more likely to have debt crisis if you have a mental health issue.\nMental health and finance are both being radically shifted by technology, and we may be able to do that better.\u201dRelated: Paul Donnachie\u2019s benefits were suspended.\nRelated: Mental health problems aren\u2019t all in the brain | Clare Allan\u201cThe assessment was that to make it easier for people to move into work it had to be harder to live on benefits.\nFor Mackenzie \u2013 the daughter of a clinical psychologist, whom she credits with first sparking her interest in mental health \u2013 focusing on a practical, fixable problem is a bonus after five years of firefighting in the coalition."}
