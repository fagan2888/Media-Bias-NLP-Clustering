The most vulnerable locations include the fuel line, the cockpit or anywhere close to the fuselage skin.\n\n\"The placement is the critical thing,\" said Jimmie Oxley, a professor of chemistry who specializes in explosives at the University of Rhode Island.\n\nOxley and other experts drew parallels with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 by Libyan nationals over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988. An investigation showed a palm-sized explosive in a cassette recorder in a bag in the luggage hold had ripped a 50 centimeter hole in the fuselage and decompression caused the plane to break up in mid-air.\n\nThe apparent similarities, the detonator and switch suggested the soda can device was on a timer, rather than operated by a suicide bomber, suggested a similar chain of events on the Russian airliner, some experts said.\n\nHowever, Clive Williams, a professor at the Australian National University's Centre for Military and Security Law and a member of the International Association of Bomb Technicians and Investigators, said the use of a soda can raised questions about whether the device was included in the catering supply.\n\nExperts added that the photo could also provide a key clue in tracking Islamic State as the detonator pictured was a commercial one, which could be traced back to its manufacturer.\n\n\"TERRORIST ACTIVITY\"\n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said on Wednesday the U.S. government was not in a position to confirm \"the veracity\" of the magazine's claim.\n\n\"We do believe that terrorist activity is likely the reason,\" he said, referring to the crash.\n\nIslamic State also published a photo of what it said were passports belonging to dead Russians \"obtained by the mujahideen\". It was not immediately possible to verify the authenticity of the published photos.\n\nThe group, which has seized large swathes of Syria and Iraq, said it had exploited a loophole at Sharm al-Sheikh airport, where the plane originated, in order to smuggle a bomb on board.\n\nThe airport is widely used by budget and charter airlines to fly tourists to the nearby resorts on the Sinai coast.\n\nIslamic State said it had initially planned to bring down a plane belonging to a country participating in the U.S.-led coalition bombing it in Syria and Iraq, but it changed course after Moscow started its own air strikes campaign in Syria.\n\n\"A bomb was smuggled onto the airplane, leading to the deaths of 219 Russians and five other crusaders only a month after Russia's thoughtless decision,\" it said.\n\nEgypt's interior minister told a news conference in Sharm al-Sheikh on Tuesday that there was \"no information\" about security lapses at the airport.\n\nIslamic State's Egyptian branch, Sinai Province, claimed responsibility for the attack the day it happened but Egyptian officials were quick to dismiss talk of a bomb as premature.\n\nNO SAFETY IN MUSLIM LANDS\n\nEgypt is battling an Islamist insurgency in the Sinai, a strategic peninsula bordering Israel, Gaza and the Suez Canal. But Islamic State said the airline attack was primarily planned as a response to Russian and Western air strikes.\n\n\"This was to show the Russians and whoever allies with them that they will have no safety in the lands and airspace of the Muslims,\" the group wrote.\n\nRussia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, launched air strikes against opposition groups in Syria including Islamic State, on Sept. 30.\n\nThe downed aircraft had been carrying Russian holidaymakers from the Egyptian resort to St Petersburg when it broke up over Sinai.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to hunt down those responsible and offered a $50 million reward for information leading to the perpetrators.\n\n\"We will find them anywhere on the planet and punish them,\" Putin said at a somber Kremlin meeting.\n\nAlexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's FSB security service, said traces of foreign-made explosive had been found on fragments of the downed plane and on passengers' personal belongings. He said the bomb probably contained around 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of TNT.\n\n(Reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein and Lin Noueihed; Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed in Washington, Jane Wardell in Sydney and Siva Govindasamy in Singapore.; Writing by Ahmed Aboulenein; Editing by Luke Baker, Gareth Jones, Toni Reinhold and Dean Yates)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Islamic State's official magazine carried a photo on Wednesday of a", "title": "Islamic State says 'Schweppes bomb' used to bring down Russian plane", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/18/Islamic-State-shows-photo-improvised-Russian-plane-bomb", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/egypt-crash-bomb-arrests_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/18/Islamic-State-shows-photo-improvised-Russian-plane-bomb", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/egypt-crash-bomb-arrests_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Islamic State's official magazine carried a photo on Wednesday of a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ffb\"", "article_summary": "Islamic State also published a photo of what it said were passports belonging to dead Russians \"obtained by the mujahideen\".\nBut Islamic State said the airline attack was primarily planned as a response to Russian and Western air strikes.\nRussia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, launched air strikes against opposition groups in Syria including Islamic State, on Sept. 30.\nExperts added that the photo could also provide a key clue in tracking Islamic State as the detonator pictured was a commercial one, which could be traced back to its manufacturer.\nIslamic State's Egyptian branch, Sinai Province, claimed responsibility for the attack the day it happened but Egyptian officials were quick to dismiss talk of a bomb as premature."}
