Oklahoma and Oklahoma State have released their 2014 football schedules. With three games to go in the 2013 regular season, both teams are still in the hunt for the Big 12 Title. And no less will be expected from these two next year.

The Sooners open at home against Louisiana Tech on Aug. 30 and then get a bye week before the Tennessee Volunteers come to Norman on Sept. 13. Then they go to Tulsa to face the Golden Hurricane on Sept. 20 to conclude the non-conference schedule.

Oklahoma goes to West Virginia on Sept. 27th and then plays two consecutive games in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, first against TCU on Oct. 4 and then the Sooners get Texas on Oct. 11. They'll return to Norman on Oct. 18 to take on Kansas State and after an off week will go to Ames to face Iowa State on either Oct. 30 or Nov. 1. The next week the Sooners play Baylor at home (Nov. 8) and a trip to see Texas Tech in Lubbock on Nov. 15 is the final road contest for OU. The Sooners will see Kansas in Norman on Nov. 22 and then host Oklahoma State for Bedlam on either Nov. 29 or Dec. 6.

The Cowboys open their season with a headliner on Aug. 30 when they'll face Florida State in Dallas at Jerry's World. Then will return to Boone Pickens Stadium for Missouri State (Sept. 6) and UTSA (Sept. 13). After an open week, OSU begins Big 12 play at home on a Thursday night against Texas Tech (Sept. 25) and then hosts Iowa State on Oct. 4. On Oct. 11 the Cowboys go to Kansas and a week later they're in Fort Worth to take on TCU (Oct. 18).

West Virginia comes to Stillwater on Oct. 25 and on Nov. 1 OSU will play at Kansas State. The Cowboys get a bye week before the home finale against Texas on Nov. 15. Oklahoma State finishes the 2014 Big 12 slate on the road against Baylor (Nov. 22) and then, of course, Bedlam is to-be-determined (either Nov. 29 or Dec. 6).
