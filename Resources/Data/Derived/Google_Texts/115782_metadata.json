Wyoming's senior senator, Mike Enzi, gets to wield one of those gavels in the all-important Budget Committee.\n\nSenator Enzi is quiet and unassuming, but his D.C. office is adorned with Wyoming paraphernalia. Today, he\u2019s at his most gleeful, if still subdued, because of his new chairmanship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited about that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is nice to be in the majority and it\u2019s nice to be a chairman again. It\u2019s good to play offense instead of just defense.\u201d\n\nThat's the equivalent of an end zone dance for Wyoming's senior senator. Enzi's proudly a numbers guy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the first accountant to chair of the Budget Committee in the history of the Budget Committee. Yeah, the rest have been attorneys or a schoolteacher.\u201d\n\nSo what is the Budget Committee? you might be asking. They lay out the blueprint for most all federal spending, or as Enzi describes it, \u201cThe people on the Budget Committee are the ones that get to say how much can be spent next year and then we\u2019re in charge of enforcing to make sure that that\u2019s all that gets spent. And we can make assignments to the different committees on how much they ought to save.\u201d\n\nEnzi says he promises to use his new perch to take aim at the nation's mind numbing eighteen- trillion-dollar debt.\n\n\u201cPeople across American and particularly in Wyoming are concerned about the national debt and what that\u2019s going to do to the next generation. And the budget\u2019s one place that we can get a handle on that.\u201d\n\nHe interestingly was voted by staffers as the nicest senator, which is, you know, he's nice to everybody. And he has been very gracious towards other members of both parties during his entire tenure here. So he has respect, he has camaraderie; and I think that you're going to see this role for Mike Enzi perhaps being his crowning achievement here in the Congress.\n\nYou may remember the controversial Ryan Budget. It was authored by former Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan, the former chair of the House Budget Committee. It angered Democrats for basically turning Medicare into a voucher program, but won praise from the GOP for balancing the budget in a decade. That wasn't good enough for Enzi.\n\n\u201cYou know, one of the problems I\u2019ve had with budgets that I\u2019ve looked at is that they use a lot of gimmicks.\u201d\n\nEnzi says Ryan's budget was misleading because it called for the repeal of so-called Obamacare but applied the mathematical underpinnings of the health law towards deficit reduction. Enzi's mum on the details of what he plans to propose but he\u2019s promising a serious document calling for cuts that will anger voters across the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never easy when you\u2019re talking about money,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd everybody in America gets something from the federal government. And any time we talk about cutting something, we\u2019re cutting about some federal employees who immediately heat up at least ten or twenty people that have benefited from the program to flood in here to make sure that we understand how important it is.\u201d\n\nWyoming Republican Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis says Enzi is well situated to tackle some pressing issues at home too.\n\n\u201cThe abandoned mine lands raids where money is taken from Wyoming and given to eastern states--and taken only from Wyoming and given to eastern states. I\u2019m hopeful that Senator Enzi will be in a position to right that wrong,\u201d Lummis says. \u201cAlso, the fact that mineral royalties were taken from states that have onshore production, and it only happened to people who have onshore, not offshore. So I am hopeful that Senator Enzi will use his perch on Budget to right some of those wrongs.\u201d\n\nLummis says she expects Enzi to be an effective chairman because he\u2019s actually likeable in an institution filled with big egos, many who notoriously treat their staffs like slaves.\n\n\u201cHe interestingly was voted by staffers as the nicest senator, which is \u2013 you know, he\u2019s nice to everybody. He\u2019s nice to everybody on Capitol Hill. And he has been very gracious towards other members of both parties during his entire tenure here. So he has respect, he has camaraderie; and I think that you\u2019re going to see this role for Mike Enzi perhaps being his crowning achievement here in the Congress.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Republicans. Virginia Democratic Senator, and former governor, Tim Kaine serves on Enzi\u2019s committee and looks forward to working with him.\n\n\u201cYeah he is a very, you know, he is an old fashioned guy in the sense of civility and courtesy, let\u2019s listen to each other even if we have very different points of view. If we listen to each other maybe we\u2019ll find some commonalities. I think he\u2019ll be a good chair.\u201d\n\nThe clock\u2019s already ticking though. Enzi needs to produce a budget by April fifteenth to meet the statutory deadline. But Congress is out for a two-week recess right before the deadline, so he\u2019s aiming to get it done in March.\n\n\u201cTo get it done that fast, it will be a master achievement just to get a budget passed that balances in ten years. Then we can refine it, modify it, enforce it and cover the other proposals that still need some salesmanship in order to get done.\u201d\n\nEnzi also has his eyes on reforms, like moving from an annual budget to a two-year budget like they have in the Wyoming legislature.\n\n\u201cWe try to go through the twelve appropriations bills, the spending bills every year,\u201d Enzi says. \u201cThat\u2019s one-and-one-tenths trillion dollars of decisions we actually get to make on the budget. There\u2019s twice that much that we don\u2019t even get to touch because that\u2019s in the mandatory spending. But to touch one-and-one-tenths-trillion dollars \u2013 nobody can imagine how much money that is. So it really isn\u2019t scrutinized.\u201d\n\nEnzi also is lobbying lawmakers on his Penny Plan, which would cut spending by one penny for every dollar the government spends. To get those pennies to add up Enzi and his staff are working overtime these days, and you\u2019ll hear about the results this spring.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Open Spaces", "description": "Republicans now are the majority in both chambers in the U.S. Congress, which means they control all the gavels on Capitol Hill.
