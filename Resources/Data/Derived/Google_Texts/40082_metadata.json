Target is the second-largest U.S. discount retailer by sales and had about 361,000 total employees last fiscal year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is the largest regulatory overhaul of health care since the 1960s, creating a system of penalties and rewards to encourage people to obtain medical insurance. The law known as Obamacare doesn\u2019t require most companies to cover part-time workers, and offering them health plans may disqualify those people from subsidies in new government-run insurance exchanges that opened in October.\n\n\u201cYou see a lot of retailers making adjustments in contemplation of the full effect of the employer mandate penalties in 2015,\u201d said Neil Trautwein, a lobbyist with the National Retail Federation. \u201cEven though it is not effective yet, it is already having an effect on the job market and putting companies where they would probably not otherwise want to be.\u201d\n\nThe move should also reduce the cost of Target\u2019s health benefits, Trautwein said.\n\nThe health law requires all companies employing 50 or more people to offer health insurance to those working at least 30 hours a week starting in 2015. Those that don\u2019t comply may be liable for fines of as much as $3,000 per worker.\n\n\u201cHealth care reform is transforming the benefits landscape and affecting how all employers, including Target, administer health benefits coverage,\u201d Jodee Kozlak, Target\u2019s executive vice president of human resources, said in the Web posting. She cited \u201cnew options available for our part-time team and the historically low number of team members who elected to enroll in the part-time plan.\u201d\n\nNo Target workers will see their hours cut as part of the change, she said. A Target spokeswoman, Jill Hornbacher, wouldn\u2019t say how many part-time workers the company employs, saying in an e-mail that the number \u201cfluctuates often.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act created new government-run health insurance exchanges to sell coverage to uninsured people, often with premiums discounted by federal subsidies. It disqualifies Americans for subsidies at the exchanges if they have an offer of \u201caffordable\u201d coverage from their employers, defined as an insurance premium less than 9.5 percent of their income. Target plans to pay $500 to part-timers losing coverage, and a consulting firm will help those workers sign up for new ACA plans. It said on its website that many part-time workers may prefer coverage from the health law\u2019s exchanges and that by offering them insurance, \u201cwe could actually disqualify many of them from being eligible\u201d for subsidies.\n\nCoverage for employees who work fewer than 30 hours will end April 1, Target said.
