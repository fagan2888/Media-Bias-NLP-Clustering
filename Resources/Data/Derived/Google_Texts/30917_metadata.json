What gives?\n\nObviously there\u2019s the celebrity angle, coupled with the specific \u201cGwyneth Paltrow schadenfreude\u201d element. There were a lot of people who had been eagerly waiting for Paltrow to be taken down a peg, tired of her Goop pronouncement and kale recipes.\n\nBut there was more to it than simply a lot of people who were angry they paid good money to see \u201cSliding Doors\u201d in the theater.\n\nIn fact, most of the responses I got weren\u2019t really about Gwyneth Paltrow at all.\n\nThey were about the reality of being a parent in the US in 2014; the difficulties, the hardships, the desperate juggling act so many moms and dads perform between love and bills and family and work and what it means to live in a country that lags woefully behind in policies that support families and working parents.\n\nI found myself having a really great dialogue with mothers \u2014 and fathers, too \u2014 across the country, most of whom just wanted to say, \u201cHey, thanks for giving us a voice.\u201d\n\nThey also wanted to talk about their lives \u2014 not to complain, but to share their own stories.\n\nAnother big problem facing families is the epidemic of overwork \u2014 otherwise known as the only addiction that\u2019s socially acceptable.\n\n\u201cAs a mother of three children, wife of 23 years (husband facing yet another downsize starting Tuesday), your letter speaks to the work and challenges working mothers face,\u201d wrote one woman in an e-mail.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is daunting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you! I work two jobs at 70 hour per week just to pay the bills! #DivorcedParentsProbs,\u201d tweeted one woman.\n\n\u201cThe message being telegraphed to the little people is that if we would have tried harder to be a millionaire, life would have turned out fabulously,\u201d wrote another.\n\nWomen make up roughly half of the workforce, yet in so many ways we are still treated like second-class citizens, Oliver Twists sidling up to the work table to meekly ask, \u201cPlease, sir, could we have some more?\u201d\n\nMore paid maternity leave, for one. The United States is the only industrialized nation in the world \u2014 the world! \u2014 not to offer paid maternity leave.\n\nSome companies cover up to six weeks paid, followed by a month or so of unpaid leave \u2014 essentially, giving you the privilege of returning to your job without actually paying you. Taking unpaid leave is a privilege many, if not most, American women can\u2019t afford, which means they\u2019re forced back to work before they\u2019re physically or emotionally ready.\n\n\u201cPaid maternity leave costs too much and affects my bottom line,\u201d the business owner might say. To which I answer: When employees feel valued and supported by their companies, they are much more likely to stay. High retention rates are good for employers; finding, hiring and training new employees costs a lot of money.\n\nAnother big problem facing families is the epidemic of overwork \u2014 otherwise known as the only addiction that\u2019s socially acceptable.\n\nAmericans work more than any other developed country \u2014 according to the International Labour Organization, \u201c137 hours more per year than Japanese workers, 260 more hours per year than British workers and 499 more hours per year than French workers.\u201d\n\nAccording to date by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the productivity of the American worker has increased 400% since 1950. That might be good news for the company, but certainly not for the individual.\n\nAll of this \u2014 the lack of paid leave, lack of affordable child care, an accepted culture of overwork and businesses that are slow to embrace flexible or work from home arrangements \u2014 combines to create an atmosphere where many parents feel under attack as they go about the business of trying to raise kids who will grow up to become good future citizens.\n\nAnd it boils down to one thing, whether they were women with high-powered jobs or women working two jobs to make ends meet: Working American parents feel like they\u2019ve reached a tipping point in their attempts to balance life and work. They want \u2014 need \u2014 more support from their elected officials.\n\nThat\u2019s a point that bears repeating again and again until things change. Even if it takes Gwyneth Paltrow to do it.\n\nMackenzie Dawson is a contributing editor at The Post.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Last week, I wrote an open letter to Gwyneth Paltrow about some condescending comments she had made in an interview with E!, where she said moms with the \u201croutine\u201d of an office job had it easier", "title": "It\u2019s not about Gwyneth \u2014 it\u2019s the struggle of being a working", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/spl320035_011.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@msullivandawson", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-4217188\"}", "sailthru.tags": "celebrity-relationships,children,gwyneth-paltrow,parenting,work,working-moms,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2014-04-05 21:29:56", "sailthru.title": "It\u2019s not about Gwyneth \u2014 it\u2019s the struggle of being a working\u00a0mom", "nypost-section": "Living", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/spl320035_011.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "Last week, I wrote an <a title=\"open letter to Gwyneth Paltrow\" href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/03/27/a-working-moms-open-letter-to-gwyneth-paltrow/\">open letter to Gwyneth Paltrow</a> about some condescending comments she had made in an interview with E!, where she said moms with the \u201croutine\u201d of an office job had it easier than her, who had to spend months on a movie set.\r\n\r\nIn the space of a couple of days, I got hundreds of e-mails from working married moms, single moms, stay-at-home moms; divorced dads, finance dads, tech dads, female lawyers, ER nurses, teachers, one country-music star <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/04/02/congolese-refugee-responds-to-working-moms-letter-to-gwyneth/\">and a Congolese refugee</a>.\r\n\r\nWith 3.6 million readers, the letter clearly struck a nerve.
