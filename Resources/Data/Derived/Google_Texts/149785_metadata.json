There's an old hypothesis in economic history called the \"Kuznets Curve\" which postulated that agrarian economies started out very poor but not-so-unequal. Then as they started industrializing, inequality would explode. Because rural productivity is extremely low, early industrialists can earn enormous profits paying highly productive factory workers wages that are only barely above the subsistence-level earnings of the farmers. But the very profitability of this sweatshop industrialism ensures that people will build more and more factories. That creates excess demand for industrial labor, and you get to the part of the curve where China is today\u2014rising wages and falling inequality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOne way of thinking about the contemporary United States is that Kuznets was wrong to think of this as an inverted-U with a single peak. Instead it's a wave, where inequality rises again once the share of the population working in factories falls.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Deindustrialization and Inequality", "sailthru.author": "Matthew Yglesias", "description": "Paul Krugman writes that \"today\u2019s service economy is in many ways like the Edwardian-era economy in which a small number of wealthy people employed a l ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Paul Krugman writes that \"today\u2019s service economy is in many ways like the Edwardian-era economy in which a small number of wealthy people employed a l ...", "title": "Deindustrialization and Inequality", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/12/11/deindustrialization_and_inequality_the_kuznets_curve_bends_again.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/12/11/deindustrialization_and_inequality_the_kuznets_curve_bends_again/453973135.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paul Krugman writes that \"today\u2019s service economy is in many ways like the Edwardian-era economy in which a small number of wealthy people employed a l ...", "title": "Deindustrialization and Inequality", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/12/11/deindustrialization_and_inequality_the_kuznets_curve_bends_again.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/12/11/deindustrialization_and_inequality_the_kuznets_curve_bends_again/453973135.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@mattyglesias", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-11T16:59:09Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Deindustrialization and Inequality", "sailthru.headline": "Deindustrialization and Inequality", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Deindustrialization and Inequality\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/12/11/deindustrialization_and_inequality_the_kuznets_curve_bends_again.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/12/11/deindustrialization_and_inequality_the_kuznets_curve_bends_again/453973135.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"221131211006\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-11T16:59:09Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Business\",\n  \"author\": \"Matthew Yglesias\",\n  \"tags\": [\"inequality\"]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Deindustrialization and Inequality", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "keywords": "industrialization", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "http://www.Facebook.com/mattyglesias"}, "sailthru.tags": "industrialization", "sailthru.description": "Paul Krugman writes that \"today\u2019s service economy is in many ways like the Edwardian-era economy in which a small number of wealthy people employed a l ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/12/11/deindustrialization_and_inequality_the_kuznets_curve_bends_again/453973135.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Instead it's a wave, where inequality rises again once the share of the population working in factories falls.\nIt's interesting to note in this regard that domestic income inequality is shrinking in China as industrialization continues.\nThat creates excess demand for industrial labor, and you get to the part of the curve where China is today\u2014rising wages and falling inequality.\nThen as they started industrializing, inequality would explode.\nThere's an old hypothesis in economic history called the \"Kuznets Curve\" which postulated that agrarian economies started out very poor but not-so-unequal."}
