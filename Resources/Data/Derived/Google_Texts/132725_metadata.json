Will they get it done?\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d state Sen. Mike Schulz, R-Altus, told reporters Thursday. \u201cI want to go home.\u201d\n\nOklahoma's constitution requires the legislature to adjourn on the final Friday in May. Lawmakers have discussed wrapping up their work a week early, which they\u2019ve done every year since 2012.\n\n\u201cWe always get to this time of year and everybody always wants to start speculating about a special session,\u201d Schulz said. \u201cI\u2019m confident in the coming weeks we\u2019ll be able to come together and get it done.\u201d\n\nBut the chairman of the House Appropriations and Budget Committee says it\u2019ll still be another week before lawmakers consider their first budget bills to try to minimize cuts to education and health care in the Fiscal Year 2017 budget.\n\nState Rep. Earl Sears, R-Bartlesville, said the governor\u2019s office and the GOP leadership in the House and Senate have agreed on a couple of ideas that could become legislation heard in the second week of May, The Oklahoman\u2019s Rick Green reports:\n\n\"A number of approaches will develop funds to help us address the shortfall,\" Sears said. \"We're close.\" Health officials have warned they can't sustain major cuts without destabilizing the Medicaid system. Education leaders say reductions will cause programming cuts, teacher layoffs and four-day school weeks.\n\nBut House Minority Leader Scott Inman, D-Del City, says he\u2019s worried about a repeat of last year, when the budget wasn\u2019t introduced until the final day of the session.\n\n\u201cIt was within a few hours they released it, suspended the rules, and made all of us vote on a $7 billion budget without having an opportunity to really review it,\u201d Inman said Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way this process should work. That\u2019s not the way our constituents want it to work.\u201d\n\nSchulz says he sees a \u201cglimmer of hope\u201d in the oil and gas industry. But once production tax revenue recovers, he wants to see tax credits and one-time spending formulas changed to fix what he described as a \u201cstructural deficit\u201d in the budget.\n\nLast month Gov. Mary Fallin proposed using $450 million in bond money to help shore up the $1.3 billion gap. But state Sen. Clark Jolley, R-Edmond, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Thursday bonding should be one of the last options because it\u2019s a one-time source of funding.\n\n\u201cBonding, in many ways, is no different than someone taking a cash advance to use it for money floating purposes,\u201d Jolley said. \u201cOur goal would be if we are going to do a bond, what I\u2019ve advocated is no more than $150 million on a two-year commitment.\u201d\n\nJolley also said transportation, education, and healthcare were priorities, but it\u2019s too early to know what ideas would pass the House or the Senate, and if Fallin would sign them. Lawmakers are also trying to avoid significant slashing to Corrections and Department of Human Services funding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve sustained a lot of cuts in core agencies because we\u2019ve kept education harmless or increased funding to education over the last few years,\u201d Jolley said. \u201cAnd the growth of money that has had to go to our health care area has been dramatic.\u201d\n\nTaxing Tobacco\n\nWhen she unveiled her executive budget during February\u2019s State of the State address, Fallin also proposed raising more than $180 million through a new $1.50-per-pack cigarette tax. Jolley said he supports the idea in order to decrease Oklahoma\u2019s smoking rates by pricing people out of the habit.\n\n\u201cWhat we are paying in healthcare costs \u2013 for what is going to happen because of behaviors today in 20 years \u2013 is significant,\u201d Jolley said.\n\nBut Schulz is against the idea because it puts non-tribal retailers at a disadvantage, since the tribes have some of that tax money refunded. As a lawmaker representing a district along the Red River, he also says Oklahomans who want cheaper cigarettes will simply go to Texas, Kansas, or Arkansas to buy them.\n\nMedicaid Makeover\n\nLawmakers are starting to support a plan to shift coverage for some of Oklahoma's Medicaid recipients in order to trigger an infusion of federal funding, but the idea of funding it with the tobacco tax is facing an uphill battle.\n\nState health officials unveiled the Medicaid Rebalancing Act of 2020 this spring as an alternative to a traditional expansion of Medicaid authorized under the Affordable Care Act. But Inman says he's against putting it on the ballot because of the clout of the tobacco industry.\n\n\u201cIf we're going to try to help our hospitals by bringing in revenue through the cigarette tax, you are jeopardizing that by putting it to a vote of the people where big tobacco can come in and defeat it,\u201d Inman said. \u201cSo if it is defeated, not only will the revenue not come in to help take care of the cuts that are currently facing the Health Care Authority, but it also takes the issue of any potential cigarette tax increase off the table for years, much like when the gasoline tax failed at the ballot.\"\n\nEighty-seven percent of voters disapproved of raising Oklahoma's motor fuel tax in 2005 to pay for road and bridge improvements \u2013 one of the most lopsided defeats of a state question in history. The Medicaid rebalancing plan would still require federal approval, but the biggest hurdle is the $100 million price tag.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know if Medicaid rebalancing is a sure thing, but trying to mitigate of impact on provider rates is absolutely a priority,\u201d Jolley said. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of apportionments. I\u2019m not going to say that we will pass this if it\u2019s directed to that. I think we would want to pass revenue measures or revenue changes to bring permanent change so we\u2019re not using one-time funding and having a structural deficit.\u201d\n\nSchulz says the plan has merit, but his biggest concern is whether moving people from the state\u2019s Medicaid program to the Insure Oklahoma plan for low-income residents would actually change their habits.\n\n\u201cAre they going to start going to the primary care doctor? Start making the wellness checks, appointments like they need to, to really change their health outcomes? Or are they still going to be dependent on the emergency rooms just like they are today?\u201d Schulz said. \u201cThe behavior needs to change for the price of the healthcare delivery to really come down on that population.\u201d\n\nKGOU produces journalism in the public interest, essential to an informed electorate.
