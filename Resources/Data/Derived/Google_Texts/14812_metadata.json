What are you supposed to look like?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would move to the right maybe four feet and get out of the way and let Jay Leno talk,\u201d Fallon replied.\n\nFallon pulled out a cardboard cutout of Christie and set it behind the New Jersey governor for emphasis.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t find that distracting?\u201d Fallon asked.\n\n\u201cHe looks serious. He\u2019s listening,\u201d Christie said.\n\nChristie made headlines and shocked pundits when he endorsed Trump in February, after heavily criticizing him in the past.\n\nThe New Jersey governor since appeared on the campaign trail with Trump.\n\n\u201cI thought really hard\u201d about the endorsement, Christie said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I drew it out of a hat or something, Jimmy. It was my judgement that I thought he was better than the other two.\u201d\n\nFallon asked Christie about rumors he may be Trump\u2019s pick for vice president.\n\n\u201cI have a hard time believing anybody would be asking me to be vice president because of that,\u201d he said, pointing to the cardboard cutout behind him.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re vice president, that\u2019s basically what you do. I\u2019ve got to get better at it then that, obviously.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cIf you\u2019re used to talking, it\u2019s awkward not to talk,\" he said.", "description": "\u201cIf you\u2019re used to talking, it\u2019s awkward not to talk,\" he said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cIf you\u2019re used to talking, it\u2019s awkward not to talk,\" he said.", "title": "Christie explains 'awkward' stare behind Trump", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/274977-christie-explains-awkward-stare-behind-trump", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/trumpdonald_030116_screegrab.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-02T11:23:44-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-02T11:23-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/274977-christie-explains-awkward-stare-behind-trump", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-02T11:23-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Elliot Smilowitz", "author": "Jessie Hellmann", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-02T11:23:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-02T11:23:44-04:00"}, "keywords": ",Donald Trump,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/274977-christie-explains-awkward-stare-behind-trump", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cIf you\u2019re used to talking, it\u2019s awkward not to talk,\" he said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Christie explains 'awkward' stare behind Trump"}, "dcterms.title": "Christie explains 'awkward' stare behind Trump"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENT \u201cIf you\u2019re used to talking, it\u2019s awkward not to talk, so if you\u2019re standing there, I\u2019m listening.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re vice president, that\u2019s basically what you do.\nHe\u2019s listening,\u201d Christie said.\nChristie made headlines and shocked pundits when he endorsed Trump in February, after heavily criticizing him in the past.\n\u201cI have a hard time believing anybody would be asking me to be vice president because of that,\u201d he said, pointing to the cardboard cutout behind him."}
