It doesn't look like there will be.\n\nAt issue is the fact that the GOP refuses to pass a budget unless there's some sort of cancellation, defunding, or delay to Obamacare. Obviously, Democrats won't support such a bill, and Obama would never sign it.\n\nSo: gridlock.\n\nMeanwhile, in Italy, the entirety of Silvio Berlusconi's Popolo della Libert\u00e0, or PDL Party, has indicated that they will resign from government, threatening to collapse the fragile coalition that was established after February's election. So it's unclear what happens now, and if a new coalition can be formed, but it's not good.\n\nSo you have the world's largest government bond market (the U.S.) and the world's third largest (Italy) both experiencing political crises on the same weekend.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Joe Weisenthal", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Italy and the US are both in political trouble.", "creator": "thestalwart", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/italy-and-the-us-both-experiencing-government-crises-2013-9", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/4fc905d66bb3f7144b000006-506-253/great-2-of-the-3-largest-government-debt-markets-are-experiencing-political-crises-on-the-same-weekend.jpg", "title": "GREAT: 2 Of The 3 Largest Government Debt Markets Are Experiencing Political Crises On The Same Weekend", "site": "themoneygame", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "moneygame,clusterstock,politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Markets, Italy, Government shutdown, Joe Weisenthal", "description": "Italy and the US are both in political trouble.", "author": "Joe Weisenthal", "sailthru.date": "2013-09-28", "sailthru.title": "GREAT: 2 Of The 3 Largest Government Debt Markets Are Experiencing Political Crises On The Same Weekend", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/4fc905d66bb3f7144b000006-50-50/great-2-of-the-3-largest-government-debt-markets-are-experiencing-political-crises-on-the-same-weekend.jpg", "news_keywords": "Markets, Italy, Government shutdown, Joe Weisenthal", "tbi-image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/4fc905d66bb3f7144b000006/great-2-of-the-3-largest-government-debt-markets-are-experiencing-political-crises-on-the-same-weekend.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2013-09-28", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/joe-weisenthal"}, "sailthru.description": "Italy and the US are both in political trouble.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Italy and the US are both in political trouble.", "title": "GREAT: 2 Of The 3 Largest Government Debt Markets Are Experiencing Political Crises On The Same Weekend", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/italy-and-the-us-both-experiencing-government-crises-2013-9", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/4fc905d66bb3f7144b000006-1190-625/great-2-of-the-3-largest-government-debt-markets-are-experiencing-political-crises-on-the-same-weekend.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "GREAT: 2 Of The 3 Largest Government Debt Markets Are Experiencing Political Crises On The Same Weekend", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/4fc905d66bb3f7144b000006/great-2-of-the-3-largest-government-debt-markets-are-experiencing-political-crises-on-the-same-weekend.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "moneygame"}, "article_summary": "So you have the world's largest government bond market (the U.S.) and the world's third largest (Italy) both experiencing political crises on the same weekend.\nThat's because two out of the three countries with the largest debt markets in the world are experiencing political crises right now.\nSo it's unclear what happens now, and if a new coalition can be formed, but it's not good.\nWhen markets reopen on Sunday evening, things might be interesting.\nMeanwhile, in Italy, the entirety of Silvio Berlusconi's Popolo della Libert\u00e0, or PDL Party, has indicated that they will resign from government, threatening to collapse the fragile coalition that was established after February's election."}
