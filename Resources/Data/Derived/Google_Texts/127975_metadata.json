Credit: Associated Press\n\nBy\n\nThe Aug. 20 dialogue at the Milwaukee Art Museum on \"Eggs Benedict\" presented a classic conflict between faith and science. Science, represented by the church, won.\n\nThe faith, in this case, was ideological, ridiculing Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI for saying that distribution of condoms had not stemmed the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa and had actually made it worse. The science, brilliantly summarized by Dr. Christine Zainer, consisted of detailed empirical studies and opinions from public health experts showing that condom distribution had in fact failed to stem the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa; and had, indeed, contributed to spreading HIV/AIDS.\n\nBecause of the public health phenomenon known as \"risk compensation,\" condom distribution makes people think sex with condoms is safer than it is. They therefore engage in high-risk sexual activity that they would otherwise refrain from, resulting in transmission of HIV/AIDS to people who would not otherwise contract it. Because no condom is 100% effective, and many fall far short of that (especially if they are re-used), the false sense of security generated by condom distribution leads to HIV/AIDS infections that would not otherwise have occurred.\n\nIn short, as explained by Edward C. Green, a senior research fellow at the Harvard University School of Public Health and a self-described liberal and pro-contraceptionist, \"The pope was right.\" Benedict's statement was not the mindless assertion of religious dogma over science-based health care that \"Eggs Benedict\" falsely portrayed it as being. It was, rather, a courageous witness to human dignity based on religious faith but solidly backed by well-informed scientific opinion and empirical data. It was the artist, Niki Johnson, not the pontiff, who ignored the relevant science.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel reported that the artist \"challenged\" Dr. Zainer's \"stats.\" That was rather generous. The \"challenge\" consisted of asserting, without a shred of empirical support, that the data presented by Dr. Zainer \"just isn't true.\" When a member of the audience asked whether the artist or any of her supporters knew of any peer-reviewed studies from any source casting doubt on the data presented by Dr. Zainer, they came up with nothing.\n\nThe artist speculated that other \"social medicine\" experts might have dissented from Dr. Zainer's data. That's certainly possible. Some essentially political bureaucracies with health-based missions are heavily invested in the pro-condom ideology and would be loathe to admit that their efforts had not only failed but made things worse. Such dissent, however, would not change the fact that Benedict's comments reflected amply supported scientific opinion, not the medieval obscurantism that \"Eggs Benedict\" caricatured.\n\nPope Emeritus Benedict doesn't have the right to be above criticism. Like all of us, however, he does have the right not to be ridiculed for a grotesque misrepresentation of his position.\n\nThe more important point, however, is not the work's insulting falsification of Benedict's position but its flippant disregard of the risk compensation effect and the danger of HIV/AIDS contagion it entails. By recklessly ridiculing information essential to saving African lives, the artist joined a long line of western elitists in viewing an African tragedy through the prism of affluent, First World privilege, without the real world perspective that the church's thousands of HIV/AIDS treatment centers in Africa give it. Like many past efforts, the result is a position that is subjectively sincere, earnest and well-meaning \u2014 and objectively racist. MAM was complicit with the artist in demonstrating, once again, that with the possible exception of handguns and tequila, the most dangerous combination on Earth is passion and ignorance.\n\nMichael Bowen is a resident of Fox Point.", "article_metadata": {"title": "The tragic error at the core of artist's 'Eggs Benedict'", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/the-tragic-error-at-the-core-of-artists-eggs-benedict-b99562865z1-323272101.html", "image": {"width": 1137, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99562865z.1_20150828171758_000_gdacamnc.1-1.jpg", "height": 711}, "type": "article", "description": "Pope Emeritus Benedict doesn\u2019t have the right to be above criticism.
