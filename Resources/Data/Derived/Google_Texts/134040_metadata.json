The low-dose test, offered by the hospital at no cost, took less than 10 minutes to complete and found no abnormalities in his lungs. It was a relief for Schroeder, who understood the health implications of his addiction to cigarettes.\n\n\u201cLung cancer was always on my mind. Any smoker is lying if they say they're not worried about it,\u201d said Schroeder, 59, a draftsman.\n\nCT scans of the lungs have emerged as a powerful, yet controversial, medical tool as doctors fight lung cancer, the nation's No. 1 cancer killer. The disease kills about 160,000 people every year in the United States.\n\nExperts say the scans, used within the right parameters and on the right people, can help find tumors in the earliest stages, when they are most treatable.\n\nCost: $9B over 5 years\n\nThis month, Medicare announced a proposal to pay for the screening for people at high risk, mainly heavy smokers who are at least 55. The move is expected to cost the government more than $9 billion over five years, according to a study published in May. That's about $3 per Medicare beneficiary.\n\n\u201cThis will cost the nation money \u2026 but when you look at how little progress there's been in the treatment of lung cancer, the opportunity to reduce lung cancer death is an investment that society is willing to make,\u201d said Dr. Richard Wender, chief cancer control officer with the American Cancer Society.\n\nHospitals have stepped up to pay for the tests, which cost between $200 and $300 each. Allegheny Health Network has provided more than 175 free CT scans since September, said Dr. Rodney Landreneau, director of thoracic oncology and co-director of its Esophageal and Lung Institute.\n\nAbout 20 percent of the tests found nodules in the lungs that required patients to undergo follow-ups. Four of those screened eventually were diagnosed with cancer, he said.\n\n\u201cIf you identify cancers at an early stage, you save money, as compared to treating cancers at a more advanced stage,\u201d Landreneau said.\n\nAllegheny Health's parent, health insurer Highmark Inc., supplied a $174,000 grant to pay for the tests. Highmark and other area health insurers will follow Medicare's lead in covering the screenings next year.\n\nSome insurers cover them as part of requirements of the Affordable Care Act. In some cases, it could affect what consumers pay for health care.\n\n\u201cBenefit changes like this do add to overall health care cost, and the cost of providing health care is the largest driver of premium increases,\u201d said Aaron Billger, spokesman for Highmark, the state's largest insurer.\n\nUPMC Health Plan spokeswoman Gina Pferdehirt said the coverage will not affect its members' premiums.\n\n\u201cIn the scheme of things, this is not a significant percentage of costs and is assumed in the normal trends we plan for in health care,\u201d she said.\n\nFalse positive results\n\nExperts caution the scans are not for everyone \u2014 and certainly not for every current and ex-smoker. The ideal candidate is between 55 and 74 years old and smoked at least a pack a day for 30 years. This includes people who quit as long as 15 years ago.\n\nDr. David Wilson, associate director of UPMC's Lung Cancer Center, warned the scans might find abnormalities that have no medical consequence but might scare or intimidate people.\n\nHe oversaw a study of nearly 4,000 CT lung screenings in Western Pennsylvania called the Pittsburgh Lung Cancer Screening Study. It found 40 percent of people had positive scans, yet fewer than 2 percent of those people had cancer.\n\nWilson said most abnormal scans are \u201cvery low risk for lung cancer and really don't require anything more than a repeat scan in a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision to get a CT scan, even if you're eligible, is not something anyone should rush into,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cPeople have to explain what to expect before you get the scan so we don't generate mass hysteria here.\u201d\n\nFollow-up biopsies\n\nSome studies have raised doubts about the test because too many people received false positive results. Doctors have worried about potentially harmful follow-up biopsies.\n\nFollow-up scans could expose patients to higher doses of radiation, said Dr. Kenneth Lin, an associate professor of family medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine.\n\nLin said he's not surprised some health care systems offer free scans because they can make up for the cost with additional tests.\n\n\u201cWhenever something is free, especially in health care, there's usually some catch,\u201d said Lin. \u201cIf they're just telling you about the benefits, or they're just telling you about the drawbacks, they're not giving you a balanced perspective.\u201d\n\nLung CT scans gained acceptance after the National Lung Screening Trial in 2010 showed the screenings reduced lung cancer deaths by 20 percent in older, longtime smokers. The test's impact solidified in December with a recommendation from the Preventive Services Task Force, which sets widely followed screening advice.\n\nPatient advocates said the screening is a promising tool, much in the same way mammograms help detect abnormalities in the breast.\n\n\u201cIt gives lung cancer another tool. Is it the final answer? No. Is it a start? Absolutely,\u201d said Andrea Ferris, president of the Chicago-based LUNGevity Foundation.\n\nLuis F\u00e1bregas is Trib Total Media's medical editor.
