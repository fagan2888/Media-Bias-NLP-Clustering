In Northern California, those counties include Sacramento, Placer, Yolo and Solano.\n\n\n\nDeloitte\u2019s subcontractor for the work was CGI, the company behind the troubled website where people have been unable to sign up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nAfter KCRA 3 exclusively reported that the contract was awarded four months ago, some Californians said they were worried that the computer work could fail, leaving people without benefits.\n\n\n\nA representative for WCDS did not give a reason for the agency\u2019s decision to set aside Deloitte\u2019s winning bid in the amount of $537 million. The agency\u2019s executive director did not return a call or email requesting more information and previously said that she has been advised by WCDS\u2019s attorney not to speak about the contract.\n\nHowever, legal documents filed with the agency last fall reveal disturbing claims about Deloitte made by a competing vendor, Hewlett Packard (HP). In those documents, obtained by KCRA 3 through a Public Records Act request, HP claimed Deloitte did not offer numerous taxpayer protections required of all companies bidding for the job.\n\n\n\nAmong the problems HP wrote was Deloitte\u2019s \u201crefusal\u201d to include a limit on the cost of the job, meaning taxpayers could have been on the hook for much more than $537 million.\n\n\n\nWCDS has not said why it originally awarded the work to Deloitte. It announced Wednesday that it will now begin negotiating with HP, whose initial bid had been slightly lower, at about $532 million.\n\nIn a written statement Wednesday, Deloitte defended its work.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn addition to significant taxpayer savings, we offered the consortium extensive taxpayer protections,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are committed to our clients, the community, and to continuing our long history of service to the people of California.\u201d\n\n\n\nState Sen. Jim Nielsen, R-Gerber, who has questioned Deloitte about late unemployment benefits following a software upgrade at EDD, said he believes WCDS did not welcome the scrutiny it was receiving for deciding last fall to work with Deloitte.\n\n\n\n\"I think they realized that a spotlight has been shined,\" said Nielsen. \"I think that they didn't like the spotlight.\"\n\n\n\nBut both Nielsen and Coupal said WCDS needs to make other changes.\n\n\n\nThe agency, virtually unknown by the public, is one of three county consortia in California that distribute billions in welfare benefits every year. The agency\u2019s work is overseen by several state agencies, but it doesn\u2019t hold public meetings and doesn\u2019t post meeting minutes or agendas, as required of public agencies by the Brown Act.\n\n\n\n\"Why are they closing the door to all kinds of scrutiny?\u201d Coupal said. \u201cI think this is one of the problems we have in California.\"\n\n\n\nHP, which currently runs the CalWin automation system, released a prepared statement Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\u201cHP welcomes the opportunity to continue its relationship with WCDS to serve the consortium\u2019s 18 counties,\u201d the company said in the statement.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Wed, 19 Mar 2014 19:46:21 PDT", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Sharokina Shams", "og": {"site_name": "KCRA", "description": "An agency responsible for choosing IT consultant Deloitte for a 10-year, half-billion dollar job said Wednesday that it has changed its mind.", "title": "KCRA 3 Investigation: Agency abandons talks with Deloitte for welfare contract", "url": "http://www.kcra.com/news/KCRA-3-Investigation-Agency-abandons-talks-with-Deloitte-for-welfare-contract/25063548", "image": "http://www.kcra.com/image/view/-/25062908/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/ylmyciz/-/img-Troubled-company-dropped-from-new-state-project.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.kcra.com/news/KCRA-3-Investigation-Agency-abandons-talks-with-Deloitte-for-welfare-contract/25063548", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "kcra://content/article/25063548", "iphone": "kcra://content/article/25063548", "googleplay": "kcra://content/article/25063548"}, "name": {"ipad": "kcra", "iphone": "kcra", "googleplay": "kcra"}, "id": {"ipad": 505581274, "iphone": 505581274, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}}, "site": "@kcranews", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "kcra://content/article/25063548", "app_name": "kcra", "package": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}, "ios": {"url": "kcra://content/article/25063548", "app_store_id": 505581274, "app_name": "kcra"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 102798321191}, "keywords": "deloitte, welfare client data systems, wcds, kcra investigates, sharokina shams, software problems, welfare contract, hewlett packard, howard jarvis taxpayers association, unemployment payments, kcra, kcra3, kcra 3, kcra news, kcra channel, kcra.com", "google-site-verification": "lseesGPufjGiNJ4blx9-qW5A0JKGfgPc9Mw6RTc9Ulo", "news_keywords": "deloitte, welfare client data systems, wcds, kcra investigates, sharokina shams, software problems, welfare contract, hewlett packard, howard jarvis taxpayers association, unemployment payments, kcra, kcra3, kcra 3, kcra news, kcra channel, kcra.com", "description": "An agency responsible for choosing IT consultant Deloitte for a 10-year, half-billion dollar job said Wednesday that it has changed its mind."}, "article_summary": "The agency, Welfare Client Data Systems (WCDS), told KCRA 3 that it could not come to an agreement on the terms of a contract and will no longer negotiate with the company.\nThe agency, virtually unknown by the public, is one of three county consortia in California that distribute billions in welfare benefits every year.\nAn agency responsible for choosing IT consultant Deloitte for a 10-year, half-billion dollar job said Wednesday that it has changed its mind.\nHowever, legal documents filed with the agency last fall reveal disturbing claims about Deloitte made by a competing vendor, Hewlett Packard (HP).\nWatch report: Deloitte dropped from new state projectThe decision represents what observers of the government said is a rare reversal in the middle of contract negotiations."}
