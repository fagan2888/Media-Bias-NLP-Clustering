Generalized Anxiety Disorder, officially. It was never really acknowledged or diagnosed until it swelled up into a wave of depression during my second year of college. Looking back now, I can trace the breadcrumbs marking its trail: the odium for sleepaway camp, the times spent fighting off nausea in the locker room before swim meets.\n\nAt most times, it flares up unannounced, unwelcomed. It doesn\u2019t always make sense. I\u2019m white, in my 20s, grew up in the same house my parents still live in and have graduated college debt-free. I\u2019ve got a good family with four living grandparents, a brother, cousins and good friends.\n\nTo the objective observer it would seem I\u2019ve got it all. And I kind of do. Maybe I have a genetic predisposition for anxiety and depression; but maybe it\u2019s environmental. But maybe there\u2019s something more going on. Maybe America has something to do with it.\n\nAnxious America\n\nFor me, anxiety is all about control. My anxiety spikes when outcomes are uncertain or I feel threatened or invalidated. I live in a country where control is systematically hard to come by. America is a nation without universal health care or affordable post-secondary education; a country in which the disparity of wealth between rich and poor has hit an all-time high; a nation run by corporations that ship our jobs overseas; a society filled with intolerance, violence and discrimination\u2014and that\u2019s just a glimpse of our problems.\n\nAmerica doesn\u2019t offer security\u2014emotional, physical or fiscal\u2014to its people. And it\u2019s making us anxious.\n\nA study conducted to look at Britain\u2019s \u201cme culture\u201d connected high levels of depression and anxiety to the country\u2019s individualistic, capitalistic culture. The lead author of the study, Joan Chiao, states: \u201cPeople from highly individualistic cultures like the United States and Western Europe are more likely to value uniqueness over harmony, expression over agreement, and to define themselves as unique or different from the group.\u201d\n\nIn individualistic societies like ours, the prioritization of individual success takes away time and value from community building. When success means being better than the other, the idea of a society with shared resources is hard to nurture. While a few among us might gain individually from a capitalistic, individualistic model, we lose collectively. The larger share of society\u2019s resources we claim for ourselves, the smaller share we deal to someone else.\n\nThis ever-present, ever-pressing need to secure enough resources to survive is what makes America a breeding ground for anxiety.\n\nWe like to believe we get to be ourselves in America. But what the American \u201cmelting pot\u201d really serves to do is to melt away our individual differences and serve us up, neatly poured into duplicate molds.\n\nTo be successful as an individual, we have to conform. Even from childhood, we need to check off all the right boxes to secure our future. The ideal set-up: fiscally secure; English-speaking home; pre-kindergarten education; good primary schooling; participation in a range of extracurricular activities; development of unique/marketable skills; good grades; AP classes, high SAT scores; no felony/misdemeanor violations; admittance to a well-regarded university; high GPA; summer internships at notable organizations; professional appearance; interpersonal skills\u2014you could get more specific and more extensive, but the point is clear. Success in America is formulaic and there is no level playing field. Socioeconomic factors like race, sex and income level play an influential role. Any difference, any deviation means an added challenge to overcome.\n\nWhite, Wealthy Men\n\nThe proof of endemic American inequality can be seen in the country\u2019s legislation. Since 1776, the law of the land has protected the interests of wealthy white men. Women and minorities are still fighting for legislation that reflects and serves their values and needs. The wealthy white men have been guarding their turf and fighting back. This is only to be expected. As Martin Luther King Jr. wrote in Letter From a Birmingham Jail: \u201cIt is a historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily.\u201d\n\nToday, the triumph of Ronald Reagan\u2019s get rich ideology has resulted in a Citizen\u2019s United court ruling unleashing unlimited money into election campaigns. Exemptions from federal environmental standards for drilling companies and the Trans-Pacific Partnership are only two of the too many decisions and deals that cater to corporate interests that monopolize wealth.\n\nThe American dream is still rigged in favor of the white, wealthy men who set it up.\n\nYes, our society has evolved culturally and legislatively since its inception, but we are still governed by a group who looks suspiciously demographically similar to the one that founded this country.\n\nOur current congressional body is 80% white, 80% male and 92% Christian. For a body of representatives, Congress isn\u2019t very representative at all. Whites make up only 63% of the total US population. That\u2019s nearly a 20% deviation from the racial representation in Congress. The number of women in congressional office doesn\u2019t come close to covering the 50.8% majority that actually exists in the US, nor does the number of Christian congressmen paint an accurate picture of the religious breakdown of Americans. Not only are there few non-Christian congressmen, but there is almost no representation of the 22.8% of Americans who consider themselves religiously unaffiliated.\n\nIf you\u2019re non-male, non-white or non-Christian, how can you expect to feel secure with a majority white, majority male and majority Christian representative body? If you\u2019re white, male and Christian, why share? Why risk giving up your security?\n\nBoth situations are anxiety-inducing, which suggests that perhaps I\u2019m not the only one in America affected. In fact, evidence is everywhere that our country is beset by anxiety and depression\u2014from an individual to a national level.\n\nClayton R. Cook broke down common characteristics of so-called emotional disorders like depression and anxiety into: all-or-none thinking; discounting the positive; Negative filter; overgeneralization; labeling; fortune telling; emotional reasoning; should and must statements; personalization; and unfair comparisons.\n\nEvidence of these symptoms runs rampant in our politicians. For example, Cook characterizes all-or-none thinking as one which views only extremes without accepting a middle ground. Remember the time Republicans shut down the government to shut out Obamacare?\n\nThat is textbook all-or-none thinking.\n\nWhat about discounting the positive? Barack Obama\u2019s use of the n-word in an interview with WTF with Marc Maron drew a variety of critical responses and disproportionate attention to the social acceptability of his word choice rather than the reason he dropped the slur.\n\nFortune-telling or fear-mongering is also big. What else explains the Republican hysteria that any sort of negotiation with Iran would lead directly to Iranian nuclear development? The Republicans have no evidence, and they\u2019ve been wrong (big time) before. Their open letter directed to Iranian leaders is a classic example.\n\nTo return to Cook\u2019s criteria, our representatives are using such partisan polemic that compromise is impossible. Tensions run high in Washington DC and throughout much of the United States. The fraught atmosphere of the Republican primary and the popularity of Donald Trump reveal how divided the country has become. With so many self-important, competing agendas, it\u2019s no wonder we don\u2019t have universal health care or affordable post-secondary education. On one side, we have people anxious about defending their resources, and on the other, we have people anxious about trying to gain them.\n\nSteps in the Right Direction\n\nWhen I first started to tell people about my experience with anxiety and depression, it was hard and weird. A lot of people didn\u2019t understand. They wanted to know what \u201chappened\u201d to me, and I was embarrassed not to have what they\u2019d recognize as a real reason. It was frustrating.\n\nBut then there were the people who did understand\u2014who\u2019d experienced the same thing or were at least sympathetic. They validated the way I was feeling, equipped me with tools to manage and made me feel secure no matter the circumstances.\n\nI think if America can take that that step, talk honestly about its weaknesses, insecurities and struggles, then perhaps we can start building communities that are attentive and responsive to the needs of the whole and not just one part.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer\u2019s editorial policy.\n\nPhoto Credit: KieferPix / Luciano Mortula / Orhan Cam / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe bring you perspectives from around the world.
