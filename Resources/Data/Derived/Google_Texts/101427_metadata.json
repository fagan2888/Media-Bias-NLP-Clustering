Our driveway was empty, and I smelled cigar smoke. \u201cThis is the day,\u201d I reconciled. This is the day when the pain is finally too much. After years of therapy, diagnoses and medications that mitigate \u2014 but can\u2019t eliminate \u2014 the memories in his head, today is the day my husband will smoke a cigar (one of his remaining vices), drive to a remote location and then walk alone into the Maine woods.\n\n\u201cThey made a movie?\u201d he asked when he learned about \u201cBoychoir.\u201d His voice got angrier. \u201cWhat\u2019s next? \u2018Penn State, the musical\u2019?\u201d\n\nI had no answer.\n\n\u201cBoychoir\u201d screenwriter Ben Ripley did not include a rape scene.\n\nSearch online for \u201cBoychoir\u201d and red carpet images pop right up. New Jersey\u2019s American Boychoir School, where Trav was a choirboy from ages 11 to 13, is the inspiration for the eponymous film. The American Boychoir School provided its students as actors, as well as musical direction and accompaniment for the movie.\n\nAs late as the 1990s, the school also provided a well-documented spot where little boys were regularly and repeatedly sexually violated by teachers, administrators and other students. I\u2019d wager the school is still addressing these allegations.\n\nNow, it is a movie.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a movie about overcoming a culture of institutionalized sex abuse. In fact, sex abuse has no part in the story line. Variety film critic Peter Debruge writes, \u201cIn a country where musical talent is so often confused with sex appeal, \u2018Boychoir\u2019 offers a welcome alternative, celebrating discipline, talent and the sound of untainted innocence.\u201d\n\nUntainted innocence? I\u2019ll write it again for emphasis. Little boys, according to many sources, were systemically raped at the American Boychoir School.\n\n\u201cThat\u201d is all in the past \u2014 ancient history, the current American Boychoir School officials say, never using the word \u201crape.\u201d\n\nHowever, for Trav (and for so many sex abuse survivors), the American Boychoir School\u2019s history dictates his present-tense reality.\n\nThere are safety measures now, the school\u2019s website assures.\n\nTrav\u2019s parents were given safety assurances, too, and their son still spent 30 months as a choirboy from 1988 to \u201990 unable to sleep because of the sex abuse he saw, heard, feared and experienced.\n\nMore than 25 years later, he deals with the long-term effects of this experience. A few of the clinical diagnoses: post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder (1, not 2), and alcoholism.\n\nWant to know how many prescription medications he takes? Six. Two of those are anti-psychotics. For my husband, getting through the day is a win. Sleep is a gold medal.\n\nOn one especially brutal night, Trav said, \u201cI cannot get away from this. I keep trying to put it behind me, and it keeps presenting itself. Every time I try to get past this, it jumps in front of me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A movie about the American Boychoir School leaves out its legacy of sex abuse, which is still haunting my marriage", "author": "Shonna Milliken Humphrey", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A movie about the American Boychoir School leaves out its legacy of sex abuse, which is still haunting my marriage", "title": "My husband was abused as a choir boy: Why doesn\u2019t \u201cBoychoir\u201d tell his story?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/02/my_husband_was_abused_as_a_choir_boy_why_doesnt_boychoir_tell_his_story/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/boychoir.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A movie about the American Boychoir School leaves out its legacy of sex abuse, which is still haunting my marriage", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/boychoir.jpg", "title": "My husband was abused as a choir boy: Why doesn\u2019t \u201cBoychoir\u201d tell his story?", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "My husband was abused as a choir boy: Why doesn\u2019t \u201cBoychoir\u201d tell his story?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, american boychoir school, boychoir, Editor's Picks, Movies, Sex abuse", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1942\"", "article_summary": "Topics: american boychoir school, boychoir, Editor's Picks, Movies, Sex abuse, Media NewsSoon, \u201cBoychoir\u201d will light up movie theater marquees worldwide.\nLittle boys, according to many sources, were systemically raped at the American Boychoir School.\nNew Jersey\u2019s American Boychoir School, where Trav was a choirboy from ages 11 to 13, is the inspiration for the eponymous film.\nThe American Boychoir School provided its students as actors, as well as musical direction and accompaniment for the movie.\nIn fact, sex abuse has no part in the story line."}
