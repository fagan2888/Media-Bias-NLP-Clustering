Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) proposed the legislation, which would explicitly ban the FCC from reclassifying Internet serve as a telecommunications service that can be regulated, and also block the FCC from imposing rules on Internet service providers.\n\nBlackburn was among the many GOP members who opposed the FCC\u2019s \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rule, which supporters say will prevent providers from prioritizing some Internet pages over others. Most Republicans say the rule would only add government shackles to an Internet that has clearly flourished without any significant government regulation, and could lead to political decisions about content.\n\nMany Republicans also complained that the rule had not been seen by the public before the FCC vote, which led many to say Democrats were selling the huge, unseen rule the way they sold Obamacare.\n\n\u201cOnce the federal government establishes a foothold into managing how Internet service providers run their networks they will essentially be deciding which content goes first, second, third, or not at all,\u201d she said Wednesday. \u201cMy legislation will put the brakes on this FCC overreach and protect our innovators from these job-killing regulations.\u201d\n\nBlackburn\u2019s bill has a good chance of being considered, as key House and Senate leaders vowed last week that Congress would have a say over the FCC\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201c[L]ike Obamacare, the Obama administration\u2019s plan for the Internet may not work, but it will create years of uncertainty and lead to expensive legal fights,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said last week. More mandates and regulations on American innovation and entrepreneurship are not the answer, and that\u2019s why Republicans will continue our efforts to stop this misguided scheme.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Less than a week after the Federal Communications Commission voted to regulate the Internet, 20 House Republicans have proposed a bill to block the FCC rule.
