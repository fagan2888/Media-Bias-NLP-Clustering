She won\u2019t use pills as she has several times before. Her final attempt, she said, will be with a rope, and alcohol will buy her the courage.\n\n\u201cMy last way, my final out, will be a hanging,\u201d said Cepeda, who suffers from severe depression, bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress. \u201cAnd like I told my brother, there will be no more suicide attempts. There will be one more and I will succeed.\u201d\n\nFor now, the 42-year-old Sebastopol resident, who lost both her best friend and her mother this year, said she\u2019s holding on, keeping her \u201cmental demons\u201d at bay. When her world starts to go \u201cblack,\u201d Cepeda said she still has the rationale to check herself into a local emergency room, with the hope of being admitted into an inpatient psychiatric facility.\n\nFor Cepeda and hundreds of other Sonoma County residents, that usually means waiting hours while hospital staff searches for a bed in a facility outside the county.\n\nBecause Cepeda\u2019s health care is covered by Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s Medicaid program for low-income residents, she essentially is ineligible to stay at Aurora Santa Rosa Hospital, the new for-profit private inpatient psychiatric hospital in west Santa Rosa. The Fulton Road facility, which opened last year, is located at the site of the psychiatric unit previously operated by Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital before being shut down in 2008.\n\nA little-known federal rule that goes back to the creation of the Medicaid program in the mid-1960s tightly restricts the use of federal Medicaid matching funds to pay for care at \u201cinstitutes of mental disease,\u201d or IMDs, residential treatment facilities with more than 16 beds whose primary purpose is to serve those with mental illness.\n\nKnown as the IMD exclusion, the rule was established at a time when state-run mental institutions were receiving serious scrutiny and criticism for \u201cwarehousing\u201d mental health patients. The rule reflected the federal government\u2019s wish to stop funding such institutions.\n\nSince then, the number of state-run mental health facilities has declined dramatically.\n\nThe IMD exclusion does not apply to inpatient psychiatric facilities that are tied to general acute care hospitals, such as the one operated by Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae. And it does not apply to people younger than 22 or older than 64.\n\nHowever, the number of these hospital-affiliated units also has declined as hospitals close inpatient psychiatric facilities to reduce costs. Memorial Hospital shuttered its psychiatric unit \u2014 the county\u2019s only remaining inpatient psychiatric hospital \u2014 in 2008 as part of a large cost-cutting plan.\n\nWide age range ineligible\n\nAt hospital-affiliated psychiatric units, Medi-Cal pays for about half the cost of a patient\u2019s stay, and counties pay the other half.\n\nBut under the IMD rule, Medi-Cal will not pay for any care provided to patients ages 22 to 64 at freestanding psychiatric hospitals, like Aurora Santa Rosa Hospital, that are not tied to a general acute care hospital. As a result, these patients usually are sent out of Sonoma County to other facilities.\n\nSeventy percent of the Sonoma County residents who were hospitalized last year for mental health treatment fall within this age group, said Michael Kennedy, the county\u2019s mental health director.\n\n\u201cTo not provide a psychiatric hospital benefit for this age group is discrimination,\u201d Kennedy said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maria Cepeda said she knows exactly how she will end her life.", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "A little-known federal rule has forced hundreds of Sonoma County residents to be sent out of county for inpatient psychiatric care.", "title": "Mental health patients forced to seek treatment outside Sonoma County", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/2853924-181/mental-health-patients-forced-to", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=dfhwv7AeGdZRjYRleJygZs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtdptLLPWH$GX4SqNqo8XSLWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2014-09-23T08:55:00-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6af\"", "article_summary": "Seventy percent of the Sonoma County residents who were hospitalized last year for mental health treatment fall within this age group, said Michael Kennedy, the county\u2019s mental health director.\nMemorial Hospital shuttered its psychiatric unit \u2014 the county\u2019s only remaining inpatient psychiatric hospital \u2014 in 2008 as part of a large cost-cutting plan.\nKnown as the IMD exclusion, the rule was established at a time when state-run mental institutions were receiving serious scrutiny and criticism for \u201cwarehousing\u201d mental health patients.\nSince then, the number of state-run mental health facilities has declined dramatically.\nHowever, the number of these hospital-affiliated units also has declined as hospitals close inpatient psychiatric facilities to reduce costs."}
