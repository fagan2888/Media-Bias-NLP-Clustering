Children and adolescents under 25 years old make up about one-third of all sports recreational and exercise-related injuries (SRE). Louisville guard Kevin Ware\u2019s horrific injury was watched worldwide. Jaws dropped, people cried, others fell out of their seat when he broke his leg while playing against Duke. Ware\u2019s bone stuck outside of his leg, a traumatic moment in sports history. Ware\u2019s injury definitely topped the sports' worst injury list, but what about the weirdest?\n\nAkilah Hughes, of the YouTube channel smoothiefreak, fills you in on some of the weirdest sports injuries. Some of them are just embarrassing. Others will make you raise your eyebrows. You can\u2019t help but laugh at baseball player Jose Cardanel\u2019s reason for not playing at a game.\n\nHe said the crickets kept him up at night. Red Sox pitcher Clarence Blethen\u2019s injury was probably the strangest. Blethen\u2019s strategy to intimidate his opponents was very odd. Instead of wearing his false teeth, he would keep them in his back pocket. In 1923, he forgot to put them back in his mouth. When he batted and slid into second base, his teeth bit him right through his pocket. Ouch! Can you imagine running and bumping into a sleeping moose? That\u2019s what happened to football player Svein Grondalen. The moose was scared and charged at him. To save his own life, he jumped down a hill and injured his leg.
