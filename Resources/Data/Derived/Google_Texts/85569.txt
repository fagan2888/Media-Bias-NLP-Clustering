The Community Cooperative's "Empty Bowls" event was held Sunday in Fort Myers at the Alliance for the Arts.

The event raises money and promote awareness for students in Lee County who are food-insecure.

Twenty different public and private Lee County schools handcrafted ceramic bowls to represent the amount of people in the community who are in need of food. Attendees purchase the bowls and then fill them with soup from area restaurants that are at the event.

Money raised will benefit Community Cooperative's Healthy School Pantry and FLIP (Food Literacy in Preschool programs). The two organizations will then use the money to pay for one to two Lee County school pantries to feed students outside of their classrooms.
