As you'd expect, Putin's team won. And the man himself scored seven goals. The President's teammates included former Vancouver Canucks player Pavel Bure, as well as Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who earlier in the day had been briefing Putin on Russia's latest round of military strikes in Syria. Despite his impressive scoring feats on the rink in the southern city of Sochi, Putin only \"mastered\" ice hockey in recent years, according to the Russian news agency Tass.\n\nPutin scored seven goals in his team's 15-10 victory and was presented with a trophy afterwards, because, well, of course he was.\n\nPutin is an extreme latecomer to hockey, as he began skating in 2010 in an effort to, in part, revive Russia's struggling hockey programs. (Russian lawmakers have also considered banning young stars from playing in the United States in an effort to prop up its domestic professional leagues.) Putin has proven to be a master of propaganda, and his latest foray into sport is no different.\n\nPutin's athletic \"accomplishments\" are approaching a Kim Jong-il-level of absurd. While the man's dedication to patriotic photo ops is impressive, it's still somewhat head-scratching. Russia has a whole host of societal issues that need to be addressed before the leader of the country takes the ice with Pavel Bure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "King of the photo op. .05/26/2016 20:35:23PM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "King of the photo op.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Vladimir Putin Scores Seven Goals in Birthday Hockey Game", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/10/11/vladimir-putin-scores-seven-goals-in-birthday-hockey-game-n2062954", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/280/6edc83e5-ee4e-40ef-ba85-ce48338baf33.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "King of the photo op.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Vladimir Putin Scores Seven Goals in Birthday Hockey Game", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/10/11/vladimir-putin-scores-seven-goals-in-birthday-hockey-game-n2062954", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/280/6edc83e5-ee4e-40ef-ba85-ce48338baf33.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Vladimir Putin Scores Seven Goals in Birthday Hockey Game, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Putin scored seven goals in his team's 15-10 victory and was presented with a trophy afterwards, because, well, of course he was.\nVladimir Putin turned 63 on Wednesday, and he celebrated in a rather unorthodox manner: by partaking in an all-star hockey game with former NHL stars and Russian cabinet members.\nAnd the man himself scored seven goals.\nThe leader, famous for posing shirtless on horseback and in other unashamedly macho situations, played in a hockey game Wednesday night alongside former NHL stars.\nPutin is an extreme latecomer to hockey, as he began skating in 2010 in an effort to, in part, revive Russia's struggling hockey programs."}
