Its ignorance of the province\u2019s language, culture and history stymied the mission and led to tribal leaders \u2014 \u201cthe greatest natural politicians I\u2019ve ever come across,\u201d Martin said \u2014 manipulating coalition forces to settle their own scores.\n\n\u201cOur biggest failure was a failure to understand,\u201d he said at a promotional event for the book Wednesday at London\u2019s Royal United Services Institute.\n\nWestern forces tend to view Afghanistan\u2019s recent history as a series of distinct conflicts \u2014 the Soviet war, civil war, Taliban rule \u2014 whereas locals in Helmand see those decades as a single ongoing battle over land, water and other resources.\n\nCoalition forces paid dearly for failing to appreciate that history. More than 400 of Britain\u2019s 448 casualties in Afghanistan died in Helmand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Defense Ministry's own report describes flaws in its Afghanistan operation.
