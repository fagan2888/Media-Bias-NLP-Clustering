It has its own shop that makes custom artificial limbs and body casts that help treat certain conditions.\n\nHospital researchers have also discovered genes related to idiopathic scoliosis, the most common type of scoliosis, which causes the spine to curve or twist.\n\nIn its fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2013, Scottish Rite reported $297 million in revenue, compared with about $115 million just three years earlier.\n\nAbout $120 million of the 2013 revenue came from royalties and another $107 million from investments. Expenses were about $133 million and long-term debt totaled only about $20 million.\n\nThe hospital has not released its financial report for the year ending Sept. 30, 2014. But in response to questions from The Dallas Morning News, officials said the hospital will report nearly $150 million in royalty income for that period.\n\nInvestments in publicly traded securities \u2014 the hospital\u2019s endowment \u2014 totaled $1.997 billion at the end of the period, the hospital said.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot. Dallas-based Children\u2019s Health, for example, reported $1.1 billion in revenue for calendar 2013 and $579 million in investments in publicly traded securities.\n\nBecause of the drop in oil prices over the past year, royalties for Scottish Rite will decline this fiscal year, hospital officials said.\n\nThe recent oil windfall coincided with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, a period of radical change in the health care industry, including more people having insurance.\n\nUntil recently, Scottish Rite never billed patients for services. But after two years of board debate, Walker said, the hospital did start billing in 2012.\n\nHe said that third-party payers, such as insurance companies and government programs, accounted for about $40 million of the hospital\u2019s revenue last fiscal year.\n\n\u201cI think this could grow over time,\u201d Walker said.\n\nAmid the changes, Walker and Olson said, a major concern is to preserve the culture of the institution, which depends on many generous donors and hundreds of volunteers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about helping kids,\u201d said Walker, who has worked at the hospital for 36 years.\n\nScottish Rite has about 15,000 current patients and has treated more than 230,000 in its 94-year history. Patients are children, up to 18 years old.\n\nThe royalties, mainly oil, largely come from the 173,000-acre Rocker b Ranch west of San Angelo. It was given to Scottish Rite by the Blakley-Braniff Foundation in 1964. Another large ranch in New Mexico was donated at the same time, but the hospital sold it soon afterward.\n\nFormer U.S. Sen. William Blakley, who owned the ranches, was the personal attorney for Thomas Braniff, the founder of Braniff Airways. Blakley, often referred to in news stories at the time as \u201cDallas\u2019 Cowboy Capitalist,\u201d was also a large shareholder in the airline.\n\nIn 1974, Blakley had second thoughts about his donation of the Rocker b.\n\nHe told The Associated Press then that he \u201cmade a great mistake by giving a piece of operating property to a charitable institution.\u201d He told The Dallas Morning News that the ranch should be sold, generating more money for children immediately.\n\n\u201cI think you ought to take care of crippled children now, in this generation,\u201d said Blakley.\n\nAt the time, the Rocker b was appraised at $60 million, according to the AP. And its 570 wells earned about $4 million a year in royalties.\n\nBlakley died in 1976. He had no business partners, according to news reports, and he and his wife had no children.\n\nWhatever Blakley\u2019s concerns then, there is no doubt his gift is helping ensure Scottish Rite\u2019s future now.\n\nDrilling and production have increased dramatically in recent years with new techniques, such as fracking and horizontal drilling.\n\nFor the year ending Sept. 30, 2010, oil royalties for the hospital totaled $52 million, the vast majority from the Rocker b. For the year ending Sept. 30, 2014, royalties totaled $148.5 million. There were 1,460 producing wells on the Rocker b, hospital officials said, an increase of about 50 percent from 2010.\n\n\u201cAt the time nobody really understood the significance of that gift,\u201d Walker said of the Rocker b.\n\nOlson, a Waco native, is a longtime financial services industry executive. He is a member of the Baylor Scott & White Health board and has been on the Scottish Rite board for two decades.\n\nBorn with club feet, he underwent several surgeries as a child. Blood circulation problems, however, led to gangrene and both of his legs were amputated at Scottish Rite. He was fitted with artificial legs and taught to walk.\n\nNow, next to his portrait on a wall in the hospital\u2019s executive offices, is a small photo of him in his Little League baseball uniform. With his new legs, he was able to play.\n\nDespite the \u201cliteral sea change\u201d in the industry today, Olson said, Scottish Rite will never change its approach to patients.\n\n\u201cWe treat the poorest of the poor and the wealthiest of the wealthy,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd the patients will get whatever they need, no matter how much or how little insurance may pay.\n\n\u201cWe are here for the children,\u201d Olson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the past four years, the children\u2019s hospital has received about $500 million from oil and gas royalties.", "og": {"description": "In the past four years, the children\u2019s hospital has received about $500 million from oil and gas royalties.", "title": "Oil boom royalties extend Texas Scottish Rite Hospital\u2019s mission", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20150706-oil-boom-royalties-extend-texas-scottish-rite-hospitals-mission.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20150706-lede.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/LEDE.jpg", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-07-07T15:47:44Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-07-07T02:13:41Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Oil boom royalties extend Texas Scottish Rite Hospital\\u2019s mission\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20150706-oil-boom-royalties-extend-texas-scottish-rite-hospitals-mission.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20150706-lede.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/LEDE.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2355884\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-07-07T02:13:41Z\", \"section\": \"Health Care\", \"author\": \"GARY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20150706-lede.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/LEDE.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-07-07T02:13:41Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad90\"", "article_summary": "A gift from the past is giving Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children a boost for the future.\nFounded by a group of Texas Masons in 1921, Scottish Rite specializes in pediatric orthopedics.\nDespite the \u201cliteral sea change\u201d in the industry today, Olson said, Scottish Rite will never change its approach to patients.\nLast year, Scottish Rite revealed plans for a multimillion-dollar outpatient care center in Frisco, the organization\u2019s first satellite expansion from its central Dallas location.\nHe is a member of the Baylor Scott & White Health board and has been on the Scottish Rite board for two decades."}
