Today, none of them make the top 10, and only cardiologists finish in the top 20, according to the article. Hospitals are far more interested in recruiting primary care providers, along with nurse practitioners and physician assistants.\n\nHealthcare reform is driving the shift. For example, its emphasis on prevention, value-based care and moving away from the traditional fee-for-service model creates demand for primary care providers, emergency physicians, clinical pharmacists and health IT and data experts, the article noted.\n\nScripps Health, a 517-bed system in San Diego, operates primarily under fee-for-service, but recognized the changing nature of the industry and planned accordingly. Since 2010 Scripps has restructured to strengthen outpatient processes in anticipation of smaller-scale inpatient offerings. It also saved approximately $200 million during the past three years through consolidation and retraining rather than layoffs, according to U.S. News. Today, two-thirds of Scripps hires are internal transfers, compared to 75 percent external hires 10 years ago.\n\nThe shift in healthcare reimbursement and delivery is affecting hospital leadership as well. UnityPoint, a Des Moines, Iowa-based health system with 30 hospitals and 280 clinics and home care operations, has introduced physicians to its leadership team to make its operation more patient-centered and doctor-driven, according to the article.\n\nIn recent years, hospitals have put more doctors and nurses in executive positions. In addition, more physicians are heading back to school for their MBAs, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the U.S. News & World Report article\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHospitals put more doctors, nurses in charge\n\nLeadership changes afoot: Hospitals consider putting doctors in charge\n\nMore docs head back to school for their MBAs\n\nPrimary care physicians in highest demand 7 years running\n\nStudy: Team-based care benefits elderly", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare reform, the continuing physician shortage and an aging population are changing the face of hospital staffing, according to U.S. News & World Report.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Healthcare reform, the continuing physician shortage and an aging population are changing the face of hospital staffing, according to U.S. News & World Report.", "title": "The future of hospital staffing", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/future-hospital-staffing/2013-10-17", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Hospital Staffing,HR & Workforce Management,primary care doctors,Scripps Health", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde694\"", "article_summary": "Healthcare reform, the continuing physician shortage and an aging population are changing the face of hospital staffing, according to U.S. News & World Report.\nToday, none of them make the top 10, and only cardiologists finish in the top 20, according to the article.\nThe shift in healthcare reimbursement and delivery is affecting hospital leadership as well.\nIn 2004, cardiologists, anesthesiologists and radiologists attracted the biggest demand among specialty physicians.\nHospitals are far more interested in recruiting primary care providers, along with nurse practitioners and physician assistants."}
