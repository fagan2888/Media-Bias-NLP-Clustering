Even Chris Wallace is all: I can't even with you, Ben Carson.

The "Fox News Sunday" host challenged the 2016 presidential candidate on some of his most inflammatory remarks, including Carson's comparing the Obama administration to Hitler's Germany.

"I want to ask you about some remarks you've made that you say that you stand by," Wallace said. "You have compared our government today to Nazi Germany. Do you really believe that?"

"Well, a lot of people like to say that," Carson responded. "But what I said is that in Nazi Germany, most of those people didn't believe in what Hitler was doing, but did they say anything? They did not. That's what allowed people to progress to that point. We need to be willing to stand up and speak up for what we believe."

Wallace jumped in: "But people oppose Barack Obama all the time!"

The Fox News host also brought up Carson's claim that Obamacare is the worst thing to happen to the country since slavery.

"Well, you have to understand what I'm talking about," Carson explained. "You know, Obamacare fundamentally changes the relationship between the people and the government. The government is supposed to respond to the will of the people. Not dictate to the people what they are doing. And with this program, we're allowing that whole paradigm to be switched around."

You do you, Ben Carson. You do you.
