Our much more refined brothers across the pond are apparently worried that the American press corps, with our pride of the haggard and ill-dressed journalists, won\u2019t be appropriately attired when interacting with the royals. Buckingham Palace advises reporters covering the royals to adhere to a certain dress code, according to guidance posted on the palace website.\n\n\u201cJournalists wishing to cover Royal engagements, whether in the United Kingdom or abroad, should comply with the dress code on formal occasions out of respect for the guests of The Queen, or any other member of the Royal Family,\u201d the palace press office requests. \u201cSmart attire for men includes the wearing of a jacket and tie, and for women a trouser or skirt suit. Those wearing jeans or trainers will not be admitted and casually dressed members of the media will be turned away.
