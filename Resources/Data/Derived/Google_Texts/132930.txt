If you’re getting skittish about the tear that biotechnology stocks have been on lately, at least one brokerage says it may not be at the bubble stage just yet.

Bespoke Investment Group put out a note Thursday, which shows that the 361% gain in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index /quotes/zigman/12633939/realtime NBI since hitting a trough — along with the rest of the market — in March 2009, pales in comparison with some other recent bubbles.

For one, the Nasdaq 100 made a leap of 1,118% during the period from December 1994 to March 2000 that included the dot-com bubble. That’s over a period of 1,935 days, only slightly longer than the current 1,822-day biotech rally.

There’s at least one more bubble to examine, the note says. The housing runup of the early 2000s brought with it an 835% gain for homebuilders in the S&P 1,500, Bespoke points out. That rally was similar in length to the dot-com bubble, lasting 1,954 days.

That brings with it one disconcerting fact, the note says.

“Bubbles certainly come in all shapes and sizes, and while the biotech group’s rally since March 2009 has been much less than the rally we saw during the dot-com and housing bubbles, the length of time the current rally has lasted for biotech is getting close to the time the prior two bubbles lasted,” the note says. “If biotech’s rally lasted as long as the dot-com bubble lasted, it would come to an end in late June. If it lasted as long as the housing bubble, it would come to an end in late July.”

Yet if a hard rain is about to fall for biotech, the same could be said for internet stocks, as the Nasdaq Internet group is up 493% since March 2009, the paper says.
