The specter of a less-than-honest sales job to promote the Obama agenda raises its head again as the President touts a nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAlready touted as another \u201csuccess,\u201d Obama\u2019s announcement of a framework nuclear agreement with Iran is, at best, questionable, as Washington and Tehran are now disagreeing on what was agreed (e.g., Obama says we will inspect military sites but Iran says no) and, at worst, disastrous as Iran is granted nuclear club membership.\n\nIf one revisits Obama\u2019s public pronouncements, made since 2008, about a nuclear-armed Iran, the picture emerges\u2014just as with Obamacare\u2014of a President again relying upon American voters\u2019 stupidity to promote his own agenda.\n\nIn 2008, when Senator Barack Obama announced his presidential candidacy, his message about a nuclear-armed Iran was made infinitely clear. We read his lips and got the message over and over again: there would no nukes for Tehran.\n\nWe first heard Obama make his prevention \u201cPromise\u201d as a presidential candidate in June 2008, claiming: \u201cI will continue to be clear on the fact that an Iranian nuclear weapon would be profoundly destabilizing for the entire region. It is strongly in America\u2019s interest to prevent such a scenario.\u201d\n\nThis theme was underscored again in October during a presidential debate, \u201cWe cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. It would be a game-changer in the region.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Goldberg at The Atlantic lists numerous instances in which President Obama repeated the same claims. We heard it many times during his first term in office. In May 2011, he assured, \u201cYou also see our commitment to our shared security in our determination to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons\u2026So let me be absolutely clear \u2014 we remain committed to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\u201d In March 2012, Obama proclaimed, \u201c\u2026when the United States says it is unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear weapon, we mean what we say.\u201d As Obama\u2019s re-election loomed large in 2012, we heard it again in a September speech at the U.N., \u201cMake no mistake: A nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained\u2026the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nObama gave us every confidence the Promise would be honored, deeming a nuclear-armed Iran unacceptable as posing a regional security threat and triggering an arms race. To this Promise, we received his \u201cabsolute commitment.\u201d\n\nIn March 2013, we were given reassurances by Vice President Biden the President was \u201cnot bluffing\u201d about the Promise. But some point, this message changed. Following Obama\u2019s re-election in November 2012, the Promise was no longer heard\u2014at least from him. It transitioned from one of prevention to one of containment of an Iran armed with nukes.\n\nAs much as the public might want to attribute it to Obama experiencing a \u201ceureka\u201d moment during negotiations, such was not the case. Obama has always sought his own agenda on Iran. American voter stupidity enabled him to implement his deception plan, creating a Middle East world according to Obama.\n\nThe Center for New American Security (CNAS) is a think tank whose principals share similar views with Obama on the Middle East. One of those principals, Dr. Colin Kahl, was the Director of the Middle East Security Program there. Kahl, like Obama, favored the U.S. distancing itself from Israel and focusing on an alliance with Iran.\n\nCNAS and Team Obama played well together. It was Kahl\u2019s influence that successfully got the issue of the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital dropped from the 2013 Democratic Party platform.\n\nIn May 2013, whether with Team Obama\u2019s input or independent of it, CNAS issued the report, \u201cIf All Else Fails: The Challenges of Containing a Nuclear-Armed Iran.\u201d The report became a vehicle by which Team Obama reneged on the Promise.\n\nUnsurprisingly, in 2014, Kahl became the Vice President\u2019s National Security Advisor. Biden recognized Kahl\u2019s \u201cunique perspective on a number of national security issues our country faces today in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe transition from prevention to containment was now in the open. While adopting it may have appeared as a major foreign policy shift by Obama, there is evidence that he had set this course direction even before being elected President. In 2008, presidential candidate Obama secretly dispatched Ambassador William G. Miller to Tehran to deliver a message to the mullahs. The message was that Obama would be elected President and as such would engage in friendlier negotiations concerning Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nThis mission to Tehran by Ambassador Miller as Obama\u2019s emissary was confirmed by historian and foreign policy analyst Michael Ledeen last year. He reported that Obama, as President, launched a quest for an Iranian alliance \u201cthrough at least four channels: Iraq, Switzerland (the official U.S. representative to Tehran), Oman and a variety of American intermediaries, the most notable of whom is probably Valerie Jarrett, his closest adviser.\u201d\n\nWhat is disturbing is this foolish effort involved negotiating a nuclear deal on unfavorable terms to the U.S., undeterred by the declared intentions of Iran\u2019s own leaders.\n\nIn January 2014, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested Iranian negotiations were simply a stalling tactic to gain time. Unabashedly, he proclaimed, \u201cWe had announced previously that on certain issues, if we feel it is expedient, we would negotiate with the Satan (the U.S.) to deter its evil.\u201d\n\nThat same month, Iranian lawmaker Mohammed Nabavian stated \u201ca nuclear bomb is necessary to put down Israel.\u201d He also bragged Iran could obtain breakout to build such a weapon within two weeks time if it had the right materials. He added, concerning Obama\u2019s incessant overtures to make nice towards Iran, it was because \u201cthe United States (i.e., Obama) needs Iran.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s beseechment of Tehran as an alliance partner should leave little doubt why the Iranians demanded, and received, almost everything they wanted in the negotiations.\n\nWith Obama so needy for an agreement, he has imbued Iranian negotiators with tremendous confidence their demands will be met. This, undoubtedly, motivated President Rouhani to now throw in yet another demand: \u201cWe will not sign any agreement, unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal.\u201d\n\nFor Rouhani to demand this after a framework deal was supposedly hammered out demonstrates he fully recognizes just how desperate Obama is for a final agreement. (So desperate, in fact, Obama is unwilling to consider Tennessee Senator Bob Corker\u2019s demand as a condition of the deal Iran renounce terrorism.)\n\nPresident Obama relied upon the American public\u2019s stupidity to play a bait-and-switch\u2014replacing a prevention policy towards Iran with a containment policy.\n\nAs the mullahs now make further demands of Obama after he prematurely went public with his framework deal, they rely upon his own stupidity to extract yet another pound of flesh from us.\n\nAs Forrest Gump so aptly, and accurately, put it, \u201cStupid is as stupid does.\u201d\n\nLt.
