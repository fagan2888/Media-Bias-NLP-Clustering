Fear of U.S. airstrikes have reportedly increased the surge of new refugees, with 5,000 to 6,000 people now streaming across the border daily.\n\nThe official refugee figures, bad as they are, don\u2019t include an estimated 4 to 6 million people \u2014 nobody can say for sure \u2014 who are now displaced within Syria itself, many of them without access to adequate food and clean water. International aid agencies are scrambling to figure out how to help feed the nation whose agricultural system is currently in tatters.\n\nWheat production, for example, is believed to be 40 percent lower in Syria this year than it was before the war began. And food distribution in some areas is grinding to a halt. \u201cRising violence in many parts of Damascus and Homs, and a proliferation of checkpoints around the main cities have hit the flow of food,\u201d warned Elisabeth Byrs, a spokeswoman for the United Nation\u2019s World Food Program.\n\nInternational agencies are sending food aid. But it is funneled through the Syrian government, which has blocked it from flowing to areas that it does not control. In a bold exception to this rule, the USAID, is currently running a covert, cross-border aid operation on the Turkish border, and a smaller one on the Jordanian border, according to NPR\u2019s Deborah Amos.\n\nSyria\u2019s food woes began long before the current civil war. The worst drought in the nation\u2019s history \u2014 from 2006 onward \u2014 has withered crops, forcing hundreds of thousands of farmers and herders off their land. Making matters worse, the Assad government\u2019s wasteful water-intensive agricultural schemes have caused water tables to plunge in some areas, with many wells going dry or becoming brackish.\n\nDesertification has combined with the current fighting to create a perfect storm of food insecurity in a region that was once, ironically, called the breadbasket of the Middle East. Inflation in the prices of staple commodities, such as wheat flour, bread and sugar, have risen by over 100 percent over pre-war levels in Syria\u2019s urban areas. With unemployment in the country running at an astonishing 60 percent, according to Oxfam\u2019s senior policy adviser Noah Gottschalk, more are going hungry every day.\n\nGottschalk told me that the British-founded confederation Oxfam hopes to radically scale up its assistance in the coming months. But it\u2019s been rough going in a country where travel is perilous, food aid is frequently stolen, and aid workers are targeted; 95 have already died in the conflict.\n\nThe work of these organizations is made even more difficult by public apathy. Gottschalk says that Oxfam\u2019s long-standing appeal for Syria is only 40 percent met, which pales in comparison with the success of their earlier relief effort in Haiti, after the 2010 earthquake. This disappointing response may be because the media has focused attention on the military situation rather than the humanitarian disaster, and also because people feel hopeless about a situation that looks increasingly intractable with no end in sight.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Countless Syrians are without adequate food -- but an old U.S. law ties the hands of those who would deliver it", "title": "Controversial, old law could make people starve", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Countless Syrians are without adequate food -- but an old U.S. law ties the hands of those who would deliver it", "title": "Controversial, old law could make people starve", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/12/controversial_old_law_could_make_people_starve/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/food_aid.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Countless Syrians are without adequate food -- but an old U.S. law ties the hands of those who would deliver it", "title": "Controversial, old law could make people starve", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/food_aid.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Richard Schiffman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, big agriculture, Food, hunger, Lobbyists, Middle East, Syria, USAID", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae6e\"", "article_summary": "International agencies are sending food aid.\n\u201cRising violence in many parts of Damascus and Homs, and a proliferation of checkpoints around the main cities have hit the flow of food,\u201d warned Elisabeth Byrs, a spokeswoman for the United Nation\u2019s World Food Program.\nBut it\u2019s been rough going in a country where travel is perilous, food aid is frequently stolen, and aid workers are targeted; 95 have already died in the conflict.\nInternational aid agencies are scrambling to figure out how to help feed the nation whose agricultural system is currently in tatters.\nFear of U.S. airstrikes have reportedly increased the surge of new refugees, with 5,000 to 6,000 people now streaming across the border daily."}
