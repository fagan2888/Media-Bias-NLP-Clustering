Louie Gohmert likes to give speeches on the House floor. A lot of speeches.\n\nIn 2014, Gohmert managed to speak for an astounding 29 hours total on the house floor \u2014 the most of any congressman for the whole year, according to data collected by CSPAN. The Hill reports that Gohmert made most of his speeches at the end of the legislative day, delivering 30-60 minute \u201cspecial order\u201d speeches multiple times a week. The Hill described these speeches as \u201clong-winded.\u201d\n\nGohmert gave talks on a variety of topics that included immigration and Obamacare and was known to even incorporate visuals in his congressional monologues. One of his last talks was a 48-minute attack on President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty \u2014 which he had described as \u201cmonarchical\u201d \u2014 and he urged his fellow Republicans to defund it.\n\nThe Texas conservative\u2019s log time far surpassed his fellow talkative congressmen. Fellow conservative Rep. Steve King of Iowa was second among all Republicans in speech time with 10 hours total. Another Texan, Democrat Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, spoke the most among her party\u2019s legislators with nine hours logged in.\n\nUnlike these three, the majority of congressman only spent two or three hours speaking before Congress in 2014.\n\nFollow Scott on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Scott Greer", "description": "Logged in 29 hours of speaking time this year", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Texas Republican Rep.
