Many uninsured decided to just pay the $95 in 2014. However, they may owe much more than $95.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act states that every person in the United States must have minimum health coverage in 2014 or must pay a fee on their federal tax return. This fee is sometimes called the \u201cindividual shared responsibility payment.\u201d In some cases, you may be able to get an exemption from the fee meaning you would not have to pay the fee (Read more about health insurance penalties).\n\nIf you didn\u2019t have health insurance coverage in 2014, you\u2019ll pay one of these two amounts when you file your 2014 federal tax return:\n\nOne percent of your yearly adjusted gross household income. (If you made less than the tax filing threshold, about $10,000 for an individual or $20,300 for married filing jointly, is used to calculate the penalty.) The maximum penalty is the national average premium for a bronze plan, which, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was $2,448 per individual ($204 per month per individual), but $12,240 for a family with five or more members ($1,020 per month for a family with five or more members)\n\n(If you made less than the tax filing threshold, about $10,000 for an individual or $20,300 for married filing jointly, is used to calculate the penalty.) The maximum penalty is the national average premium for a bronze plan, which, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was $2,448 per individual ($204 per month per individual), but $12,240 for a family with five or more members ($1,020 per month for a family with five or more members) $95 per person for the year ($47.50 per child under 18). The maximum penalty per family using this method is $285.\n\nYou make the payment when you file your 2014 income taxes, which will be due in April 2015.\n\nMany uninsured decided to pay the $95 peanlty in 2014. However, they may owe much more than $95. The IRS provides two good examples of the penalty amounts that will be owed by a single individual with $40,000 income due $298.50, and a married couple with two children and $70,000 income will be charged $497 when they file their 2014 Income Tax Return by April 2015.\n\nThe penalty for no 2015 coverage increases. You will be paying the higher of these two amounts:\n\nTwo percent of your yearly household income. (Only the amount of income above the tax filing threshold, about $10,000 for an individual, is used to calculate the penalty.) The maximum penalty is the national average premium for a bronze plan.\n\n(Only the amount of income above the tax filing threshold, about $10,000 for an individual, is used to calculate the penalty.) The maximum penalty is the national average premium for a bronze plan. $325 per person for the year ($162.50 per child under 18). The maximum penalty per family using this method is $975.\n\nIn 2016, it will be 2.5 percent of income or $695 per person, whichever is higher.\n\nIt is important to remember that choosing to make the individual shared responsibility payment instead of purchasing minimum essential coverage means you will also have to pay the entire cost of all your medical care. You won\u2019t be protected from the kind of high medical bills that can sometimes lead to bankruptcy.\n\nIf you\u2019re uninsured for just part of the year, one-twelfth of the yearly penalty applies to each month you\u2019re uninsured. If you\u2019re uninsured for less than three months, you don\u2019t have to make a payment.\n\nYou are considered covered if you have health insurance provided by your employer, health insurance you purchase in the Health Insurance Marketplace, most government-sponsored coverage (Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE, VA health coverage,), and coverage you purchase directly from an insurance company.\n\nFor more information or assistance, visit HealthCare.gov, or call the Health Insurance Marketplace call center at 1-800\u2011318-2596.
