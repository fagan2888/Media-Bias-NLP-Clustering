Are you a HealthSpan member who's concerned about preserving access to medical care? Tell us your story in the comments.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- As HealthSpan prepares to shutter its physicians group next month, Cleveland hospitals are competing to land the company's doctors and the additional business they could bring from thousands of patients across the region.

MetroHealth said two weeks ago that it expected to finalize contracts with a majority of HealthSpan's physicians, including more than 40 primary care doctors who will join its network April 1.

But on Tuesday, a spokeswoman for University Hospitals confirmed it also expects to sign plenty of the doctors. "We are actively recruiting a significant number of HealthSpan physicians and are in the process of negotiations," said spokeswoman Alicia Reale, who declined to indicate how many doctors UH is in discussions with.

Meanwhile, the Cleveland Clinic said it is recruiting from HealthSpan as well. "The number continues to fluctuate and we are continuing to recruit in both primary care and in a number of specialties," spokeswoman Heather Phillips said.

The hospitals are interested in hiring HealthSpan doctors in large part because of the new business they can generate. For example, MetroHealth's chief executive, Dr. Akram Bourtros, said he expects that the new hires will bring in 40,000 new patients a year, an increase of 16 percent. So far, MetroHealth has signed contracts with 56 HealthSpan physicians.

As the competition plays out, HealthSpan members are anxiously awaiting news about where their doctors will land and whether they will be able to continue to see them after March 31, when HealthSpan's physicians group will cease operations.

"We really don't have much information right now," said Marilee Ward, a 60-year-old HealthSpan member from Geneva. Ward said she has high blood pressure, thyroid issues and several other medical problems, and is worried about how far she will have to travel to get care.

HealthSpan announced plans to disband its physicians group in December after several years of poor financial performance. The decision marked the end of an unusual model in Northeast Ohio of offering both insurance and direct medical services to its members. The company said some of its physicians will retire or move out of the area, but that most are expected to sign up with other local health systems.

Some HealthSpan members criticized the timing of the announcement, complaining that it left them with little or no time to switch to another insurer during the open enrollment period.

Nathan Kaplan, a spokesman for HealthSpan, has said that the timing was not meant to prevent people from shopping elsewhere and that the company intends to send members information about their options for medical care in the the next few weeks.

"We want to communicate with them as quickly as we can, but we're waiting to have more clarity on" where HealthSpan's physicians will end up and how that will affect the availability of services, he said.

Kaplan said HealthSpan currently has about 180 physicians. He could not say how many of those doctors are retiring or taking their services outside Northeast Ohio.

Members who lose access to their doctors will be provided information about how to request their medical records, Kaplan said. He also noted that the breadth of provider options available to members will be determined by the details of their health plans, which offer both narrow and broad networks of physicians.
