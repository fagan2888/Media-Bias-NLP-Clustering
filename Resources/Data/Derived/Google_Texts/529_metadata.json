The case centered on one 2010 post that suggested that San Diego attorney Rhonda Holmes had been \u201cbought off\u201d and that was why she wasn\u2019t representing the singer anymore.\n\nLove had hired Holmes to file a fraud case against the estate of her late husband, Kurt Cobain.\n\nThe message was never meant to be public, Love told jurors. She said she meant for it to be sent as a direct message, which only the recipient would see, but it instead went public and was quickly deleted.\n\nJurors determined that Love\u2019s tweet included false information, but the musician didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t true.\n\nAiken weighing run for Congress\n\nPop singer Clay Aiken is considering a run for Congress in North Carolina\u2019s 2nd District, according to a longtime Democratic Party consultant.\n\nConsultant Gary Pearce told the Associated Press on Friday that the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d runner-up from 2003 has talked with him and other advisers and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee about whether to challenge Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers.\n\nOther Democrats have already said they plan to seek the nomination.\n\n\u2018SNL\u2019 names \u2018Update\u2019 co-host\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019 has named head writer Colin Jost as its new \u201cWeekend Update\u201d co-host. Jost will join Cecily Strong as co-anchor of the coveted \u201cSNL\u201d post, replacing soon-to-be-departing Seth Meyers, who will take on hosting duties of \u201cLate Night.\u201d\n\nJost, a Harvard University alum, joined the \u201cSNL\u201d writing staff in 2005 and has been head writer at the late-night sketch show since 2012. His transition to the \u201cWeekend Update\u201d desk is reminiscent of Tina Fey and Meyers.\n\nJost will make his \u201cWeekend Update\u201d debut on March 1, allowing viewers a month to mourn the loss of Meyer\u2019s droll presentation of the news. Meyers, who joined the desk in 2006, recently announced he will do his last \u201cWeekend Update\u201d on Feb. 1.\n\nThe birthday bunch\n\nActor Gregg Palmer is 87. Actor Dean Jones is 83.
