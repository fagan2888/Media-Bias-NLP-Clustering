Known as \u201cearmarks\u201d to some and as \u201cpork\u201d to those who took a less favorable view, these were provisions lawmakers inserted into federal law that required the government to fund specific projects, typically in their home districts.\n\nBoehner was a driving force in eliminating the process, and on multiple occasions during his years running the House he resisted any suggestion that it should be brought back. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m Speaker, there will be no earmarks,\u201d he said repeatedly.\n\nRelated: The New Supply Side Economics\n\nWell, Boehner isn\u2019t speaker anymore and one political scientist, in a recent paper prepared for the Brookings Institution, thinks that bringing back earmarks, at least in a limited fashion, might help restore some sanity to the federal budget and appropriations process.\n\n\u201cThe backlash against earmarking was rooted in the fact that the number of earmarks rose rapidly from the 1990s to the early 2000s,\u201d wrote Peter C. Hanson, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Denver. \u201cAppropriators complained that they were overwhelmed with requests and budget hawks claimed earmarks were wasteful spending.\n\n\u201cA limited restoration of earmarks could satisfy both concerns. Member requests could be capped to prevent appropriators from being flooded with requests. Members have historically understood earmarks to be in their re-election interest, and would likely do so again as long as the number of requests is effectively managed.\u201d\n\nThe thinking among political scientists has long been that earmarks are a potent tool for keeping order in Congress. Leadership can use them as both a carrot, to persuade lawmakers to cooperate on a difficult vote by promising them something for their constituents, and as a stick, to punish obstructionist lawmakers by withholding federal spending that might otherwise have been funneled to their districts.\n\nRelated: Clinton Wants $275 Billion for Infrastructure, but How Will She Pay for It?\n\nThere is also a credible argument to be made that when it comes to directing federal spending, a lawmaker who spends time on the ground in his or her state or district might have a better sense of taxpayers\u2019 wants and needs than bureaucrats in faraway Washington, D.C. (The argument against this, of course, is typified by wasteful projects, like the legendary \u201cbridge to nowhere\u201d that was used by reformers as a prime example of why earmarks needed to be eliminated.)\n\nAs Congress heads toward a December 11 deadline to pass appropriations bills that will allow the government to keep operating, Boehner\u2019s replacement as speaker, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, will be facing many of the same challenges his predecessor did. His party has a majority in the House, but many of his members are not interested in voting for bills that increase federal spending, or insist that they will only do so if they are paired with highly controversial legislation \u2013 such as defunding Planned Parenthood, or cutting aid to Syrian refugees.\n\nThese are the kind of difficult votes, Hanson argues, that earmarking used to help with.\n\n\u201cThe ban on earmarking in appropriations bills has had the unintended effect of making it harder to pass this vital legislation,\u201d he writes. \u201cRestoring limited earmarking could create an important tool for coalition building, thus facilitating passage of appropriations bills.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Can\u2019t the Pentagon Audit Its Books? The Excuses Pile Up\n\nRyan swore off earmarks in 2008, and has shown no sign or proposing their return in this session of Congress, but in the years before they became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the conservative movement, he wasn\u2019t shy about using them to direct spending to his district.\n\nIf members on his party\u2019s right flank decide to make his tenure as speaker as challenging as they made Boehner\u2019s, the old carrot and stick might start looking pretty attractive to the man from Wisconsin.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "\u201cAs long as I\u2019m Speaker, there will be no earmarks,\u201d John Boehner said repeatedly.
