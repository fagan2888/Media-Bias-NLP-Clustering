And I had read that they had said, oh, we actually lost money, which was surprising.\n\nSo, I called the mayor, who told me, not only did we lose money then; we are totally going to lose money this year, which is an absolutely stunning statement from a public official.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: How are they losing money?\n\nMINA KIMES: So, the game is in Glendale, but many of the events, the tourists, the hotels, are actually in Phoenix and Scottsdale.\n\nSo, you\u2019re going to have a lot of people coming in for the game and then leaving. And the city has to spend money on security, costs like that.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, this also happened last year when\u2026\n\nMINA KIMES: Exactly.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: With the Super Bowl in New York, right?\n\nMINA KIMES: Right.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Actually, I said New York.\n\nMINA KIMES: There you go, right, a perfect example, right.\n\nMINA KIMES: The actual game was in New Jersey, but everyone remembers that it was the New York Super Bowl.\n\nSo, as a result, New Jersey felt kind of spurned in a way by the game.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: OK.\n\nSo, what about \u2014 how do the NFL owners feel in these towns? Is there tension between the mayors and the owners?\n\nMINA KIMES: Well, there definitely is in Arizona.\n\nSo, the owners, they want game. There\u2019s huge benefits to have it at their stadium. It\u2019s great for the team.\n\nAnd the Cardinals\u2019 owner, Mike Bidwill, has actually publicly clashed with the mayor of Glendale about his, shall we say, lack of enthusiasm over hosting the game this year.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And cities and towns put a lot of money into building stadiums\u2026\n\nMINA KIMES: Yes.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: \u2026 so that they can get events like this.\n\nMINA KIMES: Glendale being a perfect example of where that has gone wrong.\n\nThis city has contributed money to three major sports facilities over the last 10 years and now is absolutely mired in debt.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: You know, there are economists or that \u2014 that are going to say, look at all of \u2014 or, I should say, maybe even the NFL will say, look at all the money that comes in with all the tourists.\n\nDon\u2019t they spend a couple extra bucks here and couple extra bucks there?\n\nSo you are saying \u2014 or the mayor of that town is saying that it doesn\u2019t make up for the cops that I have to put on the beat?\n\nMINA KIMES: So, the NFL definitely says that.\n\nEconomists mostly don\u2019t. In fact, a lot of economists will \u2014 who are independent, right, will come out and say, actually, the benefits of these games and especially stadiums are incredibly overblown, because, in a lot of cases, you are displacing other tourists that would normally be in especially a warm place like Phoenix in the winter.\n\nAnd, oftentimes, it is indirect spending, publicity, things you can\u2019t really put a clear number on.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Right. And I would imagine that the NFL is also going to say that the \u2014 what about the sort of brand that you build\u2026\n\nMINA KIMES: Right. Yes.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: \u2026 and the exposure argument, that you are getting all this free airtime. Everybody is talking about the Super Bowl in your town.\n\nMINA KIMES: And yet you just said the Super Bowl in New York last\u2026\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: I mean, not East Rutherford, New Jersey, right.\n\nMINA KIMES: A perfect example, right?\n\nReally, what branding? I mean, our \u2014 in America in a year, are people going to remember the Super Bowl was in Glendale?\n\nSome people will, but I\u2019m guessing a lot of people will just say Phoenix.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.\n\nAnd so, and all the celebrities, all that traffic goes to Phoenix, that they don\u2019t\u2026\n\nMINA KIMES: Yes.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: \u2026 necessarily come out to Glendale until exactly the game time, and they\u2019re there for the game and then they leave.\n\nMINA KIMES: Much like in New York, I don\u2019t think, you know, most of these celebrities were staying in New Jersey last year.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Mina Kimes, senior writer for ESPN The Magazine, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nMINA KIMES: Thanks for having me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the days leading up to Super Bowl XLIX, economists are debating the fiscal wisdom of cities that compete to host the big game.
