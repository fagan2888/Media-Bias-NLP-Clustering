Pre-registration is required by Feb. 20. Continuing Education Unit credits are available.\n\n\"Now more than ever, we want to help the next generation of Union County residents grow up with a hands-on appreciation for the connection between our health and the earth, air, and water that supports us,\" said Freeholder Chairman Mohamed Jalloh. \"I encourage you to come to the workshop and get all the information you need to get started.\"\n\nAttendees can choose from sessions covering the fundamentals of growing a successful produce garden, such as how to pick a good site and how to keep pests out.\n\nOther sessions cover integrating garden activities into health and nutrition lesson plans for youngsters in grades Pre-K to 4, and for youth in grades 5, 6 and up.\n\nAlso included are two popular specialty topics, how to grow strawberries and how to garden-in-a-hurry with containers.\n\n\"Strawberries are a popular school project because the fruits can mature while the school year is still in session, and container gardening is an easy, space-saving solution when you don't have much room to work with,\" Jalloh said. \"Let our Extension experts show you some of the amazing things you can do with a few plastic buckets and a few minutes.\"\n\nThe fee for \"Get Your Youth and Community Garden Growing\" is $25 which includes lunch and all materials. More details and a registration form are available at the Union County website, ucnj.org.\n\nTo register online visit tinyurl.com/schoolgardenconference by Feb. 20.
