Long-time ESPN anchor Stuart Scott had a well-documented battle with cancer, which he succumbed to last year. His two daughters, Taelor and Sydni, posted a video and a letter in tribute to their dad, to mark the one-year anniversary of his passing.

“This last year, we realized the full impact you’ve had on the world, and how important you were to so many,” they wrote on their blog at Dear World. “We are truly grateful for the opportunity to meet many people whom you profoundly impacted, share our grief and our memories while giving back on your behalf and continuing the legacy you started in raising cancer awareness.”

In the video, both Taelor and Syndi recount how their father influenced their lives individually, with Scott always being there to watch Taelor play soccer, or teaching Sydni how to operate a camera she’d received as a gift. Sydni recounts how she used the camera to take pictures of her father in the hospital.

“It was like back when I was little,” she said. “It was the best time we got to spend together in years.”

His daughters finish their letter by stating how they have learned to persevere through it all, just like their father did. “[W]e’ve learned to reach for the fight we possess inside and apply it with passion to our lives. It was through your vulnerability, that you taught us the real value of strength in never giving up.”

Before passing away at 49, Scott accepted the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at the 2014 ESPYs. “When you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer,” he said at the time. “You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live.”
