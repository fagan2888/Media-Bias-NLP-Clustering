Gov. Dan Forest warned the state\u2019s homeschoolers Monday to look out for\u2014and oppose\u2014\u201crandom homeschool searches\u201d by state officials.\n\nForest\u2019s statement caused a stir among the homeschool community because it brought to light a longstanding practice of inspections the Division of Non-Public Education\u2019s (DNPE) left dormant for 20 years.\n\nIn North Carolina, homeschool parents must make attendance, immunization, and standardized test records available to state inspectors. Many homeschooling families believe that regulation, and the state\u2019s plan to visit parents and children at home, conflicts with the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against warrantless searches.\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

Mills said he used to visit every homeschooling family, but growing numbers overwhelmed the state agency, leading inspectors to resort to mail or group visits in church basements. \u201cI went to probably 10,000 or more homes visiting homeschools and just talking to them about their [records],\u201d he said. \u201cThere never was any animosity that I remember.\u201d\n\nDespite Forest\u2019s opposition, North Carolinians for Home Education didn\u2019t take issue with Mills\u2019 plans to renew visits, saying Oct. 2 the inspections demonstrated \u201cthat DNPE is actively serving North Carolina\u2019s citizens.\u201d\n\nMills told me he has some families call annually asking for him to come by, but conventional private schools have taken all his time: \u201cThere was no intent of harassment or trying to intimidate or anything like that. It was just trying to open up a rapport is all it was.\u201d\n\nHe \u201chad such a good rapport\u201d with homeschoolers 20 years ago, he said he wanted to try again and increase his knowledge: \u201cI could say firsthand, \u2018No, I\u2019ve been to the schools, and they have spoken with me and been free in their expression of what their philosophical idea of education is. And there\u2019s no problem that I see.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut despite Mills\u2019 history and expressed intentions, many homeschooling families don\u2019t want a strengthened relationship with the state. Some called his office and said they looked forward to the visit, but others expressed distrust, Mills admitted. He told me that even before Forest\u2019s comments, he had decided against going forward with the visits, describing parents\u2019 reaction as a surprise: \u201cI\u2019ve been really a good advocate for homeschools all these 28 years.\u201d\n\nForest could not be reached to explain his concern as a homeschool dad. But on Monday, he and the DNPE released a joint statement saying \u201cno site visits have been conducted and none are planned.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina remains friendly to homeschools despite having stricter regulations than some states. The state community of 53,000 homeschools is large and organized, with the grassroots power to kill educational policy it doesn\u2019t agree with. In 2005, then-Gov. Mike Easley proposed placing private and homeschools under the Department of Public Instruction, but thousands of phone calls led the governor to quickly drop the proposal.\n\nNationally, Forest\u2019s spat with the DNPE isn\u2019t the first misunderstanding of sorts involving home visits this year. Earlier this summer, the Homeschool Legal Defense Association dispelled rumors that a home visits program in the Affordable Care Act was mandatory and potentially adversarial.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "RALEIGH, N.C.\u2014North Carolina Lt.
