But this system is about to run its course as the state\u2019s servers reach the end of their useful lives.\n\nRelated: Pentagon Plays Catch-Up with Cloud Computing\n\nDelaware now is about to take another big step into the cloud. It\u2019s looking at relinquishing management of its computing infrastructure and turning it over to an outside company to handle for a monthly fee. It\u2019s a leap to the so-called \u201cpublic\u201d cloud, where the computing is done by a third party. The First State\u2019s foray into the cloud is one many other states are undertaking, as officials increasingly shed their skepticism and yield to the promise of the cost savings.\n\n\u201cPeople are becoming more comfortable with (cloud computing),\u201d said Dan Lohrmann, former chief information security officer for the state of Michigan. \u201cMore and more states are adopting the cloud.\u201d\n\nA new survey of the states\u2019 top information technology officials bears that out. Twenty percent of the states are now highly invested in cloud-based services, according to the survey released earlier this month by the National Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO). Last year, just 6 percent of the states were.\n\nNearly three-quarters of the states, 73 percent, say they already have some applications in the public cloud and are considering others. That\u2019s a major advancement from just four years ago, when more than half of the information officers, 54 percent, said in a similar NASCIO survey that they were still investigating cloud computing.\n\nRelated: Amazon Gets Government Boost in Its Cloud War with Google\n\nStates are expected to spend about $32.6 billion on information technology this year, while local governments will spend about $27.8 billion, Deltek, the consulting and software firm for government contractors, estimates. Of that, state and local governments will spend only about $625 million for cloud services combined, said Chris Dixon, Deltek\u2019s senior manager of state and local industry analysis. But the amount spent on cloud computing will likely increase as states become more comfortable with it, he said.\n\nCost savings are driving states to embrace the cloud and accept private-sector cloud services. Estimates are states can save 25 percent to 50 percent in their computing operations.\n\nCosts drove Delaware to it. The state saved $5 million in 2009, the first year its in-house cloud system was up and running, said William Hickox, Delaware\u2019s acting chief information officer. \u201cThe first year, it\u2019s savings,\u201d Hickox said. \u201cAfter that it\u2019s cost avoidance. We\u2019ve had $5 million a year in cost avoidance since then.\u201d\n\nFear of a Lack of Control\n\nStates have trailed the private sector in turning to the cloud and third-party, cloud-based services. And while they\u2019re ahead of local governments, they\u2019ve also trailed the federal government.\n\nIn late 2010, the federal government announced a \u201ccloud first\u201d strategy for federal agencies, saying giving priority to web-based applications and services would let more people share a common infrastructure, thereby cutting technology purchases and support costs. Vivek Kundra, federal chief information officer at the time, predicted a \u201ccloud first\u201d approach could lower some costs by as much as half by using third-party public services.\n\nRelated: Big Business Trend - Knock Out Disruptive Upstarts\n\nThe policy helped spur state information technology chiefs to drop some of their queasiness about the cloud, especially the public cloud, where firms such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others have huge capacity and offer services on a subscription basis. Simply renting servers rather than buying them can lower capital costs.\n\nStates were slow to adopt cloud computing, and the public cloud especially, for several reasons, said Dugan Petty, former chief information officer for Oregon and a senior fellow at The Center for Digital Government. Security of a state\u2019s data is the main one. States hold vast amounts of personal information on their citizens, ranging from dates of birth to Social Security and driver\u2019s license numbers. Security is also a federal concern, and their systems adopted security standards to protect their data.\n\nState computers are under constant attack, as Stateline has reported. And the prospect of a breach of that data held in the cloud by private companies can keep state officials up at night. Just having the servers holding the data out of officials\u2019 sight in the cloud can make them queasy, although they have full access to it.\n\n\u201cI think the major thing people are afraid of is lack of control,\u201d said Lohrmann, now chief security officer and strategist with the cybersecurity training firm Security Mentor. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of security when you have it under your control.\u201d\n\nHowever, Lohrmann said, cloud companies are constantly developing better security that must meet federal standards, just as states and third-party security contractors they use to protect their data are becoming more adept in combating cyberattacks. That doesn\u2019t mean there still aren\u2019t breaches. Apple\u2019s iCloud, for example, was hacked recently, and nude photos of several celebrities were grabbed and posted online.\n\nPetty said state officials also have considered much of what they do\u2014from hiring to financial management to procurement and inventory\u2014as different from the private sector and that government required its own software. But they\u2019re learning what they do isn\u2019t unique and cloud software services that businesses subscribe to can be fitted to government use.\n\nCloud software service vendors are proliferating, and increasingly offering services for government that can be tuned to a state\u2019s policies and regulations and open to audit.\n\nThe firm BidSync, for instance, offers a cloud-based service for state procurement officers that handles purchasing from the bidding stage through receiving tailored to a state\u2019s regulations. Next to labor, purchases of goods and services can be a government\u2019s highest operating cost. \u201cThis challenges the notion that we are so different in government,\u201d Petty said.\n\n\u2018Pretty Much Inevitable\u2019\n\nAlthough Delaware was the first state to take to the cloud, Petty said others, such as Utah and Michigan, were early cloud adopters, too. The budget crunch spawned by the Great Recession helped spur adoption, he said. States were forced to consolidate hardware and use virtual software to run multiple operating systems and applications on the same server at the same time to reduce costs.\n\nPetty said the next logical step is to outsource other computer infrastructure and software services and pay for it on a subscription basis, just as Delaware is looking to do. Some states are taking big plunges into the cloud with outside firms.\n\nThis summer, California launched a consolidated \u201cCalCloud\u201d platform managed by IBM to streamline operations and deliver services from the cloud for 400 state and local agencies. IBM would provide the infrastructure and operate it on a subscription basis in the five-year, $400 million deal, while the state manages the rest.\n\nAt the same time, Pennsylvania announced it would pay global technology firm Unisys up to $681 million over seven years to unify seven state data centers and deliver cloud-based services ranging from storage to allowing other third-party software adaptation. Exactly how much the state spends will depend on use. But cost savings are anticipated. Lohrmann said the prospect of budget savings will all but demand states go there. \u201cGoing to the cloud is pretty much inevitable.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Stateline, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Center on the States that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Seven years ago, the state of Delaware started moving computer servers out of closets", "title": "States Turn to Cloud Computing for Cost Savings", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/14/States-Turn-Cloud-Computing-Cost-Savings", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06212011_Cloud2_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/14/States-Turn-Cloud-Computing-Cost-Savings", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06212011_Cloud2_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Seven years ago, the state of Delaware started moving computer servers out of closets", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Cost savings are driving states to embrace the cloud and accept private-sector cloud services.\nBut the amount spent on cloud computing will likely increase as states become more comfortable with it, he said.\n\u201cPeople are becoming more comfortable with (cloud computing),\u201d said Dan Lohrmann, former chief information security officer for the state of Michigan.\nBut this system is about to run its course as the state\u2019s servers reach the end of their useful lives.\nBut they\u2019re learning what they do isn\u2019t unique and cloud software services that businesses subscribe to can be fitted to government use."}
