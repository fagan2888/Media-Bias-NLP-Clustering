His strategic bumbling in the most explosive part of the planet has set off a chain reaction.\n\nThe president turned his back on America\u2019s friends like Israel, Jordan and Egypt, and longtime partner Saudi Arabia. Desperate for help in crushing the Islamic State terrorists and diverting attention from his failures, President Obama has thrown in his lot with the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nAmerica has no worse enemy.\n\nFor three decades, the State Department classified Iran as a state sponsor of international terrorism. The Iranian regime supported and directed the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, slaughtering 241 American servicemen in a single stroke.\n\nTehran aided terrorists worldwide ever since. Reports indicate it helped al-Qaeda in the 1990s. After 9/11, the regime helped al- Qaeda even more. When the U.S. sent forces to destroy al-Qaeda\u2019s Taliban safe havens in Afghanistan, Iran aided the Taliban. When the U.S. led the way to oust Saddam Hussein and smash jihadists in Iraq between 2003 and 2011, Iran backed terrorists and Shiite militias to maim and kill our young men and women.\n\nIran\u2019s notorious Revolutionary Guard designed and built countless improvised explosive devices, giving them to terrorists to butcher our people more horrifically in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nPresident Obama never called Iran to account for its unprovoked attacks on Americans. Instead, his policies have rewarded the ayatollahs.\n\nIran is a longtime supporter of the Syrian regime \u2014 itself a state sponsor of terrorism \u2014 run by fanatics willing to murder thousands of its own citizens with chemical weapons.\n\nBit by bit, Iran is surrounding the great oil fields of the Arabian peninsula. It has co-opted the government of Iraq that we had put in power. Last month, it helped Houthi extremists overthrow the pro-American president of Yemen, a government that President Obama once called his counterterrorism success story. It is trying to overthrow the government of Bahrain.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is America\u2019s staunchest friend in the region: Israel. The Iranian regime continues to build the capability to execute its inflammatory rhetoric to exterminate Israel and hold the world hostage to new forms of nuclear terror.\n\nThe ayatollahs and their followers believe their rhetoric. Israel, they insist, must be wiped out. America, they repeat daily, is \u201cthe Great Satan.\u201d As true believers, they demand that the Great Satan must be destroyed as well.\n\nLast December, President Obama pretended not to notice the Iranian regime celebrating the 35th anniversary of the 1979 hostage crisis by staging \u201cDeath to America\u201d rallies. Grasping for options against the atrocities of the Islamic State, Obama has gone soft on Iran. For years, the U.S., Israel and others had been working covertly to disrupt and destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. Not anymore.\n\nThe president apparently believes that, for all their tough talk, the ayatollahs are reasonable men who can be trusted to strike a deal that benefits everybody. After all, no other country has more \u201cboots on the ground\u201d against the Sunni fanatics of the Islamic State than the Shiite fanatics of Iran.\n\nThe Obama administration seems willing to accept an Iranian nuclear weapons system that is complete but not operational. Such a stance would assure Tehran that its big investment in nuclear missiles will ultimately become a reality. And President Obama could claim political success for preventing the ayatollahs\u2019 nukes from actually being deployed.\n\nAt least on his watch.\n\nRepublican Ken Buck represents Colorado\u2019s 4th Congressional District.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ken Buck: Obama\u2019s dangerous dance with Iran", "title": "Ken Buck: Obama\u2019s dangerous dance with Iran", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/06/ken-buck-obamas-dangerous-dance-with-iran/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150306__20150308_Z00_OP08C_BUCKp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150306__20150308_Z00_OP08C_BUCKp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-06T11:14:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T20:56:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "President Obama just made a dangerous world a lot more dangerous.\nGrasping for options against the atrocities of the Islamic State, Obama has gone soft on Iran.\nThe Iranian regime supported and directed the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, slaughtering 241 American servicemen in a single stroke.\nAnd President Obama could claim political success for preventing the ayatollahs\u2019 nukes from actually being deployed.\nLast month, it helped Houthi extremists overthrow the pro-American president of Yemen, a government that President Obama once called his counterterrorism success story."}
