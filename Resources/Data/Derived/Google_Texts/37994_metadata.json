They really like eating wings.\n\n2. They like the 60\u201d TVs when watching sports.\n\n3. They want to exercise their vocal chords by singing Karaoke.\n\nOr so they say.\n\nRelated: Slide Show: 7 Brazen Breastaurants in the U.S. in 2014\n\nLike moths attracted to light, men continue to flock to restaurants that push the babes, booze and burgers \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise that these specialty eating establishments swelled to over $2 billion in annual sales in 2013. Now, bold upstarts with a flair for the double entendre and an eye for the bottom line have been busting out all over the country.\n\nMany say it\u2019s high time someone challenged the \u201cold man\u201d of the industry: Hooters. It launched more than three decades ago, in 1983 \u2013 when Ronald Reagan was still president, big hair ruled and the brat pack was on the prowl. Even during the peak of the great recession, the bastion of male bonding was raking in nearly $1 million a year. But then things went flat, with sales declining by nearly 3 \u00bd percent in 2012 as new competitors muscled in and the brand went stale. Analysts said it was in need of a serious makeover.\n\nOutlets such as Bikinis Sports Bar & Grill and the Tilted Kilt today push playful and energetic taglines such as \u201csports with a view\u201d and \u201ca cold beer never looked so good.\u201d CEO Doug Guller of Austin-based ATX Brands, which runs the eight-year-old Bikinis, told Nation\u2019s Restaurant News recently, \u201cIt\u2019s a somewhat recession-resilient industry. I don\u2019t think food, booze, sports or sex are going to die anytime soon.\u201d\n\nRelated: Breastaurants Grow to Over $2 Billion in Annual Sales\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t \u201cunderestimate how contemporary they are,\u201d Darren Tristano of Technomic Inc., a Chicago-based research firm, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a contemporary experience with good comfort food that depends on the looks and quality of the service.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cservice,\u201d of course, is dishing out a lot more than overstuffed chicken quesadillas. Twin Peaks, known for its \u201cmountain cabin ambiance\u201d and skimpy waitress outfits, emphasizes \u201cthe guest experience and the Twin Peaks girls,\u201d according to CEO Randy DeWitt, who last year appeared on the CBS reality series Undercover Boss. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a well-rounded female who can deliver a great experience for our guests,\u201d Maggie Miller, Twin Peaks\u2019 director of training and recruiting, told ABC News.\n\nHooters, feeling the heat, is in the midst of a three-to-five year reinvention \u2013 grabbing for a clientele well beyond the 80-percent male presence of most other breastaurants. After launching with a menu of moderately priced American bar food such as wings, burgers, and sandwiches, the chain now serves a wide array of salad entrees in an appeal for a younger and more female clientele.\n\nThe privately held Hooters, which is in 27 countries and has more than 412 restaurants, also changed its tagline a few years back to \u201cfeed the dream\u201d and hired HBO\u2019s \u201cEastbound & Down\u201d creator Jody Hill to direct attention-getting TV ads.\n\nClick Here to See 7 Brazen Breastaurants in the U.S. in 2014\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There are three reasons men say they go to \u201cbreastaurants\u201d:", "title": "Bodies, Brews and Boys: Restaurants with High \u2018T\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/13/Bodies-Brews-and-Boys-Restaurants-High-T", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Tilted%20Kilt%20%28Tilted%20Kilt%29.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/13/Bodies-Brews-and-Boys-Restaurants-High-T", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Tilted%20Kilt%20%28Tilted%20Kilt%29.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There are three reasons men say they go to \u201cbreastaurants\u201d:", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3bd\"", "article_summary": "Twin Peaks, known for its \u201cmountain cabin ambiance\u201d and skimpy waitress outfits, emphasizes \u201cthe guest experience and the Twin Peaks girls,\u201d according to CEO Randy DeWitt, who last year appeared on the CBS reality series Undercover Boss.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a well-rounded female who can deliver a great experience for our guests,\u201d Maggie Miller, Twin Peaks\u2019 director of training and recruiting, told ABC News.\nMany say it\u2019s high time someone challenged the \u201cold man\u201d of the industry: Hooters.\nBut then things went flat, with sales declining by nearly 3 \u00bd percent in 2012 as new competitors muscled in and the brand went stale.\nClick Here to See 7 Brazen Breastaurants in the U.S. in 2014Top Reads from The Fiscal Times:"}
