Thousands of migrants from Middle Eastern countries, including Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, have fled to Europe. As European countries grapple with the situation, Hungary has become the epicenter of the crisis, with many on trains or at train stations. Many of the migrants have resisted going to a refugee camp.
