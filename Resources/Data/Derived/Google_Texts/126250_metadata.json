Though no details have been revealed about the specific type of submarine involved, Finland\u2019s naval forces reported a second sighting during the night, which prompted them to release several \u201clight depth charges at three in the morning.\u201d\n\n#Finland fires warning shots at \u201cforeign submarine\u201d near Helsinki http://t.co/vLwN60BlJG @TelegraphNews #ausdef pic.twitter.com/LHndHo0pUE \u2014 David Feeney (@Feeney4Batman) April 29, 2015\n\nDefense Minister Carl Haglund observed that while the intruding vessel could possibly be a submarine, its identity has yet to be confirmed by authorities.\n\n\u201cWe determined that there was something there under the water\u2026 we dropped a couple of warning depth charges which cause a lot of noise but don\u2019t pose any danger to the possible target,\u201d he noted. \u201cAt this stage we don\u2019t know if it was a vessel or something else. What we do know is that our sensors detected sounds that indicate activity.\u201d\n\nFinland\u2019s navy has detected such strange underwater activity before, but the dropping of depth charges is considered to be highly unusual. The last time the weapons were utilized to warn away a suspected submarine was in 2004.\n\nFinnish Navy drops depth charges near foreign submarine off Helsinki. http://t.co/0gWSbWtLUj pic.twitter.com/PbKIBYAdJL \u2014 Jalopnik (@Jalopnik) April 28, 2015\n\nThe submarine incident in Finland comes amid increased Russian military activity in the Baltic, according to the Telegraph, which has prompted the neutral nation to announce closer military cooperation with other Nordic countries, including Norway and Denmark. Finland shares a border with Russia, which spans 830 miles.\n\nLast year, Swedish forces pursued a suspected submarine in their territorial waters after several observations were made near Stockholm. Though their efforts were unsuccessful, as the Inquisitr previously reported, most Swedish defense analysts pointed to Russia as the likely culprit behind the submarine intrusion.\n\nThough Haglund did not specifically accuse Russia while discussing the recent incursion, he noted the similarities with last year\u2019s incident in Sweden.\n\n\u201cWe strongly suspect that there has been underwater activity that does not belong there. Of course it is always serious if our territorial waters have been violated,\u201d he noted.\n\nFinland\u2019s Navy has not detected any further underwater activity, and it is believed that the intruder, whether a submarine or not, has fled the region.\n\n[Image: Jussi Nukari/LEHTIKUVA via AP]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Authorities in Finland have reported that the country's navy fired depth charges at a suspected submarine located in the waters off Helsinki, after they failed", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Authorities in Finland have reported that the country\u2019s navy fired depth charges at a suspected submarine located in the waters off Helsinki, after they failed", "title": "Suspected Submarine Fired On By Finnish Navy Off Helsinki", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2052051/suspected-submarine-fired-on-by-finnish-navy-off-helsinki/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Submarine-Hunt-670.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-29T12:35:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-29T13:25:46+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Submarine-Hunt-670.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-04-29T12:35:02+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "depth charges,finland,navy,submarine,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Submarine-Hunt-670.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Authorities in Finland have reported that the country\u2019s navy fired depth charges at a suspected submarine located in the waters off Helsinki, after they failed"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd43bd\"", "article_summary": "Authorities in Finland have reported that the country\u2019s navy fired depth charges at a suspected submarine located in the waters off Helsinki, after they failed to identify the suspicious vessel.\nFinnish Navy drops depth charges near foreign submarine off Helsinki.\nThe last time the weapons were utilized to warn away a suspected submarine was in 2004.\nLast year, Swedish forces pursued a suspected submarine in their territorial waters after several observations were made near Stockholm.\nFinland\u2019s Navy has not detected any further underwater activity, and it is believed that the intruder, whether a submarine or not, has fled the region."}
