What part of voters\u2019 collective \u201cTrump\u2019s our guy\u201d cry don\u2019t they get?\n\nFirst this, from Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, who appeared on MSNBC to spout the view that fellow conservative elites ought to stand firm and fight on \u2013 that the Trump train could certainly still be stopped. He said, in part: Let\u2019s launch a Reform Party run.\n\n\u201cThe key is to have compelling candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is too much resignation and fatalism, especially among the people. If you think we deserve better than Trump and Clinton, and I certainly do \u2026 I guess I\u2019m annoyed at other people who are activists and donors and politicians, who sort of sit back and watch the slow motion car crash happening. It is happening in slow motion. There is time to avert it.\u201d\n\nThen this, from ForAmerica Chairman Brent Bozell, in an open letter to Sarah Palin, Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson and Phyllis Schlafly, all Trump supporters: \u201cDo the most courageous thing you\u2019ve ever done, in a lifetime of bravery. Retract your endorsement.\u201d\n\nCheryl Chumley\u2019s latest book takes on the Washington behemoth head-on. Don\u2019t miss her guidebook for turning back the disastrous effects of bipartisan Big Government: \u201cThe Devil in D.C.: Winning Back the Country from the Beast in Washington\u201d\n\nHuckabee, meanwhile, indicated in an email within hours after that call for retraction that he would do no such thing \u2013 especially since he\u2019s never officially endorsed Trump.\n\n\u201cThe irony is that I have not endorsed in the primary,\u201d he said, in an emailed statement. \u201cI think some assume if you don\u2019t hate Trump and spew venom at him, you must have endorsed.\u201d He also added, however: \u201cFor the record, I like Trump and think he is our very best hope to beat Hillary [Clinton].\u201d\n\nThis should also be for the record: The Trump hating has got to stop. Remember the January torrent of outrage that spewed at National Review when dozens of Republican pundits, faithfuls and operatives penned separate letters that were then filed under the general headline, \u201cConservatives Against Trump\u201d? Those at least came when the primary season was still in the throes of competition, with 11 candidates in the Republican camp duking it out on nationally televised debate stages. Now, the voters\u2019 choices have been made clear; now, it\u2019s mathematically impossible for anyone but Trump to lead in the delegate count.\n\nYet, diehard Trump bashers seem content to rest on the laurels that brought about the rise of Trump in the first place \u2013 which is to say, their reliance on inner-party workings and the power of said workings to overcome any will of the people that doesn\u2019t fit their inner-party visions. Their goal? To bring about an open convention where delegates can thwart the will of the American voter and pick the establishment\u2019s candidate of choice \u2013 which appears, at this point, to be Anyone But Trump. America saw this type of attitude already with the tea party fight for relevance on Capitol Hill, and the push-back from the likes of the Senate\u2019s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, one of Washington\u2019s most entrenched insiders, who bragged during the 2014 election season \u201cwe are going to crush them everywhere.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that same elitism, the one that expresses profound disbelief in an American citizenry\u2019s ability to choose what\u2019s best for self and country, that\u2019s continuing to propel this anti-Trump march forward \u2013 that\u2019s giving it breath and life it doesn\u2019t deserve. Like Trump or hate him, the will of the American Republican seems clear. And it\u2019s personified by this, the most recent delegate count: Trump, 954; Cruz, 562.\n\nThose who refuse to accept the numbers and abide the fact that what voters see in Trump, at root, is that he\u2019s everything they\u2019re not are only revealing themselves as entrenched elitists, enemies of the very republic \u2013 the one won against all odds by farmers and shopkeepers and untrained militiamen, no less \u2013 they then impudently proclaim to support.\n\nCheryl Chumley\u2019s latest book takes on the Washington behemoth head-on.
