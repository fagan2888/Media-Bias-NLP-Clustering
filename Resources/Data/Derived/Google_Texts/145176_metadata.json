Frayne said getting the community involved is the best shot hospitals have at changing the way the state is funding health care.\n\nState Sen. Mae Flexer, D-Killingly, said now that the state budget has passed, the legislature must now pass implementation bills by July 1.\n\nA fund called the low-cost hospital pool is designed to assist health care organizations such as Day Kimball that serve more medicare and medicaid patients that must be evaluated, Flexer said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fighting to keep the number of hospitals in that pool as small as possible,\u201d Flexer said. \u201cDay Kimball is definitely in the pool, but there is a debate over who else needs to be in it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Francesca Kefalas For The BulletinPUTNAM \u2014 The news for Day Kimball Healthcare is better \u2014 but not good \u2014 now that the state budget has passed.Day Kimball is going to lose $5 million over two years through increased taxes or lost revenue, said Robert Smanik, president and chief executive officer of Day Kimball Healthcare.It\u2019s much better than the $12 million over two years that was first proposed in the governor\u2019s budget, but still not good for Day Kimball,", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-15935B0B-44F3-7AAE-E053-0100007F6D43-pub252"}, "og": {"type": "article", "image": {"width": 3264, "identifier": "http://www.norwichbulletin.com/storyimage/CT/20150613/NEWS/150619770/AR/0/AR-150619770.jpg", "height": 2448}, "site_name": "The Bulletin", "description": "Francesca Kefalas For The BulletinPUTNAM \u2014 The news for Day Kimball Healthcare is better \u2014 but not good \u2014 now that the state budget", "title": "Day Kimball faces fiscal crunch; staff reduction likely"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NorwichBulletin", "image": {"src": "http://www.norwichbulletin.com/storyimage/CT/20150613/NEWS/150619770/AR/0/AR-150619770.jpg&MaxW=1200&MaxH=630"}, "description": "Francesca Kefalas For The BulletinPUTNAM \u2014 The news for Day Kimball Healthcare is better \u2014 but not good \u2014 now that the state budget has passed.Day Kimball is going to lose $5 million over two years through increased taxes or lost revenue, said Robert Smanik, president and chief executive officer of Day Kimball Healthcare.It\u2019s much better than the $12 million over two years that was first proposed in the governor\u2019s budget, but still not good for Day Kimball,", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Day Kimball faces fiscal crunch; staff reduction likely"}, "bt": {"pubDate": "20150613T21:19:27Z", "modDate": "20150614T03:15:00Z"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143435942403889}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-15935B0B-44F3-7AAE-E053-0100007F6D43-pub252"}}, "msvalidate.01": "7E15F9269E2CE66F2A488ABB04B5015E", "google-site-verification": "iJXziaWxVrrdv4gd3I0Mc6rJCiGR73uNjnSmYiQ7gZI"}, "article_summary": "Day Kimball is going to lose $5 million over two years through increased taxes or lost revenue, said Robert Smanik, president and chief executive officer of Day Kimball Healthcare.\n\u201cDay Kimball is definitely in the pool, but there is a debate over who else needs to be in it.\u201d\nSmanik said over the last few years Day Kimball has also reduced the number of senior administration.\nFor Day Kimball, which has a large portion of medicare and medicaid patients, the formula is onerous, Smanik said.\nDay Kimball has relaunched its pledge campaign, \u201cI Am A New Day,\u201d to shine a spotlight on the issue for state leaders."}
