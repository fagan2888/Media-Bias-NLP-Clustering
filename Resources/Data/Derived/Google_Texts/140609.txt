2. Alice Munro wins the Nobel for literature

Canadian author Alice Munro won the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday. Munro, 82, has made a career of short fiction rather than novels, a rare feat. The most recent of her 13 short-story collections was Dear Life, but it will be her final one if she sticks to an announcement in July to retire from writing. The New York Times says her "visceral work explores the tangled relationships between men and women, small-town existence, and the fallibility of memory." Author Cynthia Ozick has called her "our Chekhov." [The New York Times, Globe and Mail]

5. Libya's prime minister is abducted, then freed, in Tripoli

Gunmen seized Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan early Thursday from the Tripoli hotel where he lives, then freed him within hours. The abduction appeared to be a militia group's retaliation against the Libyan government for supposedly allowing U.S. commandos to capture suspected al Qaeda leader Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, a.k.a. Abu Anas al-Libi, in Tripoli on Saturday. Militants have accused the government of collusion in the raid. [USA Today]
