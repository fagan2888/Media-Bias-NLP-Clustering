Former Rep. Trey Radel (R-Fla), the self-described “hip-hop conservative” who resigned from Congress last year following a drug bust, is launching a media training company.

In addition to training, the Trey Radel Media Group will provide management and message crafting, and will “be on the forefront of training people how to prepare for and deal with the media,” according to its website.

The ex-congressman’s company will also guide clients in Washington and Florida on how to testify before state and federal lawmakers.

“As a member of Congress, I noticed that people who testified sometimes lacked a clear message or didn’t exactly know what the committee wanted,” Radel writes on his site. “We will help people craft their most persuasive requests while maximizing the time of lawmakers. It’s a win-win.”

Radel resigned from Congress in January of 2014 after pleading guilty to cocaine possession. The 38-year-old father and former television news anchor then entered drug treatment.

“I hope what I’ve learned can help others. Whether it’s a crisis situation or a misstep in the media, you’ve got to be able to pick yourself up, learn and move on. Today, I hope to lead others to do just that,” Radel says.

As a congressman, Radel was known for his heavy presence on Twitter, as well as his love of hip-hop artists, including Public Enemy and NWA. He once reviewed an album by rapper Jay-Z on Twitter during a flight to Washington.
