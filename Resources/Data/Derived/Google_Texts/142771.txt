Hopefully this won’t photon torpedo the guy’s reputation too much.

David Waddell, a town councilman from Indian Trail, N.C., and prospective third-party challenger to Sen. Kay Hagan, tendered a resignation letter to the town’s mayor this week written in the Klingon language of the “Star Trek” universe. Waddell said he included an English translation of the text via Bing.com with the original Klingon.

Teach (the) city (the) constitution

I will return next time to (witness) victory.

Resignation occurs in 2014 the 31st of January.

Perhaps today is a good day (to) resign.

The last line is a play on the phrase “Perhaps today is a good day to die,” which was uttered in one of the series’ movies, and possibly at a Deaton Halloween party sometime in the 1990s when Chris and his best friend dressed up as a couple of the show’s characters. Photographic evidence exists in a drawer somewhere and will not be featured in a #TBT coming to a social media feed near you.

A copy of the Klingon text is available at the Charlotte Observer, which also quoted Indian Trail Mayor Michael Alvarez as not being

too amused by the stunt.

“It’s an embarrassment for Indian Trail, and it’s an embarrassment for North Carolina,” he said.

Waddell said that part of his motivation for resigning the seat was so he could focus more time on his planned write-in campaign on the

Constitution Party ticket against Hagan, a first-term Democrat who has come under criticism for her support of Obamacare. He could not be reached for further comment at time of publication.

Scotty is busy repairing the universal translator, anyway.
