Bischoff\n\nColumbus Bureau\n\nRepublican presidential hopefuls played to a hard line conservative crowd at the Americans for Prosperity conference on Saturday, promising that when they\u2019re in the White House they\u2019ll repeal Obamacare, rip up the Iranian nuclear deal, rebuild the military and restore the U.S. economy.\n\nThey each advocated for lower taxes, fewer regulations and a smaller federal government \u2014 right in line with AFP\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cThe policies that we follow in this country are outdated. And they\u2019re particularly troublesome when you follow the path of big government and more regulations and taxation. Because that has never worked. It is a disaster in the 21st century,\u201d said U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. \u201cWe have to think globally now. There are dozens of other countries that learned from our example and so now they have limited government, they have lower taxes, they have less regulations. So every day we see American jobs and companies go abroad. We\u2019re no longer globally competitive.\u201d\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, a conservative political organization founded by billionaire business brothers David and Charles Koch, advocates against minimum wage hikes, union rights, global warming regulations, the Affordable Care Act, taxes and more.\n\nThe convention drew 3,600 activists and five Republican presidential hopefuls over two days: former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Rubio.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, who expanded Medicaid under Obamacare and supports Common Core education standards, did not get an invite despite the event being in Columbus.\n\nThe five candidates railed against expanded Medicaid, Common Core and more and brandished their credentials as true conservatives.\n\nPerry, who was among three candidates speaking on Saturday, criticized governors \u2014 including Kasich \u2014 who took federal Medicaid expansion money, saying they were turning a blind eye to the fact America is $18 trillion in debt.\n\nThe politicos delivered plenty of red meat applause lines.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz promised that on his first day as president he would abolish the IRS, investigate Planned Parenthood, rescind President Obama\u2019s executive orders and tear up the Iran nuclear deal. He also rallied the crowd by saying he\u2019d make sure military service members can bear arms.\n\n\u201cThe next time a jihadist shows up at a recruiting station in Chattanooga, Tenn., he\u2019s going to meet the business end of firearms wielded by marines,\u201d Cruz said to frenzied applause and cheers.\n\nPerry pitched himself as a Washington outsider who works for Main Street, not lobbyists and special interests on K Street in D.C.\n\n\u201cI have not worked one day in Washington. I am not invested in that crony culture,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd there was plenty of talk about securing the southern border.\n\nPerry said: \u201cSome candidates, they want to talk a good game on border security and offer simplistic solutions, like let\u2019s build a wall. But let me be clear a wall is only as secure as it is enforced by manpower. To keep the border secure, it takes boots on the ground from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville.\u201d\n\nU.S. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Cincinnati, batted clean up at the convention, speaking Saturday about how the road to the White House and possibly the U.S. Senate runs through the Buckeye State.\n\nPortman is being challenged next year by former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland. This month, Americans for Prosperity launched $1.4 million worth of attack ads aimed at Strickland.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
