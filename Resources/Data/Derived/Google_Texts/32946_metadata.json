They said \u201cVOTE YES ON ONE\u201d across the top and \u201cMarriage = 1 Man + 1 Woman\u201d across the bottom. In the middle was a stick-figure family holding hands.\n\nI groaned.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Tennessee state legislature has kept itself busy over the last decade producing mountains of wholly unnecessary legislation designed to protect what it considers to be Tennessee\u2019s most threatened demographic: white evangelical Christians. One proposed bill would have made practicing Islam a felony, punishable by fifteen years in prison. Another sought to ban middle school teachers from even mentioning gay relationships to their students. House Bill 368 (signed into law in 2012) encourages teachers in public schools to \u201cpresent the scientific weaknesses\u201d of evolution and climate change. In 2013, panicked rumors among legislators that renovations to the capitol building included the installation of a \u201cMuslim foot bath\u201d were assuaged when it was revealed that the fixture in question was, in fact, a mop sink.\n\nThat particular summer, Tennessee lawmakers were busy amending the state constitution to include a ban on same-sex marriage. Churches and conservative organizations across the state had organized a campaign to remind voters that if they wanted to say no to gay marriage they needed to vote yes on proposition one and the Tennessee Marriage Protection Amendment. Nearly every church in town boasted several signs on their lawns, and now ours did too.\n\n\u201cWe might as well hang a banner over the door that says \u2018No Gay People Allowed,\u2019\u201d I muttered.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a lot of gay friends at the time. I hadn\u2019t met Andrew or my friends Justin, Jeffry, Matthew, and Kimberly. I hadn\u2019t yet reconnected with those high school classmates who, before they came out, got as far away from Rhea County as they could. I wasn\u2019t even sure what I thought about same-sex relationships at that point in my life, but I had no intention of voting yes on prop one because I didn\u2019t see why my religious concerns should have any bearing on whether my fellow citizens enjoyed the same rights and privileges as I did under the law. When you grow up just a few miles from 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, and when you move to a town situated on the old Trail of Tears where a man was once prosecuted and fined for teaching evolution, you get a little sensitive about constitutional amendments designed to restrict rights rather than protect them. Sure, the Tennessee Marriage Protection Amendment sounded like a good idea to a lot of folks at the time, but how would it sound in twenty-five, fifty, or a hundred years? I just wasn\u2019t convinced we had this one right.\n\nOf greater concern to me was the way these signs were sprouting up like weeds in every church lawn in the county. If Christians in East Tennessee wanted to send the message that gay and lesbian people would be uncomfortable and unwelcome in our churches, that their identity would be reduced to their sexual orientation and their personhood to a political threat, then we\u2019d sure done a bang-up job of communicating it. We\u2019d surrounded our churches with a bunch of stick-figured families who, with linked arms and vacuous smiles, guarded our houses of worship like centurions. If you wanted to get through, you had to know your place in the chain. You had to assimilate.\n\nDuring the announcements, a man I didn\u2019t recognize invited us to attend a meeting that night to discuss the \u201cradical homosexual agenda in America and how Christians should respond to it.\u201d He spat out the word homosexual the same way others spat out the words liberal, feminist, and evolutionist, and it occurred to me in that moment that maybe I wasn\u2019t the only one who brought an uninvited guest to church on Sunday morning. In a congregation that large, there was a good chance the very people this man considered a threat to our way of life weren\u2019t out there, but rather in here\u2014perhaps visiting with family, perhaps squirming uncomfortably with the youth group in the back, perhaps singing with the worship band up front. How lonely they must feel, how paralyzed. Sitting there with my Bible in my hands, twisting its silk bookmark nervously between my fingers, I realized that just as I sat in church with my doubt, there were those sitting in church with their sexuality, their race, their gender, their depression, their addiction, their questions, their fears, their past, their infertility, their eating disorder, their diagnosis, their missed rent, their mess of a marriage, their sins, their shame\u2014all the things that follow us to church on Sunday morning but we dare not name.\n\nThe words from Anne Sexton\u2019s poem \u201cProtestant Easter\u201d floated into my brain:\n\nJesus was on that Cross.\n\nAfter that they pounded nails into his hands.\n\nAfter that, well, after that,\n\neveryone wore hats . . .\n\nAnd smiles. And masks. And brave fronts.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop going to church after the Vote Yes On One campaign, but I stopped being present. I was too scared to speak up in support of LGBT people, so I ignored my conscience and let it go. I played my role as the good Christian girl and spared everyone the drama of an argument. But that decision\u2014to remain silent\u2014split me in two. It convinced me that I could never really be myself in church, that I had to check my heart and mind at the door. I regret that decision for a lot of reasons, but most of all because sometimes I think I would have gotten a fair hearing. Sometimes I think my church would have loved me through that disagreement if I\u2019d only been bold enough to ask them to. Like a difficult marriage, my relationship with church buckled under the weight of years of silent assumptions. So I checked out\u2014first in spirit, then in body. When our closest friends from Sunday night moved to California, our interest in the social events began to dwindle. After a few months, Dan and I began sleeping in on Sunday mornings.\n\n* * *\n\nSeven years after the \u201cVote Yes On One\u201d campaign sent me fleeing from the church, I discovered church again in an unlikely place: the Gay Christian Network\u2019s annual \u201cLive It Out\u201d conference in Chicago.\n\nFounded by Justin Lee, a young gay man who grew up Southern Baptist and survived the destructive effects of \u201cex-gay ministries\u201d to eventually accept and embrace his sexuality, the Gay Christian Network offers community and support to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Christians, along with their friends, family, and allies. The group is ecumenical, but attracts a lot of evangelicals, many of whom have been marginalized or kicked out of the churches in which they grew up. Some of the more than seven hundred attendees believed Scripture compelled them to commit their lives to celibacy while others believed Scripture granted them the freedom to pursue same-sex relationships and marriage. There was room at the table for all.\n\nI spoke at the conference as an ally, but within hours of arriving at the Westin on the Chicago River, it became clear I had little to teach these brothers and sisters in Christ and everything to learn from them. I speak at dozens of Christian conferences in a given year, but I\u2019ve never participated in one so energized by the Spirit, so devoid of empty showmanship, so grounded in love and abounding in grace. As one attendee put it, \u201cthis is an unapologetically Christian conference.\u201d\n\nIndeed it was. There was communion, confession, worship, and fellowship. There was deep concern for honoring Scripture and loving as Christ would love, even through differences and pain. There was lots of hugging and crying and praying . . . and argyle.\n\nBut what startled me the most was the degree to which so many attendees had suffered, sometimes brutally, at the hands of Christians trying to \u201ccure\u201d them of their sexual orientation. One young woman described undergoing an exorcism ceremony designed to cast the demon of lesbianism from her body. Another went to counseling where her Christian therapist insisted she must have been molested or mistreated by her parents when she hadn\u2019t. One man followed the advice of his pastor and married a woman, hoping heterosexual sex would make him straight, a decision that led to heartbreaking consequences. Many at the conference had gone through evangelical ex-gay ministries, the largest of which had recently shut its doors when its president admitted that reparative therapy to change sexual orientation is rarely, if ever, effective. Person after person told stories about getting kicked out of their church or their family upon coming out. (Of the estimated 1.6 million homeless American youth, between 20 and 40 percent identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.) Far too many described contemplating suicide as teenagers after begging God to \u201cfix\u201d them to no avail.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The campaign against marriage equality sent me fleeing from the church.
