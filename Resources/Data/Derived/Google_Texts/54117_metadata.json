Should Congress be able to ban films? Should Congress be able to ban groups such as the NAACP, the National Rifle Association and the Sierra Club from speaking?\n\nThe answer to all three questions should, unequivocally, be \u201cno.\u201d But, sadly, 46 Democrats in the U.S. Senate are supporting a constitutional amendment to repeal the free-speech provisions of the First Amendment and give Congress carte blanche power to regulate political speech.\n\nIt\u2019s all because a group of conservative filmmakers made a documentary film in 2008 about then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that did not speak favorably about her record. Forty-four Senate Democrats are now supporting a constitutional amendment from Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico to stop Americans from showing movies like the one Citizens United created during the 2008 election.\n\nForty-six Senate Democrats are willing to rewrite the Constitution to take away the right of Americans to speak or create art that is critical of politicians.\n\nForty-six Senate Democrats are actively working to silence political criticism ahead of the next presidential election.\n\nThey are the \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d Democrats.\n\nNever before has Congress tampered with the First Amendment.\n\nWhen a similar proposal was considered in 1997, the famed liberal lion of the Senate, Ted Kennedy, reminded his colleagues that never before had the Bill of Rights been amended and \u201cnow is no time to start.\u201d\n\nI agree with Ted Kennedy. Where are the Democrats who agree with him today? Not a single one has spoken out against this. Groupthink has taken over their party.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, however, has sounded the alarm. The ACLU says the Democrats\u2019 amendment would \u201cseverely limit the First Amendment and lead directly to government censorship of political speech.\u201d\n\nFloyd Abrams, perhaps the leading First Amendment litigator in the country and an outspoken Democrat, has, as well. He said the amendment \u201cwould limit speech that is at the heart of our First Amendment.\u201d\n\nSenate Democrats would like to pretend they could draw the line between what they think is \u201creasonable\u201d political speech and \u201cunreasonable\u201d political speech. To hear the Democrats tell it, all they want to do is stop \u201ccorporate influences\u201d from unfairly influencing the political debate.\n\nHowever, The New York Times is a corporation. Should they stop penning editorials? NBC is a corporation. Should it quit airing \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d?\n\nAfter all, wasn\u2019t Tina Fey influencing voters when she took on an Alaskan accent and declared \u201cI can see Russia from my house\u201d \u2014 something Sarah Palin never even said?\n\nDidn\u2019t Will Ferrell\u2019s hilarious portrayals of President George W. Bush as childlike and confused change public opinion of our 43rd president? Wasn\u2019t Seth Green swaying voters when he impersonated Vice President Al Gore as a dry, droning bore? Wasn\u2019t Darrell Hammond enforcing a certain kind of perception of Bill Clinton when he presented the president as a lusty, smirking cad?\n\nThe answer is yes, yes, yes and yes. That\u2019s what free speech gives Americans the power to do \u2014 mock, provoke, challenge and persuade. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has a constitutional right to do so, but the Democrats\u2019 amendment would allow Congress to ban the show.\n\nThe hard-line liberal partisans who want to rewrite the Constitution to give their party a political advantage certainly do not have the same interests in mind as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton.\n\nWe should keep our faith in the Bill of Rights, rather than in politicians intent on preserving their power.\n\nThere will always be political speakers who someone disagrees with. Democrats should be free to disagree with films made by Citizens United, just as many Republicans disagree with films made by Mr. Gore and Michael Moore.\n\nThat\u2019s a sign of a healthy and vibrant society. Banning films is not.\n\nIn Ray Bradbury\u2019s novel \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d \u2014 the temperature at which \u2018book paper\u2019 auto-ignites \u2014 Capt. Beatty, who is the chief book burner, said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want a man unhappy politically, don\u2019t give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none.\u201d\n\nThat same sentiment was expressed by the Obama administration, which told the Supreme Court in Citizens United that, in its view, Congress could ban books.\n\nWhen Justice Anthony Kennedy asked the Department of Justice if the Obama administration was truly arguing that, according to the Constitution, book sales could be prohibited, the Justice official replied, yes, \u201cif the book contained the functional equivalent of express advocacy.\u201d\n\nThat was a shocking exchange. The government made an unabashed argument for the government being able to stop a book from being sold.\n\nAs the ACLU observed, under the Democrats\u2019 proposed amendment, Congress could ban Mrs. Clinton\u2019s new book, \u201cHard Choices.\u201d\n\nIt could ban anti-Hillary movies and pro-Hillary books alike. What then would become of our political debates? We would have only that which Congress would allow.\n\nThe Democrats, by working to shut down political speech, want to eliminate different sides of our most important questions, just as Capt. Beatty said.\n\nSoon, Senate Democrats will hold their vote on a constitutional amendment to repeal our free-speech protections.\n\nThey are playing with fire. \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d is coming to life, and tragically, the Democrats are playing the role of the firemen who want to burn our books and silence the citizenry.\n\nTed Cruz is a Republican member of the U.S. Senate from Texas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I have three questions for my Democratic colleagues in the Senate: Should Congress be able to ban books?
