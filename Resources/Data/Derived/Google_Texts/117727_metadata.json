There Is Good News, if Republican Leaders Are Teachable\n\n\u201cA fondness for power is implanted, in most men, and it is natural to abuse it, when acquired.\u201d \u2013Alexander Hamilton (1775)\n\nPrior to the 2014 midterm election, I wrote a column titled, \u201cGOP Senate Majority \u2013 Then What?\u201d\n\nLast week, the substantial Senate and historic House majorities elected in the November \u201cRepublican wave\u201d stood to take the solemn oath \u201cto Support and Defend\u201d our Constitution.\n\nSo, what now?\n\nThe Republican majorities in Congress have the potential to stop the Obama regime in its tracks, particularly since those majorities are bolstered by the highest number of conservative Republicans (a.k.a. us wacky constitutional constructionists) ever. The first wave of the so-called \u201cTea Party\u201d conservatives arrived in 2010, and the second wave has landed.\n\nAnd as you recall, in less noted but equally promising news, Republicans once again decimated Democrats in gubernatorial and statehouse elections across the nation. This was a wide and deep victory for Republicans, and particularly conservatives.\n\nBut it\u2019s going to take more than the GOP\u2019s revitalized turnout machine to overcome Obama. It\u2019s going to take both resolute leadership and a fearless message of conservative principles. Indeed, the hard and necessary work in the months ahead will be to set the stage for 2016 and beyond.\n\nBut with sizeable majorities in the House and Senate, what\u2019s the problem?\n\nHere\u2019s a hint: It\u2019s not the Democrats.\n\nThe most significant threat to the Grand Old Party inside the Beltway, and across the nation, is \u2026 drum roll please \u2026 the GOP itself, which has proven time and again to be its own worst enemy. The tendency of power-drunk \u201cestablishment Republicans\u201d to depart from the GOP platform, and thus foment fratricidal infighting with the growing number of conservative Republicans who actually abide by their oaths and stand on principle, is a sure formula for self-destruction.\n\nDemocrats are not the problem.\n\nConsider, if you will, the most important lesson of the 2014 election.\n\nIn 1992, Bill Clinton defeated George H.W. Bush, who had squandered the Reagan legacy and broke his famous \u201cRead my lips, no new taxes\u201d promise.\n\nIn 1994, Clinton suffered a huge midterm election defeat led by Newt Gingrich and conservative Republicans across the country. The grassroots GOP groundswell took control of the House for the first time since 1952 with a net gain of 54 seats, and likewise the Senate with a gain of eight seats.\n\nClinton responded, \u201cThe president is still relevant,\u201d and, indeed, he was relevant enough to win re-election two short years later when Republicans fielded yet another establishment type, former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, in a top-down campaign that failed to invigorate grassroots conservatives. House Republicans would have done better in 1998, too, but for the necessary perjury impeachment effort against Clinton after that \u201cchampion of women\u2019s rights\u201d imposed himself upon a young intern.\n\nIn 2000, George W. Bush won the presidency despite a few dangling chads and not receiving a majority of the popular vote, but he failed to inspire any sizeable grassroots support in the years that followed. He did win re-election in 2004, when the Democrats fielded a flawed establishment candidate of their own, John Kerry.\n\nIn 2006, Democrats re-took the House and Senate by rallying their antiwar grassroots base.\n\nIn 2008, Republicans lost the presidency and suffered additional legislative branch losses after fielding yet another establishment moderate presidential candidate, John McCain, who lacked even an iota of charismatic appeal and failed to inspire grassroots conservatives. The Democrats, for their part, swept to victory by fielding an appallingly unqualified candidate whose charisma and communicative skills captivated the party\u2019s \u201cprogressive\u201d base.\n\nIn 2010, Republicans enjoyed massive midterm gains in elections that were driven by a historic uprising of grassroots \u201cTea Party\u201d conservatives. Republicans gain 63 House seats, 6 Senate seats, 6 governorships and a whopping 680 state legislative seats \u2013 more state legislatures than at any time since 1928. But, regrettably, establishment Republican leaders in the House excluded the new conservatives from leadership positions.\n\nBut in 2012, that momentum was sidelined by fratricidal infighting between Tea Party activists and \u201cestablishment\u201d Republicans in 2012, and consequently Republicans suffered 8 House and 2 Senate seat losses. But most notably, Mitt Romney was labeled \u201cestablishment\u201d and he failed to connect with grassroots conservatives. That allowed Obama to dupe voters into electing him for a second term by a very narrow margin.\n\nHowever in 2014, Republicans again decimated Democrats in not only House and Senate races but notably in gubernatorial and statehouse elections across the nation. This was a broad and deep win for Republicans and particularly conservatives, moving the political needle back towards Liberty! After the smoke cleared, Republican had historic gains both in federal and state elections. They picked up 9 Senate seats for a total of 54, retaking the majority, and gained 14 additional House seats, increasing their majority there to 247. They added two more Republican Governors, brining that total to 31 and picked up 11 more legislative chambers for a total of 68. As was the case in 2010, Republicans again won historic midterm gains, especially in statewide elections that were driven by fresh, conservative grassroots candidates such as Iowa\u2019s Joni Ernst, Nebraska\u2019s Ben Sasse and Arkansas' Tom Cotton.\n\nCan you detect a pattern here?\n\nWhen statewide and national elections are powered by conservative grassroots enthusiasm, Republicans win. When they are powered by top-down campaigns featuring moderate presidential candidates, Republicans lose.\n\nSo, is there a case study on a national election being powered by a conservative presidential candidate who inspired grassroots conservatives when Republicans won? Well, yes. That would be the Ronald Reagan model, which led to victory in 1980 and a historic landslide re-election in 1984.\n\nWill the GOP learn something from this pattern ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign and adopt the Reagan model? Or will they continue to validate the old adage, \u201cInsanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results\u201d?\n\nThe line between conservatives and leftists has never been more defined, and conservatives have a winning message because they articulate two core Liberty principles that moderate Republicans can\u2019t seem to grasp.\n\nFirst, they understand that Liberty is colorblind, not a \u201cwhite thing\u201d; and second, that Liberty is eternal, not transient.\n\nAgain, when candidates articulate these principles, they win. And when grassroots voters hand the GOP control of federal and state government, they expect leaders to articulate, first and foremost, the fundamental principles of Essential Liberty, and to follow through on campaign promises such as undoing ObamaCare.\n\nThe GOP establishment is learning, but it has a long way to go, both at the state and national level.\n\nThe contest between constitutional conservatives and GOP establishment types in our nation\u2019s capital is a source of much fanfare in the liberal media, which trumpets such disunity knowing that to divide is to conquer \u2013 a concept the GOP has yet to fully embrace.\n\nIndeed, this week there is a significant development in the House that is a direct result of the GOP establishment\u2019s failure to stand on principle. A mass exodus is underway as conservative Republicans abandon the Republican Study Committee, which, a few years back when House Republicans were in the minority, was home to some 100 genuine conservatives. The RSC has since been defanged by an establishment moderate \u201cget-along\u201d Republican, House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nAnd there are similar GOP shenanigans undermining Republican majorities at the state level.\n\nIn Tennessee, my colleague, former state GOP chairperson Robin Smith, set our state on a steady course to the top of the conservative pack. As a result, our moderate-to-conservative Republican governor must now work with a state house that has a conservative Republican super-majority and state senate with a firmly conservative Republican majority. In addition, our national congressional delegation is composed of two Republican senators, and seven of our nine house seats are Republican.\n\nRobin\u2019s formula? Grow the party by avoiding infighting, and promote the GOP\u2019s winning platform principles. Let the party focus on candidates and let candidates focus on a winning governing agenda.\n\nThe net result? Our state economy is rapidly recovering despite Obama\u2019s failed economic policies. We are fourth in the nation in job creation, a \u201cright to work\u201d state with an economy driven by entrepreneurial ingenuity and hard work, and largely unfettered by state government interference and regulation. We have the lowest debt ratio of any state in the nation, even though we have no regular income tax.\n\nDespite that success, there is trouble on the horizon, as our governor\u2019s wealthy political cronies have created PACs to favor moderate Republicans over strong conservative Republicans, and to exile conservatives from the state GOP Executive Committee. (Shades of Carl Rove\u2019s PAC against congressional conservatives.)\n\nBut there is a tenet that will both build existing majorities in Congress and the states, and ensure Republican victory in the next presidential election. It is a winning dictum as demonstrated twice by Ronald Reagan.\n\nIn his 1990 autobiography, \u201cAn American Life,\u201d President Reagan explained this tenet, which he learned during his first campaign for the California governorship: \u201cThe personal attacks against me during the primary finally became so heavy that the state Republican chairman, Gaylord Parkinson, postulated what he called the Eleventh Commandment: Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican. It\u2019s a rule I followed during that campaign and have ever since.\u201d\n\nA fearless message of conservative principles, which will energize grassroots Americans, along with adherence to the Eleventh Commandment is a winning combination, whether in office or running for one. Unity is essential for success.\n\nIn 500 BC, Sun Tzu wrote in his timeless treatise, \u201cThe Art of War,\u201d \u201cYou will not succeed unless your men have tenacity and unity of purpose, and, above all, a spirit of sympathetic cooperation.\u201d That is summarized in the current U.S. Army Field Manual 100-5 on Operations: \u201cFor every objective, seek unity of command and unity of effort.\u201d\n\nRepublican Party Chairman Reince Preibus, who distributed our Essential Liberty Declaration and Constitution Guides to every attendee at the last Republican National Convention, has made some progress toward party unity, which we saw in the 2014 midterm.\n\nBut the current leadership in the House and Senate are slow learners.\n\nPerhaps they\u2019ll take a cue from 20th-century philosopher George Santayana, who wrote, \u201cWhen experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d Or as Aldous Huxley put it, \u201cThat men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of history.\u201d Or, as esteemed philosopher Forrest Gump observed, \u201cStupid is as stupid does.\u201d\n\nIn contemporary parlance: There is nothing to be learned from the second kick of a jackass \u2013 or in the case of too many GOP politicos today, the third, fourth or fifth, ad infinitum.\n\nSo here is a project I\u2019ll be discussing with several leading conservative organizations in the coming weeks:\n\nRepublican candidates are asked to sign all sorts of pledges \u2013 no-tax pledges, Second Amendment pledges, ObamaCare repeal pledges, etc. How about a pledge to abide by Reagan\u2019s 11th Commandment rather than spend millions on fratricidal attacks? And how about Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney sign first? Of course, it would take candidates of Reagan\u2019s character and humility to abide by such restraints.\n\nPro Deo et Constitutione \u2013 Libertas aut Mors\n\nSemper Fortis Vigilate Paratus et Fidelis", "article_metadata": {"description": "There Is Good News, if Republican Leaders Are Teachable", "csrf-token": "MVjG0eJp49/rPugbDV+Fkf3ayxjNAJo2tg+4bKLUzYc=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "&ldquo;A fondness for power is implanted, in most men, and it is natural to abuse it, when acquired.&rdquo; &ndash;Alexander Hamilton (1775)     Prior to the 2014 midterm election, I wrote a column titled, &ldquo;GOP Senate Majority &ndash; Then What?&rdquo;  Last week, the substantial Senate...", "title": "GOP Majorities \u2014 Now What?", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/alexander/32369", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2015-01-14-4ade13f1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe42c5\"", "article_summary": "The GOP establishment is learning, but it has a long way to go, both at the state and national level.\nIn 1994, Clinton suffered a huge midterm election defeat led by Newt Gingrich and conservative Republicans across the country.\nThe Republican majorities in Congress have the potential to stop the Obama regime in its tracks, particularly since those majorities are bolstered by the highest number of conservative Republicans (a.k.a.\nAs a result, our moderate-to-conservative Republican governor must now work with a state house that has a conservative Republican super-majority and state senate with a firmly conservative Republican majority.\nIn Tennessee, my colleague, former state GOP chairperson Robin Smith, set our state on a steady course to the top of the conservative pack."}
