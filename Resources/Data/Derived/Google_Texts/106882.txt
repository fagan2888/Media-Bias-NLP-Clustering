CHARLESTON, S.C. — Donald Trump mocked his conservative critics who say he isn’t a real man of the Right at a North Charleston rally Friday night.

“You’ve probably heard from these not really smart people, ‘Donald Trump is not a conservative. He’s not a conservative!” Trump said in his impersonation of a Donald-hating conservative pundit. “I’m very conservative.”

He then went on to list the issues on which he’s claims he’s more conservative than his Republican opponents.

“I’m the most conservative person in the world on the border.”

“I’m the most conservative person in the world in respect to getting rid of common core.”

“I’m the most conservative person in the world with getting rid of Obamacare.”

“I’m the most conservative person in the world having to do with our military and rebuilding our military and taking care of our vets.”

He then took parting shots at the pundits and fellow candidates who challenge his conservative bona fides.

“What stiffs! Many of these guys if they were in private industry they wouldn’t be able to get a job,” Trump said.

Numerous conservative pundits haves served as The Donald’s most vocal opponents this election season and the influential publication National Review even dedicated an entire issue to articulating how Trump is a threat to conservatism. (RELATED: Twilight Of The Conservatives?)

Oddly enough, in spite of Trump’s claim he’s the most conservative on the border, some anti-Trump conservatives have tried to argue his hard stances on illegal immigration are not conservative.

Rival candidate Ted Cruz has been adamant in recent attack ads and speeches that Trump is a phony conservative who’s flip-flopped on several issues over the course of his long life.
