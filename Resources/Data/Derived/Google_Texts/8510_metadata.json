Tom Price intends to tackle big-ticket entitlement programs as the new chairman of the House Budget Committee \u2014 including Social Security.\n\nIn a speech at the Heritage Action for America \u201cConservative Policy Summit\u201d on Monday, Price said he was excited to work with a GOP-led Senate to end the \u201cmuddled mess\u201d of the last few years.\n\nUnder his predecessor, Paul Ryan, the House Budget included controversial changes to Medicare and Medicaid, but did not touch Social Security. Price hopes to change that this year:\n\n\u201cOn the issue of Social Security, it has indeed been the third rail as Tim [Chapman, COO for Heritage Action] mentioned, and what I\u2019m hopeful is what the Budget Committee will be able do is to is begin to normalize the discussion and debate about Social Security. This is a program that right now on its current course will not be able to provide 75 or 80 percent of the benefits that individuals have paid into in a relatively short period of time. That\u2019s not a responsible position to say, \u2018You don\u2019t need to do anything to do it.\u2019 \u201cSo all the kinds of things you know about \u2013 whether it\u2019s means testing, whether it\u2019s increasing the age of eligibility. The kind of choices \u2014 whether it\u2019s providing much greater choices for individuals to voluntarily select the kind of manner in which they believe they ought to be able to invest their working dollars as they go through their lifetime. All those things ought to be on the table and discussed.\u201d\n\nPrice consistently framed entitlement changes as Republican desires to \u201csave, secure and strengthen\u201d the programs, given their rising costs that are a big driver of future deficit projections. Price pointed out that the Social Security disability program is scheduled to run out of cash next year.\n\nHe said Republicans should not fear the politics of such changes \u2014 pointing out that the Romney-Ryan ticket won seniors in 2012, despite Democrats\u2019 \u201cMediscare\u201d tactics around the Ryan proposal for a voucher-like premium support program for Medicare.\n\nPrice also pressed the case for a full replacement bill for Obamacare. His own bill has gone nowhere in the past few years, as Republicans were unable to reach a consensus on a health care plan.\n\nPrice said there is some urgency here: If the Supreme Court in June rules that the administration can\u2019t hand out subsidies to states that do not have their own health insurance exchanges, \u201cthat unravels Obamacare rather quickly. That\u2019s a good thing. But it\u2019s not a good thing to not have any replacement.\u201d\n\nPrice also sought to temper expectations of huge conservative victories. Budget reconciliation \u2014 a process to avoid a filibuster in the Senate \u2014 is not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d Price said, implying that it might not be the tool to repeal Obamacare.\n\nHe also talked about how the debt ceiling \u201cprovides focus on this issue,\u201d but did not talk of an epic clash around the deadline, expected sometime this summer.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/01/12/tom-price-hopes-to-reform-social-security-in-house-budget/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/061212congresstravel_1.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Roswell Republican U.S. Rep.
