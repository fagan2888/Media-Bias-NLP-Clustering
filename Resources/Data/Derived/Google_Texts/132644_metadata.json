The petition denounced the Bush administration Department of Justice\u2019s \u201cerroneous and dangerous\u201d 2007 argument allowing such discrimination. Ninety such groups sent a similar protest to then-Attorney General Eric Holder last year.\n\nThis is an important church-state issue that has entangled the Salvation Army, among others, in local situations, and a change in federal policy would certainly be news. Such petitions are a routine feature of interest group maneuvers in Washington, but this particular one gives reporters an up-to-date roadmap of America\u2019s \u201cculture wars.\u201d Like so:\n\nThe petition signers\u2019 unnamed opponent is Evangelical Protestantism. The DOJ\u2019s 2007 legal blessing responded to complaints about a $1.5 million federal grant to World Vision for mentoring, tutoring, and job training with \u201cat-risk\u201d youths. Like many evangelical organizations, World Vision famously hires staff members who agree with its religious beliefs and values, including traditional heterosexual marriage.\n\nThe endorsers have been regular antagonists of Evangelicalism and also of Catholicism on a variety of issues. Along with many small or obscure masthead organizations the list features well-known advocates for gay, bisexual, and transgender rights (Human Rights Campaign, Lambda Legal), abortion rights (Planned Parenthood, NARAL), public employee and teachers\u2019 unions (AFSCME, AFT, NEA), the women\u2019s movement (American Association of University Women, NOW, YWCA), sex education (SIECUS) and various liberal causes (ACLU, NAACP, Southern Poverty Law Center).\n\nInvolvement of the major Jewish \u201ccommunal\u201d (as distinct from religious) organizations perpetuates their longstanding efforts against job discrimination (American Jewish Committee, Anti-Defamation League, B\u2019nai B\u2019rith, Hadassah, National Council of Jewish Women), joined here by related interest groups of African-Americans, Arabs, Asians, Hindus, Latinos and Sikhs. Muslim Advocates and Muslims for Progressive Values endorse the appeal, but none of the major Islamic organizations.\n\nPredictably, there\u2019s good representation from entities hostile to organized religion like American Atheists, American Humanist Association, Center for Inquiry, Military Association of Atheists & Freethinkers, Secular Coalition for America and Secular Policy Institute, though the Freedom from Religion Foundation is absent from this round.\n\nThen there are those who don\u2019t work against religion but against the \u201creligious right,\u201d including Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, Interfaith Alliance and People for the American Way.\n\nThat brings us to the religious denominations that oppose such religiously-based hiring. Again, Jewish participation is predictable and we find the national apparatus of Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism\u2019s Rabbinical Assembly (but for some reason not its United Synagogue). Equally predictable is the non-involvement of Orthodox Judaism, which rarely unites with the faith\u2019s more liberal branches on socio-political matters. The Unitarian Universalist Association is the only other religious denomination backing this petition.\n\nThe Friends Committee on National Legislation signs on (but not the Friends\u2019 religious denominations) and there\u2019s a complicated situation in \u201cmainline\u201d and liberal Protestant churches. National agencies of American Baptist Churches, United Church of Christ and United Methodist Church join the protest, but not these three denominations as such. However, the U.C.C. and the Episcopal Church are affiliated in turn with one of the endorsers, the pro-abortion rights Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice.\n\nThen there are independent caucuses within denominations such as DignityUSA (for gay Catholics), the Disciples Justice Action Network and Methodist Federation for Social Action. We find none of the black church denominations on the petition, only independent groups like African American Ministers in Action.\n\nUpshot: On many \u201csocial issues\u201d like this, a sizable and highly disparate movement of activists with some -- but somewhat thin -- religious backing is aligned against a large, and probably larger, body of religious traditionalists.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On August 20, what was billed as an \u201cunprecedented\u201d alliance of 130 \r\nnational organizations wrote President Barack Obama asking an end to \r\nfederal grants for \u00a0religious social-service agencies that hire only \r\nemployees who share their beliefs.
