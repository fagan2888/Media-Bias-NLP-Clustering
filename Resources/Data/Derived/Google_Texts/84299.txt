America, it turns out, really runs on empty. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported a third of Americans get fewer than the recommended seven hours of sleep per night, and up to 70 million Americans suffer from sleep or wakefulness disorders, like insomnia and sleep apnea.

Insufficient sleep, according to the NIH, is associated with a growing number of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and high blood pressure. Though it doesn’t take a scientist to inform us how poor a person can feel when they don't get enough shut-eye.

To the rescue: AsapSCIENCE, an educational YouTube channel that makes science accessible to any and everybody. Their most recent topic, as you might've guessed, is sleep. Founders Mitchell Moffit and Gregory Brown worked together to round up eight surprising hacks people can use to boost sleep quality and energy.

For example, taking power naps (20 to 30 minutes) a few times a week helps you feel rested and cuts your risk for heart disease by 37 percent. Caffeine intake after a certain point only disrupts the dreaming and rapid eye movement (REM) stages of a person's sleep cycle later on, and the light emanating from your pre-bed Twitter scroll is tricking your brain into thinking it’s awake.

Watch the video below for the complete list of hacks and see if you can't get better sleep ASAP (see what we did there?).
