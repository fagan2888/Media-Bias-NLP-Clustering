DUBLIN, Sept. 25, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "The United States Market for In Vitro Diagnostic Tests" report to their offering.

The United States is the world's largest in vitro diagnostics and nearly half of the global IVD market. While companies seek emerging markets for growth, most healthcare business is generated in the United States and its volume is still a strong advantage of this market. Most recently the U.S. IVD market weathered interrupted lab and healthcare sector investment in anticipation of the Affordable Care Act and several regulatory and austerity measures on the part of government payers that constricted payments for clinical testing.



In this report, The United States Market for In Vitro Diagnostic Tests, Kalorama Information analyst Emil Salazar takes a considered look into these trends and what they mean for diagnostic manufacturers and investors.



As the report notes, there are both challenging developments and postiive trends which make the United States a stable IVD market: The expansion of the insured population under the ACA; demographic aging that increases demand for clinical testing and a medical program that serves as a leading, stable vehicle for payment (Medicare); relatively optimistic macroeconomic indicators vis-Ã -vis the domestic outlook five years ago or other developed markets in the world; and continued product innovation and industry responsiveness to clients' needs in the world's largest IVD market.
