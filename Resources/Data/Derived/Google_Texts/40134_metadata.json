Since Grayson first burst onto the national media scene as a first-term congressman from Central Florida with a savage wit, he has generated near non-stop headlines and Internet hits, calling all manner of political opponents \u201c whores,\u201d \u201c vampires\u201d and \u201c knuckle-dragging Neanderthals.\u201d Even some Democrats who agree with almost all of his policy positions want to keep their distance.\n\nLately, Grayson hasn\u2019t been doing himself many favors. Last week, he exploded into an expletive-laden tirade after Tampa Bay Times reporter Adam C. Smith asked him about two Cayman Islands-based hedge funds the congressman had set up in 2011, while he was out of office. \u201cAre you some kind of shitting robot?\u201d Grayson asked Smith. \u201cYou go around shitting on people?\u201d He said he hadn\u2019t avoided any taxes, and refused to apologize for his language, downplaying his vocabulary as no different from Harry Truman\u2019s. Just this week, the messy details of Grayson\u2019s ongoing divorce yielded another choice sound bite from the congressman, who said of his estranged wife: \u201cGold diggers gotta dig.\u201d Vintage Alan Grayson: aggressive, off-the-cuff, untamed.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStill, antics aside, seasoned observers were not surprised when Grayson, 57, announced in February that he was considering a bid for the Senate seat being vacated by presidential hopeful Republican Marco Rubio. Grayson, after all, has spent the past three years subtly trying to clean himself up for a statewide race, tamping down some of the fire in one of the Democratic base\u2019s favorite firebrands and along the way staking out policy positions closer to the political center that most Floridians occupy. He\u2019s even earned praise for reaching across the aisle in a famously dysfunctional and partisan Congress.\n\nIn the six years I have been covering Grayson, in Central Florida and on Capitol Hill, in numerous one-on-one interviews and at campaign and constituent appearances, his outrage has always been sustained, he says, by \u201cthe tangible harms that come from the powerful exploiting the powerless.\u201d His tone, however, has been less consistent. After he shot into the national media arena in 2009, Grayson was unbowed, asking me, \u201cIs it a necessary element of this job that I take shit from people? No one gets a free pass if they attack me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s beneficial to turn the other cheek. There is no reason a Democrat has to be a weakling.\u201d Yet in his 2012 campaign\u2014admittedly not a tight race\u2014I noticed that his rhetoric seemed more restrained. Over a post-election brunch interview, I asked him whether he had intentionally ratcheted down his rhetoric. He brushed me off with a laugh, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I\u2019ve had a lobotomy.\u201d\n\nNow, Florida voters and national donors are beginning to wonder: Which Alan Grayson will show up in the coming months\u2014the hyperpartisan wild man who has become a hero to the left\u2019s populist base or the more pragmatic model of recent years who shows he can play well with others in the Republican-controlled House? And which Grayson, if any, do Floridians want?\n\nGrayson\u2019s chief competition this time around, ahead of the August 2016 primary, is Rep. Patrick Murphy of West Palm Beach, a well-financed former Republican who switched parties to run in 2012, narrowly defeating Tea Party favorite Allen West. In Congress, Murphy has supported Obamacare, but also the Keystone XL pipeline, earning him praise from the American Petroleum Institute. The favorite of the state\u2019s more conservative and middle-of-the-road Democrats, Murphy has drawn early support Wall Street donors, not to mention Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which endorsed him on May 4, calling him \u201cthe strongest candidate to win the Florida Senate race and flip this seat.\u201d\n\nStill, Grayson is certain he can win against Murphy in a base-left vs. centrist-establishment contest. \u201cI have the Hispanic vote. I have the black vote. I have the Jewish vote. I have the labor vote. I have the vote of liberals all around the state. These are the pillars of the Democratic Party,\u201d he insisted recently to a local Fox affiliate. If he hadn\u2019t run out of breath or air time, he could have included gays and seniors, activist constituencies he has also cultivated.\n\nTo boot, Grayson told me in a lengthy interview last week in Orlando that he has talked with populist champion Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s staff about strategy for the race. (\u201cWe talk to lots of people who want to hear about our 2012 campaign, and the advice is always the same\u2014run a grassroots campaign and stand up for what you believe,\u201d a Warren spokesperson said.) Grayson, who has not officially announced a Senate bid, told me with the breezy self-confidence many see as arrogance that he plans to \u201cwage an Elizabeth Warren-type campaign.\u201d Even though he expects the race to cost each candidate $5-10 million in the primary and another $25 million in the general election, Grayson, a multimillionaire, vowed he would depend on small contributions and \u201cenormous amounts of volunteers\u2014a people-powered campaign.\u201d\n\nThere is reason to believe the forthcoming U.S. Senate run, like all of his previous races, will be a lively one. But that means that at any moment, Grayson, with his a hair-trigger temper, could react to criticism like an amiable Dr. David Banner or by exploding into his alter ego, the Incredible Partisan Hulk, ripping and smashing at all who would thwart him, whether colleagues, opponents or the press.\n\nIf recent events are any guide, odds are it will be the green guy with the big muscles. After the DSCC\u2019s endorsement, Grayson followed up with an acrimonious phone call with the committee\u2019s chair, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, Politico reported. Grayson refused to confirm or deny reports about what happened in the interview or afterward. But in a statement, he shot back in classic style: \u201cFlorida Democratic voters choose our party nominee, not out-of-touch party bosses sipping cognac in a smoke-filled room in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\n***", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "The grand ambitions of Alan Grayson, Florida\u2019s expletive-spouting, headline-grabbing congressman.", "title": "\u2018No Reason a Democrat Has to Be a Weakling\u2019", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/05/alan-grayson-flordia-118148.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/05/20/150520_pinsky_grayson_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "The POLITICO Mag Profile,Marco Rubio,Florida,Alan Grayson", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "The grand ambitions of Alan Grayson, Florida\u2019s expletive-spouting, headline-grabbing congressman.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "There is no reason a Democrat has to be a weakling.\u201d Yet in his 2012 campaign\u2014admittedly not a tight race\u2014I noticed that his rhetoric seemed more restrained.\nThese are the pillars of the Democratic Party,\u201d he insisted recently to a local Fox affiliate.\nBut in a statement, he shot back in classic style: \u201cFlorida Democratic voters choose our party nominee, not out-of-touch party bosses sipping cognac in a smoke-filled room in Washington, D.C.\u201d***\nAlan Grayson is Elizabeth Warren without a filter\u2014but he intends with her help to become Florida\u2019s great Democratic hope.\nAfter the DSCC\u2019s endorsement, Grayson followed up with an acrimonious phone call with the committee\u2019s chair, Montana Sen.
