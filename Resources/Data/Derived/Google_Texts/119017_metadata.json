Some background:\n\nWhen a Michigan middle-school teacher was denied $10,000 in severance pay last month, the local teachers union filed a grievance against the school board on his behalf. Given the union\u2019s mission to defend the rights of educators, this would appear to be routine. Not so fast: The teacher is a convicted sex offender. Neal Erickson was sentenced in July to a 15- to 30-year jail term after acknowledging that he had sexual relations with a male student beginning when the boy was 14 years old\u2026The Erickson case isn\u2019t unique. In August, a Maryland music teacher was arrested on child-pornography charges. Authorities subsequently discovered that his stash of 4,000 images included sexually suggestive photos and videos of 14 female students between kindergarten and second-grade ages. When the case became news, a woman who had been his student during the 1990s came forward and the teacher now faces additional charges of sex abuse and rape. One former colleague told reporters that she had twice reported his suspicious activity, including locking his classroom doors when he was alone with young girls. But nothing happened because \u201cthe administrators didn\u2019t take it seriously enough,\u201d she said\u2026In 2010, the Government Accountability Office found \u201chundreds of potential cases of registered sex offenders working in schools\u201d across the U.S. \u201cHundreds\u201d is unacceptable. Even a small number of sex offenders can inflict damage far out of proportion to their numbers. The GAO cited studies in which 232 child molesters admitted to molesting 17,000 children.\n\nIn October, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives unanimously passed a piece of legislation introduced by a California Democrat that aims to close cracks in the bureaucratic system that sometimes allow convicted sex offenders to be hired in schools. Several influential unions \u2014 who often cite The Children to justify their political ends \u2014 weren\u2019t happy with some of the law\u2019s provisions:\n\nAnyone with violent or sexual convictions against a child\u2014whether a misdemeanor or felony\u2014would be ineligible for school employment. Background checks would be more thorough, using expanded databases including the FBI\u2019s fingerprint database, the national and state sex offender registries. And districts would be prohibited from knowingly unloading sex abusers on other schools\u2014a practice known as \u201cpass the trash.\u201d These are sensible measures that are overdue. Yet the two most powerful teachers unions in the country have voiced objections to the bill. Both the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers complained about the bill before it passed the House. The NEA claimed in a letter to House members that background checks \u201coften have a huge, racially disparate impact.\u201d Randi Weingarten, the AFT chief, warned of inaccuracies in the FBI database and cautioned that teachers would be inconvenienced by potentially long screening delays.\n\nYes, NEA, please explain why barring sex criminals from working at schools is somehow racist. And by all means, Ms. Weingarten, complain away about how stronger anti-molester screening processes would potentially \u201cinconvenience\u201d some of your members. For her work on education reform, Brown is under attack from the usual suspects. Media Matters complains that the Journal didn\u2019t disclose the fact that Brown\u2019s husband is on the board of an \u201canti-teacher union\u201d organization, while the Huffington Post casually speculates that she\u2019s only engaged in these issues for the financial gain \u2014 and that the money is flowing from shadowy right-wing figures, of course:\n\nBrown probably isn\u2019t taking on the job of attacking unions for free, out of a spirit of doing good for the world by driving down people\u2019s wages and benefits. It is more likely that Brown has tapped into the lucrative Republican-aligned corporate/billionaire-funded anti-union money fire hose. That would explain a lot.\n\nThe same piece accuses Brown of playing fast and loose with the facts, having failed to parrot the unions\u2019 line that they were only interested in \u201cstrengthening\u201d the bill. The author then dives into the conspiratorial fever swamp of Koch Derangement Syndrome, based on zero facts whatsoever. Because, you see, the only reasons anyone would ever oppose teachers unions is either an abiding hatred of teachers (especially their wages and benefits), or piles of secret Kochtopus cash. Or something.\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Campbell Brown: Teachers unions are resisting efforts to keep sex offenders out of classrooms", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "Former CNN anchor Campbell Brown published an op/ed in the Wall Street Journal\u00a0over the weekend taking powerful teachers unions to task over their attempts to water down bipartisan legislation aime\u2026", "title": "Campbell Brown: Teachers unions are resisting efforts to keep sex offenders out of classrooms", "url": "http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2014/01/21/campbell-brown-teachers-unions-are-fighting-efforts-to-keep-sex-offenders-out-of-classrooms/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-21T17:53:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-20T20:43:20+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21a9\"", "article_summary": "Even a small number of sex offenders can inflict damage far out of proportion to their numbers.\nBecause, you see, the only reasons anyone would ever oppose teachers unions is either an abiding hatred of teachers (especially their wages and benefits), or piles of secret Kochtopus cash.\nYet the two most powerful teachers unions in the country have voiced objections to the bill.\nNot so fast: The teacher is a convicted sex offender.\nCampbell Brown: Teachers unions are resisting efforts to keep sex offenders out of classroomsposted at 12:53 pm on January 21, 2014 by Guy BensonFormer CNN anchor Campbell Brown published an op/ed in the Wall Street Journal over the weekend taking powerful teachers unions to task over their attempts to water down bipartisan legislation aimed at keeping convicted sex criminals out of the teaching profession."}
