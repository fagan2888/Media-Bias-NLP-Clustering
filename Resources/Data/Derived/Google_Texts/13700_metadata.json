But as Justice Nancy Rice asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t it qualitatively different when one goes to ski, you don\u2019t expect to be caught in an avalanche?\u201d\n\nBy all means, skiers should understand that hurtling down a snowy hill on waxed boards through icy, forested land will never be a safe activity.\n\nBut until the legislature says otherwise, those skiers should have some expectation that when they launch themselves onto a ski resort run \u2014 even in the trees \u2014 they won\u2019t be unsuspectingly wiped out by an avalanche.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche victims and the right to sue ski resorts", "title": "Avalanche victims and the right to sue ski resorts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/02/avalanche-victims-and-the-right-to-sue-ski-resorts/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151002__OP05AVALANCHEp1.jpg", "height": 451}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151002__OP05AVALANCHEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-02T16:14:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T10:01:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd87f0\"", "article_summary": "The safety act was written to protect Colorado ski areas from excessive litigation, allowing them to operate without onerous liability insurance premiums.\nResorts should have to inform skiers when avalanche risk is high, signs should be posted on problematic areas and, in extreme cases, runs should be closed.\nSki resorts say that should be common knowledge and an inherent risk of skiing.\nSkiers can anticipate the other events listed in the law as inherent dangers, such as ice, rocks and changing conditions.\nIt stands to reason that if Colorado\u2019s legislature meant to include avalanches as an inherent skiing risk as part of the Colorado Ski Safety Act, it would have added it."}
