Bernie Sanders is currently beating Clinton in New Hampshire and Joe Biden looks like he'll be jumping into the race sometime in September.\n\nWith Clinton's flailing poll numbers and inevitability failing to pass public scrutiny, apparently Al Gore's people are now looking at the potential for another White House run. Yes, that Al Gore.\n\nGore, 67, won the popular vote in the 2000 election and has been mentioned as a possible candidate in every contested Democratic primary since then. He instead spent much of the 2000s focused on environmental campaigning and business ventures. He has largely slipped out of public view in more recent years.\n\n\n\nBut in recent days, \u201cthey\u2019re getting the old gang together,\u201d a senior Democrat told BuzzFeed News.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re figuring out if there\u2019s a path financially and politically,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cIt feels more real than it has in the past months.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe senior Democrat and other sources cautioned not to overstate Gore\u2019s interest. He has not made any formal or informal moves toward running, or even met with his political advisers about a potential run.\n\nSure, Gore hasn't made any \"formal or informal\" moves toward running, but technically neither has Biden.\n\nIf Gore decides to get into the race, the big question is who Bill Clinton will side with. Will it be his wife? Or his former vice president who he supported back during the 2000 run for the White House?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Repeat. .05/26/2016 3:31:52AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Repeat.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Are You Ready For...Gore 2016?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/08/14/are-you-ready-forgore-2016-n2038843", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/225/2015-08-13T232549Z_1_LYNXNPEB7C15N_RTROPTP_3_CHINA-ENVIRONMENT.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Repeat.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Are You Ready For...Gore 2016?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/08/14/are-you-ready-forgore-2016-n2038843", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/225/2015-08-13T232549Z_1_LYNXNPEB7C15N_RTROPTP_3_CHINA-ENVIRONMENT.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Are You Ready For...Gore 2016? , Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda33b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt feels more real than it has in the past months.\u201dThe senior Democrat and other sources cautioned not to overstate Gore\u2019s interest.\nHe has not made any formal or informal moves toward running, or even met with his political advisers about a potential run.\nBut in recent days, \u201cthey\u2019re getting the old gang together,\u201d a senior Democrat told BuzzFeed News.\nOr his former vice president who he supported back during the 2000 run for the White House?\nSure, Gore hasn't made any \"formal or informal\" moves toward running, but technically neither has Biden."}
