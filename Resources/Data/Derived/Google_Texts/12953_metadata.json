Now the student government is picking up where the protesters left off. Sunday, the student assembly voted for a resolution that would slash the funding used to publish the paper\u2019s twice-weekly print edition.\n\nThe plan would cut the Argus\u2018s publication budget in half, with the $15,000 \u201csavings\u201d used to pay small stipends to 20 student writers at up to four online publications. The so-called \u201cdigitalization\u201d of the Argus was framed primarily as an environmentally conscious decision to reduce paper waste and expand support for more diverse publications.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBryan Stascavage, the student who wrote the op-ed on Black Lives Matter which generated campus protests, is a member of the Wesleyan student assembly and was present for the vote. He told Breitbart News Monday, \u201cIf the student government really believes in these work study positions, then they should be funding it from the general budget, not taking money away from the Argus.\u201d He added, \u201cBy taking it from the Argus, it looks like a spiteful, retributive move.\u201d\n\nThe resolution to slash the Argus\u2019s budget, fund stipends, and give students course credit comes just weeks after protesters explicitly threatened to cut the paper\u2019s budget if their demands, including stipends and course credit for writers, were not met. In other words, while never saying so, the new plan appears to give protesters much of what they demanded, including the elimination of most future print editions.\n\nRebecca Brill, the editor of the Argus, told Jezebel, \u201cI reminded everyone in the WSA senate meeting today, we need to remember that an op-ed that made people upset is the root of this entire conversation.\u201d She added, \u201cBut all the op-ed stuff is being divorced at this point, and is being framed as an amalgam of measures toward racial diversity, socioeconomic diversity, saving money, and environmentalism.\u201d\n\nThe op-ed which generated the protests was moderately critical of the Black Lives Matter movement but offered a quote from a supporter of the movement as well as from a police officer who was concerned about its message. After its publication, students destroyed part of the print run, and Bryan Stascavage, the author, was called a racist both online and on campus.\n\nProtesters started a petition, listing their demands and threatening to cut the paper\u2019s funding. Over 150 students signed the petition. The university president did not side with the protesters and, in fact, issued a strong statement in defense of free speech, saying, \u201cthere is no right not to be offended.\u201d\n\nPaul Singley, president of the Connecticut Society for Professional Journalists, told the Argus last month, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be second guessing whether you should publish something that you certainly have the right to just because you\u2019re going to lose funding. That\u2019s an unhealthy situation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wesleyan Univ students destroyed the print edition of their student newspaper after it published an op-ed critical of Black Lives Matter.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Wesleyan Univ students destroyed the print edition of their student newspaper after it published an op-ed critical of Black Lives Matter.", "title": "Student Assembly Cuts Funding to Campus Paper After Op-Ed Critical of Black Lives Matter - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/wesleyan-university-argus-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-10-20T09:37:47-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/10/19/student-assembly-cuts-funding-campus-paper-op-ed-critical-black-lives-matter/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wesleyan Univ students destroyed the print edition of their student newspaper after it published an op-ed critical of Black Lives Matter.", "creator": "@verumserum", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/wesleyan-university-argus-AP.jpg", "title": "Student Assembly Cuts Funding to Campus Paper After Op-Ed Critical of Black Lives Matter - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Black Lives Matter, free speech, Wesleyan University,Big Journalism, Education, Law Enforcement,black lives matter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-10-19T20:10:09-07:00", "section": "Big Journalism", "modified_time": "2015-10-20T09:37:47-07:00", "tag": "Wesleyan University", "categories": "Big Journalism,Education,Law Enforcement"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWesleyan University students destroyed the print edition of their student newspaper last month after it published an op-ed critical of Black Lives Matter.\nSunday, the student assembly voted for a resolution that would slash the funding used to publish the paper\u2019s twice-weekly print edition.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBryan Stascavage, the student who wrote the op-ed on Black Lives Matter which generated campus protests, is a member of the Wesleyan student assembly and was present for the vote.\nNow the student government is picking up where the protesters left off.\nAfter its publication, students destroyed part of the print run, and Bryan Stascavage, the author, was called a racist both online and on campus."}
