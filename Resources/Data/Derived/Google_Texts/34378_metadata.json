Denver aimed to become the first national champion located west of the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nIn the end, it was the Pioneers who made history.\n\nWesley Berg scored five goals and Ryan LaPlante had 13 saves as Denver won its first title, beating Maryland, 10-5, at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nFive other players, including Maryland transfer Connor Cannizzaro, scored goals for Denver, which led, 5-3, at halftime and was never challenged in the final two quarters. Berg was chosen as the tournament\u2019s Most Outstanding Player, and he ended the season with a team-record 58 goals.\n\nThe victory gave Pioneers coach Bill Tierney his record seventh national title. He won six with Princeton, which he left after 22 seasons in 2009.\n\nMatt Rambo had two goals and Kyle Bernlohr had 10 saves for the Terrapins (15-4), who were trying to win their first championship since 1975. After the school\u2019s women\u2019s lacrosse team defeated North Carolina in the title game on Sunday night, the Terrapins were trying to double up in championships for the first time since Princeton did so in 1994.\n\nMaryland has now played in the championship game eight times since its last victory, including three times in the last five years, but yet again failed to hoist the trophy.\n\n\u201cI think that people talk about winning a championship, and that\u2019s certainly one of our goals,\u201d Maryland coach John Tillman told reporters. \u201cWe know how much it would mean to our school, our state, our alums, and I\u2019m determined to just bust our hump to try to get it for them. I wanted it so bad for those kids because \u2026 we had a lot of kids that bought in and sold out, and that\u2019s what hurts.\u201d\n\nThe fourth-seeded Pioneers (17-2) beat top-seeded Notre Dame in overtime in the semifinals on Saturday, while Maryland (15-4), the No. 6 seed, topped local rival Johns Hopkins to advance.\n\nDenver took a 4-1 lead in the first quarter as Berg scored the Pioneers\u2019 first three goals, while LaPlante kept the Terrapins at bay with six saves over the first two quarters.\n\nAfter an empty possession for the Terrapins to begin the third quarter, Miller recovered a rebound and sent a shot past Maryland goalie Kyle Bernlohr with 11:43 left in the period.\n\nMiller\u2019s first goal of the game set the tone for the rest of the half, and Denver\u2019s defense continued to frustrate Maryland.\n\nJust over three minutes later, Colin Woolford scored his 10th goal of the season for the Pioneers, and Berg scored on an assist from Miller for an 8-3 lead.\n\nRambo scored his 40th goal of the season with 5:55 remaining in the third quarter and didn\u2019t find the back of the net again until Jay Carlson scored with 32 seconds to play. Bryan Cole and Colin Heacock also scored for the Terrapins.\n\nCannizzaro, the ACC freshman of the year last season at Maryland, transferred to Denver following the season and was eligible to play immediately because players do not have to sit out a year when given their release. He finished this season with a school-record 90 points, including 57 goals and 33 assists, and scored his lone goal on Monday with 1:24 remaining in the first quarter.\n\nSean Cannizzaro, Connor\u2019s older brother, and Zach Miller and Erik Adamson also scored for Denver, which had lost in the Final Four in three of the last four years. Before the Pioneers\u2019 victory, North Carolina was the school farthest west that had won a national championship.\n\n\u201cJust like Wesley carried us on his back for a few games here, I feel like we were carrying a burden around \u2014 and now it\u2019s off,\u201d Tierney told reporters afterward. \u201cNow, we move on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wesley Berg scored five goals and Denver won, 10-5, spoiling Maryland's attempt to become the first school in over 20 years to win the men's and women's lacrosse national championships in the same season.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Wesley Berg scored five goals and Denver won, 10-5, spoiling Maryland\u2019s attempt to become the first school in over 20 years to win the men\u2019s and women\u2019s lacrosse national championships in the same season.", "title": "Denver holds off Maryland, wins first NCAA men\u2019s lacrosse championship", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/25/denver-maryland-ncaa-mens-lacrosse/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/NCAA_Denver_Maryland_Lacrosse.JPEG-0eac2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/NCAA_Denver_Maryland_Lacrosse.JPEG-0eac2.jpg", "description": "Wesley Berg scored five goals and Denver won, 10-5, spoiling Maryland's attempt to become the first school in over 20 years to win the men's and women's lacrosse national championships in the same sea", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Denver holds off Maryland, wins first NCAA men\u2019s lacrosse champi"}, "Author": "Staff and Wire Reports", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Denver, Wesley Berg, Connor Cannizzaro, Bill Tierney"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe62\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think that people talk about winning a championship, and that\u2019s certainly one of our goals,\u201d Maryland coach John Tillman told reporters.\nWesley Berg scored five goals and Ryan LaPlante had 13 saves as Denver won its first title, beating Maryland, 10-5, at Lincoln Financial Field.\nFive other players, including Maryland transfer Connor Cannizzaro, scored goals for Denver, which led, 5-3, at halftime and was never challenged in the final two quarters.\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Maryland was attempting to become the first team in over 20 years to win NCAA championships in men\u2019s and women\u2019s lacrosse.\nBefore the Pioneers\u2019 victory, North Carolina was the school farthest west that had won a national championship."}
