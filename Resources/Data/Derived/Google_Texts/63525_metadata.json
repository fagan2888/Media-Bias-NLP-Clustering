Are you coming?\u201d\n\nA donation page on the Ready For Hillary website reads, \u201cSarah Palin says Republicans will be ready for Hillary. Let\u2019s show her she\u2019s wrong.\u201d It asks for contributions upwards of $20.16.\n\nIn a second e-mail sent to backers Tuesday, Ready For Hillary claimed that the group had raised over $25,000 from the Palin statement.\n\nThis amount of money is actually sufficient to make Palin a co-chair of Ready For Hillary, but the PAC insisted in the e-mail it wouldn\u2019t give the former GOP vice presidential candidate the title without receiving confirmation from her first.\n\nPalin\u2019s speech at the Iowa Freedom Summit Saturday raised a lot of eyebrows, particularly because of its disjointed nature.\n\nThe former Republican governor had a few things to say about Hillary Clinton, two of which didn\u2019t make much sense.\n\n\u201cWhat will they do to stop causing our pain and start feeling it again,\u201d Palin said while remarking on Obamacare. \u201cWell, in other words, um \u2014 Is Hillary a new Democrat or an old one?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow the press asks, the press asks, \u2018Can anyone stop Hillary?'\u201d she said later. \u201cAgain, this is to forego a conclusion, right? It\u2019s to scare us off, to convince us that \u2014 a pantsuit can crush patriots.\u201d\n\nIn a statement following Palin\u2019s speech, Democratic National Committee communications director Mo Elleithee said plainly, \u201cThank you!\u201d\n\nPalin, who is \u201cseriously interested\u201d in running for president in 2016, has likely singled out Hillary as her Democratic competition.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Following Palin's confusing speech at a Tea Party conference in Iowa Saturday, the pro-Hillary Clinton political action committee Ready For Hillary used the former governor of Alaska's remarks to raise a whopping $25,000.", "title": "Not Ready For Palin: Hillary Clinton super PAC raises $25k after...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 554, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2015/01/GOP-2016-Iowa_Chal-554x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/01/28/not-ready-palin-hillary-clinton-super-pac-raises-25k-iowa-speech/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "sarah-palin-ready-for-hillary-25k", "published_time": "2015-01-28T12:23:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-28T12:23:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2ee\"", "article_summary": "According to the Huffington Post, Ready For Hillary sent an e-mail to supporters asking for money after Palin proclaimed herself \u201cready for Hillary\u201d during her Iowa speech.\nAre you coming?\u201dA donation page on the Ready For Hillary website reads, \u201cSarah Palin says Republicans will be ready for Hillary.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than a village to beat Hillary,\u201d Palin declared Saturday.\n\u201cWell, in other words, um \u2014 Is Hillary a new Democrat or an old one?\u201d\u201cNow the press asks, the press asks, \u2018Can anyone stop Hillary?\nIn a second e-mail sent to backers Tuesday, Ready For Hillary claimed that the group had raised over $25,000 from the Palin statement."}
