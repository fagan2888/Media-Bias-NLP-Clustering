Two other adults were also employees at Sal\u2019s Japanese Steakhouse and became infected. The fourth case was in an unvaccinated infant whose only known exposure was at the restaurant.\n\nState Health Officer Rober Moser said, \u201cThe best way to keep from getting the disease is by being vaccinated. Protect children by making sure they have the MMR vaccine when they are 12 to 15 months old, and again before they enter kindergarten.\"\n\nDue to the concern of transmission to the public, health officials are requesting anyone who dined at Sal\u2019s Japanese Steakhouse, 6829 E. Kellogg Dr. in Wichita, on the following dates: June 20, 23, 25, 29, July 3, 5, and July 7, and later developed an illness with fever and rash to contact their health care provider. Healthcare providers who have questions should call the Kansas Department of Health and Environment at 877-427-7317 or the Sedgwick County Health Department at 316-660-7424.\n\nInterim Director Adrienne Byrne-Lutz said, \u201cIf you have a fever, stay home except to see a healthcare provider. If you need to visit your healthcare provider, call ahead so appropriate measures can be taken to protect other patients and staff.\"\n\nPeople at high risk for severe illness and complications from measles include infants and children aged <5 years, adults aged >20 years, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems.\n\nFor more information: http://www.cdc.gov/features/Measles/index.html\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Four additional cases of measles have been reported in Sedgwick County.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"description": "Four additional cases of measles have been reported in Sedgwick County.", "title": "Four more measles cases reported in Sedgwick County", "url": "http://www.kake.com/health/headlines/Four-more-measles-cases-reported-in-Sedgwick-County-266876801.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/80C/B69/80CB6916A0614105929A16F3DF43506A", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/0E7/C2D/0E7C2D43890B481E8CC6337B230FB7A6.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Four additional cases of measles have been reported in Sedgwick County.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/health/headlines/Four-more-measles-cases-reported-in-Sedgwick-County-266876801.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/measles+alert.jpg", "title": "Four more measles cases reported in Sedgwick County", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Four more measles cases reported in Sedgwick County", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Four more measles cases reported"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc50\"", "article_summary": "Four additional cases of measles have been reported in Sedgwick County.\nHealthcare providers who have questions should call the Kansas Department of Health and Environment at 877-427-7317 or the Sedgwick County Health Department at 316-660-7424.\nTwo other adults were also employees at Sal\u2019s Japanese Steakhouse and became infected.\nThe Kansas Department of Health and Environment and Sedgwick County Health Department said one case involved an adult linked to a recent outbreak of measles in the Kansas City metropolitan area, and who is an employee at Sal\u2019s Japanese Steakhouse.\nInterim Director Adrienne Byrne-Lutz said, \u201cIf you have a fever, stay home except to see a healthcare provider."}
