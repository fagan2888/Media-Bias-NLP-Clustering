The guilty look \u2014 head cowered, ears back \u2014 is a reaction to the tantrum you are throwing now over the damage they did hours earlier.\n\n\u201cJust get over it and remind yourself not to put temptation in the way next time,\u201d said Dr. Bonnie Beaver, a professor at Texas A&M University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine and executive director of the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists.\n\nScientific findings have not put a dent in the popularity of online dog shaming sites, like dogshaming.com and shameyourpet.com or videos like those posted on youtube.com/crackrockcandy. In the photos and videos, dogs wear humorous written \u201cconfessions\u201d and often are surrounded by the remnants of their misdeeds. There is no question that in some photos, they look guilty of eating, drinking, chewing, licking or destroying something they shouldn\u2019t have.\n\nDogshaming.com was the first and is among the most popular sites. Since Pascale Lemire started it in August 2012, it has received more than 58 million page views and more than 65,000 submissions. A submission has to come with a photo showing the dog\u2019s guilty look.\n\nLemire, who lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, also published a book called \u201cDog Shaming,\u201d which hit the New York Times best-seller list in January.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think dogs actually feel shame,\u201d Lemire said. \u201cI think they know how to placate us with this sad puppy-dog look \u2026 My guess is that their thinking is: \u2018Oh man, my owner is super mad about something, but I don\u2019t know what, but he seems to calm down when I give him the sad face, so let\u2019s try that again.\u2019 \u201c\n\nShe thinks the online dog-shaming memes are all in good fun.\n\n\u201cPeople come for a laugh and camaraderie,\u201d Lemire said. \u201cThey see that their dog isn\u2019t the only one who does awful things.\u201d\n\nAnother dog owner helped get celebrities into the trend. In late 2011, Jeremy Lakaszcyck of Boston started putting shaming videos of his beagle, Maymo, on YouTube. Four months later, Ellen DeGeneres ran one of them on her show, and comedian Ricky Gervais tweeted it. The popularity of the videos soared, Lakaszcyck said.\n\n\u201cMaymo can sit for quite a while looking sad because he\u2019s a ham,\u201d Lakaszcyck said. \u201cIt\u2019s natural, and he knows a treat is coming. His tail usually wags through the wait.\u201d\n\nOne of the first scientific studies on the \u201cguilty dog look\u201d was conducted in 2009 by Alexandra Horowitz, an associate professor of psychology at Barnard College in New York City. One of her books, \u201cInside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know,\u201d included the findings.\n\nIn the study, she used 14 dogs, videotaping them in a series of trials and studying how they reacted when an owner left the room after telling them not to eat a treat. When the owners returned, sometimes they knew what the dogs had done and sometimes they didn\u2019t and sometimes the dogs had eaten the treats and sometimes they hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI found that the \u2018look\u2019 appeared most often when owners scolded their dogs, regardless of whether the dog had disobeyed or did something for which they might or should feel guilty,\u201d Horowitz said.\n\nDogs can certainly learn from bad behavior, but rewards or punishment are most effective right after the wrongdoing, said Beaver, the veterinary professor. \u201cThe farther it gets from that, the less connection is made with the behavior,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Behaviorists: Dogs feel no shame despite \u201cthe look\u201d", "title": "Behaviorists: Dogs feel no shame despite \u201cthe look\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/28/behaviorists-dogs-feel-no-shame-despite-the-look/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140228__20140301_C8_fe01ahdogshamep1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140228__20140301_C8_fe01ahdogshamep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-28T17:41:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:01:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93b2\"", "article_summary": "A submission has to come with a photo showing the dog\u2019s guilty look.\nIn the photos and videos, dogs wear humorous written \u201cconfessions\u201d and often are surrounded by the remnants of their misdeeds.\nThere is no question that in some photos, they look guilty of eating, drinking, chewing, licking or destroying something they shouldn\u2019t have.\nThe guilty look \u2014 head cowered, ears back \u2014 is a reaction to the tantrum you are throwing now over the damage they did hours earlier.\nIn late 2011, Jeremy Lakaszcyck of Boston started putting shaming videos of his beagle, Maymo, on YouTube."}
