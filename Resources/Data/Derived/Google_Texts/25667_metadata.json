A recent report from the Obama administration finds 23 percent of those in that gap are dealing with a mental illness or substance abuse disorder. Without Medicaid, they have fewer options when they are looking for treatment.\n\nScott Lynch works at a treatment center called Austin Recovery. A big part of his job involves helping people get into rehab programs, even if that means sending them to other facilities.\n\nSometimes that involves making sure people get medical or psychiatric help before entering treatment. But the cost of rehab programs is often the biggest barrier people face. Lynch said a lot of people who turn to Austin Recovery don\u2019t have health insurance.\n\n\u201cThe large majority of our population is uninsured,\u201d Lynch said. He estimates that 85 percent of the people who call into Austin Recovery seeking treatment are uninsured. Without insurance, or donations from elsewhere, they will likely have to find a way to pay out-of-pocket for treatment.\n\nTrent Thompson had recently been looking for a rehab program here in Austin. He said when he would call a facility, the conversation would go something like this:\n\n\u201cThey are like, \u2018Can you pay this?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Man, look. I\u2019m a drug addict. I\u2019m actively using. I don\u2019t have a bank account built up anymore. There\u2019s nothing there.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve experienced.\u201d\n\nThompson said he found that some facilities almost exclusively take patients that have insurance.\n\n\u201cYou are pretty much not going to be able to get in, and that\u2019s where you are getting pretty extensive recovery. I mean like some really good recovery. But if you don\u2019t have insurance you are not going to get in,\u201d Lynch said.\n\nThompson had made a lot of calls trying to find a way into treatment. He was on a mission to get clean, he said, because he\u2019d been in this place before. He\u2019s been using since he was in high school with periods of sobriety throughout. He\u2019s also had periods of his life where his heroin addiction completely took over. So, when he recently relapsed after 8 months of sobriety, he knew he needed to make this happen.\n\n\u201cI need to get into treatment. I know I have to do this. I\u2019ve kind of messed up in the past three weeks, but it\u2019s just I\u2019ve gotten to \u2013 I know how low it gets,\" he said. \"It tears me out and it just starts to eat away at things in my life, and I just know I need to go.\u201d\n\nThompson said that finally, he was just a few days from getting into rehab. He said he\u2019d talked to a friend who recommended a place that was able to reserve Thompson a spot. But he said the waiting had him on edge.\n\n\u201cThey immediately said \u2018Okay, we have a bed, and you\u2019ve got to wait a week.\u2019 Sometimes that\u2019s hard because sometimes you don\u2019t know where you are going to be in a week. When you are in active addiction, it\u2019s just like you don\u2019t really have a choice. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s driving you crazy and it just keeps eating away at you, you don\u2019t really have a choice.\u201d\n\nThese wait times aren\u2019t just stressing out people who are seeking help. Lynch said the demand out there is something he deals with all the time.\n\n\u201cWhenever you think you are making headway and covering some ground, you realize that you\u2019ve barely touched a fraction of the people that are in need,\" he said. \"So, definitely the services are underwhelming as opposed to the need.\u201d\n\nAustin Recovery is among a small group of treatment centers that works to provide services to mostly low-income people, but they can only do so much. Their in-patient facility, for example, can only take in about 70 people at a time. And with the rising number of people addicted to opiates like painkillers and heroin, the need is only getting bigger. Austin Recovery\u2019s executive director Ivana Grahovac said that Texas needs more programs like hers.\n\n\u201cThe number one issue that is affecting Americans right now is accidental drug overdose. It is now the number one cause of death in America \u2013 it has superseded car accidents,\" Grahovac said. \"So, it\u2019s crucial that there are providers like Austin Recovery who can provide affordable, easy access to effective treatment of appropriate duration and intensity.\u201d\n\nA federal report found that, just in Texas, about 406,000 adults who would qualify for Medicaid under an expanded program are struggling with mental illness or substance use disorder. State lawmakers in Texas are still largely opposed, though, to expanding Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Texas", "description": "Thousands of Texans would have qualified for Medicaid if state lawmakers expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act.
