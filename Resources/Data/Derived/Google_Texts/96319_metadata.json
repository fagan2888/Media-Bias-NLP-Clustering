The average going rate per kilowatt hour in Maine was 15 cents in August, but on an island like Monhegan, far from the reach of the grid, it\u2019s usually about 70 cents. The difference in price for No. 2 heating oil, which 80 percent of Maine\u2019s islands are dependent on? Typically $1 more per gallon than on the mainland.\n\nAdditional Images Peaks Islander Sam Saltonstall and other Mainers visiting Sams\u00f8 tagged along on a maintenance trip to offshore wind turbines. On Sams\u00f8, pipes carry hot water to heat all 270 homes. The heat is generated in large barns where hay is constantly being fed into boilers. Samsingers, which is what inhabitants of Sams\u00f8 are called, grow the hay, too. ISLAND ENERGY CONFERENCE\n\n\n\nTHE ISLAND INSTITUTE will host the fifth annual Island Energy Conference, a gathering of island leaders and energy experts focused on sharing energy challenges and solutions. Keynote by Dr. James Manwell from the University of Massachusetts Wind Energy Center. Participants in the Collaborative for Island Energy Research and Action (CIERA) will share their experiences on both Maine islands and Sams\u00f8 in Denmark.\n\n\n\nWHEN: Friday to Nov. 9 WHERE: Most sessions at Clarion Hotel, 1230 Congress St., Portland, with an event on Peaks Island as well.\n\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION: islandinstitute.org/energyworkshops.php Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nThrow climate change into the equation and the rising costs associated with it and island life starts to seem that much more tenuous and the need for answers that much more urgent.\n\nWhich is how 13 College of the Atlantic students and five representatives from five Maine islands \u2013 Long, Peaks, Monhegan, Swan\u2019s and Vinalhaven \u2013 ended up in Denmark for several weeks this fall at a place that sounds straight out of science fiction. Or Sir Thomas More: Sams\u00f8, the world\u2019s first island to be powered by 100 percent renewable energy; it\u2019s a 21st century Utopia.\n\nA 44-square-mile island smack in the geographic middle of the funny little claw of peninsula and islands that make up Denmark, Sams\u00f8 is home to 21 wind turbines (11 onshore, 10 offshore) cooperatively owned by islanders (and some investors). Solar panels are scattered throughout the island, and the island\u2019s heating needs for its 4,000 residents are mostly met by four heating plants that run on hot water fueled by straw and wood chips. And all this has happened since 1997 when Denmark designated Sams\u00f8 as the country\u2019s energy island.\n\nUnder a joint project of the Island Institute and the College of the Atlantic, the whole island became a classroom and source of inspiration for the future of Maine\u2019s islands. But the key lessons the islanders and the college students took home were not what they\u2019d anticipated learning when they signed on for this master course in green living.\n\n\u201cI expected to go there and find an island of energy miracles,\u201d said Wade Lyman, a senior at College of the Atlantic. \u201cLike technologies you wouldn\u2019t find anywhere else. Amazing visual things. Giant turbines everywhere.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Lyman visualized. Student Zabet NeuCollins said she came with no such expectations. \u201cJust the fact that Sams\u00f8 is 100 percent renewable is so far from our reality that it was hard for me to even begin to understand what it might look like,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the day they left, as they were nearing the port on the larger Danish island of Zealand to Sams\u00f8\u2019s west, Lyman stood on the upper deck of the ferry, talking over the trip with College of the Atlantic professor Jay Friedlander, who recounted his student\u2019s quiet revelation: \u201cHe said, \u2018When I started the course, I thought that to solve climate change you needed a technological solution,'\u201d Friedlander said.\n\nWhat Lyman had realized was the main tools the residents of Sams\u00f8 \u2013 called Samsingers \u2013 employed were social, cultural and economic. And that the results were shockingly subtle. But Sams\u00f8 is using technology that\u2019s at least 10 years old at this point. Tried and true stuff, including modern spins on the classic windmills in use in Denmark for centuries.\n\nThe student had presumed there would be drama in the Danish landscape, signs everywhere of a community waging a campaign against fossil fuel dependence. Instead, \u201cyou had to go looking for the turbines,\u201d Lyman said.\n\n\u201cThere was a sense of normalcy there that I wasn\u2019t expecting. It didn\u2019t appear that they had made many sacrifices. They took what was available to them and they used it.\u201d\n\nNow the task ahead starts with translating that message for the Maine island dwellers. They range from a retired high school German teacher to an innkeeper and the son of a longtime Casco Bay fishing family, and they\u2019ve all got different projects ahead but will be delivering essentially the same heartening message to their fellow islanders. Change here doesn\u2019t have to look radical either. Maybe it won\u2019t be that hard to lower those angst-producing electric and heating bills. Maybe adapting to renewable energies won\u2019t take much of a sacrifice at all.\n\nFor Long Island in Casco Bay, that could mean a solar-powered charging station at the dock for electric cars. On Peaks, it will likely mean cost-saving measures at the island school and organizing community members for buy-ins on green energy, such as heat pumps. On Mount Desert Island, represented by the MDI-dwelling college of the Atlantic students (Lyman also happens to be from there), the work ahead includes developing a feasibility plan for the island\u2019s six schools to improve their energy and heating efficiency. On Swan\u2019s Island, where residents own and run the nation\u2019s smallest electric cooperative and face rising costs (they had to raise rates 15 percent just last year), solar could be an option; the main goal there is to figure out ways to make the cooperative sustainable and affordable.\n\nOn Vinalhaven, where three giant wind turbines have been generating electricity since 2009 (along with controversy over their noise and seeming inability to bring down electricity rates), that might mean a solar farm to generate electricity in the summer months when the winds aren\u2019t blowing as mightily, so costs spike. For Monhegan, still debating the issue of a nearby major wind turbine installation proposed by UMaine, the main task ahead is consensus building and developing a comprehensive energy plan for the island\u2019s 60-year round residents (10 of them children).\n\nEND OF THE LINE\n\nFor Maine\u2019s islands, the economic impetus to find energy solutions is that much more significant, said Suzanne MacDonald, Community Energy Director for the Island Institute. Monhegan and Matinicus pay among the top 20 highest electric rates in the entire United States. \u201cThe only places that pay more of electricity are these small, remote villages in Alaska,\u201d MacDonald said. Maine is more dependent on No. 2 heating oil than any other state, but because of use of alternatives like natural gas or wood pellets, the state has recently dropped from being 80 percent reliant on oil to somewhere in the 70 percent range, she said. On the islands, it remains over 80 percent.\n\nMaine as a whole has some of the oldest housing stock in the nation, as well as the oldest residents. \u201cWe have a lot of folks on fixed incomes with drafty homes,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cPeople on the islands though? It is even worse.\u201d\n\nNatural gas isn\u2019t going to flow to Matinicus. Ever. There are also propane shortages to contend with.\n\n\u201cThey say Maine is at the end of the line,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cWell, the islands are at the end of that end of the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have some folks still burning coal,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the process of finding solutions, she said there\u2019s no push for any one specific technology. \u201cWe want to invest the islanders as leaders so they can come up with solutions that will be best for their island.\u201d\n\nGETTING THERE FROM HERE\n\nThe Sams\u00f8 trip was funded by a new project of the College of the Atlantic and the Island Institute, the Fund for Maine Islands. That fund, established with a $2 million grant from the Partridge Foundation, was kicked off with great fanfare in August this year, with journalist and PBS stalwart Bill Moyers giving a speech in Bar Harbor celebrating it and the woman behind the Partridge Foundation, philanthropist Polly Guth.\n\nBut for Friedlander and professor Anna Demeo, the co-teachers of the semester-long course on Sams\u00f8, the germ of an idea for the trip dates back to 2008. The ultimate Samsinger, S\u00f8ren Hermansen, who runs the Energy Academy, an educational center that explains Sams\u00f8 to the world, had come to the College of the Atlantic at Friedlander\u2019s invitation. This was the same year Hermansen was dubbed a \u201cHero of the Environment\u201d by Time magazine. Friedlander was new to the school, specializing in green business; Demeo had been there about a decade, teaching project-based renewable energy courses.\n\nAs they sat in the same lecture hall listening to Hermansen describe the island\u2019s path from dying community to being designated Denmark\u2019s \u201cRenewable Energy Island\u201d in 1997 and five years later, to being self-sufficient for all its electricity, they had a shared brainstorm. \u201cWe said, \u2018Oh my God, we have to do something with this,'\u201d Friedlander remembers. \u201cWe knew we needed to foster a relationship between College of the Atlantic and the Energy Academy and bring some of what they were doing back to this side of the pond.\u201d\n\nThey invited Hermansen back to the college again last spring and took him hiking. The Energy Academy gives one- and two-day workshops to visitors all the time, but distilling a decade\u2019s worth of work into such short sessions wasn\u2019t easy. Why not try explaining Sams\u00f8 over two or three weeks and really do it right? Their students would happily be guinea pigs for such a program, Demeo said. They sent another College of the Atlantic student, Nick Urban, ahead to do an extended internship at Hermansen\u2019s Energy Academy to help Hermansen and his wife, Malene, develop that longer course of study. There on Acadia Mountain, Friedlander and Demeo\u2019s \u201cMonster Class\u201d was born. \u201cWe had this almost shovel-ready idea,\u201d Demeo said.\n\nThere was no shortage of students interested in devoting their fall semester to island sustainability. And the Island Institute was flooded with applications from Maine island residents who wanted to participate in what was now known as the Collaborative for Island Energy Research and Action, or CIERA. They had 25 applicants for five spots, according to the Island Institute\u2019s Suzanne MacDonald. Key to their selection was \u201cthe benefit to the broader community\u201d MacDonald said.\n\nBUSMAN\u2019S HOLIDAY\n\nFor some of the island representatives, the trip was a bit of a busman\u2019s holiday. Nate Johnson is the director of environmental affairs for Portland-based Ocean Renewable Power Company, which uses tidal energy and river currents to generate electricity. He\u2019s also a native of Long Island, who left for college, worked away and returned to Long Island to raise his three children, joining the island\u2019s roughly 230 year-round residents.\n\nWho includes his parents; his father still lobsters and his mother teaches in the island school. He wants their lives on Long Island, where fuel and heating costs are about 25 percent more than on the mainland, to be sustainable.\n\nTo that end, he\u2019s working on a baseline assessment of the island\u2019s energy needs. Among the considerations, incorporating solar and possibly wind turbines into the ferry station. Maybe a charging station for the island\u2019s many golf electric carts, which some residents use for buzzing around the island in lieu of cars. High profile but not ruining anyone\u2019s view, an ideal opportunity, he said, to introduce renewables.\n\nWhich may turn out to fit, as they did on Sams\u00f8, with the island mindset \u2013 community-minded and already sustainably oriented. Who wants to go to the mainland if you don\u2019t have to? Johnson grew up with a mother who hung clothes out to dry and grew vegetables for the family and a father who kept just about every kind of tool in his workshop. \u201cThe way you learn to do things involves relying on other people. If you don\u2019t have it, you know your neighbor does,\u201d he said.\n\nUnless it is something as random as a paint sprayer. When Monhegan resident Marian Chioffi called to talk about her Sams\u00f8 experience, she\u2019d just arrived on the mainland to pick up a paint sprayer; she had some rooms to paint at the Trailing Yew, her inn on Monhegan, and that\u2019s one thing she couldn\u2019t find on the island.\n\nHer Monhegan project is a little more wonky than some of the others in that her goal is to create a comprehensive energy plan for the island. As the bookkeeper for the Monhegan Plantation Power District (founded in 1999, Chioffi is the only staff member), she\u2019s had a firsthand look at how hard it is to build consensus. The diesel-fueled generator producing that expensive electricity for the island \u2013 to the tune of $100,000 a year just for the diesel \u2013 isn\u2019t tenable in the long term, but how should it be supplemented or upgraded? \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at renewables for a long time,\u201d Chioffi said.\n\nThere has been a passionate debate over what the proposed UMaine turbines might mean for Monhegan, as well as a separate discussion about a small-scale, community-owned wind project and/or adding photovoltaics to the grid. Not to mention a cry for harnessing tidal power.\n\n\u201cI think because there are so many things out there that people are confused about the path that the energy company needs to take,\u201d Chioffi said. Working with NeuCollins, she\u2019s focusing on making sure the community is engaged in the discussion. \u201cI know you can\u2019t please everybody all the time,\u201d she said. But what Sams\u00f8 showed her is that if individuals at least feel they\u2019ve been heard, the whole community gains.\n\nWhile on Sams\u00f8, she paid careful attention to the presence of turbines. The offshore ones had a certain beauty, she was surprised to find. And were less noisy than she expected. The onshore ones, which are scattered around various farms, were less appealing. Their owners had motivations ranging from financial to something more altruistic.\n\n\u201cWe talked to one farmer who said he did it for the money,\u201d Chioffi said. \u201cBut we talked to another who said, \u2018I did it because it was the right thing.'\u201d She\u2019ll spend the next year working with CIERA to get Monhegan residents if not on the same page, at least in the same book. And aware of the many ways there may be to skin the energy cat on Maine islands. As Johnson puts it, \u201cwith energy solutions, there is no one silver bullet.\u201d The Samsingers would likely agree.\n\nCOMMON SENSE\n\nThere are key distinctions between Sams\u00f8 and the typical inhabited Maine island. It\u2019s a two-hour ferry ride to Sams\u00f8; not even Monhegan is that far from the mainland. The climate there is milder, the winters less harsh. But the winds blow far steadier and fiercer than on say, Casco Bay. The waters around Sams\u00f8 are more shallow, which means the offshore turbines don\u2019t have to be as massive. Sams\u00f8 has never been driven by a tourist economy (although its energy status has made it quite a draw with the environmental set). It once had a fishing community, but the collapse of the fisheries in the 1970s left the island with agriculture as an industry and not much else. Here\u2019s the biggest difference: The Danish government piled on incentives for the Samsingers to go green, paying premium for power, with guarantees of up to 10 years, long enough to establish Sams\u00f8 as an energy generator.\n\n\u201cGovernment is more helpful to them,\u201d the Island Institute\u2019s Suzanne MacDonald said. None of the returnees from the trip to Denmark expect that to happen here.\u201dBut we\u2019ll have other opportunities available to us,\u201d she added.\n\nThere are similarities, too. Sams\u00f8 is famous for its potatoes. And the Samsingers are Yankee-esque. \u201cWhen you are in Denmark, the word that comes up a lot is common sense,\u201d Friedlander said. \u201cThe people on Sams\u00f8 did this because it made economic sense for them. I think Mainers would love it if, instead of sending their money to the Middle East, their money is being plowed back into the communities.\u201d Literally. The straw and the wood chips that fuel those biomass boilers on Sams\u00f8 were grown right there.\n\n\u201cS\u00f8ren (Hermansen) is always saying, \u2018We\u2019re not a bunch of hippies,'\u201d Anna Demeo said. \u201cHe says, \u2018We are commonsense farmers and conservatives.\u2019 And he\u2019s told them of the bond he feels with Maine, saying \u201cit felt most like home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to shift the conversation so that people understand, these are the benefits to me, getting away from it being a conversation about global warming to it being about other things people care about in their life,\u201d Friedlander added.\n\nLike heating bills. It\u2019s November. How many times have you already discussed the heating season ahead with neighbors? Or, uh, the credit department at your local heating company?\n\nHEAT PUMP BLOCK PARTIES\n\nSam Saltonstall, who represented Peaks Island on the Sams\u00f8 trip, moved to Peaks in 2007. He and his wife had lived in Portland, but retirement gave them the freedom and flexibility they needed to make the jump to a life on Peaks, which \u201chas its inconveniences but is wonderful,\u201d Saltonstall said. Among the inconveniences; drafty old houses, not uncommon in Maine, obviously, but particularly common on islands. He engaged with his new community by joining the Peaks Environmental Action team and working on energy efficiency projects. He\u2019s helped build storm window inserts (island residents have installed 900 new ones over the last three years), worked with the Island Institute on weatherization efforts like air-sealing homes and formed a heat-pump purchase group. Last year, about 30 homeowners banded together to save on both the price of the pumps and the installation.\n\nOn Sams\u00f8, Saltonstall was most impressed with his visit to one of the four district heating plants, where pipes carry hot water to heat every house in a 270-home community, all of that heat generated in a large barn where hay is constantly being fed into a boiler. \u201cThey made it very inexpensive for people to participate upfront before they started building trenches for the pipe,\u201d Saltonstall said. That system couldn\u2019t work on Peaks, he knows. But the consensus- building that brought that many people together for something that sounded radical but 10 years later seems normal? He thinks he can bring that to bear as he and the College of the Atlantic students move ahead with a multi-pronged approach to education and action on Peaks. They\u2019ll hold meetings on the ins and outs of insulating and air sealing homes, rooftop solar installations, heat pumps and programmable thermostats.\n\n\u201cInvesting in the stock market is a risky business,\u201d Saltonstall said. \u201cBut investing in measures in your own home makes huge sense.\u201d Part of his goal is to get people past the hump of spending money to save money by educating them about purchasing groups and rebates through groups like Efficiency Maine.\n\nCollege senior Saren Peetz, who will be working with Saltonstall on Peaks and has already helped him run one community meeting, said the concerns she heard from Peaks\u2019 residents were mostly financial, but that she was encouraged by how ready islanders seemed to be for creative, collaborative solutions.\n\nThe Sams\u00f8 trip has so inspired the Cleveland native that she\u2019s thinking about forming a consulting business with some of her fellow students to do more of this kind of work. The College of the Atlantic is a school full of great ideas, she said. But they don\u2019t always come to fruition \u2013 like that cool idea she and her classmates had her freshman year to grow and can their own tomatoes for the whole school. This experience might have been born of idealism and dreams of a utopian island far far away, but at this point, it all feels practical. And within reach.\n\n\u201cAt COA I think we have the reputation of staying in the idea part of a project for far too long,\u201d Peetz said. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult for us to actually translate those ideas into concrete change a lot of the time. But I feel like with this class \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it is the people we\u2019re working with or the Island Institute \u2013 but it has the potential to change a lot of people\u2019s lives. People are going to take these ideas and run with them and I think this is going to result in something.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Danish island of Sams\u00f8 becomes a classroom and source of inspiration for a group of Maine students and residents.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The Danish island of Sams\u00f8 becomes a classroom and source of inspiration for a group of Maine students and residents.", "title": "A completely green-powered island gives Mainers ideas - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/528642_870101-samsocoa.jpg", "height": 750}, "updated_time": "2014-11-02T00:17:22-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/11/02/completely-green-powered-island-gives-mainers-ideas/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Danish island of Sams\u00f8 becomes a classroom and source of inspiration for a group of Maine students and residents.", "title": "A completely green-powered island gives Mainers ideas - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/528642_870101-samsocoa.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Source", "published_time": "2014-11-02T03:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-02T00:17:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd110f\"", "article_summary": "ISLAND ENERGY CONFERENCETHE ISLAND INSTITUTE will host the fifth annual Island Energy Conference, a gathering of island leaders and energy experts focused on sharing energy challenges and solutions.\nAnd the Island Institute was flooded with applications from Maine island residents who wanted to participate in what was now known as the Collaborative for Island Energy Research and Action, or CIERA.\nWHEN: Friday to Nov. 9 WHERE: Most sessions at Clarion Hotel, 1230 Congress St., Portland, with an event on Peaks Island as well.\nThey took what was available to them and they used it.\u201dNow the task ahead starts with translating that message for the Maine island dwellers.\nParticipants in the Collaborative for Island Energy Research and Action (CIERA) will share their experiences on both Maine islands and Sams\u00f8 in Denmark."}
