We can thank former President Bill Clinton for perfect clarity in his comments about the chaos and horror of Gaza. In an interview on Indian television, Clinton\u2014who told us in his memoir that Palestinian self-destructiveness (in the form of Yasir Arafat\u2019s various delusions and prevarications) undid his effort to bring about a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict\u2014blames the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s Gaza affiliate, Hamas, for adopting a policy of deliberate self-murder in order to present Israel with a set of impossible dilemmas. \u201cHamas was perfectly well aware of what would happen if they started raining rockets in Israel,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThey fired a thousand of them. And they have a strategy designed to force Israel to kill their own civilians so that the rest of the world will condemn them.\u201d 2. We can thank Hamas for bringing its own form of clarity to this situation. This is the manner in which Hamas works: It builds reinforced bunkers for its leaders (under hospitals and other must-avoid targets) but purposefully neglects to build bomb shelters for the civilians in its putative care. From their bunkers, the leaders order rocket teams to target Israeli civilians. Hamas, which was responsible for the deaths of several hundred Israeli civilians during the second Palestinian uprising alone, has lately been less effective at killing Israelis, but nevertheless, the rockets keep launching. When you repeatedly fire rockets at civilian targets in a neighboring country, that country usually responds militarily. Civilians get killed during the Israeli response in part because Hamas rocket teams operate from sites that are among Gaza's most densely populated, and in part because Hamas stores its weapons in schools and mosques.\n\nThe goal of Hamas\u2014the actual, overarching goal\u2014is to terrorize the Jews of Israel, through mass murder, into abandoning their country. If generations of Palestinians have to be sacrificed to that goal, well, Hamas believes such sacrifices are theologically justified. Related Story What, Exactly, Is Hamas Trying to Prove? 3. Bill Clinton is far from the only Western leader to understand Hamas' strategy. President Obama himself has spoken strongly about Israel's right to self-defense. Here is what he said Wednesday: \"As I\u2019ve said repeatedly, Israel has a right to defend itself from rocket attacks that terrorize the Israeli people. There is no country on Earth that can be expected to live under a daily barrage of rockets.\" Not everyone understands this principle. I am not talking about anti-Jewish propagandists such as Turkey's Tayyip Recep Erdogan, a serial human rights violator who cynically accuses Israel of committing \"genocide.\" I think he understands the principle discussed by Obama and rejects it because Obama is applying it to a Jewish country. I'm talking now about the myopia of otherwise well-meaning people. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the institution that cares for Palestinians but whose actual raison d'\u00eatre is the perpetuation of the stateless status of the descendants of refugees from 1948, recently tweeted this thought to its followers: \u201cPalestinian children in #Gaza are experiencing severe trauma for the 3rd time in 5 years. The effects are lasting.\u201d Entirely, miserably, true. An alternative to this current horrible reality presented itself in 2005, when the Israeli government\u2014after years of foolish and destructive colonization\u2014expelled thousands of Jewish settlers from Gaza and then withdrew its army. The Palestinian leadership could have taken the opportunity created by the Israeli withdrawal to build the nucleus of a state. Instead, Gaza was converted into a rocket-manufacturing and -launching facility. But here\u2019s a bit of good news: The people of Gaza, who suffer from Hamas rule, appear to be tired of it. In a recent Pew poll, 63 percent of Gazans surveyed disapproved of Hamas. Perhaps this is because the people have come to realize that Hamas has brought them nothing but grief, sloganeering, and military defeat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five observations about the Gaza conflict, including praise for an ex-president&#39;s insight into the particular nature of Hamas&#39; evil", "author": "Jeffrey Goldberg", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Five observations about the Gaza conflict, including praise for an ex-president&#39;s insight into the particular nature of Hamas&#39; evil", "title": "Understanding What Hamas Wants", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/07/RTR3I7KF-2/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/understanding-what-hamas-wants/374656/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/jeffreygoldberg182"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c74\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHamas was perfectly well aware of what would happen if they started raining rockets in Israel,\u201d Clinton said.\nCivilians get killed during the Israeli response in part because Hamas rocket teams operate from sites that are among Gaza's most densely populated, and in part because Hamas stores its weapons in schools and mosques.\nBut here\u2019s a bit of good news: The people of Gaza, who suffer from Hamas rule, appear to be tired of it.\nPerhaps this is because the people have come to realize that Hamas has brought them nothing but grief, sloganeering, and military defeat.\nIf generations of Palestinians have to be sacrificed to that goal, well, Hamas believes such sacrifices are theologically justified."}
