What's a Republican to do if he can't, in good conscience, support any of his party's candidates? In this photo, Nebraska fans try to distract Delaware State players with signs of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during the second half of an NCAA college basketball game in Lincoln, Neb., Thursday, Nov. 19, 2015. Nebraska won 75-60. (Nati Harnik/ AP)\n\nSelf-described conservative Barton Swaim has a dirty secret: He likes Bernie Sanders. He really likes him.\n\nHe confessed his crush in a Los Angeles Times op-ed that deemed Sanders more aware than most politicians, Hillary Clinton in particular, that not everyone shares his views. Swaim bases this claim largely on Sanders\u2019s use of prefatory phrases like \u201cin my view,\u201d as opposed to Clinton\u2019s \u201cI think\u201d or \u201cI believe.\u201d (Yes, I\u2019m underwhelmed by the distinction, too.) Of course, Swaim, an admired writer, hastens to clarify that \u201cI would not vote for Sanders under any circumstance.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m a registered Republican, and I could. Or for Clinton, come next November.\n\ntoday\u2019s Tea Party-dominated GOP reality has become [unreal]\n\nNot over rhetorical quibbles, mind you. A revealing Politico survey of strategists and activists in both parties underscores the starkly different universes Democrats and Republicans inhabited. For me, it showed how unreal today\u2019s Tea Party-dominated GOP reality has become.\n\nThe survey found that Democrats regard income inequality as the greatest economic problem facing the country. Republicans, by contrast, worry about economic growth \u2014 so much so that even the deficit came in a distant second. (Politico notes that its survey preceded the Paris terrorist attacks, which could elevate foreign policy in the presidential election.)\n\nA Nevada Democrat explained the party\u2019s worldview: \u201cDemocratic base voters see the country in stark terms: the small group at the top who\u2019ve got it all, and everyone else struggling to make in in a country that won\u2019t even guarantee them modest sick time or family leave.\u201d But most Republicans \u201csaid growing the economy overall was more important than the other priorities listed\u201d in the survey. \u201cNone of the 60 GOP insiders surveyed chose economic inequality as the most important issue.\u201d\n\nMy party isn\u2019t wrong to worry about economic growth. It\u2019s essential to reducing the inequality that haunts Democrats. Progressives like Paul Krugman point out that economic growth vastly improved poor Americans\u2019 living standards before the New Deal created a significant federal safety net. In recent decades, growth has lifted millions around the world out of poverty. Dumb liberals seem unaware of this, or else condemn growth as inevitably harmful to the environment. That\u2019s wrong, and smart liberals \u2014 including Clinton and Sanders \u2014 acknowledge the need for entrepreneurship, which aids growth.\n\nYet Politico\u2019s Republican respondents don\u2019t grasp that growth can be jobs-less, and growth merely for growth\u2019s sake is worthless. Krugman notes that while corporate earnings ultimately rebounded after the financial collapse, jobs didn\u2019t, as companies sat on their money rather than hire workers, wary of wasting cash: Recession-battered consumers weren\u2019t buying what the companies sold. Meanwhile, economic mobility, the American dream even conservatives prize, is no longer the norm in disadvantaged neighborhoods.\n\nOnce upon a time, Republicans understood that growth had to benefit average Americans. Abraham Lincoln believed fervently in private enterprise. But he knew from personal experience that capitalism generated inequality, and he thought government could ease that problem. (So did the pioneering free marketeer, Adam Smith.) Lincoln enacted free farmland for the poor and public universities for the working class, and he subsidized the transcontinental railroad to ensure economic development. It all worked.\n\nAlone among today\u2019s Republican candidates, Ohio Gov. John Kasich seems to share Lincoln\u2019s and Smith\u2019s wisdom. He expanded his state\u2019s Medicaid program under Obamacare and defends the safety net. For now, Kasich languishes in the polls. The leading contenders think they know better than Lincoln and Smith.\n\nto paraphrase conservative icon William Buckley, no one\u2019s saying the Democrats are perfect, just better\u2026\n\nDonald Trump says Americans are overpaid. Marco Rubio commendably proposes tax cuts that would help low- and middle-income earners, but he\u2019d replace Obamacare with inadequate measures and opposes the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, a hedge against financial collapse, and thus against inequality, that\u2019s also pro-growth. Ben Carson also hates Obamacare and babbles half-baked tithing schemes. (More bad news if you\u2019re one of those Republicans worried about the deficit: Pretty much every GOP candidate would swell it with tax cuts.)\n\nThe Democratic candidates have their shortcomings, certainly. But to paraphrase conservative icon William Buckley, no one\u2019s saying the Democrats are perfect, just better TWEET \u2014 better at seeing our real economic problem, better at their willingness, occasionally, to take on knee-jerks in their own party who didn\u2019t sit in the gifted section back in grade school. If things keep up like this, even a Republican might find that worth considering a year from now.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's one year until people will vote in the 2016 presidential election.
