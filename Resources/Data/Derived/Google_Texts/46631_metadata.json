Ward \u2014 checking his locker to see if the league has left him a letter docking his pay. Ward plays full throttle, his relentless pursuit of tackles leaving him straddling between oohs and the NFL\u2019s rules.\n\nOver the past three weeks, the Broncos strong safety has been fined $33,150 for hitting a defenseless receiver, throwing a punch and daring to expose his abs with a short jersey.\n\nSunday night Ward faces the New England Patriots. He remains a villain among their fans after ending tight end Rob Gronkowski\u2019s 2013 season with a hit on his right knee.\n\n\u201cI love playing Gronk. I love playing great competition, especially Gronk. He plays hard, tries to make plays. You have to respect that,\u201d Ward said. \u201cI think he knows that I wasn\u2019t out there trying to hurt him. People think that. But, that\u2019s not how I play.\u201d\n\nWatch Ward crumple a ballcarrier \u2014 the Bears\u2019 Ka\u2019Deem Carey and Martellus Bennett missed Thursday\u2019s game against the Green Bay Packers after absorbing big hits from Ward last week \u2014 and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s a bad man. But is he a bad guy?\n\n\u201cI think the perception of me is misconstrued,\u201d Ward said Thursday. \u201cI am passionate. I think people think I am a bad person. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d\n\nWard recognizes professional football doesn\u2019t reward timidity. He is 5-foot-11, 202 pounds \u2014 15 lighter than last season \u2014 and inflicts pain. He is not trying to break rules. He\u2019s trying to crush dreams, stop drives, prevent first downs.\n\nIf that leaves him in the league\u2019s crosshairs, he can live with it.\n\n\u201cI know the rules and I am going to abide by them,\u201d Ward said. \u201cBut I am not going to slow down or take anything off my game. If it\u2019s a bang-bang play, it becomes a judgment call, and then (the officials and league) can judge me.\u201d\n\nCoach Gary Kubiak doesn\u2019t want Ward to change, beyond the punch at the Chiefs\u2019 Jeremy Maclin, which led to an ejection. Kubiak defended Ward\u2019s strike on the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 T.Y. Hilton, explaining, \u201cHe did what you teach. He got his head out of the play.\u201d\n\nThursday, Kubiak praised Ward\u2019s restraint on Bears running back Jeremy Langford\u2019s crack-back block. It knocked Ward off his feet, and officials \u2014 to the amazement of Broncos\u2019 defenders \u2014 picked up the flag after a conference.\n\n\u201cHe took a shot that was pretty tough, and he kept his composure. We talked about him hanging on there and doing the right thing for the team,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cT.J. is a great player. We need him making all those plays he\u2019s been making.\u201d\n\nProof Ward\u2019s style fits the Broncos new 3-4 defense? He has earned the coaching staff\u2019s defensive player of the game honors multiple times this season, including against the Bears.\n\nWard figures to play a central role this week, along with safeties Darian Stewart and David Bruton, in the coverage of Gronkowski. Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips promised that the Pro Bowler will see plenty of double teams.\n\n\u201c(Cornerback) Aqib (Talib) is top of the line, and Ward is an unbelievable player too,\u201d Gronkowski said. \u201cSo it\u2019s definitely going to be a challenge this week to go versus them.\u201d\n\nWard spent large chunks of snaps last season at middle and weakside linebacker. Phillips\u2019 creativity allows Ward to move throughout the defense, creating pause for receivers going across the middle, while also coming free on blitzes.\n\nWard plays with emotion. He delivers \u2014 56 tackles, two sacks. And sometimes that leads to letters in his locker.\n\n\u201cI love the game. I know I have to be smart,\u201d Ward said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t change the way I play.\u201d\n\nTroy E. Renck: trenck@denverpost.com or @troyrenck\n\nSafety dance\n\nT.J.
