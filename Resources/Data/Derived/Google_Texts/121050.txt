[Kate] McKinnon played Clinton, while Clinton took on the role of a bartender named Val, helping the fake Clinton to blow off steam after 'a rough couple of 22 years.'

Lamenting her flagging campaign, 'Clinton' can be heard complaining 'why won't the people just let me lead, just give me the hammer and nails and let me fix everything?'

As the conversation continues, 'Clinton' turns to potential political rival Trump, moaning that 'all anybody wants to talk about is Donald Trump'.

'Val' shoots back: 'Trump, isn't he the guy that's like.. "ugh, you're all losers," mocking Trump's distinctive accent.

The conversation then turns to whether or not Trump can win the Republican nomination race, with 'Clinton' vowing that 'he must' so that 'I can be the one to take him down'.

McKinnon's Clinton then promises: 'I will destroy him him and mount his hair in the oval office.'

The skit also poked fun at Clinton's political record, in particular her opposition to the Keystone pipeline and her support of gay marriage.

Bartender 'Val' mentions that she opposes the pipeline, and 'Clinton' enthusiastically agrees, adding: 'I took a long time to decide that, I do do believe it.'

A similar criticism was aimed at the real-life Clinton's support for gay marriage after another bartender appears to compliment 'Clinton' on her stance, saying his brother is gay.

'Clinton' then replies, 'well I could have supported it sooner' to which 'Val' responds that she supported it sooner than a lot of people.

With a wink, McKinnon's Clinton then repeated: 'It could have been sooner'.

The sketch also took on Clinton's attempt to appeal to younger people despite being a grandmother, saying she 'must work in Brooklyn' because she seems so with it.
