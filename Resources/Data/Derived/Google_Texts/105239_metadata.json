Adcock said the number of clients has been declining recently due to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cSince the rollout of the Affordable Care Act and open enrollment for Obamacare insurance, Gwinnett Community Clinic has realized a significant decrease in enrollment and requests for services,\u201d Adcock said in a statement. \u201cEffective immediately, no new patient enrollments are being accepted. Current patients may update their qualification for service through October 1. The last clinical appointments will be for October 15, 2015.\u201d\n\nThe non-profit charitable clinic is located at 2160 Fountain Drive in Snellville, on the Eastside Medical Center\u2019s South Campus.\n\nClinic Board of Directors President Pam Kramer told the Gwinnett Daily Post it was bittersweet to see the clinic close because it also mean more people are getting access to health care. She said around 30 percent of the clinic\u2019s patients were able to receive government insurance and were no longer eligible for services.\n\nThe clinic will officially close on Dec. 14, its 26th anniversary, Kramer told the Post. Existing patients will be referred to the Hope Clinic in Lawrenceville.\n\nThrough a partnership with Eastside and volunteer doctors, nurses and support staff, the clinic was able to provide more than $5 million each year in primary care and chronic disease management, Adcock said.\n\nThe clinic was funded by United Way of Greater Atlanta, Kaiser Foundation, Georgia Baptist Healthcare Ministry Foundation, private donations and grants and other supporters.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Snellville, GA Patch", "description": "With the number of uninsured clients declining due to Obamacare, the last appointments at the charitable clinic will be Oct 15.", "title": "With Fewer Clients, Gwinnett Community Clinic to Close Its Doors", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.patch.com/users/64974/2015/07/T800x600/20150755a961a43829a.png", "url": "http://patch.com/georgia/snellville/fewer-clients-gwinnett-community-clinic-close-its-doors-0", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": 116541048368485, "section": "Community Corner", "published_time": "2015-07-17T16:16:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-17T16:16:01-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521361477908471}, "description": "Snellville, GA - With the number of uninsured clients declining due to Obamacare, the last appointments at the charitable clinic will be Oct 15.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Gwinnett Community Clinic will close its doors this fall, its executive director said in a statement emailed Thursday.\nClinic Board of Directors President Pam Kramer told the Gwinnett Daily Post it was bittersweet to see the clinic close because it also mean more people are getting access to health care.\nWith the number of uninsured clients declining due to Obamacare, the last appointments at the charitable clinic will be Oct 15.\nThe clinic will officially close on Dec. 14, its 26th anniversary, Kramer told the Post.\n\u201cSince the rollout of the Affordable Care Act and open enrollment for Obamacare insurance, Gwinnett Community Clinic has realized a significant decrease in enrollment and requests for services,\u201d Adcock said in a statement."}
