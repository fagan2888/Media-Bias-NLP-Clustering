The 32-year-old Tyrone, Ga. native has been on the team longer than anybody on the roster.\n\nGolston, in his 10th season, has played in 128 games for the Redskins and recorded 212 tackles and seven sacks.\n\nAfter breaking his left hand in the team\u2019s Week 3 loss to the New York Giants, Golston was inactive on Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nEarlier in the week, Golston talked about cars, country music and what he would be doing if he was not playing football in this week\u2019s Sunday chat.\n\nQ: If you were not playing football, what would you be doing?\n\nA: I could have seen myself being a teacher or something in the military. Probably health or physical education. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be the cool gym teacher, but I like being around kids. I know the role teachers and coaches played in my life and influencing me in a positive way. To be able to spend that much time around kids and mold them at an age where they\u2019re so impressionable, that would be good.\n\nQ: What are you memories from your NFL debut?\n\nA: It was September 11, [2006], we were playing the Minnesota Vikings on Monday Night Football. I was playing against [guard]Steve Hutchinson, who had just signed a huge deal the year before that and it was the most fun I had ever had in a football game in my life. Not still, but it\u2019s up there in top five. I only played maybe 10 or 12 snaps, but my family was there. It was almost like a larger-than-life moment, not knowing if I was gonna make the team, being in that limbo part of your life where you don\u2019t know, you can be back home or playing football. It was a phenomenal feeling.\n\nQ: Were you nervous?\n\nA: I was nervous, but sometimes ignorance is bliss. I just went out there, really just tried to play as fast and hard as I could. I had a decent game. We ended up losing the game, but my family was there, you could see the joy in their face. It was achieving a life-long dream, a childhood dream to play in the NFL.\n\nQ: What is your most embarrassing moment on the football field?\n\nA: One time in my rookie year, I was super tired. I was running down the field and at the end of the play, I just dove on the ground because I was that tired. You could see it on film, just me diving on the ground, away from the play. I was like., \u2018What are you doing man, you\u2019re an idiot.\u2019\n\nQ: How often do you eat a cheat meal and what is your favorite?\n\nA: Too much. I enjoy food. I\u2019d have to say, pizza, wings, french fries, just bad stuff. I\u2019m a big hot dog guy.\n\nQ: How would you fare in the Nathan\u2019s Hot Dog Eating contest?\n\nA: That would just get out of hand. I like to enjoy it. In the course of a cookout, it ain\u2019t nothing to eat six to eight hot dogs.\n\nQ: What\u2019s your favorite type of music?\n\nA: I\u2019m a huge country fan. Zac Brown and Jason Aldean. I listen to Christian rap, worship music, pretty much all music. As long as the lyrics aren\u2019t too vulgar. I like music, I can respect it all. A little Kenny G.\n\nQ: What are you watching on Netflix?\n\nA: Orange is the New Black. I just got into the whole Netflix thing. I watched all of Breaking Bad in the offseason. I like Street Outlaws and Gas Monkey Garage.\n\nQ: What\u2019s your favorite car?\n\nA: I love trucks. I have a jacked up Silverado right now. I just recently purchased a 1975 Caprice convertible. I can\u2019t enjoy that now. But I like all cars. If I had to say, that is a thing of mine. I\u2019m not into clothes, not into jewelry. Cars, four wheelers, motorcycles. I like being outside.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Golston has been on the Redskins longer than anybody on the roster, but what would he be doing if he wasn't playing football?
