Ellen Roberts, R-Durango, and Sen. Irene Aguilar, D-Denver, have expressed interest in looking at waivers \u2014 Section 1332 of the act \u2014 as a way to improve Connect for Health Colorado, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace.\n\nRoberts, who leads the Colorado exchange\u2019s legislative oversight committee, recently formed a seven-member working group to mull over innovation waivers this summer.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any time to lose if we are going to make legislative changes,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocrats talk about tweaks, while Republicans have advocated for big changes, up to and including repeal of the state exchange and Obamacare. But other Republicans want to strategize in case the act survives. They don\u2019t necessarily want to abandon the state exchange if the alternative is the federal version.\n\nStates will have the authority to seek exemption from the ACA\u2019s individual mandates, from employer penalties for not providing coverage and from benefits considered part of comprehensive coverage.\n\nStates could toss out their exchanges and take an entirely different tack. As long as federal authorities agree states can meet the primary goals of the act \u2014 more insured, comprehensive coverage and affordable premiums \u2014 states still get the subsidies.\n\nFor example, a state could take all the federal money available to subsidize health insurance premiums, co-pays and tax credits for small businesses and use it to pay for a coverage plan of its own design.\n\nColorado is one of 14 states that, along with the District of Columbia, chose to run their own marketplace. But the exchange just survived a bruising second enrollment period that saw roughly 10 percent of applicants snared in technical hang-ups that took months to resolve.\n\n\u201cConsumer confusion and frustration are a widespread thing across most of these exchanges,\u201d said Dick Cauchi, health program director for the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAnd questions about the exchange\u2019s financial sustainability loom large now that federal startup grants have ended.\n\nUnrest is widespread. This year, according to a March 6 analysis by the NCSL, at least 11 states have proposed bills to end their state-run exchanges or prohibit forming them. And at least 10 states have proposed bills to convert their federally facilitated marketplaces into state-run or state-federal partnership exchanges.\n\nIn late January, 24 Colorado Republicans legislators unsuccessfully sponsored a bill to repeal the state exchange, which had been created by a bipartisan effort in 2011.\n\nJonathan Lockwood of Advancing Colorado, a free-market advocacy group, said although he opposed the ACA, the time for \u201cstomping your feet and calling for repeal\u201d is probably over. \u201cAt least with running the exchange at the state level, we have been able to keep tabs on what is going on.\u201d\n\nMany think a state exchange beats the alternative.\n\n\u201cI still think we\u2019re better off in Colorado with a state-based exchange,\u201d said board member Steve ErkenBrack, president of Grand Junction-based Rocky Mountain Health Plans. \u201cWhen problems arise, we can fix them at the state level. We set this up to be a marketplace, not a government entity. The consumers want it. The carriers want it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear in Colorado, as it is for most of the state-based exchanges formed under the ACA, what kind of exchange will survive the loss of heavy federal funding and political fallout.\n\n\u201cStates can use the waivers to chip around the edges \u2014 it can be a small tweak \u2014 or to make big changes,\u201d said Jeff Bontrager, the Colorado Health Institute director of research on coverage and access. \u201cBut they need to start their planning processes if they want to be out of the gate in 2017. The way we read it, though, there is no deadline. A state could decide \u2026 and apply down the road, if the ACA and its subsidies still stand as the law.\n\nTo qualify for an innovation waiver, the state must establish that its reform plan would provide good coverage at affordable rates, and Roberts said convincing federal authorities of that will be the hard part. But she\u2019s ready to get the ball rolling.\n\n\u201cIts our reading of the law that legislation would be needed to grant the state authority to apply for the waiver,\u201d Bontrager said.\n\nA state that is granted a waiver can fund reforms using the amount of federal funding that otherwise would have been paid out in the state for premium tax credits, cost-reduction payments and small-business tax credits.\n\nVermont was the first state to announce it wanted a 1332 waiver. It looked at creating a single-payer system. The state since has found the plan is too costly \u2014 pricier than the $275 million it would have under ACA.\n\nOther states looking at proposals include Hawaii, New Mexico, Arkansas and Minnesota, Bontrager said.\n\nThere is wide latitude under the waivers to retool reform, but legislators, while they could modify benefits, couldn\u2019t do away with the ACA\u2019s basic goals, such as protection for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nBut states could reduce or eliminate penalties on the uninsured and on businesses that don\u2019t offer coverage.\n\nStates could find different ways \u2014 such as vouchers or savings plans \u2014 to subsidize plan premiums other than the confusing tax credits in place.\n\nElecta Draper: 303-954-1276, edraper@denverpost.com or twitter.com/electadraper", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado exchange could change a little or a lot under waivers", "title": "Colorado exchange could change a little or a lot under waivers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/20/colorado-exchange-could-change-a-little-or-a-lot-under-waivers/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-20T20:14:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-20T20:14:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Democrats talk about tweaks, while Republicans have advocated for big changes, up to and including repeal of the state exchange and Obamacare.\nRoberts, who leads the Colorado exchange\u2019s legislative oversight committee, recently formed a seven-member working group to mull over innovation waivers this summer.\n\u201cAt least with running the exchange at the state level, we have been able to keep tabs on what is going on.\u201dMany think a state exchange beats the alternative.\nThey don\u2019t necessarily want to abandon the state exchange if the alternative is the federal version.\nIn late January, 24 Colorado Republicans legislators unsuccessfully sponsored a bill to repeal the state exchange, which had been created by a bipartisan effort in 2011."}
