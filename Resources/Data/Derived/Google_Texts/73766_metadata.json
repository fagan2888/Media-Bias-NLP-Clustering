Children with autism are also more likely to seek mental health treatment at the emergency room, researchers found.\n\nTo accommodate the population, several hospitals now offer calming aids like toys and iPads, dim lighting and quiet waiting rooms, according to the KHN-CNN piece. A pilot program for autistic children Nemours Children's Hospital in Orlando, Florida will offer patients and their families a separate play or waiting area, as well as headphones and other sensory tools to help children calm themselves if they become overstimulated. The hospital also intends to limit the number of people in rooms for testing and other procedures.\n\nChildren's hospitals in New Jersey, District of Columbia, New York, Pennsylvania, Indiana and South Carolina are undertaking similar measures, according to the KHN-CNN article.\n\nThe number of children diagnosed with autism continues to grow--the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates one in 45 children was diagnosed in 2014, up from 1 in 150 in 2000, KHN-CNN reported.\n\nA study published in January in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders showed that autistic adults are also more likely to seek treatment at the emergency room, so the changes are even more far-reaching.\n\nThe cost to update protocols and train staff to work with autistic patients doesn't have to be expensive, according to KHN-CNN. Autism Speaks, an advocacy group for people with ASD, has subsidized the training for some, according to the article.\n\n\"You can adapt your protocol without changing drastically,\" Joann Migyanka, an associate professor at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, told KHN-CNN. \"Some of it is slow down. That's difficult in an emergency department but ... if you slow down a bit, and give them a bit of time, in the long run, you will save time.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the KHN-CNN article\n\n- here's the study abstract from Pediatrics\n\n- check out the CDC report (.pdf)\n\n- here's the study abstract from JADD\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPediatric ER seeks to limit stressors for autistic patients\n\nEHRs improve screening rates for autism\n\nCalifornia payers delay compliance with autism coverage requirements", "article_metadata": {"description": "A small but growing number of emergency rooms across the country are working to accommodate patients with autism, a neurological disorder that impacts communication skills,\u00a0according to\u00a0a\u00a0Kaiser Health News\u00a0piece published by\u00a0CNN.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A small but growing number of emergency rooms across the country are working to accommodate patients with autism, a neurological disorder that impacts communication skills,\u00a0according to\u00a0a\u00a0Kaiser Health News\u00a0piece published by\u00a0CNN.", "title": "More ERs aim to improve experience for autistic patients", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/more-ers-aim-improve-experience-autistic-patients/2016-03-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "autism,Autism Spectrum Disorder,Care Delivery,emergency rooms,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The cost to update protocols and train staff to work with autistic patients doesn't have to be expensive, according to KHN-CNN.\nChildren with autism are also more likely to seek mental health treatment at the emergency room, researchers found.\nTo accommodate the population, several hospitals now offer calming aids like toys and iPads, dim lighting and quiet waiting rooms, according to the KHN-CNN piece.\nA pilot program for autistic children Nemours Children's Hospital in Orlando, Florida will offer patients and their families a separate play or waiting area, as well as headphones and other sensory tools to help children calm themselves if they become overstimulated.\nA study published in January in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders showed that autistic adults are also more likely to seek treatment at the emergency room, so the changes are even more far-reaching."}
