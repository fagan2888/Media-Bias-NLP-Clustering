Rick Perry that he\u2019s dropping out of the crowded GOP contest for 2016.\n\nCruz packed the ballroom Saturday morning at the Airport Marriott when he addressed this weekend\u2019s Eagle Forum convention, called the Eagle Council.\n\nThe Texas senator warned the crowd that conservatives' best hope of getting a like-minded nominee is to coalesce behind one candidate -- preferably him -- rather than to continue being split among several candidates.\n\nOtherwise, he asserted, a moderate might end up getting the GOP nomination -- which Cruz contended could lead to defeat in 2016.\n\nReferring to the Democratic field, he joked their party was in even more disarray, consisting of \"a wild-eyed socialist with ideas that are dangerous for America and the world \u2014 and Bernie Sanders.\"\n\nThe \"socialist\" appeared to be a jab at Hillary Clinton.\n\nIf elected president, Cruz promised to swiftly act to investigate and defund Planned Parenthood, eliminate the IRS, abolish the Department of Education and press for a flat income tax.\n\nBut to do all that, Cruz said he needs the support of committed conservatives like Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly and her allies.\n\n\u201cThis is a room of warriors,\u201d Cruz said, igniting cheers. \u201cThis is a room of women and men who charge into battle to defend liberty with a knife between your teeth, over broken glass, with fire coming over your head.\u201d\n\nCruz implied that he was prepared to take that approach in the coming weeks, as he seeks to force Congress to strip $500 million from the federal budget that goes to Planned Parenthood to cover family-planning and well-women services for the poor under the federal Medicaid program.\n\nCruz hints at government shutdown\n\nIf that fight forces a government shutdown, Cruz says that it would be President Barack Obama\u2019s fault, because he has promised to veto any budget that strips out Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding.\n\nAlthough the private agency\u2019s money doesn\u2019t go for abortion, Cruz and abortion opponents contend that Planned Parenthood uses the federal money to help bolster its overall operation as the nation\u2019s largest private provider of contraceptives and abortion services. Abortion opponents also have accused Planned Parenthood of breaking the law because of videos produced by undercover abortion opponents that imply that some Planned Parenthood officials or state agencies may be improperly profiting from the remains of aborted fetuses donated for scientific research.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has denied any misconduct, and so far no state investigations have produced evidence of illegal behavior.\n\nEven so, most the Republican presidential field -- notably Cruz and Santorum -- puts opposition to abortion and Planned Parenthood among top issues.\n\nSantorum, in particular, sought to highlight their differences in a later speech Saturday before the convention, a sign that the duo continues to duel over who\u2019s most committed to the conservative fight.\n\nSantorum appeared to acknowledge that he\u2019s trailing, at least for now. One potential sign: the former Pennsylvania senator attracted far fewer listeners Saturday than Cruz.\n\nFormer Missouri Eagle Forum president Lois Linton said in an interview that many members have affection for Santorum, but don\u2019t believe he has enough money or a strong enough campaign operation to be successful.\n\nMany conventioneers view Cruz, she added, \u201cas the only strong Republican senator standing for the principles that made American great.\u201d\n\nCruz issues list of Missouri backers\n\nAt a news conference afterward, Cruz contended that if elected, he\u2019d be \u201ca strong leader who will defend the Constitution, who will kill the terrorists, repeal Obamacare and stand up for the Bill of Rights.\u201d\n\nHis campaign sought to highlight his Missouri strength by issuing a list of 30 state GOP allies. The co-chairs include former state Sen. Jim Lembke of Lemay and former state Rep. Carl Bearden of St. Charles County.\n\nBut Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, contended that Cruz was all talk, and little action. He asserted that Cruz, in the Senate only since 2013, \u201cscreams and hollers, and gets nothing done.\u201d\n\nSantorum, who served in the Senate for 12 years before losing in 2006, said his own record shows that he has fought longer and harder on a number of issues, including abortion, education and immigration.\n\nOn immigration, for example, Santorum said Cruz actually had embraced certain provisions sought by business that would allow some foreign workers into the country to fill certain jobs, hurting American workers.\n\n\u201cIn the last 25 years, wages in America have flat-lined,\u2019\u2019 Santorum said. He asserted that legal and illegal immigration were partly to blame.\n\nSantorum calls for focus on workers\n\nSpeaking broadly, Santorum contended that most of the Republican presidential field is too pro-business \u2013 in practice and in rhetoric.\n\n\u201cNinety percent of workers in America do not own their own business,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cYet, if you listen to any Republican get up on stage, all they talk about is small business and business. You\u2019re talking to about 10 percent of Americans and then we wonder why we don\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nSantorum dismissed the talk of some that 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney lost because he alienated evangelicals, who stayed home.\n\nIn truth, said Santorum, it was the conservative blue-collar workers who failed to vote in 2012. They feel abandoned by Obama and the Democrats, he said, but are alienated by Republicans.\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to look to a party who never talks about them,\u2019\u2019 Santorum said. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to care about us, if we show we care about them.\u201d\n\nSantorum also showed Saturday that he cares about Missouri's presidential delegates. He stopped by the state GOP's executive committee meeting, held in Westport Plaza, to speak briefly with state party leaders. The committee gave its final approval to changes that will allocate most of the state's 52 delegates by congressional district, unless one candidate wins more than 50 percent of the statewide vote.\n\nThe number of delegates at stake is slightly smaller than state party leaders had expected Missouri would be allocated, based on the national party's formula.\n\nBack at the Eagle Forum's convention, attendees also heard from presidential candidate Rand Paul, R-Ky. But his evening remarks centered almost exclusively on his mother, Carol Paul, who received the group's Homemaker of the Year award. Her husband, former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, also attended, but sat quietly and proudly at his wife's side.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz is portraying himself as fellow conservatives\u2019 best hope for transforming the federal government if he becomes", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/cruz-santorum-duel-conservative-gop-support", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kwmu/files/styles/medium/public/201509/eagle_forum_crowd.jpeg", "type": "article", "description": "Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz is portraying himself as fellow conservatives\u2019 best hope for transforming the federal government if he becomes", "title": "Cruz, Santorum duel for conservative GOP support"}, "story_id": 439838607, "twitter": {"site": "@stlpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jmannies"}, "author": "Jo Mannies", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Cruz, Santorum duel for conservative GOP support"}, "nid": 48483, "datePublished": "2015-09-12", "keywords": "Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, Election 2016", "wordCount": 1214, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd904f\"", "article_summary": "Even so, most the Republican presidential field -- notably Cruz and Santorum -- puts opposition to abortion and Planned Parenthood among top issues.\nSantorum calls for focus on workersSpeaking broadly, Santorum contended that most of the Republican presidential field is too pro-business \u2013 in practice and in rhetoric.\nRepublican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz is portraying himself as fellow conservatives\u2019 best hope for transforming the federal government if he becomes president.\nOtherwise, he asserted, a moderate might end up getting the GOP nomination -- which Cruz contended could lead to defeat in 2016.\nPlanned Parenthood has denied any misconduct, and so far no state investigations have produced evidence of illegal behavior."}
