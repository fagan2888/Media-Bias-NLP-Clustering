The average income of the top 10 percent was 9.6 times higher than the bottom 10 percent, the OECD found. In the U.S., it was 19 times higher.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cWe have reached a tipping point,\u201d said OECD secretary-general \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda. \u201cThe evidence shows that high inequality is bad for growth. The case for policy action is as much economic as social. By not addressing inequality, governments are cutting into the social fabric of their countries and hurting their long-term economic growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn recent decades, as much as 40% of the population at the lower end of the distribution has benefited little from economic growth in many countries,\u201d the study found. \u201cIn some cases, low earners have even seen their incomes fall in real terms. When such a large group in the population gains so little from economic growth, the social fabric frays and trust in institutions is weakened.\u201d\n\nWorking conditions have also deteriorated, largely due to the rise of a \u201cnon-standard\u201d economy that incentivizes part-time work, self-employment, and temporary contracting.\n\n\u201cBetween 1995 and 2013, more than 50 percent of all jobs created in OECD countries fell into these categories,\u201d the OECD stated in a press release on Thursday. \u201cLow-skilled temporary workers, in particular, have much lower and instable earnings than permanent workers.\u201d\n\nHowever, the study found that an increase in the number of women working \u201chelped stem the rise in inequality, despite their being about 16% less likely to be in paid work and earn about 15% less than men.\u201d\n\nInequality is highest in Chile, Mexico, the United States, Turkey, and Israel. It is lowest in Denmark, Slovenia, Slovak Republic and Norway.\n\nHigher inequality also drags down economic growth by making opportunities more scant for the bottom 40 percent and often preventing low-income children from receiving quality education, or enough of it. The long-term rise of inequality \u201chas indeed put a significant brake on long-term growth,\u201d from developed nations to emerging economies, the OECD found.\n\n\u201cIf the bottom loses ground, everyone is losing ground,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe OECD recommends a wide range of solutions to reverse the growing wealth gap, including removing the obstacles that prevent mothers from working; doing more to provide youth with useful skills and allow workers to continue updating those skills over time; and redistribute wealth through taxes and transfers, which the report describes as a \u201cpowerful instrument to contribute to more equality and more growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn recent decades, the effectiveness of redistribution mechanisms has been weakened in many countries,\u201d the OECD states. \u201cTo address this, policies need to ensure that wealthier individuals, but also multinational firms, pay their share of the tax burden.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "'When such a large group in the population gains so little from economic growth, the social fabric frays and trust in institutions is weakened.'", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Nadia Prupis | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "'When such a large group in the population gains so little from economic growth, the social fabric frays and trust in institutions is weakened.'", "title": "Growing Global Inequality Gap 'Has Reached A Tipping Point'", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/growing-global-inequality-gap-has-reached-a-tipping-point/205915/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Poverty-in-America.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-22T11:24:31-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'When such a large group in the population gains so little from economic growth, the social fabric frays and trust in institutions is weakened.'", "title": "Growing Global Inequality Gap 'Has Reached A Tipping Point'", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Poverty-in-America.jpg", "creator": "@nadiaprupis", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "wealth gap", "published_time": "2015-05-23T05:00:59-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-22T11:24:31-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "In its 34 member states, income inequality has reached record highs, the OECD found in its study, In It Together: Why Less Inequality Benefits All.\nThe long-term rise of inequality \u201chas indeed put a significant brake on long-term growth,\u201d from developed nations to emerging economies, the OECD found.\n\u201cBetween 1995 and 2013, more than 50 percent of all jobs created in OECD countries fell into these categories,\u201d the OECD stated in a press release on Thursday.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\u201cWe have reached a tipping point,\u201d said OECD secretary-general \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda.\nHigher inequality also drags down economic growth by making opportunities more scant for the bottom 40 percent and often preventing low-income children from receiving quality education, or enough of it."}
