REUTERS/Gus Ruelas\n\n4132378\n\nMuch has been made about new \u201cTonight Show\u201d host Jimmy Fallon\u2019s supposed liberal inclinations, but Wednesday night he had no problem ripping Obamacare and needling President Obama over his handling of Ukraine.\n\nFallon\u2019s humorous assault took the form of a fictional phone call between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cLook, don\u2019t you see what you\u2019re doing though? You\u2019re forcing people to accept something that the majority of them don\u2019t even want,\u201d the actor playing Obama tells Putin, referring to Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d responds Fallon, playing Putin. \u201cIn Russia we have word for this: Obamacare.\u201d\n\nFallon also needled Obama\u2019s impotent handling of the Ukraine situation more broadly.\n\n\u201cSo look, Vlad, just to recap our call, no progress was made here, right?\u201d the Obama character says at the end of the skit.\n\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d Fallon\u2019s Putin responds.\n\n\u201cOkay. Take care,\u201d the faux Obama says before hanging up.\n\nIn real life, over the past month President Obama has spent over four hours on the phone with Putin discussing the situation in Ukraine. So far, those phone calls do not seem to have yielded any substantive accomplishments.\n\nFollow Jamie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jamie Weinstein", "description": "Much has been made about new \"Tonight Show\" host Jimmy Fallon's supposed liberal inclinations, but Tuesday night he had no problem ripping Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Much has been made about new \"Tonight Show\" host Jimmy Fallon's supposed liberal inclinations, but Wednesday night he had no problem ripping Obamacare and needling President Obama over his handling of", "title": "Jimmy Fallon TURNS on buddy Obama, RIPS Obamacare", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/20/jimmy-fallon-dings-obamacare-as-unpopular-mocks-obamas-feckless-handling-of-ukraine/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-18T205032Z_1_CBREA1H1LXR00_RTROPTP_4_USA-e1395322209441.jpg", "height": 344}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'In Russia we have word for this: Obamacare'", "title": "Jimmy Fallon dings Obamacare as unpopular, mocks Obama\u2019s feckless handling of Ukraine Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/20/jimmy-fallon-dings-obamacare-as-unpopular-mocks-obamas-feckless-handling-of-ukraine/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-18T205032Z_1_CBREA1H1LXR00_RTROPTP_4_USA-e1395322209441.jpg"}, "creator": "@Jamie_Weinstein", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-20 00:24:47", "sailthru.title": "Jimmy Fallon dings Obamacare as unpopular, mocks Obama's feckless handling of Ukraine", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "jimmy-fallon,jamie-weinstein", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "jimmy fallon", "sailthru.description": "Much has been made about new \"Tonight Show\" host Jimmy Fallon's supposed liberal inclinations, but Wednesday night he had no problem ripping Obamacare and needling President Obama over his handling of", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-18T205032Z_1_CBREA1H1LXR00_RTROPTP_4_USA-e1395322209441.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Jimmy Fallon, host of \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\", takes part in a panel discussion at the NBC portion of the 2014 Winter Press Tour for the Television Critics Association in Pasadena, California, January 19, 2014.\n\u201cIn Russia we have word for this: Obamacare.\u201dFallon also needled Obama\u2019s impotent handling of the Ukraine situation more broadly.\nREUTERS/Gus Ruelas4132378Much has been made about new \u201cTonight Show\u201d host Jimmy Fallon\u2019s supposed liberal inclinations, but Wednesday night he had no problem ripping Obamacare and needling President Obama over his handling of Ukraine.\nFallon\u2019s humorous assault took the form of a fictional phone call between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nIn real life, over the past month President Obama has spent over four hours on the phone with Putin discussing the situation in Ukraine."}
