Tuition for the programs start around $1,200 for careers that can have a starting salary of up to $15 per hour.\n\nCareers in the health care field have been expanding in the past few years due in part to the Affordable Health Care Act, which resulted in there being more people in the state covered by insurance.\n\n\u201cThe industry needs more workers to help fill the need for the new insured patients who are coming into the system,\u201d said Leonardo Guerra, the director of the Danbury facility, which includes several classrooms, as well as a laboratory and a computer room for certification testing. \u201cOur students can take their test right here on our premises and know immediately if they passed. Usually, they are doing cartwheels through the room when it happens.\u201d\n\nGuerra noted that the courses provided by the school can help launch area residents into a new career that is ripe with advancement possibilities as additional certification is obtained.\n\n\u201cEven during bad economic times, there is always a need for more health care workers,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the state Department of Labor, more than 13,179 Danbury area residents were working in the health care industry last year. That\u2019s a more than 13 percent increase since 2009, when the department reported that about 11,639 people in the area worked in health care.\n\nWorkers in the field can expect an average salary of about $54,870, according to the department. Nationally, the need for phlebotomists alone is expected to increase by 27 percent during the next 10 years, while the need for nursing assistants is expected to grow by about 21 percent during the same time period, according to national labor statistics.\n\n\u201cWithin a relatively short period of time, people can train for a new career that will continue to be in demand for many years to come,\u201d said Chesney. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to get into the profession.\u201d\n\ndperrefort@newstimes.com", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "\u201cThe industry needs more workers to help fill the need for the new insured patients who are coming into the system,\u201d said Leonardo Guerra, the director of the Danbury facility, which includes several classrooms, as well as a laboratory and a computer room for certification testing.
