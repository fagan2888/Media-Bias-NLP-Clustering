North Carolina is basically a pariah now,\u201d the 71-year-old told The Daily Beast. These people don\u2019t understand what humanity is. They don\u2019t have an evolutionary bone in their body.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nDeVito is the latest liberal luminary to chime in on North Carolina\u2019s so-called \u201cbathroom bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the people of North Carolina need to rise up against all this legislation, because it\u2019s ludicrous to be discriminating against folks,\u201d he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act removes discrimination protection from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in public facilities. The law has caused some controversy because it forbids transgender men and boys from using women\u2019s public bathrooms and locker rooms if they self-identify as female. The law also bars local governments from granting transgender people the right to use whatever public facilities they choose.\n\n\u201cBruce Springsteen canceled a concert down there, and it\u2019s kind of divesting,\u201d DeVito said, referencing the musician\u2019s decision to drop his April 10 concert in Greensboro, North Carolina. Springsteen said the cancellation was in support of the \u201cfight against prejudice and bigotry.\u201d\n\nDeVito\u2019s latest on-screen feature is a short film, Curmudgeons, which sees DeVito professing his love for an angry old man (David Margulies) in a retirement home.\n\nDevito added:\n\nIt\u2019s the way it works in the world, it seems to be, because people are so invested in money\u2014and so invested in capitalism\u2014the only way to get people to wake up is to divest and say, \u201cLook, we\u2019re not going to do business with you if you\u2019re going to treat people like second-class citizens and not give them their basic human rights.\u201d\n\nOver the past couple months, Danny DeVito has been an enthusiastic celebrity surrogate for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\n\nFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Danny DeVito called NC's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act a \"ridiculous\" law that treats transgender people as second-class citizens.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Danny DeVito called NC's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act a \"ridiculous\" law that treats transgender people as second-class citizens.", "title": "Danny DeVito: NC's Bathroom Law Treats Transgenders as 'Second-Class Citizens'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Danny-DeVito-getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/05/02/danny-devito-north-carolinas-bathroom-privacy-law-treats-transgender-people-like-second-class-citizens/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Danny DeVito called NC's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act a \"ridiculous\" law that treats transgender people as second-class citizens.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Danny-DeVito-getty.jpg", "title": "Danny DeVito: NC's Bathroom Law Treats Transgenders as 'Second-Class Citizens'", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Danny Devito, North Carolina, North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, Transgender,Big Hollywood,Danny DeVito", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Transgender", "published_time": "2016-05-02T10:23:50-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "North Carolina\u2019s Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act removes discrimination protection from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in public facilities.\nNorth Carolina is basically a pariah now,\u201d the 71-year-old told The Daily Beast.\nThe law also bars local governments from granting transgender people the right to use whatever public facilities they choose.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDanny DeVito called North Carolina\u2019s Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act a \u201cridiculous\u201d law from a state full of people who do not \u201cunderstand what humanity is.\u201d\u201cOh my god, it\u2019s ridiculous.\n\u201cBruce Springsteen canceled a concert down there, and it\u2019s kind of divesting,\u201d DeVito said, referencing the musician\u2019s decision to drop his April 10 concert in Greensboro, North Carolina."}
