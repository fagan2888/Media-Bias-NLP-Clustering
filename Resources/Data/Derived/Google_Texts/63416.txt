Police are looking for two men reportedly connected to a stabbing early Saturday morning in north Wichita.

Officers were called around 3:30 a.m. to an argument between a couple in the 3300 block of North Waco.

Sgt. Roger Runft saida 39-year-old woman and 36-year-old man were arguing in the home when the woman's two sons got physical with the man.

One of the sons allegedly pulled a knife and stabbed the man at least five times. He was taken to a nearby hospital with serious injuries.

Officers have not yet located the 19- and 20-year-old suspects, but know who they are. Runft said the suspects are not related to the victim.
