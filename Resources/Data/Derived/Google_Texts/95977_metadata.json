Due to Anschutz\u2019s tax exempt status, it can be a slick problem, but one researcher Gregory Tung is aiming to answer with a new grant.\n\n\u201cNow, because of the Affordable Care Act, there are all sorts of changes moving forward. Hospitals are going to be required to do a whole new range of activities and not just provide charity care, but think about other ways of interfacing with the community,\u201d Tung said. \u201cBut what that actually looks like? Nobody really knows yet.\u201d\n\nDr. Gregory Tung poses for a portrait March 11, in Downtown Denver. Dr. Tung, an assistant professor at the Colorado School of Public Health at CU Anschutz, was recently awarded a$250,000 grant and will be leading the new community Health Impact Assessment, to analyze how a nonprofit hospital like Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado can better benefit the community it serves. (Philip B. Poston/Aurora Sentinel) Building 500 houses the Colorado School of Public Health at CU Anschutz, which was recently awarded $250,000 grant from the Health Impact Project to perform Health Impact Assessments which will analyze how a nonprofit hospital can become most efficient to benefit the community it serves.\n\nTung, an assistant professor at the Colorado School of Public Health at CU Anschutz, is spearheading a new initiative targeted at providing an answer to that question. Through a recently awarded $250,000 grant provided by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and The Pew Charitable Trust, Tung will be spending the next two years analyzing how a nonprofit hospital like Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado can better benefit the community it serves. Mainly, that means finding ways to provide resources for Aurora residents apart from just occasionally providing free health care services.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s tons of money, like $50 billion a year that\u2019s spent on nonprofit community hospital benefit activities, and in the past almost all of that has been directed towards charity care, or basically providing free care,\u201d he said.\n\nThe $250,000 grant will also see a matching $100,000 contribution from several other entities at CU Anschutz.\n\nTung explained that new guidelines outlined in the ACA will soon require hospitals to serve the community through more robust mechanisms than just providing free care, though what those mechanisms are exactly remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe ACA\u2019s new and the specific requirements and rules about what hospitals are supposed to be doing are still being written,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IRS are kind of going through this stage process of bringing out new rules, so this interfacing of the community is still totally new.\u201d\n\nTo try and provide an answer in the meantime, Tung and his team will be focusing on two Health Impact Assessments \u2014 studies on specific initiatives intended to inform later policy making decisions \u2014 on issues immediately relevant to those served by Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. With the possibility of more HIAs down the road, the first outlined in Tung\u2019s grant proposal will focus on preventing youth and gang violence in Aurora Public Schools and the second on drafting recommendations for policies tied to marijuana use and its relation to child abuse and neglect.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of unanswered questions relating to marijuana, across the full spectrum,\u201d Tung said. \u201cOur potential focus is looking at, \u2018how should this be operationalized within child welfare decision making?\u2019 I don\u2019t think there are clear answers just yet, so that\u2019s the space that we\u2019re trying to inform.\u201d\n\nAnd informing marijuana policy is an area in which Tung is uniquely familiar. Last year, he led another HIA through Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, which made recommendations for and eventually resulted in state legislators enacting stricter limits on the packaging of recreational marijuana in order to keep it out of the reach of minors. The HIA was the only one in the country to be justified within a hospital\u2019s (Children\u2019s) community benefit activities.\n\n\u201cThere was lots of interest in that and the state was very responsive, ultimately adopting those recommendations, so it was cool,\u201d Tung said.\n\nIn his report, Tung found that after the use and sale of medical marijuana grew rapidly in Colorado between Oct. 2009 and Dec. 2011, the number of children under the age of 12 who tested positive for marijuana at Children\u2019s Hospital significantly increased.\n\nThough the ink is barely dry on the new grant, Tung said he\u2019s excited about the possibility his new HIA\u2019s could have not only for Anschutz, but other hospitals around the country.\n\nHe is expected to make his first recommendations related to his two initial HIAs in about 18 months.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Aurora Sentinel", "description": "Tung and his team will be focusing on two Health Impact Assessments", "title": "Grant will reveal what Aurora charity hospitals can provide beyond health care - Aurora Sentinel", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.aurorasentinel.com/asuplads/WELL.Community-Hospital.031115.0002.WEB_.jpg", "height": 400}, "updated_time": "2015-03-26T14:01:18-06:00", "url": "http://www.aurorasentinel.com/news/grant-will-reveal-what-aurora-charity-hospitals-can-provide-beyond-health-care/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theaurorasentinel", "section": "Anschutz and Aurora", "tag": "tung", "published_time": "2015-03-26T13:58:23-06:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-26T14:01:18-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1085\"", "article_summary": "Mainly, that means finding ways to provide resources for Aurora residents apart from just occasionally providing free health care services.\nThe HIA was the only one in the country to be justified within a hospital\u2019s (Children\u2019s) community benefit activities.\nHospitals are going to be required to do a whole new range of activities and not just provide charity care, but think about other ways of interfacing with the community,\u201d Tung said.\nThough the ink is barely dry on the new grant, Tung said he\u2019s excited about the possibility his new HIA\u2019s could have not only for Anschutz, but other hospitals around the country.\n\u201cThere\u2019s tons of money, like $50 billion a year that\u2019s spent on nonprofit community hospital benefit activities, and in the past almost all of that has been directed towards charity care, or basically providing free care,\u201d he said."}
