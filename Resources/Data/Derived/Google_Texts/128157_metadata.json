Instead, he said the only sustainable solution is to limit overuse and misuse of antibiotics.\n\nOne place to start is in the United States, which leads in per capita consumption of antibiotics, according to the report. The nation is also second to China in its consumption of antibiotics in livestock.\n\nAnd though wealthy countries like the U.S. still use far more antibiotics per capita, the new data reveals high rates of use in low- and middle-income countries. For example, in India, 57 percent of the infections caused by the deadly superbug Klebsiella pneumoniae, were resistant to carbapenem antibiotics, a last-resort drug, in 2014 compared to 29 percent six years earlier. In comparison, these same drugs are still effective against the infections in 90 percent of cases in the U.S. and more than 95 percent of cases in most of Europe.\n\n\"Carbapenem antibiotics are for use in the most dire circumstances--when someone's life is in danger and no other drug will cure the infection,\" said Sumanth Gandra, an infectious diseases physician and CDDEP Resident Scholar in New Delhi, in the announcement. \"We're seeing unprecedented resistance to these precious antibiotics globally, and especially in India. If these trends continue, infections that could once be treated in a week or two could become routinely life threatening and endanger millions of lives.\"\n\nThe data also reveals infection rates caused by 12 common and potentially deadly bacteria, including Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\n\nThe report outlines six strategies that all countries can follow to halt the spread of resistance:\n\nImprove water, sanitation and immunization: Better access to clean water and sewerage systems and providing improved coverage for existing and new vaccines will ensure a safe and healthy food supply, reducing the need for antibiotics and thus reducing antibiotic-resistance rates.\n\nBetter access to clean water and sewerage systems and providing improved coverage for existing and new vaccines will ensure a safe and healthy food supply, reducing the need for antibiotics and thus reducing antibiotic-resistance rates. Improve hospital infection control and antibiotic stewardship. The report calls for better hygiene, particularly handwashing between patients, and implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs to reduce infection rates.\n\nThe report calls for better hygiene, particularly handwashing between patients, and implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs to reduce infection rates. Eliminate economic incentives that encourage antibiotic misuse and overuse in hospitals, communities and agriculture.\n\nin hospitals, communities and agriculture. Reduce and eventually phase out antibiotic use for growth promotion in agriculture .\n\n. Educate health professionals , policymakers, and the public on antibiotic use and promote conservation.\n\n, policymakers, and the public on antibiotic use and promote conservation. Work with politicians to gain their support for policies to address the threat of antibiotic resistance.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has recently taken action to address the growing threat. This week the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced the establishment of a Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria to provide advice, information and recommendations to the HHS regarding programs and policies related to combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nHHS also announced a strategic alliance with a global biopharmaceutical company to accelerate the development of new drugs to treat multi-drug resistant bacterial infections. Although the CDDEP report said only 20 percent of efforts should focus on new drug development, HHS said in the announcement that lack of investment in new drugs has helped create a \"perfect storm\" with the rise of antibiotic-resistant infections.\n\nThe Joint Commission has also launched a Speak Up on Antibiotics campaign to help educate the public on the appropriate and safe use of antibiotics, as well as the risks associated with antibiotic overuse. The campaign includes complete package of free resources, including an infographic, podcast and video.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the CDDEP online map on resistance\n\n- read the report\n\n- check out the report announcement\n\n- see the HHS announcements about the advisory council and alliance\n\n- here's the Joint Commission Speak Up campaign information\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nReport: Superbugs a 'looming global crisis'\n\nAntibiotic-resistant superbugs: 'Health crisis of this generation'\n\nAntibiotic-resistant superbugs: Deadlier than previously thought\n\nAHA15: The next public health threat is antibiotic resistance\n\nAntibiotic shortages ratchet up superbugs' threat to patient safety\n\nAt antibiotic stewardship forum, White House lauds hospitals' superbug plans\n\nWhite House plan calls for aggressive measures against superbugs\n\nWHO releases international antibiotic resistance plan\n\nAntibiotic stewardship can curb rise of deadly superbugs", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fears of a \"looming\" global crisis of antibiotic resistant superbugs\u00a0intensified this week as new\u00a0data\u00a0reveals alarming rates of bacteria resistant to last resort antibiotics that can lead to life-threatening infections across the world.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Fears of a \"looming\" global crisis of antibiotic resistant superbugs\u00a0intensified this week as new\u00a0data\u00a0reveals alarming rates of bacteria resistant to last resort antibiotics that can lead to life-threatening infections across the world.", "title": "Antibiotic resistance: Global report reveals alarming rates of bacteria resistant to last-resort drugs", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/antibiotic-resistance-global-report-reveals-alarming-rates-bacteria-resista/2015-09-17", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "antibiotic overuse,Antibiotic resistance,antibiotic stewardship,antibiotic-resistant superbugs,Care Delivery,Center for Disease Dynamics,Economics & Policy,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd46b2\"", "article_summary": "The report calls for better hygiene, particularly handwashing between patients, and implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs to reduce infection rates.\nThe data also reveals infection rates caused by 12 common and potentially deadly bacteria, including Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\nFears of a \"looming\" global crisis of antibiotic resistant superbugs intensified this week as new data reveals alarming rates of bacteria resistant to last resort antibiotics that can lead to life-threatening infections across the world.\nHHS also announced a strategic alliance with a global biopharmaceutical company to accelerate the development of new drugs to treat multi-drug resistant bacterial infections.\nImprove hospital infection control and antibiotic stewardship."}
