Even better, the shortened schedule appeared to be less acutely toxic for the patient and just as effective as the latter. Together, the two studies could signify a new approach to breast cancer treatment.\n\nIn the more experimental of the two studies, the authors recruited 287 women over the age of 40 who were already meant to receive additional radiation therapy after they had their breast tumors removed via surgery (the severity of their cancers ranged from Stage 0 to II). The women were randomly assigned to one of two treatment schedules: conventionally fractionated whole-breast irradiation (CF-WBI), which spaces out its doses over a longer period of time; and hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (HF-WBI), which provides higher, quicker doses \u2014 both groups were similarly given a boost dose of radiation at the end to the area where the original tumor was located.\n\nThe two groups of women were then measured for their toxicity levels and interviewed about their quality of life both immediately after the last treatment and six months later.\n\nAt the time, only half of the HF-WBI group suffered from any effects of acute radiation toxicity, compared to around two-thirds of the CF-WBI group, including lower rates of skin inflammation (dermatitis), breast pain, and darkening skin. Six months later, though the physical side-effects of the treatments had balanced out, there was still a noticeable improvement seen in the HF-WBI group.\n\n\u201cPatients who received the shorter course reported less difficulty in caring for their families\u2019 needs. This is a major priority for women undergoing breast cancer radiation,\u201d said lead author Dr. Simona Shaitelman, an associate professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in a statement. \u201cMost are busy working mothers, working inside or outside the home, and are juggling a number of priorities. It\u2019s paramount that we address this need.\u201d\n\nShaitelman and her colleagues\u2019 results are further bolstered by the second study, a prospective analysis of 2,309 Michigan patients who either received CF-WBI or HF-WBI after surgery from 2011 to 2014. Sifting through data collected by the Michigan Radiation Oncology Quality Consortium (MROQC), the authors similarly found a wide variety of benefits accrued to those who had undergone HF-WBI over CF-WBI.\n\n\u201cHypofractionation not only improves convenience but also may reduce acute pain, fatigue, and the extent to which patients are bothered by dermatitis in patients with breast cancer undergoing whole-breast radiotherapy,\u201d they concluded.\n\nThese results are some of the first to strongly throw their hat behind HF-WBI as a first line treatment option over CF-WBI, though Shaitelman notes that the previous studies looking at HF-WBI were performed many years ago and that a lot has changed since then.\n\n\u201cThose studies were done with now-antiquated technologies,\u201d said Shaitelman, \u201cSince then, with advances in technology, randomized studies in the United Kingdom and Canada have shown equal rates of recurrence in both groups, as well as equal survival. Yet our radiation oncology community has been slow to adopt the practice.\u201d\n\nAnother change in HF-WBI therapy, and which may explain the study results, has been in the dosage of radiation given to its patients. Though HF-WBI uses more radiation per dose (around 16 in total), the total radiation utilized is actually lower than in CF-WBI. The two treatments are nonetheless equally effective because tumor cells respond differently to radiation than their functional siblings, it\u2019s now believed.\n\nDespite the steady growing base of evidence, HF-WBI\u2019s early reputation has been difficult to overcome. \u201cStudies have shown that hypofractionation remains underused, even in analyses of patients treated well after the issuance of consensus guidelines, mature long-term evidence from clinical trials, and the encouragement of the American Society for Radiation Oncology\u2019s Choosing Wisely campaign,\u201d the authors of the second study wrote. \u201dIt is critical to recognize that hypofractionation not only provides equivalent long-term tumor control in selected patients at considerably lower cost and greater convenience, but it may also represent a more tolerably administered approach.\u201d\n\nSource: Shaitelman S, Schlembach P, Arzu I, et al.
