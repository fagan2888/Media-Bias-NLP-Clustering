As the outlet's execs started adding old sitcoms, westerns, and other programming they deemed family friendly, they were choosy about what they would or wouldn't broadcast\u2014Bewitched wasn't allowed, for example, on the grounds that it promoted witchcraft.\n\nThat was then, this is now. The Christian Broadcasting Network still exists, but it spun off the Family Channel as an independent company in 1990; the operation was eventually sold to Fox and then ABC. The channel still broadcasts The 700 Club\u2014that was required by the sales agreements\u2014but it now airs the show with disclaimers, and the rest of the schedule has changed rather drastically. We passed a cultural milestone of sorts when the outlet that once had refused to show Bewitched started transmitting Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.\n\nSince then, it's gone a lot further into territories that Robertson probably didn't envision when he went into the cable business four decades ago. Like The Fosters, its weekly drama about a lesbian couple. And, as of this month, the reality show Becoming Us:\n\nRobertson, for the record, is more progressive than you might expect on trans issues, declaring on-air two years ago that he doesn't \"think there's any sin associated with\" sex-change operations. So it's possible that he wouldn't object to Becoming Us. Either way, I suppose it's appropriate to have a show about gender transitions on a channel that's gone through such a transition itself.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The Family Channel is not what it used to be.", "title": "From Televangelists to Transgender TV", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/06/29/from-televangelists-to-transgender-tv", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14355920935543.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Family Channel is not what it used to be.", "title": "From Televangelists to Transgender TV", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14355920935543.jpg", "creator": "@notjessewalker", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-06-29T16:22:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/jesse-walker"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "You young'uns might not remember this, but the cable channel now known as ABC Family used to be called the CBN Family Channel, with CBN standing for \"Christian Broadcasting Network.\"\nEither way, I suppose it's appropriate to have a show about gender transitions on a channel that's gone through such a transition itself.\nThe Christian Broadcasting Network still exists, but it spun off the Family Channel as an independent company in 1990; the operation was eventually sold to Fox and then ABC.\nSince then, it's gone a lot further into territories that Robertson probably didn't envision when he went into the cable business four decades ago.\nWe passed a cultural milestone of sorts when the outlet that once had refused to show Bewitched started transmitting Sabrina, the Teenage Witch."}
