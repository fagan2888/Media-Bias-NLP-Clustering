Those vehicles have a warning light that reads \u201cService Air Bag.\u201d If a customer ignores the light it can eventually result in the non-deployment of the air bag and other safety features in case of a side impact collision.\n\nSpokesman Greg Martin said the company is not aware of any injuries caused by the problem.\n\nSeparately, 64,000 Cadillac XTS full-size sedans from 2013 and 2014 are being recalled to fix a problem with overheating brakes that has been responsible for two fires.\n\nAnd it is also recalling 303,000 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana full-size vans to rework the material on the instrument panel to improve the safety of unbelted passengers who hit it during an accident. The full-sized vans are typically commercial vehicles not sold for passenger use.\n\nGeneral Motors has been getting a lot of attention and criticism for its recall of 1.6 million vehicles worldwide to deal with a problems with its ignition switch. GM engineers knew at least as early as 2004 of the problem, but the company did not recall the vehicles until February of this year. At least 12 deaths have been linked to the problem with the ignition switch.\n\n\u201cI asked our team to redouble our efforts on our pending product reviews, bring them forward and resolve them quickly,\u201d said GM CEO Mary Barra, in the statement disclosing Monday\u2019s recall. \u201cThat is what today\u2019s GM is all about.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "General Motors announced another broad recall Monday, saying about 1.2 million of its popular crossover SUV models will need to have the wiring for its seat-mounted side airbag fixed.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "ab9b95eb1a995697f3c88253f276fa87"}, "og": {"site_name": "fox8.com", "description": "General Motors announced another broad recall Monday, saying about 1.2 million of its popular crossover SUV models will need to have the wiring for its seat-mounted side airbag fixed.", "title": "Air Bag Worries: GM Recalls 1.2 Million SUVs", "url": "http://fox8.com/2014/03/17/air-bag-worries-gm-recalls-1-2-million-suvs/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://localtvwjw.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/gm.jpeg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwjw.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/gm.jpeg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox8news", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox8news"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324686068", "fb": {"pages": 74758790293}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox8.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/ea8bceb705ffdd1b50e02de092ee74b4?s=16", "application-name": "fox8.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Fox8NewsCleveland", "published_time": "2014-03-17T18:10:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-17T18:10:20+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/Fox8NewsCleveland"}, "keywords": "news, gm, gm recall", "google-site-verification": "RrRVvAvDXFfRHU6-TtZJh28fqDSaZbTLz1xSvv0udQ8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "General Motors has been getting a lot of attention and criticism for its recall of 1.6 million vehicles worldwide to deal with a problems with its ignition switch.\nGM engineers knew at least as early as 2004 of the problem, but the company did not recall the vehicles until February of this year.\nThe models involved are the 2008-13 Buick Enclave and the GMC Acadia, along with the 2009-13 Chevrolet Traverse and the 2008-2010 Saturn Outlook.\nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) \u2014 General Motors announced another broad recall Monday, saying about 1.2 million of its popular crossover SUV models will need to have the wiring for its seat-mounted side airbag fixed.\nThose vehicles have a warning light that reads \u201cService Air Bag.\u201d If a customer ignores the light it can eventually result in the non-deployment of the air bag and other safety features in case of a side impact collision."}
