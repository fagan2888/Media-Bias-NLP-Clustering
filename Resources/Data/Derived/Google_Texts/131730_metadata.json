He went on to downplay the situation, emphasizing that Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki \u201cindicated that he did not see a link between the wait and them actually dying.\u201d\n\nPerkins sees this as the dawn of yet another mass cover-up.\n\n\u201cWhile their loved ones were begging to see doctors for heart conditions, viruses and even cancer, the very government that was supposed to be caring for these patients was faking waiting times and covering it up by shredding documents,\u201d Perkins contests. \u201c\u2019Two weeks,\u2019 for an appointment turned into a year, until finally, Dr. Sam Foote, a VA employee, couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and blew the cover off the story.\u201d\n\nMany tragic stories branch out from the overlying scandal, which include numerous meticulously documented press reports recently distributed that describe double books and 40 veteran deaths in the states of Texas, Arizona, Missouri and Colorado.\n\nOne CNN report details Thomas Breen\u2019s tragic end spurred by VA neglect. The 71-year-old Navy veteran with a history of cancer was taken to a VA emergency room in Arizona last September with blood in his urine, only to be released and told he would see a urologist within the next seven days. Breen didn\u2019t receive the appointment until three months later in December, when stage 4 bladder cancer had already claimed his life.\n\nAnother report shows a secret set of books held by the VA in Phoenix that gives the illusion that vets got their appointments within two weeks when they were really on a seven-month waiting list. On Wednesday the VA admitted that its local director was given approximately $9,000 for a performance bonus in April.\n\nPerkins insists that such blatant care for vets has been under the radar for years.\n\n\u201cDespite warnings from the Bush administration, the GAO in 2012, and just last year from House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.), it seems President Obama hasn\u2019t lifted a finger to help the thousands of former military members waiting months for medical attention through the VA \u2014 and in 40 of those cases, dying before they receive it,\u201d Perkins stressed.\n\nAnd reports of the cover-up continue to flow in, as the probe by the inspector general now encompasses 26 VA hospitals nationwide \u2014 up from 10. News has recently surfaced that a VA deputy undersecretary was informed that \u201cgaming strategies\u201d and \u201cinappropriate scheduling practices\u201d were used to conceal and falsify wait times several years ago in 2010.\n\nSeeing the scandal unfold from his FRC headquarters in the nation\u2019s capital, Perkins views it as nothing short of a tragedy for military families.\n\n\u201cTheir loved ones died, not in the line of duty, but waiting for the kind of care their sacrifice should have afforded them,\u201d Perkins noted. \u201cAfter more than a decade of war, America\u2019s veterans have all kinds of needs. And how does their country express its appreciation? By ignoring them.\u201d\n\nPerkins claims that other interests within the White House supercede taking care of those who have served America with their lives, and that this preference has been exposed for some time.\n\n\u201cNone of this should come as a surprise, especially not from an administration that\u2019s spent the last five years using the military as a mule for its illicit agenda,\u201d Perkins relates. \u201cThe President\u2019s own Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, said in his book that \u2018the only military matter, apart from the leaks, about which I ever sensed deep passion on his part was \u2018Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe notes that the homosexual agenda within the military has been a major concern for the Commander-in-Chief since the beginning of his presidency.\n\n\u201cWe see those backwards priorities today,\u201d Perkins continued. \u201cHonorable veterans are dying while dishonorable traitors get sex changes. While the President ignores the crises of military suicide rates, sexual assault, and even VA neglect, the Obama Pentagon is working overtime to give national security leaker Bradley Manning the ability to live out his sentence as a woman. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel gave the Army the green light to work out a transfer agreement with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which offers the kind of hormone therapy Manning demands.\u201d\n\nDespite the White House\u2019s \u201coutrage\u201d over veteran care, Perkins sees little change in the future.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the men and women who served our nation with integrity are wasting away on \u2018special lists,\u2019 excluded from care,\u201d Perkins concluded. \u201cAnd in this administration\u2019s hands, it is a system that \u2014 through incompetence, a political agenda, or both \u2014 continues to be the President\u2019s greatest weapon.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/politics-govt/2014/05/24/a-soldier-gets-his-sex-change-while-vets-meet-their-maker", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/images/ogimage.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "Outrage over the Obama administration\u2019s seven years of U.S. military veteran neglect has erupted like never before against the President who touted, \u201cWe need a new sense of urgency,\u201d during his 2007 campaign regarding hundreds of thousands of veterans seeking care.", "title": "A soldier gets his sex change while vets meet their maker"}, "twitter": {"site": "@onenewsnowcom", "image": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/images/ogimage.jpg", "description": "Outrage over the Obama administration\u2019s seven years of U.S. military veteran neglect has erupted like never before against the President who touted, \u201cWe need a new sense of urgency,\u201d during his 2007 campaign regarding hundreds of thousands of veterans seeking care.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A soldier gets his sex change while vets meet their maker"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Outrage over the Obama administration\u2019s seven years of U.S. military veteran neglect has erupted like never before against the President who touted, \u201cWe need a new sense of urgency,\u201d during his 2007 campaign regarding hundreds of thousands of veterans seeking care."}, "article_summary": "One CNN report details Thomas Breen\u2019s tragic end spurred by VA neglect.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how systemic this is,\u201d President Obama proclaimed when questioned about the numerous veteran deaths and cases of medical neglect.\n\u201cMeanwhile, the men and women who served our nation with integrity are wasting away on \u2018special lists,\u2019 excluded from care,\u201d Perkins concluded.\nPerkins insists that such blatant care for vets has been under the radar for years.\nOn Wednesday the VA admitted that its local director was given approximately $9,000 for a performance bonus in April."}
