(RELATED: Obama lashes out at GOP, NRA after gun bill fails)\n\nHis effort to curb gun rights has been stalled by several Democratic Senators who are facing 2014 elections in their GOP-leaning states. The Democrats\u2019 Senate leader, Sen. Harry Reid, said on Thursday that Democrats didn\u2019t have the votes to pass gun control legislation in 2013.\n\nThe successful recall votes in September of two pro-gun control Democratic state Senators in Colorado also reduces the likelihood of Obama\u2019s latest efforts.\n\nBut the renewed campaign for gun control may increase African-Americans and suburban-swing voter turnout in the 2014 mid-term elections.\n\nObama\u2019s red-meat rhetoric also included a defense of his Obamacare healthcare network, and nostalgic invocations of anti-discrimination marches from half a century ago. He did not discuss how he planned to jumpstart stalled economy or lower the very high unemployment rate among African-Americans, but instead blamed companies and wealthy Americans for the 13 percent unemployment rate among African-Americans.\n\n\u201cAt a time when black unemployment remains twice as high as white unemployment, at a time when working Americans of all races have seen their incomes and wages stagnate even as corporate profits and the incomes of folks at the very top are soaring, we\u2019ve got to pick up the torch of economic justice,\u201d he declared, shortly before he urged passage of a hike in the minimum wage.\n\nHe also slammed the GOP\u2019s new budget, which funds the government but not the Obamacare network.\n\nGOP legislators, Obama said, \u201care actually willing to see the United States default on its obligations and plunge this country back into a painful recession if they can\u2019t deny the basic security of health care to millions of Americans\u2026 We\u2019re not going to allow anyone to inflict economic pain on millions of our own people just to make an ideological point.\u201d\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "President Barack Obama accused opponents of gun control of wanting to sell guns to criminals in a speech on Saturday to activists at Congressional Black Caucus.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "President Barack Obama accused opponents of gun control of fighting to allow \"dangerous people\" to own guns in a speech on Saturday to\u00a0activists at Congressional Black Caucus, promising he \u00a0would re", "title": "Obama accuses gun control opponents of fighting to allow \u2018dangerous people\u2019 to own guns", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/22/obama-accuses-gun-control-opponents-of-fighting-to-allow-dangerous-people-to-own-guns/", "image": {"width": 738, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-22T031147Z_1_CBRE98L08W300_RTROPTP_4_USA-OBAMA-e1379859693680.jpg", "height": 332}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Revived gun control campaign descends to new incendiary level", "title": "Obama accuses gun control opponents of fighting to allow \u2018dangerous people\u2019 to own guns Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/22/obama-accuses-gun-control-opponents-of-fighting-to-allow-dangerous-people-to-own-guns/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-22T031147Z_1_CBRE98L08W300_RTROPTP_4_USA-OBAMA-e1379859693680.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-22 11:33:21", "sailthru.title": "Obama accuses gun control opponents of fighting to allow 'dangerous people' to own guns", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "gun-control,neil-munro", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "gun control", "sailthru.description": "President Barack Obama accused opponents of gun control of fighting to allow \"dangerous people\" to own guns in a speech on Saturday to\u00a0activists at Congressional Black Caucus, promising he \u00a0would re", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-22T031147Z_1_CBRE98L08W300_RTROPTP_4_USA-OBAMA-e1379859693680.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd62d7\"", "article_summary": "But the renewed campaign for gun control may increase African-Americans and suburban-swing voter turnout in the 2014 mid-term elections.\n3869382President Barack Obama accused opponents of gun control of fighting to allow \u201cdangerous people\u201d to own guns in a speech on Saturday to activists at Congressional Black Caucus, promising he would revive his failed gun control efforts following recent urban shootings in Chicago and Washington D.C.\u2019s Navy Yard.\nObama suffered a critical political defeat in April when the Senate rejected his proposals for stricter gun control.\nThe Democrats\u2019 Senate leader, Sen.
