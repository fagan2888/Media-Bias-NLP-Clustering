I felt defeated.\n\nIn hindsight I've come to view setbacks as vital curves in the course of life.\n\nStruggle shapes the lens through which we see the world by throwing us out of our comfort zones and forcing us to grow.\n\nI've seen many inspirational comebacks from serious injury in rugby, none more so than Pat McCabe's return from two broken necks to be playing Super Rugby this season.\n\nPoey now stands at the foot of a long and arduous journey back to full fitness, too.\n\nWhile I believe he will get there, I don't share the seemingly unanimous faith that his recovery is a foregone conclusion.\n\nIf a steely resolve was enough to guard against injury, Poey would never get hurt.\n\nTo look sporting mortality in the eye, to acknowledge that defeat and failure is possible, that's what will make Dave's challenge so much more worthy.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brumbies, Union News", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "''Is this the end for Pocock?''", "title": "David Pocock has a challenging mountain to climb", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/david-pocock-has-a-challenging-mountain-to-climb-20140307-34cle.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/4/7/s/2/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.34cle.png/1394208000000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/4/7/s/2/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.34cle.png/1394208000000.jpg"}, "description": "''Is this the end for Pocock?''", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "David Pocock has a challenging mountain to climb"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "''Is this the end for Pocock?''"}, "article_summary": "The news headline indicated my ACT Brumbies teammate David Pocock had joined a long list of athletes prematurely written off following serious injury.\nDealing with a serious knee injury in the World Cup year of 2007 was also difficult.\nAfter working incredibly hard to rebound from last year's knee surgery, he has suffered the same season-ending injury just two weeks into our season.\nI've seen many inspirational comebacks from serious injury in rugby, none more so than Pat McCabe's return from two broken necks to be playing Super Rugby this season.\nLong road ahead ...
