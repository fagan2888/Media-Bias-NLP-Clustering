The encounter took place on the sidewalk in front of Tulane Law School (my alma mater) where Letten is now an assistant dean.\n\n\u201cYou went to my home, you terrorized my wife, you\u2019re violating federal law, you\u2019re violating state law, you\u2019re trespassing, you\u2019re a nasty cowardly little spud,\u201d Letten shouted. He also called O\u2019Keefe a \u201chobbit\u201d for some reason.\n\nSome background is necessary here. James O\u2019Keefe is a species of yellow journalist. His basic shtick is to pretend to be somebody else in order to catch groups and individuals making compromising statements. He then heavily edits the footage, sometimes very misleadingly, for heightened effect.\n\nO\u2019Keefe made his bones in 2009 by taking down the progressive group ACORN in a video in which he and a cohort, Hannah Giles, pretended to be a pimp/prostitute pair seeking assistance on avoiding detection by civil authorities in nefarious endeavors. The selectively-edited video revealed misconduct by low-level ACORN employees and provided the final straw that led the federal government to cut funding from the group.\n\nAfter that, O\u2019Keefe attempted to maintain his dragon-slayer reputation through various projects. In 2010, he decided to target Senator Mary Landrieu following reports that she avoiding calls critical of her vote in favor of Obamacare. To get evidence of this, O\u2019Keefe decided to resurrect his trick of pretending to be something he wasn\u2019t, namely a telephone company repairman.\n\nTo make a long story short, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s ruse failed. He was arrested and brought up on felony charges, but later pled out to a misdemeanor for gaining access to a federal office under false pretenses and received a fine and probation. O\u2019Keefe is still sore about the whole mess, arguing that it was a political prosecution and that Letten\u2019s office mishandled evidence.\n\nThis idea was lent more credibility by Letten\u2019s subsequent resignation following revelations that members of his staff, including the prosecutor assigned to O\u2019Keefe\u2019s case, had inappropriately commented on a online message board regarding ongoing cases. Over at The Lens, Mark Mosely has argued persuasively that O\u2019Keefe had a legitimate gripe.\n\nThat brings us back to this past July, when O\u2019Keefe decided to revisit New Orleans to catch Letten on camera. He first went to Letten\u2019s home, where Letten\u2019s wife told O\u2019Keefe that he wasn\u2019t there. O\u2019Keefe apparently called and left a message for Letten at his office (supposedly claiming to be a prospective law student) and then went to Tulane where he was confronted on the sidewalk on Freret Street by uniformed Tulane Police officers and Mr. Letten himself.\n\nThis is when Letten lost him temper and flew into histrionics, accusing O\u2019Keefe of trespassing, terrorizing his wife, etc. O\u2019Keefe tried to give Letten a copy of his book, which Letten took only to throw it back at O\u2019Keefe. This went on until Letten started to leave and O\u2019Keefe\u2019s crew did the same, but then were detained by the Tulane Police Officers on suspicion of \u201ctrespassing.\u201d\n\nThis is where the episode actually became interesting to me. Letten losing his temper isn\u2019t much of a story. Letten has since apologized, and so that story becomes about as dull as the countless times people lose their temper and live to regret it each and every day.\n\nHowever, in the process of losing his temper, Letten accused O\u2019Keefe of trespassing, and the Tulane Police backed him. However, the sidewalk along Freret Street is, like all other sidewalks adjoining public streets, public property. The officers openly admitted that O\u2019Keefe and his crew were being detained for an active trespass, and then escorted them away from Tulane\u2019s campus. O\u2019Keefe was even issued a \u201crestricted presence\u201d notice, informing him that he was barred from Tulane\u2019s property.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing \u2013 it doesn\u2019t appear that O\u2019Keefe ever actually went onto Tulane\u2019s campus, and it\u2019s clear from O\u2019Keefe\u2019s video that the Tulane Police believed that the sidewalk was Tulane\u2019s property.\n\nIn his video, O\u2019Keefe argues that his detention was illegal, but gives the wrong basis. He argued that he has a constitutional right to be present on the open grounds of a university campus, citing an early 80\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court decision. However, that decision did not actually go to the merits. To my knowledge, a private university in Louisiana still has broad power to exclude specific persons from its grounds.\n\nOthers went overboard in the other direction. FOX 8 legal analyst Joseph Raspanti was quoted saying that \u201cthese police officers can detain someone until they identify who they are, they have the absolute right to do that.\u201d This is definitely not the case \u2013 officers can normally only detain somebody so long as they possess reasonable suspicion that they are involved in criminal activity. We\u2019d be a textbook police state if cops could detain anybody they wanted and, as in the old Soviet Bloc, \u201cask for their papers.\u201d In any event, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s identity was not in dispute.\n\nNo, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s detention wasn\u2019t illegal because Tulane can\u2019t control access to its own grounds, nor was it valid because the police have virtually unfettered authority to detain people. It\u2019s illegal because the sidewalk does not belong to Tulane. Tulane no more owns that sidewalk than it owns Freret Street. There was no trespass.\n\nPut another way, as the Louisiana Supreme Court held nearly 130 years ago, \u201cabutting proprietors are not recognized as having a fee in the sidewalks or streets in front of their estates, which are considered as public property[.]\u201d Irwin v. Great Southern Tel. Co., 37 La. Ann. 63, 67 (La. 1885).\n\nPrivate property owners who assert any ownership interest in public rights-of-way cause no end of problems in this city. It has impacted me personally on a number of occasions, and it needs to stop. No, you do not own the sidewalk. No, you do not own the parking lane in front of your house. No, you do not own the street. No, you do not own the neutral ground.\n\nCertainly, one can ask a person to move along by appealing to their sense to civility, but when you expressly claim private ownership of public lands and exploit the ignorance of law enforcement to get your way, that\u2019s when it becomes a serious problem. That\u2019s when a line is crossed and any hope of polite accommodation is lost.\n\nThe Tulane Police should have known better. Sure, Letten is a former U.S. Attorney and certainly has a better knowledge of the law, but he was clearly throwing a tantrum and was not a great source of legal analysis at the time.\n\nMoreover, even if O\u2019Keefe had attempted to enter Tulane Law School, the building is (like most university buildings) normally open to the public. At most, O\u2019Keefe should have been turned away and only detained if he refused to leave or barged his way in. It appears that the only reason O\u2019Keefe was detained is because the Tulane Police showed bias towards Letten and ignored the law.\n\nNone of this, of course, means I sympathize greatly with O\u2019Keefe. He\u2019s obviously reveling in this. Letten lost his temper, and the Tulane Police allowed themselves to become caricatures of law enforcement \u2013 brazenly detaining a political provocateur on a public sidewalk for trespassing.\n\nAmong other bizarre insults, Letten described O\u2019Keefe as a \u201chobbit,\u201d a member of a race of very short beings from the Lord of the Rings universe, but he would have been better off using the word \u201ctroll.\u201d In Internet slang, trolls are people who intentionally provoke others to start confrontations, often in hopes that they\u2019ll lose their cool and embarrass themselves. That\u2019s certainly what O\u2019Keefe was doing, and everyone fell for it. The trap worked.\n\nNevertheless, even an unsympathetic muckraker can have the troubling virtue of being right. If university police treat O\u2019Keefe this way, who is to say a local reporter won\u2019t be next? Will they arrest somebody if they refuse to leave the sidewalk? Do they believe that \u201crestricted presence\u201d letters can actually apply to public rights of way?\n\nThose are the questions this episode left me asking, and I\u2019m not liking the answers. Tulane needs to address this issue promptly. Sometimes a simple apology just isn\u2019t enough.\n\nOwen Courr\u00e8ges, a New Orleans attorney and resident of the Garden District, offers his opinions for UptownMessenger.com on Mondays.
