Why now?\n\nNo war in America history has ever been opposed by 71% of the citizens, or 75% of the military.\n\nThat\u2019s how absurd and unnecessary this potential war is.\n\nThen, when you realize Obama has had so many scandals and failures to hide, war is the perfect cover story to mask the most disastrous record in modern presidential history.\n\nObama is a desperate man. He has to cover-up the truth.\n\nWe have a CON MAN in the White House.\n\nThe sad thing is\u2026it\u2019s working.\n\nThe media headlines should be about the massive IRS scandal ordered by the Obama administration and aimed at Tea Parties, Obama critics, and GOP donors. Because it\u2019s no longer in the headlines\u2026because of Syria hogging the media spotlight\u2026no one is mentioning that the IRS attacks on conservative leaders and groups changed the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.\n\nIn other words,I believe that Obama used the IRS to fix the election.\n\nWithout IRS attacks, intimidation, and interference, Tea Party groups would have had the same influence as 2010 -- when their raging energy and passionate \u201cfire and brimstone\u201d led directly to the biggest Republican Congressional landslide in modern history.\n\nDoes anyone doubt that?\n\nHeck we now have emails from IRS officials stating exactly that -- that Tea Parties had to be stopped if Democrats wanted to win the election.\n\nSuddenly, mysteriously, in 2012 all the energy and momentum went out of the Tea Party movement.\n\nNow we know why.\n\nObama used the IRS to fix the presidential election. Instead of massive Tea Party rallies and record-setting fundraising for conservative candidates, Tea Parties were busy being distracted, hounded, harassed, and intimidated by the IRS.\n\nThey were busy being asked about the names of their members, names of their speakers, content of their Facebook posts, and the content of their prayers.\n\nThey were fending off audits.\n\nTheir tax deductible status was purposely stalled so they could not raise money for the 2012 election.\n\nTheir lives were turned upside down by these IRS attacks.\n\nFraud was committed to re-elect Barack Obama. Our country was hijacked due to the efforts of government employees trying to protect their own cushy lifetime jobs, bloated salaries, obscene pensions, and their biggest defender and protector Barack Obama.\n\nThink I\u2019m wrong? Evidently the IRS officials don\u2019t.\n\nSeveral of them have been busy hiring the most famous and expensive law firms in Washington, D.C. to defend themselves. The kind of lawyers hired by multi-millionaire businessmen and high-profile politicians and lobbyists accused of serious crimes.\n\nWhere are they getting the money?\n\nIs Obama or the Democratic National Committee arranging for big Democratic donors to pay for their legal fees?\n\nWhy would Obama do that?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a brain surgeon to figure out that Obama is frightened to death about what these IRS officials will say under oath. Their testimony could end his presidency and destroy his legacy. But Obama has conjured up a war to keep this massive IRS scandal out of the headlines.\n\nWe have a CON MAN in the White House.\n\nThe media headlines should be about the NSA scandal aimed at violating the civil rights and invading the privacy of every American citizen. But with Syria hogging the media spotlight, we have all forgotten that Obama listens to every phone call, watches every email.\n\nBig Brother rules our lives. Obama has turned out to be worse than Bush when it comes to civil liberties, but with Syria in the headlines, we don\u2019t hear a word about the NSA scandal anymore.\n\nWe have a CON MAN in the White House.\n\nThe media headlines should be about Benghazi, too. Not only should everyone be asking why four American heroes died (including the first U.S. Ambassador in over 30 years), but why?\n\nWere they killed with weapons supplied by the Obama administration to Al Qaeda rebels?\n\nWhy haven\u2019t Obama and Hillary Clinton been forced to resign in disgrace for the worst (and most obvious) cover-up in modern presidential history?\n\nLike the IRS scandal, the Benghazi scandal could have changed the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.\n\nWould Obama have been re-elected if the public knew there was no \u201cspontaneous demonstration\u201d outside our embassy that day; that no one in the Middle East had ever seen the cheap unprofessional video that Obama and Hillary blamed on the attack; and the weapons used to attack our embassy were supplied by our own CIA, upon orders of Obama?\n\nWould Obama have been re-elected if Americans knew that there was time to save those brave heroes defending our embassy, but Obama and Hillary refused to send a rescue team-multiple times.\n\nFraud was committed to re-elect Barack Obama. But with Syria in the headlines, no one is mentioning Benghazi anymore.\n\nWe have a CON MAN in the White House.\n\nThe media headlines should be about ObamaCare -- a fast moving train wreck about to destroy the entire U.S. economy. It\u2019s so bad that Congress exempted themselves a month ago.\n\nIt\u2019s so bad that union leaders met with Obama at the White House to demand they all be exempted, or ObamaCare be repealed. Yes, unions are asking for the repeal of ObamaCare, the signature achievement of the man they elected President. Shouldn\u2019t this story be in the headlines?\n\nIt\u2019s so bad that the head of the IRS testified in front of Congress that he didn\u2019t want ObamaCare -- and he\u2019s in charge of enforcing it.\n\nIt\u2019s so bad that the telemarketing company Obama hired to promote ObamaCare employs part-time workers, so they don\u2019t have to offer health insurance to employees.\n\nIt\u2019s so bad that fast food chains are \u201csharing\u201d employees, so no one works more than 29 hours- thereby avoiding ObamaCare requirements.\n\nWhere are the headlines? Oh right, Syria is in the headlines.\n\nWe have a CONMAN in the White House.\n\nThe media headlines should be about this part-time economy created by ObamaCare. The numbers are sickening. The whole country is being reduced to nothing but crummy, crappy, part-time jobs. Since January 77% of all jobs created in America under Obama have been part-time jobs.\n\nNot surprisingly in a nation with only crummy part-time jobs, the income picture is degenerating into a nightmare. Real household income has dropped in every year of Obama's Presidency. A new Census Bureau report reveals that the typical American family under Obama now earns less today than it did in 1989.\n\nHow about the numbers of Americans living in poverty under Obama? An unimaginable 46.5 million Americans now live in poverty under Obama- twice as many as the population of Syria. Maybe it's America that needs saving, not Syria?\n\nThere are more Americans on food stamps (23.1 million) than the population of the entire Northeastern United States (20 million) including New York, Boston and Philadelphia.\n\nBut with a possible war in Syria in the headlines, no one is noticing all these scandals, all this bad news, a crumbling economy, and a collapsing middle class. Obama has clearly wrecked America for generations to come.\n\nWe either have a con man in the White House, or a madman.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-01-07 01:10:53 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Fraud was committed to re-elect Barack Obama.
