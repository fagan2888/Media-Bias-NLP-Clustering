This time the Pope stopped his blue hatchback on a quiet country highway while traveling through Calabria, Italy, after a group of people with colorful banners caught the pontiff\u2019s attention. The Italian-written banners were done by the family of a little girl named Roberta who is severely disabled.\n\nThe banners read: \"Please Pope stop here to see an angel who has been waiting for you,\" and, \"Please come and bless little Roberta.\" Roberta, whose surname is not yet known, is severely disabled that she cannot breathe unassisted, or travel very far from her home, the Vatican\u2019s news.va website reported. Disregarding any danger, as he threatened to excommunicate members of the mafia from the Catholic Church just hours earlier, Pope Francis got out of the car to greet and bless the eager group, including Roberta.\n\nWeeks before his pitstop in Calabria, Pope Francis revealed he wanted to discard the bullet-proof shield on his Popemoble. \u201cIt is true that anything could happen, but let's face it, at my age I don't have much to lose,\u201d he said. Pope Francis is becoming a religious figure well-known for his spontaneity and \u201cpersonal touch.\u201d\n\nLast year, the pontiff took 17-year-old Alberto di Tullio, a teen born with Down syndrome, for a spin in his Popemobile. It was that same year Pope Francis was also spotted picking up a child with cerebral palsy to give him a hug and a kiss on the cheek while circling St, Peter\u2019s Square. The religious figure has shown a tremendous amount for support for special needs children.\n\nRoberta\u2019s family, most humbled by Pope\u2019s Francis\u2019 presence, hung a large banner in front of their house, which read, \"Thank you very much!\" in Italian.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pope francis, popemobile, motorcade, young woman, physically disabled, roberta, calabria, italy, excommunicate mafia members, catholic church, special needs", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Pope Francis, kisses a bedridden woman on a stretcher lying on the road, effectively breaking down the \u2018wall of prejudice\u2019 against the disabled.", "title": "The Popemobile Makes A Pit Stop For A Disabled Girl [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pope-francis-pulls-over-motorcade-bless-young-woman-physical-disabilities-lying-road-290012", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/25/pope-francis-kisses-bedridden-girl-lying-road.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pope Francis, kisses a bedridden woman on a stretcher lying on the road, effectively breaking down the \u2018wall of prejudice\u2019 against the disabled.", "title": "The Popemobile Makes A Pit Stop For A Disabled Girl [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pope-francis-pulls-over-motorcade-bless-young-woman-physical-disabilities-lying-road-290012", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/25/pope-francis-kisses-bedridden-girl-lying-road.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/25/pope-francis-kisses-bedridden-girl-lying-road.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-25T18:20:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-25T18:20:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Pope Francis, kisses a bedridden woman on a stretcher lying on the road, effectively breaking down the \u2018wall of prejudice\u2019 against the disabled."}, "article_summary": "Weeks before his pitstop in Calabria, Pope Francis revealed he wanted to discard the bullet-proof shield on his Popemoble.\nPope Francis and his Popemobile are at it again making pit stops to bless, and anoint the sick.\nThe banners read: \"Please Pope stop here to see an angel who has been waiting for you,\" and, \"Please come and bless little Roberta.\"\nIt was that same year Pope Francis was also spotted picking up a child with cerebral palsy to give him a hug and a kiss on the cheek while circling St, Peter\u2019s Square.\nThe Italian-written banners were done by the family of a little girl named Roberta who is severely disabled."}
