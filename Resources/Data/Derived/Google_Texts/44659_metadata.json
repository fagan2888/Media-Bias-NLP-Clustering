And WHAM! in the newest comic book to hit the market, but publisher Bluewater Productions hopes that its latest offering, out tomorrow, will entice younger readers not into the realm of superheroes, but rather into the somewhat more mundane world of party politics.\n\nTitled \u201cPolitical Power: Rand Paul,\u201d the new comic biography tells the life story of the Kentucky Senator who announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination last week.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Takes Direct Aim at Hillary Clinton\n\nThe cover shows a confident-looking Sen. Paul staring off into the distance, while behind him an extremely cranky looking President Obama and a peevish-looking Hillary Clinton stare angrily. Up in the clouds, above the capitol, hovers a ghostly image of Rand Paul\u2019s father, the former Texas Congressman Ron Paul who, by all accounts, is alive and well.\n\nDarren G. Davis, the president of Bluewater, says he hopes the comic book format will help make political issues more accessible to younger readers and to people typically uninterested in politics.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I was a reluctant reader,\u201d Davis said in a release. \u201cWe hope to reach kids in similar situations that may be more apt to read when a comic book is placed in front of them.\u201d Can a comic book format make presidential primary politics interesting to young people? Or to anybody, really, other than hardcore activists and political reporters? It\u2019s a tough sell.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul and GOP Gain as Clinton Loses Altitude\n\nHere\u2019s what passes for action in the preview panels released to the media. In one scene, Paul faces down a smarmy journalist, preemptively asking his interviewer, \u201cAre you conducting Political Profiling?\u201d\n\nThe puzzled reporter asks, \u201cPolitical Profiling?\u201d\n\n\u201cDiscrimination based on political opinions,\u201d Paul informs him, with a weary look on his face. \u201cSimilar to profiling people for the color of their skin, but now we\u2019re profiling people for the color of their thoughts.\u201d\n\nWhen the journalist tries to turn the conversation to controversial comments Paul has made about civil rights legislation, Paul springs his trap: \u201cThere\u2019s a good example of what I mean. My comments have been mischaracterized by the liberal media.\u201d\n\nIn another clash, this time with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Paul\u2019s efforts to uncover information about the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya during Congressional hearings devolve into questions about whether the U.S. is involved in the shipment of weapons from Libya to Turkey by boat. In the gripping denouement, Clinton says, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have any information on that.\u201d\n\nWhile making elections more understandable to younger or less engaged voters is laudable, Spiderman and Thor probably don\u2019t need to start worrying about their circulation numbers.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Can a comic book biography of Kentucky senator and Republican presidential hopeful Rand Paul inspire young readers to take an interest in politics?
