Its 600 workers in Moon will need a different insurer if they want to keep in-network access to UPMC.\n\n\u201cThat's not good,\u201d said Dan Persuit, president of the Transport Workers Union Local 545 that represents more than 160 US Airways dispatchers. Persuit said he had been under the impression that he and his colleagues were insulated from the UPMC-Highmark contract battle because their insurer is Anthem.\n\nAmerican Airlines spokesman Todd Lehmacher declined to comment on the situation.\n\nUS Airways recently was acquired by Dallas-based American Airlines, which said it plans to close the Moon operations center in about 18 months.\n\nBillger said there are 275,000 Western Pennsylvanians with health insurance through a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan that uses Highmark's provider network. That's in addition to more than 3 million members Highmark has in the region.\n\n\u201cUPMC would be turning away affordable access for hundreds of thousands of people living in our region who have a Blue health insurance program from an employer based outside of our region,\u201d Billger said. \u201cIf there is no contract, these people would not have affordable in-network access to UPMC facilities.\u201d\n\nUPMC, which refuses to negotiate a contract renewal with Highmark because the state's largest insurer bought rival hospital network West Penn Allegheny Health System, would prefer to keep non-Highmark Blue Cross customers, spokesman Paul Wood said.\n\nBut Blue Cross companies are not allowed to contract directly with hospitals and doctors outside their territories, he said.\n\n\u201cUPMC would be happy to contract for in-network access directly with any Blue Cross company nationwide that does not operate a hospital system in competition with UPMC,\u201d Wood said.\n\nUPMC, which owns 20 hospitals and employs about 3,500 doctors, is the largest health system in Western Pennsylvania. When the contract ends, most hospitals will be out-of-network for Blue Cross members, except specialty hospitals such as Children's Hospital and Pittsburgh and Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.\n\nAt least four Pittsburgh Business Group on Health member companies are in the same situation as US Airways, said Jessica Brooks, executive director of the group. They are based outside Western Pennsylvania and provide health insurance to employees in Pittsburgh and locations across the country through a non-Highmark Blue Cross company, said Brooks.\n\nShe declined to name the companies.\n\n\u201cThey're faced with the challenge (of) trying to figure out how to best serve all their employees,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nIf they want Pittsburgh employees to maintain in-network access to UPMC, they will have to change their national plan or offer a separate insurance option to employees here.\n\n\u201cIt's definitely a high priority\u201d for those employers, she said. \u201cAccess to provider networks is high on the list\u201d for workers.\n\nAlex Nixon is a Trib Total Media staff writer.
