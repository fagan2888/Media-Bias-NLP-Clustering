No \u2014 I was pacing the room, too nervous to sit, worried that the court would use one sloppily worded sentence to deprive millions of health insurance, condemn tens of thousands to financial ruin, and send thousands to premature death.\n\nIt didn\u2019t. And that means that the big distractions \u2014 the teething problems of the website, the objectively ludicrous but nonetheless menacing attempts at legal sabotage \u2014 are behind us, and we can focus on the reality of health reform. The Affordable Care Act is now in its second year of full operation; how\u2019s it doing?\n\nThe answer is, better than even many supporters realize.\n\nStart with the act\u2019s most basic purpose, to cover the previously uninsured. Opponents of the law insisted that it would actually reduce coverage; in reality, around 15 million Americans have gained insurance.\n\nBut isn\u2019t that a very partial success, with millions still uncovered? Well, many of those still uninsured are in that position because their state governments have refused to let the federal government enroll them in Medicaid.\n\nBeyond that, you need to realize that the law was never intended or expected to cover everyone. Undocumented immigrants aren\u2019t eligible, and any system that doesn\u2019t enroll people automatically will see some of the population fall through the cracks. Massachusetts has had guaranteed health coverage for almost a decade, but 5 percent of its nonelderly adult population remains uninsured.\n\nSuppose we use 5 percent uninsured as a benchmark. How much progress have we made toward getting there? In states that have implemented the act in full and expanded Medicaid, data from the Urban Institute show the uninsured falling from more than 16 percent to just 7.5 percent \u2014 that is, in year two we\u2019re already around 80 percent of the way there. Most of the way with the ACA!\n\nBut how good is that coverage? Cheaper plans under the law do have relatively large deductibles and impose significant out-of-pocket costs. Still, the plans are vastly better than no coverage at all, or the bare-bones plans that the act made illegal. The newly insured have seen a sharp drop in health-related financial distress, and report a high degree of satisfaction with their coverage.\n\nWhat about costs? In 2013 there were dire warnings about a looming \u201crate shock\u201d; instead, premiums came in well below expectations. In 2014 the usual suspects declared that huge premium increases were looming for 2015; the actual rise was just 2 percent. There was another flurry of scare stories about rate hikes earlier this year, but as more information comes in it looks as if premium increases for 2016 will be bigger than for this year but still modest by historical standards \u2014 which means that premiums remain much lower than expected.\n\nAnd there has also been a sharp slowdown in the growth of overall health spending, which is probably due in part to the cost-control measures, largely aimed at Medicare, that were also an important part of health reform.\n\nWhat about economic side effects? One of the many, many Republican votes against Obamacare involved passing something called the Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act, and opponents have consistently warned that helping Americans afford health care would lead to economic doom. But there\u2019s no job-killing in the data: The U.S. economy has added more than 240,000 jobs a month on average since Obamacare went into effect, its biggest gains since the 1990s.\n\nFinally, what about claims that health reform would cause the budget deficit to explode? In reality, the deficit has continued to decline, and the Congressional Budget Office recently reaffirmed its conclusion that repealing Obamacare would increase, not reduce, the deficit.\n\nPut all these things together, and what you have is a portrait of policy triumph \u2014 a law that, despite everything its opponents have done to undermine it, is achieving its goals, costing less than expected, and making the lives of millions of Americans better and more secure.\n\nNow, you might wonder why a law that works so well and does so much good is the object of so much political venom \u2014 venom that is, by the way, on full display in Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s dissenting opinion, with its rants against \u201cinterpretive jiggery-pokery.\u201d But what conservatives have always feared about health reform is the possibility that it might succeed, and in so doing remind voters that sometimes government action can improve ordinary Americans\u2019 lives.\n\nThat\u2019s why the right went all out to destroy the Clinton health plan in 1993, and tried to do the same to the Affordable Care Act. But Obamacare has survived, it\u2019s here, and it\u2019s working. The great conservative nightmare has come true. And it\u2019s a beautiful thing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Was I on the edge of my seat, waiting for the Supreme Court decision on Obamacare subsidies?
