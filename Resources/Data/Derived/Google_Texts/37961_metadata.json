The new recommendation calls for screening for all adults, regardless of whether clinics have specialized staff, and also includes specific recommendations for pregnant women.\n\nThe task force based its recommendation on an exhaustive review of clinical trials and studies about the effectiveness and accuracy \u2014 but not the cost \u2014 of depression screening. The experts concluded there is enough certainty that screenings help people to require the Affordable Care Act \u2014 also known as Obamacare \u2014 to cover them.\n\nAmong the screening tests recommended by the task force is the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. The test asks respondents to react to 10 statements, including \u201cI have been able to laugh and see the funny side of things,\u201d \u201cI have been so unhappy that I have had difficulty sleeping,\u201d and \u201cThe thought of harming myself has occurred to me.\u201d\n\nDepression in pregnant women has long been a running concern among medical experts, the New York Times Magazine reported. Expecting women with mental health issues often feel ashamed of their feelings, while some doctors fear that a diagnosis of depression could make matters worse because of the social expectation that parents-to-be are supposed to be happy.\n\n\n\nThe question of how to treat depression in pregnant patients has also stirred considerable debate. In its recommendation, the task force said that certain types of psychotherapy \u2014 in particular, cognitive behavioral therapy \u2014 have been shown to be effective in treating depression in pregnant people and new parents. But it also cautioned that some antidepressants could potentially cause harm to fetuses, adding that \u201cthe likelihood of these serious harms is low.\u201d\n\nStill, some doctors and public health experts welcomed the new recommendations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very significant that the task force is now putting forth a recommendation that\u2019s specific to pregnant and postpartum women,\u201d Katy Kozhimannil, professor of public health at the University of Minnesota, told the New York Times. \u201cPolicy makers will pay attention to it. Increased screening and detection of depression is an enormous public health need.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 4135610, "userid": 1353057}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Studies estimate that up to a fifth of all pregnant women experience depression at some point...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
