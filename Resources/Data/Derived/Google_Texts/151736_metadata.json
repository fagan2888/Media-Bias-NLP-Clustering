In September, 2013, at a town-hall meeting in Fremont that he called to explain Obamacare, he leaned back and nodded off as one of the speakers got into the gritty details.\n\nAnd Honda\u2019s not alone. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsurg was guilty of doing the same at the State of the Union address.\n\n#SOTU memories: Ruth Bader Ginsburg falls asleep http://t.co/yvYZNdXf7Z | AP Photo pic.twitter.com/FpD8n8j7fx \u2014 POLITICO (@politico) January 20, 2015\n\nHonda\u2019s nap once again proves C-SPAN can serve up some real gems.\n\nJust last week, Sen.
