Lee said in a conference call devoted to the \u201ccostly gamble\u201d that consumers take by remaining uninsured.\n\nPro-Obamacare officials once shied away from highlighting the tax, instead trying to entice support by highlighting Obamacare\u2019s benefits. But backers now are eager to talk about the tax, saying it\u2019s a critical part of their push to get folks to sign up and make the controversial health law work the way Democrats intended when they wrote it.\n\n\u201cThe rise in penalty has been integral to our messaging and that of our partners throughout this enrollment season,\u201d said Maura Collinsgru, program director at New Jersey Citizen Action, a grass-roots group that promotes Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWhile we can\u2019t say if the penalty is the cause, we do know that enrollment activity is up in New Jersey over last year,\u201d she said.\n\nNow that it\u2019s poised to inflict real pain, the mandate is becoming hard to ignore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough balancing act for the administration, because they\u2019re trying to get people signed up but also play good politics,\u201d said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, a prominent health policy nonprofit.\n\nDemocrats included the mandate in the law to drive healthy people into the marketplace and force them to buy insurance to balance out the flood of sicker customers who leapt to sign up after the law guaranteed they couldn\u2019t be denied coverage anymore.\n\nWithout the healthy customers, economists said Obamacare could face a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of spiking prices that chase people from the health insurance market, leading to still higher prices that cause even more people to cancel their policies and pay the tax instead.\n\nMr. Lee argued the \u201cbigger penalty\u201d for those who forgo insurance in California would be \u201cshowing up in an emergency room, and walking out with a bill in the tens of thousands of dollars.\u201d\n\nYet besides that possibility, there are few economic incentives for holdouts to enroll. More than 7 million Americans would still have to pay more for the cheapest plan available to them than they will owe in taxes if they defy the mandate, according to a recent Kaiser Foundation analysis.\n\nBy contrast, about 3.5 million people could acquire an inexpensive bronze plan and pay nothing in premiums, or at least less than the mandate tax.\n\nFor them, \u201cpaying the penalty is money down the toilet,\u201d Mr. Levitt said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get anything for it.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has said that, unlike last year, it will not extend the open enrollment period for people who find out they owe a penalty. The sign-up period ends Jan. 31, and those who miss out would face both a penalty on their 2015 tax return and a more powerful hit next year, so the administration is pushing people to enroll now.\n\nAbout 8.7 million customers had selected a plan on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange as of Jan. 9, according to a government update Wednesday that showed only a slight uptick in consumer interest between crucial deadlines to get covered under Obamacare in 2016.\n\nLast week, HHS reported that 11.3 million customers had selected plans nationwide, which includes enrollment from the 12 states, plus D.C., that are running their own exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obamacare tax is set to hit particularly hard this year, and federal and state officials are hoping the threat of a $1,000 tax bill will finally be enough to prod reluctant Americans to sign up for the president's controversial health law.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obamacare tax is set to hit particularly hard this year, and federal and state officials are hoping the threat of a $1,000 tax bill will finally be enough to prod reluctant Americans to sign up for the president\u2019s controversial health law.", "title": "Obamacare penalty fee increasing sharply in 2016", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/13/obamacare-penalty-fee-increasing-sharply-in-2016/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/13/Obama_State_of_Union.JPEG-08710.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/13/Obama_State_of_Union.JPEG-08710.jpg", "description": "The Obamacare tax is set to hit particularly hard this year, and federal and state officials are hoping the threat of a $1,000 tax bill will finally be enough to prod reluctant Americans to sign up fo", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare penalty fee increasing sharply in 2016"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf110\"", "article_summary": "Last week, HHS reported that 11.3 million customers had selected plans nationwide, which includes enrollment from the 12 states, plus D.C., that are running their own exchanges.\nIn 2015 the minimum tax was just $325, and the tax rate for wealthier families was only 2 percent.\nBy contrast, about 3.5 million people could acquire an inexpensive bronze plan and pay nothing in premiums, or at least less than the mandate tax.\nThe minimum penalty in 2016 will be $695, and the average penalty will be $969, the government estimates, as wealthier taxpayers who exceed the minimum must pay a 2.5 percent tax on their income above the filing threshold.\nAbout 8.7 million customers had selected a plan on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange as of Jan. 9, according to a government update Wednesday that showed only a slight uptick in consumer interest between crucial deadlines to get covered under Obamacare in 2016."}
