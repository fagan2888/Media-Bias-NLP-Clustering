But that doesn\u2019t mean your attitude toward the pungent-smelling person is harsh or disparaging.\n\nTo the contrary, malodorous strangers can elicit pity and inspire generosity\u2014so long as we believe their unpleasant aroma is due to circumstances beyond their control.\n\nThat\u2019s the conclusion of a research team from the University of Leuven in Belgium, led by psychologist Jeroen Camps. \u201cContrary to what one might intuitively expect,\u201d the researchers write in theJournal of Applied Social Psychology, \u201cour findings revealed that people with bad body odors are not always treated in an unfavorable way.\u201d\n\nCamps and his colleagues describe three experiments backing up their thesis. In the first, 36 participants were asked to sniff either a neutral- or foul-smelling T-shirt, and imagine \u201cit belonged to a person with whom they had to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bad smell was obtained by soaking the T-shirt in a solution of human sweat, beer, hydrogen sulfide and fart spray,\u201d they note.\n\nAfterward, the participants responded to a series of statements designed to reveal their attitudes toward the imaginary person in the shirt. The researchers found those who had smelled the stinky shirt expressed more pity for the wearer than those who had inspected the clean garment.\n\nBut do such feelings change anyone\u2019s behavior? That was the focus of the second experiment, which featured 62 undergraduates. Each was assigned to complete a maze while seated next to a fellow student. Half of those partners wore a clean shirt, while the others wore the foul-smelling one used in the first experiment.\n\nAfterward, participants moved by themselves into another room and played an \u201cultimatum game,\u201d in which they were asked to divide credits between themselves and their partner. \u201cEach credit gave them a chance of winning a movie ticket, so credits were valuable,\u201d the researchers note.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, they found \u201cparticipants who worked with an unpleasant-smelling other donated more credits to this person than participants in the control condition,\u201d To the researchers, this suggests \u201cthere are situations in which a person\u2019s unpleasant body odor increases others\u2019 helping behaviors toward this person.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research suggests a lack of personal hygiene can inspire feelings of pity and generosity", "title": "The upside of body odor", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New research suggests a lack of personal hygiene can inspire feelings of pity and generosity", "title": "The upside of body odor", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/07/the_surprising_benefits_of_body_odor_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/shutterstock_155697284.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New research suggests a lack of personal hygiene can inspire feelings of pity and generosity", "title": "The upside of body odor", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/shutterstock_155697284.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tom Jacobs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, body odor, Generosity, life, Pacific Standard, pity, scientific study", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: body odor, Generosity, life, Pacific Standard, pity, scientific study, Social News, Life NewsThis piece originally appeared on Pacific Standard.\nIf you find yourself in close contact with someone reeking of body odor\u2014say, in a subway car, or supermarket checkout line\u2014your initial response is probably to turn away.\nPerhaps surprisingly, they found \u201cparticipants who worked with an unpleasant-smelling other donated more credits to this person than participants in the control condition,\u201d To the researchers, this suggests \u201cthere are situations in which a person\u2019s unpleasant body odor increases others\u2019 helping behaviors toward this person.\u201d\nHalf of those partners wore a clean shirt, while the others wore the foul-smelling one used in the first experiment.\n\u201cEach credit gave them a chance of winning a movie ticket, so credits were valuable,\u201d the researchers note."}
