(AP) - Arkansas health officials announced Monday that the state is ending a home health care program that serves thousands of people, a move that could leave 2,300 workers and contractors seeking new jobs.\n\nArkansas Department of Health Director Nathaniel Smith told workers with the state\u2019s In Home Services program that the state would begin phasing out the program.\n\n\u201cWe have determined that the program is no longer sustainable for the agency due to financial constraints and competition from the private sector,\u201d Smith wrote in a letter dated Monday. \u201cOver the next several months, we will explore opportunities to transition our In Home Services to a private sector provider.\u201d\n\nAbout 13,000 people are served by the program, which provides in-home services such as health care and hospice. Smith said in the letter that the department would help those served by the program move to a private provider over the next several months.\n\nAbout 500 Health Department employees work on the program, along with another 1,800 who contract with the state. A spokeswoman for the department said the agency didn\u2019t have a definite end date for the program, and Smith wrote the process would take at least six months.\n\nSmith said the state would assist workers as they try to find jobs with a private provider or elsewhere in state government.\n\n\u201cTheir jobs are going to be there until that private sector transition occurs and then it\u2019s up to the private sector on whether they keep them as employees,\u201d ADH spokeswoman Kerry Krell said.\n\nKerry said the revenue and number of people participating in the program has declined steadily over the past several years, decreasing from 18,600 served by it in the fiscal year that ended in June 2011. The revenue from the program has decreased from $71.5 million in the 2011 fiscal year to $58.6 million in the fiscal year that just ended.\n\nGov. Asa Hutchinson said he supported the decision to wind down the program, saying the state shouldn\u2019t be competing with the private sector in providing such home health services.\n\n\u201cThis is an example of a government program that is no longer sustainable and can be ended because the private sector has stepped in to meet demand,\u201d Hutchinson said in a statement released Monday afternoon. \u201cIn the long run, this transition will preserve jobs, save taxpayer dollars and result in a more efficient, viable and sustainable in-home care program for Arkansans.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arkansas health officials announced Monday that the state is ending a home health care program that serves thousands of people, a move that could leave 2,300 workers and contractors seeking new jobs.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/10/arkansas-ending-program-providing-home-health-care/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Arkansas health officials announced Monday that the state is ending a home health care program that serves thousands of people, a move that could leave 2,300 workers and contractors seeking new jobs.", "title": "Arkansas ending program providing home health care to 13K"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Arkansas health officials announced Monday that the state is ending a home health care program that serves thousands of people, a move that could leave 2,300 workers and contractors seeking new jobs.", "card": "summary", "title": "Arkansas ending program providing home health care to 13K"}, "Author": "ANDREW DeMILLO", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Arkansas Department of Health Director Nathaniel Smith told workers with the state\u2019s In Home Services program that the state would begin phasing out the program.\n\u201cTheir jobs are going to be there until that private sector transition occurs and then it\u2019s up to the private sector on whether they keep them as employees,\u201d ADH spokeswoman Kerry Krell said.\n(AP) - Arkansas health officials announced Monday that the state is ending a home health care program that serves thousands of people, a move that could leave 2,300 workers and contractors seeking new jobs.\nAbout 500 Health Department employees work on the program, along with another 1,800 who contract with the state.\nAsa Hutchinson said he supported the decision to wind down the program, saying the state shouldn\u2019t be competing with the private sector in providing such home health services."}
