Donald Trump may be the current frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, but a Harris Poll survey indicates that could change if Clint Eastwood entered the race.

When U.S. adults were asked to choose who would make a better president between the former "Celebrity Apprentice" host or the "American Sniper" director, 72 percent of respondents chose Eastwood.

Eastwood, an outspoken Republican, famously delivered a rambling, ad-libbed speech to an empty chair at the 2012 Republican National convention, but the actor-director does have real political credibility that includes a two-year term as mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California and an appointment to the California State Parks and Recreation Commission in 2001.
