The front page of Saturday’s Denver Post contained shocking allegations against El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa concerning last year’s deadly Black Forest Fire, charges that Maketa hotly disputed.

That story comes on the heels of a Colorado Springs Gazette story about a sheriff’s candidate and a missing file.

The Republican sheriff made a name for himself last year during a heated battle over gun control at the Colorado General Assembly when he accused Senate Democratic leadership of threatening to withhold a bill on pay increases for county sheriffs because of their opposition to gun control measures.

Senate President John Morse, a Colorado Springs Democrat, called the allegations “blatantly false” and “reprehensible.” And Delta County Sheriff Fred McKee, who was president of County Sheriffs of Colorado, said he had no knowledge of any Democratic lawmakers making any sort of threats in regard to pay raises.

Maketa said at the time he was going to ask Attorney General John Suthers to investigate.

“To my knowledge we were never asked,” Suthers said Sunday.
