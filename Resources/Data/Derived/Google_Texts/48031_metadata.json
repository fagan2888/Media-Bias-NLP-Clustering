I don\u2019t know who that will be, but I hope whomever it is will consider this advice.\n\nNearly 16 years ago, I stood for the first time on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, took my oath, and became a member of Congress. My eyes were wide, my head brimming with ideas, my hair brown.\n\nI\u2019ve decided to leave the House at year\u2019s end to become a silver-haired \u201crecovering congressman.\u201d It\u2019s time to pursue new passions and develop new interests. I loved writing a satirical novel about Washington, and I\u2019d like more time to devote to my second novel.\n\nNow it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn to represent the hardworking people of the 3rd District. I don\u2019t know who that will be, but I hope whomever it is will consider this advice.\n\nConstituents first. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the glamour of Washington: speaking with the president, pontificating on national TV, having phone calls returned. But those are called trappings of power for a reason. They can trap you. What is important is what\u2019s happening at Long Island diners \u2014 listening to people and finding out how you can help. Remember who pays your salary. I\u2019m most proud to have secured $8.3 million in back pay for veterans. Too many constituents who served have been shunted aside, stifled by bureaucratic red tape. I\u2019d meet them to deliver a long overdue medal or retroactive pay, and many would say my office restored their faith in government\u2019s ability to get it right \u2014 late, but right.\n\nCompromise. I am leaving one of the most polarized environments Congress has ever seen. Shortly after I was elected, 9/11 happened, and I won\u2019t forget standing on the Capitol steps, holding hands with my colleagues in a moment of unity. Now we have shutdowns, dozens of fruitless bills to repeal Obamacare, and relentless efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. None of that helps New Yorkers worried about their paychecks, jobs and college tuition.\n\nYou can break through the nonsense by finding someone on the other side of the aisle and cooperating when you can. I did that with Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford) on Sandy relief funds, with Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) on Israel, and with Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.) to help veterans transfer education benefits to spouses and children.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nYou are as good or bad as your staff. Virtually every day, a constituent would thank me for helping to solve a problem. I didn\u2019t handle every case. My staff did. Don\u2019t hire political operatives. Hire problem solvers. Mine worked nights and most weekends. I often told them: \u201cYou won\u2019t change the world; just try changing it one constituent at a time.\u201d They have, many times.\n\nBring lots of reading material. I sat on many flights listening to the pilot say, \u201cWe\u2019re 14th in line for takeoff,\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019re on a ground stop because of delays at LaGuardia Airport.\u201d Evidently there\u2019s a new meteorological phenomenon that creates flight-canceling thunderstorms only between Washington and New York, only between April and August, and only on days when members of Congress are flying home.\n\nFocus on the middle class. America was strongest when its middle class was largest. Lately, the middle class has declined, creating massive anxiety across America. Focus on rebuilding an economy that creates 21st-century careers rather than teeters on 20th-century paychecks, and that includes making education more affordable. I\u2019ll give you some hints: There is great potential for New York to become a world-class center for neuroscience research and, also, cyberprotection.\n\nSign up for The Point and go inside New York politics.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to what the former congressman tells you. Be your own person. As long as you reflect the values and priorities of those you are privileged to represent, you will do well.\n\nFinally, have a sense of humor. I look forward to commenting on the farce of politics by writing about it, with my tongue planted firmly in my cheek. I love writing, especially when I can poke fun at Washington. It\u2019s not that hard.\n\nRep. Steve Israel is a Democrat from Huntington.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Sun, 10 Jan 2016 06:00:00 -0500", "sailthru.author": "Steve Israel", "description": "Now it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn to represent the hardworking people of the 3rd District.
