A dentist had testified the girl\u2019s teeth were in such bad shape they posed a potentially fatal threat to her health, the newspaper said.\n\nWanamaker also pleaded guilty to false swearing and is eligible for parole. His sentence is two months to a year, but he\u2019s been in jail since having his bail revoked in December for failing to enroll in drug treatment.\n\nDefense attorney Mark Freeman said the girl\u2019s treatment was put off while the family looked for an affordable way to pay for it.\n\nAuthorities still are investigating the deaths of Wanamaker\u2019s other children. A baby boy died of pneumonia in 2011, and there were two stillborn deliveries since 2007, one of which was linked to his domestic partner\u2019s drug abuse, prosecutors said would potentially be at risk without the proper treatment, describing her condition to authorities as, \u201cThe worst case of dental disease he has ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe dentist findings are laid out in an affidavit that describes a case of neglect so severe, the youngster is suffering from 14 abscessed teeth.\n\nThe report goes on to say that if her condition is ignored any further the result could be a potentially fatal infection.\n\nAuthorities say the most disturbing part is that the girl was scheduled to undergo surgery back in March. But her parents, Kevin Wanamaker and Jessica Hoffman, never scheduled a pre-operation exam and so the procedure has yet to be performed.\n\nWe spoke with an investigative team from the Northampton County Children, Youth, and Services Division. While they are not permitted to discuss the details of a pending case, department administrator Kevin Dolan says the situation was handled by the book from the moment they receive the first complaint.\n\nDolan explains, \u201cWe have to begin the investigation within 24 hours and then take action based on what we\u2019re discovering, either through our safety assessment or the immediate investigation.\u201d\n\nAction News also spoke by phone with the girl\u2019s father.\n\nKenneth Wanamaker says that while his daughter\u2019s teeth need some help, he and the youngster\u2019s mother are raising a happy, well-adjusted child who is vibrant and involved in a number of activities, including youth car racing.\n\nWanamaker goes on to say that he doesn\u2019t even think that the authorities really believe his daughter\u2019s life is in any kind of danger.\n\nHe tells us, \u201cWhat law enforcement agency would wait six months and file these charges? It\u2019s all an act for me to comply, and do these requirements, and jump through hoops of the system.\u201d\n\nHowever, arrangements are now being made for that surgery to be performed this summer. But the girl\u2019s parents, who have been released on $40,000 bail, are still facing child endangerment charges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The father of a 6-year-old girl whose teeth were so rotten her life was endangered pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment on Friday.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mediageneral.wate", "og": {"site_name": "WATE 6 On Your Side", "description": "The father of a 6-year-old girl whose teeth were so rotten her life was endangered pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment on Friday.", "title": "Man pleads guilty in case over young daughter\u2019s rotten teeth", "url": "http://wate.com/2015/04/19/man-pleads-guilty-in-case-over-young-daughters-rotten-teeth/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://mgtvwate.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/download-1.jpg", "height": 362}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The father of a 6-year-old girl whose teeth were so rotten her life was endangered pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment on Friday.", "creator": "@6News", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwate.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/download-1.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Man pleads guilty in case over young daughter\u2019s rotten teeth", "site": "6news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Knoxville, TN News & Weather", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id= 511297956", "fb": {"pages": 112945508738113}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WATE 6 On Your Side", "google-site-verification": "CV5oKVNQCepzG3ubMGxG21BH-llTVkuHAscpIom1HPI", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WATE6OnYourSide", "published_time": "2015-04-19T15:36:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-19T15:36:07+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wate.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1d4ffc72e0fc147870ebace80df0a02a?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e6e\"", "article_summary": "Defense attorney Mark Freeman said the girl\u2019s treatment was put off while the family looked for an affordable way to pay for it.\nA dentist had testified the girl\u2019s teeth were in such bad shape they posed a potentially fatal threat to her health, the newspaper said.\nKenneth Wanamaker Jr. pleaded guilty weeks before a scheduled trial in the case, The Morning Call newspaper in Allentown reported.\nAuthorities say the most disturbing part is that the girl was scheduled to undergo surgery back in March.\nWanamaker goes on to say that he doesn\u2019t even think that the authorities really believe his daughter\u2019s life is in any kind of danger."}
