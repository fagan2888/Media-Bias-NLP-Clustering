Steve King (R-Iowa) is not shy in his criticism of President Obama\u2019s abuse of executive power.\n\nThe GOP congressman compared Obama to socialist Karl Marx, famous for penning \u201cThe Communist Manifesto,\u201d during a conversation with conservative commentator Glenn Beck on his radio program, according to audio captured by BuzzFeed.\n\n\u201cThe president has contempt for Congress; he ignores Congress. He has taught the Constitution but he defies his own words,\u201d King alleged. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t yet in a clear way defied the courts. If he gets a bad decision \u2014 well, one he disagrees with \u2014 on Obamacare, if he gets a bad decision on immigration and defies the courts, who knows how the public will respond to this.\u201d\n\nThe Iowa congressman said that Obama would reach \u201cemperor status\u201d if he gets away with defying the Supreme Court\u2019s authority.\n\n\u201cHis calculation is not what\u2019s true and just and right or even good for America,\u201d King expanded. \u201cIt\u2019s how can he exploit his power base and move our country to the left toward the ideology of Karl Marx. How far can he go and get away with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no conscience involved in this,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense of duty to the Constitution or his oath to it. He has kicked that completely sideways.\u201d\n\nKing went on to declare that voters have been \u201ctoo apathetic\u201d to Obama\u2019s executive overreach, pointing in particular to the president\u2019s executive action on immigration last November.\n\n\u201cI thought we\u2019d all be ready to surround the White House when the president issued his November 20th orders,\u201d King said.\n\n\u201cWe need a new president,\u201d he concluded.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Rep.
