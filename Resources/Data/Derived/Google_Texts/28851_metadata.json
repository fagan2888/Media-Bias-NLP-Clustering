In May 2015, McSally voted for a bill that would prohibit abortions in cases where the probable age of the fetus is 20 weeks or later and would impose criminal penalties on doctors who violate the ban. It would provide exceptions for cases in which the woman's life is in danger as well as for pregnancies that are a result of rape if, as amended, for pregnancies that are a result of rape against an adult woman, the woman received counseling or medical treatment for the rape at least 48 hours prior to the abortion. An exception would be provided for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest against a minor if the rape or incest had been previously reported to law enforcement or another government agency authorized to act on reports of child abuse.

In 2015, McSally voted for the \u2018No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,\u2019 which \u201cseeks to make the [Hyde] amendment permanent law, and to prevent federal funds from going not just toward abortions themselves but toward any plan, provider, or facility that offer such services. [\u2026] The bill gives insurers a big incentive to drop abortion coverage from their plans, or risk losing the large pool of consumers who receive the law\u2019s subsidies.\u201d [National Journal, 1/28/15; HR 7, Vote #45, 1/22/15; CQ Floor Votes]\n\n\n\n\u25cf McSally Opposed Abortion in Cases of Rape and Incest during Her First Run for Office. \u201cDuring her 2012 campaign, in a questionnaire from a conservative group, McSally said she supported repealing Obamacare and prohibiting abortion except when it was necessary to prevent the death of the mother.\u201d [Politico, 6/09/14]\n\nThe Democratic political action committee EMILY's List put U.S. Rep. Martha McSally \"on notice\" for the next election cycle, making her seat a \"top target\" for a Democrat takeover in 2016.The PAC keeps track of Republican incumbents at all levels of government who have an anti-abortion, anti-reproductive health record.\u201cThe EMILY\u2019s List community\u2014more than three million members strong\u2014is committed to holding elected officials accountable for their extreme anti-woman and anti-family records,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY\u2019s List. \u201cIn the last five months of the 114th Congress, Congresswoman McSally has proven to be more interested in supporting national abortion bans and restricting women\u2019s access to health care instead of the interest of the most vulnerable men and women in Arizona\u2019s Second Congressional District.
