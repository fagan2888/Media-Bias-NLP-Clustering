U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) spent 21 hours faux-filibustering against it. Right-wing personalities have even likened it to slavery. The GOP\u2019s fight to destroy \u2018Obamacare\u2019 has reached new, headline-grabbing heights.\n\nWhile eyes are on the action at the federal level, some conservative Republican governors have used every tool in their arsenal to thwart the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on a state level\u2014from rejecting the Medicaid expansion to signing \u2018Health Care Compacts\u2019 into law.\n\nAnd it looks like they\u2019ve gotten a little help from their corporate friends.\n\nBehind some of the statewide anti-health care strategy you\u2019ll find The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a shadowy network of corporate lobbyists, representing companies including Koch Industries, ExxonMobil, AT&T and Pfizer, that draft model legislation increasingly used by state lawmakers, particularly those of the conservative Republican persuasion. In return, legislators get invited to swanky parties (read: fundraising opportunities), all-expenses paid trips and even free childcare. More than 1,000 of these corporate-backed bills are introduced into statehouses by legislators each year, with one in every five of them enacted into law, according to the Center for Media and Democracy.\n\nThe doors to ALEC busted wide open when in 2011 a whistleblower released a stunning trove of documents exposing the inner working of the secretive organization to CMD, which made it available for public viewing. While recommending model legislation may be part and parcel of the think tank process, what sets ALEC apart is the pure corporate influence\u201498 percent of its revenue comes from corporations\u2014that has a direct role in changing, enabling and killing legislation alongside lawmakers. Oftentimes, legislators come back to the statehouse without publicizing ALEC\u2019s involvement in the bills they sponsor.\n\n\u201cIt revealed the breath and depth of corporate influence over law and policy,\u201d Brendan Fischer, CMD\u2019s general counsel told the Current, referring to the 2011 evidence. \u201cALEC exists for the benefit of the corporations that are footing the bill and the evidence indicates they\u2019re getting a lot in return.\u201d\n\nIf the acronym sounds familiar, but you can\u2019t quit pin where you last heard it, chances are it was during the George Zimmerman trial. The \u2018corporate bill mill\u2019 made national headlines and garnered scrutiny when a piece of their model legislation was tied to the infamous \u2018Stand Your Ground Law\u2019 that played into the acquittal of Zimmerman in the killing of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin. The rise of ALEC\u2019s profile in such pejorative terms likely led to the exodus of several legislative members in 2012.\n\nIn sum, ALEC drafts ideologically and financially motivated legislation that, among other goals, seek to weaken labor laws and environmental regulation, and privatize education\u2014and health care laws are a particular focal point. In 2011, the group created the handy \u201cState Legislators Guide to Repealing Obamacare,\u201d a step-by-step guide detailing how to locally dismantle the ACA. Part of the strategy includes warning against the federal Medicaid expansion and instituting a law to provide a state-level \u201cdefense against Obamacare\u2019s excessive federal power.\u201d Among other things, the \u201cFreedom of Choice in Health Care Act\u201d helps arm states in litigation against the ACA.\n\nSound familiar? Texas\u2019 statewide leadership appears to have taken a page straight from ALEC\u2019s playbook in terms of responding to ACA policy. A staunch and vocal opponent of Obamacare, Gov. Rick Perry refuses to expand Medicaid, effectively denying more than 2 million eligible working adults access to health care. He\u2019s thrown up extra barriers for ACA navigators, the assistants trained to aid residents in signing up for ACA coverage. The governor has even gone so far as to deem Obamacare a \u201ccriminal act.\u201d Under Perry\u2019s 2011 legislature, the \u201cHealth Freedom Act\u201d\u2014written by a legislator who also serves as an ALEC task force member\u2014directly mimics ALEC\u2019s key vehicle for sinking Obamacare.\n\nIt may be no surprise then that ALEC and Texas legislators have cultivated a cozy relationship. From 2001-2011, Texas politicians saw $16.2 million from ALEC corporate partners, the second highest among states. Perry leads as the largest single beneficiary of ALEC funds, receiving more than $2 million in campaign contributions from ALEC corporate partners, according to Progress Texas, which tracks ALEC\u2019s influence in state politics. As the recipient of a 2010 award from the organization, it\u2019s safe to say Perry stands as an ALEC star.\n\n\u201cTexas is probably one of the strongest places in the country for ALEC laws,\u201d said Phillip Martin, deputy director of Progress Texas. \u201cALEC has tremendous influence in our state. Texas policy is shaped by ALEC and like-minded corporations that value the profit of their companies over the well-being of Texans.\u201d\n\nALEC\u2019s largesse seems to have bought it a veritable testing ground for their policy aims here. According to Martin, ALEC\u2019s national model for health care legislation originated in Texas, perhaps not surprisingly via Sen. Cruz himself.\n\nThe \u2018Health Care Compact\u2019\u2014an agreement between participating states that shields them from the ACA by transferring power back to state governments to disburse their own health care funds through block grants in lieu of a federal plan\u2014was first launched by former Texas solicitor general Cruz while he was a fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a research organization with strong ties to ALEC that bills itself as \u201cone of the nation\u2019s premier free market think tanks.\u201d\n\nWith TPPF, Cruz co-authored a 2010 report that describes Obamacare as an \u201cunconstitutional federal overreach and violation of 10th Amendment rights.\u201d The paper then spelled out what would become ALEC\u2019s own model legislation to upend Obamacare. The national Health Care Compact Alliance also credits the idea to TPPF and helpfully explains in a headline, \u201cALEC adopts Health Care Compact as model legislation.\u201d\n\nThe compact is popular among conservative governors seeking to distance themselves from the feds, including Gov. Perry, who signed Texas\u2019 interstate health care compact, authored by an ALEC Health and Human Services Task Force member, just weeks before announcing his presidential candidacy. (It\u2019s worth noting that while seven states to date have signed the compact into law, it\u2019s got no teeth until it receives unlikely Congressional approval, making it a largely symbolic measure as of now.)\n\nWhile Perry\u2019s attempt to influence national politics drifted away with his failed presidential bid, the symbiotic relationship between TPPF and ALEC may yet be able to succeed in spreading Texas conservative ideals, including those of extremists like Cruz, throughout the nation, while bringing additional \u201cgreatest hits\u201d home from other ALEC hotbeds. \u201cTPPF is really ALEC\u2019s home away from home,\u201d said Martin. \u201cA lot of research from TPPF relies on ALEC and ALEC member organizations.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to further lift the veil shrouding ALEC, the Center for Media and Democracy issued open records requests to multiple legislators across the country associated with ALEC, with little trouble\u2014until they got to Texas.\n\nA recent fight to obtain ALEC-related documents played out between CMD and a state lawmaker unwilling to hand the information over. After ALEC began stamping its material with a \u201cdisclaimer\u201d that argued it was exempt from state open records law, freshman State Rep. Stephanie Klick (R-Fort Worth) then tried to withhold ALEC documents, seeking an Attorney General opinion in the meantime. That\u2019s especially troubling for CMD\u2019s Fischer since ALEC doesn\u2019t release its list of members or funders and routinely bars the press from attending task force meetings\u2014one of the only effective avenues in unearthing the group\u2019s impact is through records requests.\n\n\u201cThey intentionally try to operate in secret, but we\u2019ve been able to uncover a fair amount of information about their influence through open records law,\u201d said Fischer. \u201cBut lately, in our opinion, they\u2019ve been trying to sneak back into the shadows.\u201d\n\nTurns out ALEC\u2019s latest scheme to remain as secretive as possible didn\u2019t fly with the Texas AG office. CMD and the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, who also filed a brief against ALEC\u2019s failure to disclose, prevailed. Early last week, CMD got their hands on the documents, which reveal a continued legislative push to erode Obamacare.\n\nKlick and other legislators were invited to an August 2013 ALEC annual meeting in Chicago, where the group\u2019s Health and Human Services Task Force would brief them on model legislation that seeks to undo the ACA, including a law that would authorize Medicaid block grants to states, a resolution that opposes government-mandated rate caps on health insurance premiums because it, \u201cflies in the face of the free market\u201d and expectedly, the \u201cHealth Care Freedom Act,\u201d according to the released materials, made available to the Current.\n\nALEC task force members attending the Chicago meeting enjoyed free travel, lodging and some meals, as well as the potential to be reimbursed for vaguely stated \u201cother\u201d fees, according to the documents.\n\n\u201cIt seems pretty significant that all of these Texas lobbyists are flying up to Chicago, booking an expensive hotel room, and sponsoring these expensive dinners in Chicago for Texas legislators,\u201d said Fischer. \u201cIt\u2019s a good example of how ALEC works and who it works for. It\u2019s not just the existence of model bills, but everything that surrounds it\u2014all of those the opportunities for excessive influence and developing relationships to gain access to legislators.\u201d\n\nFischer says he was surprised by the open records law battle in Texas as it marked the first known occasion where ALEC formally requested that a state Attorney General grant immunity from sunshine-in-government laws.\n\nHowever, considering our deep ties to ALEC, perhaps it makes sense that Texas has more to hide.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Content Default", "description": "The federal government has come to a screeching halt because of it.
