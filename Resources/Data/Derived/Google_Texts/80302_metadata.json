Hewlett-Packard\u2019s poor performance during her tenure has been a point of criticism of her candidacy.\n\nSome readers said a feminist is a woman who makes independent choices, regardless of her position on specific issues.\n\n\u201cI abhor Fiorina\u2019s politics, but she\u2019s correct that feminism is a woman leading the life she chooses, in spite of what men want on both the individual and social levels,\u201d Jenifer Wolf in New York City wrote.\n\nBut just being a successful woman doesn\u2019t make Mrs. Fiorina a feminist, some readers argued.\n\n\u201cCarly is not promoting policies that would help women in this country such as health care, child care, and equal pay,\u201d Abelle in Portland, Ore., wrote of the candidate, who has promoted the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cJust because she is a strong woman doesn\u2019t mean she promotes women\u2019s equality in public life.\u201d\n\nOthers said it\u2019s problematic for Mrs. Fiorina to trumpet her status as a leader.\n\n\u201cHer record at Hewlett-Packard \u2014 firing skilled Americans by the thousands and outsourcing their jobs to China and India, while almost running her company into the ground with an ill-advised merger \u2014 is hardly a sterling record for any sort of candidate, assuming we actually want a president of all the people rather than a modern Ebenezer Scrooge,\u201d Grossness54 wrote from West Palm Beach, Fla. \u201cThis is a woman who would deny other women control over their own bodies, as well. If she\u2019s a feminist then I\u2019m a T. rex.\u201d\n\nIn a recent column, David Brooks described Mrs. Fiorina as \u201cstylistically indomitable\u201d and called her a \u201cmarketing genius.\u201d However, he wrote \u201cfor all her feisty outsider bravado, if you actually look at her views on substance and her behavior in the past, she is a completely conventional Republican.\u201d And at Hewlett-Packard, he said, \u201cshe made the classic marketer\u2019s error, letting her promises get far out in front of reality.\u201d\n\nLike Mr. Brooks, many readers expressed skepticism about Mrs. Fiorina\u2019s leadership abilities.\n\n\u201cIf she is such a marketing genius,\u201d John W. Lusk wrote from Danbury, Conn., \u201cwhy hasn\u2019t another company hired her?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151006163246, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "per": "Brooks, David;Fiorina, Carleton S", "org": "Hewlett-Packard Company;Planned Parenthood Federation of America", "keywords": "Brooks David,Fiorina Carleton S,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Women and Girls,Women's Rights,Hewlett-Packard Company,Planned Parenthood Federation of America,Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/\u2018If She's a Feminist Then I\u2019m a T.
