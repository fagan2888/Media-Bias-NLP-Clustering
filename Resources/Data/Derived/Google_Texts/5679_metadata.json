And, in an ironic twist, the shift that tipped the city's political climate from conservative to liberal came in 1971, when Republican President Richard M. Nixon, during his first term, gave 18- to 21-year-olds the right to vote.\n\nOn the University of Colorado campus, nearly 7,000 students quickly registered, many becoming interested in politics for the first time. This was during the Vietnam War, after the U.S. invasion of Cambodia and the Ohio National Guard shootings of unarmed students at Kent State University.\n\nBoulder students rioted in May 1972. In November 1972, Nixon was re-elected by a landslide, even in Boulder County, where Republicans still outnumbered Democrats. But Nixon cut off his own coattails by endorsing the youth vote. When newly enfranchised CU students voted that year, they pulled the lever for Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.\n\nThe majority of the students voted straight Democratic tickets, ushering local Democrats into office. In the county's most heated races, Democrat Wally Toevs was elected commissioner and Democrat Alex Hunter district attorney.\n\nAfter all of the votes in the 1972 election were tallied, Boulder County Republicans had lost their once-rock-solid foothold. As the Camera stated at the time, \"Republican near-domination of local races came to an end,\" adding that \"Democrats stared at their televisions in happy disbelief.\"\n\nOn Aug. 8, 1974, Boulder voters (and others all over the country) cheered when Nixon resigned from office when he faced impeachment after becoming embroiled in the Watergate scandals. Shannon's Restaurant and Lounge, 1025 Pearl St., was one of many Boulder gathering places packed with customers s watching the breaking news on live television.\n\nAccording to an on-the-scene Camera reporter, as soon as Nixon announced his resignation, the crowd \"went bananas,\" adding \"the smell of blood was in the air.\"\n\nLiberals then quickly controlled local Boulder politics, but the majority of Boulder County voters continued, for three more elections, to choose Republicans in national elections. In 1976, county voters picked Gerald Ford over Jimmy Carter, followed by Ronald Reagan over Carter in 1980. Four years later, they again voted for Reagan when he ran against Walter Mondale.\n\nBoulder County's swing to the Democratic side in national elections began in 1988, when voters selected Michael Dukakis over George H.W. Bush. Both the city and county have been predominantly Democratic ever since. Bob Greenlee was Boulder's last Republican mayor, from 1998 to 1999. And the last Republican to hold office in Boulder County was Sandy Hume, who served as treasurer from 1995 to 2002.\n\nNixon's rationale for the youth vote was based on the premise that if 18-year-olds were old enough to be drafted and face death in the Vietnam War, they were old enough to vote. Nixon ended the draft in 1973, but his action came too late for Boulder's young and liberal voters, who were glad to see him go.\n\nAs the on-site reporter wrote, \"Nobody cried at the show's end.\"\n\nSilvia Pettem and Carol Taylor write about history for the Daily Camera.
