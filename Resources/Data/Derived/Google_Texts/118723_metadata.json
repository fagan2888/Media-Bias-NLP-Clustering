The pediatrician did a test for strep, which came back negative. After that, he just shrugged and told us it was a viral infection, probably stemming from an allergy.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to test for a virus, he told us. Pinning down an exact diagnosis would require blood work, and for many children the trauma of having blood drawn to diagnose a condition for which nothing can be done outweighs knowing the actual condition.\n\nThere is nothing more frustrating for a parent than to hear the words \u201cjust wait it out,\u201d but according to Michael Brady, a spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, waiting it out is basically all anyone can do when dealing with a virus.\n\n\u201cParents want to be part of trying to help their child get better,\u201d he said, \u201cbut sometimes doing nothing is better than doing something, particularly when the treatment could be worse than the virus itself.\u201d\n\nBrady, an Ohio pediatrician specializing in infectious diseases in children, emphasized that cold medicines do nothing to cure a virus.\n\n\u201cJust say no to cold medicines,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do not work, and they have some medications in them that make kids irritable and upset. They are more dangerous than helpful. All the over-the-counter meds are discouraged for children of any age.\u201d\n\nBrady said that most such medications fall into two camps: antihistamines and decongestants.\n\n\u201cAntihistamines do nothing for colds, because there has been no increase in histamines to begin with,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd decongestant syrup is meant to clear the nose and sinuses, but it must go through the patient\u2019s bloodstream first, meaning in order to get enough to be effective, you\u2019d have to ingest way too much of it.\u201d\n\nEven worse, he said, are cold medicines that include fever reducers, because the mixture makes it difficult for parents to know exactly how much fever reducer their child has taken.\n\n\u201cIf you need to give Motrin or Tylenol, give it by itself,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t waste time or money on combination cold medicines.\u201d\n\nBrady said honey works best for coughs and that Vicks VapoRub is better for decongesting than any syrup. And while sprays work better than meds, parents should use them for only a few days. Otherwise, they risk damaging the nasal passages.\n\nThe time to really start taking note of symptoms is when a child stops eating regularly, has a fever of higher than 101 or is no longer alert while awake. Even then, he said, call the pediatrician before going to an urgent care or emergency room.\n\n\u201cMany pediatricians are happy to talk to parents over the phone during off hours,\u201d Brady said. \u201cRemember, the pediatrician knows their patient better than an emergency room ever could.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/09/SCI_BRODY_HEALTH2.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2125\"", "article_summary": "After that, he just shrugged and told us it was a viral infection, probably stemming from an allergy.\nAnd while sprays work better than meds, parents should use them for only a few days.\n\u201cJust say no to cold medicines,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t waste time or money on combination cold medicines.\u201dBrady said honey works best for coughs and that Vicks VapoRub is better for decongesting than any syrup.\n\u201cMany pediatricians are happy to talk to parents over the phone during off hours,\u201d Brady said."}
