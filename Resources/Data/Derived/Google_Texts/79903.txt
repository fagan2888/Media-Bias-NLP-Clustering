Star Wars: Episode VII spoilers are likely going to stay buried on the internet, one of the upcoming movie’s stars says.

Domhall Gleeson, who was best known for playing Bill Weasley in the Harry Potter series, recently stopped in to HuffPost Live for an interview but said there wasn’t a whole lot he could divulge about the film.

Gleeson explained that all the Star Wars: Episode VII spoilers are carefully guarded by Disney, which is employing a strict gag order on those working on the movie.

“I get sick in my mouth every time someone brings up ‘Star Wars.’ I’m so nervous I’m going to give something away. I just get a faraway look in my eyes and try to remain calm,” Gleeson said. “You sign a massive, big, long contract thing… and then they send you a one-page thing that says, ‘Here is what you’re allowed to talk about.’ And then there’s just a big empty page. It says you’re allowed to say you’re excited to be in the movie. That’s it.”

That’s not to say there is no information about Star Wars: Episode VII. To drum up interest, Disney CEO Bob Iger has released some teasers about the movie and what he’s seen in the footage so far.

“I can only tell you that production is underway. We have a very brief hiatus, which is due in part to the fact that Harrison Ford broke his ankle (leg),” Iger said. “The footage we’ve seen is very, very exciting to us. I think there’s about 500 days left between now and December 18th, 2015 when the movie comes out. That doesn’t seem like very long.”

He added, “There’s a lot of pent up demand. We’re just as excited as the fans are about it.”

It seems that those who want to find out about the Star Wars: Episode VII spoilers will have to wait until it hits theaters on December 18, 2015.
