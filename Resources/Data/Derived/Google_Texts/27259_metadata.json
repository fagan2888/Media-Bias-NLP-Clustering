After questions about the Senate race, President Obama and the 2015 governor\u2019s race, would-be voters were asked, \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the Affordable Care Act?\u201d then \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of Kynect?\u201d The terms were not defined; the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is widely known as Obamacare, so opinion of the president influences opinion of the law.\n\nFifty-one percent said they disapproved of the law, while 34 percent said they approved and 14 percent said they were not sure. But regarding Kynect, the brand for the insurance exchange, 34 percent said they approved, 27 percent said they disapproved and 40 percent said they weren\u2019t sure. The poll\u2019s error margin, which applies to each figure, was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nThe more liberal voters were, the more likely they were to approve of the reform law and the insurance exchange. Among moderate voters, 47 percent approved of both, while 36 percent disapproved of the law and only 17 percent disapproved of Kynect. The remainders were undecided.\n\nWomen and Democrats were more likely to approve of both measures. Independents disapproved of the reform law more strongly than Republicans did, and were evenly divided about Kynect, but they were only 10 percent of the total, so the error margin for their results is almost 10 percentage points.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://bizlex.com/2014/08/poll-kynect-considered-a-success-but-voters-havent-embraced-it-and-they-still-disapprove-of-the-affordable-care-act/", "type": "article", "image": "http://bizlex.com/bl/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/kynect_logo_4C_300.png", "site_name": "Business Lexington", "title": "Poll: Kynect Considered a Success, but Voters Haven\u2019t Embraced it, and They Still Disapprove of the Affordable Care Act"}, "fb": {"app_id": 126882277485720}, "generator": "WordPress 3.3.1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9cc5\"", "article_summary": "Among moderate voters, 47 percent approved of both, while 36 percent disapproved of the law and only 17 percent disapproved of Kynect.\nThe more liberal voters were, the more likely they were to approve of the reform law and the insurance exchange.\nLexington, KY \u2013 A new poll again indicates that Kentuckians marginally approve of the state health-insurance exchange created under the federal health-reform law, but clearly disapprove of the law itself.\nThe poll, taken Aug. 7-10, surveyed Kentuckians who said they were likely to vote in the Nov. 4 election for the U.S. Senate.\nFifty-one percent said they disapproved of the law, while 34 percent said they approved and 14 percent said they were not sure."}
