MEADOWS: But maternity is one that you can probably analyze pretty well for someone who’s in their 50s. COHEN: Right, but it’s a minimal essential benefit we wanted to make sure that all Americans had access to.

"That's almost a reasonable question, so good job—although pregnancy after fifty is still possible , which is one of the reasons we probably should not nix insurance coverage for it based on the medical understandings of one Rep. Mark Meadows. But to get to the larger stupid point you were making, again—that is how insurance works. Everyone insures themselves for things that probably will not actually happen to them, and the small amount of money contributed by each of them becomes a large pool of money that can be used to assist anyone in the group who does have that thing happen to them.

"While we could break every bit of insurance apart, having separate things like heart insurance, lung insurance, toenail insurance and the like, we don't do that because first, it would be absurdly more complex, and second, the odds of someone being hit with a medical condition that their particular sub-menu of choices didn't cover becomes large, thus defeating much of the purpose of "universal" health insurance and—you're not getting any of this, are you? All right, let's just go with "because it's cheaper that way." The premiums I pay go toward insuring other people against testicular cancer, and you don't hear me complaining about that because duh."

All right, I think we've fixed it up plenty. Now to send it off and have it read into the congressional record.
