Performance for December and January was not available.\n\nA group of stocks in Orange\u2019s portfolio, worth about $1.3 billion as of September 30, according to a public filing, declined substantially over 2015.\n\nBellatrix Exploration, a Canadian oil and gas company where Lewis is a director and had pushed for change, saw its stock drop about 60 percent. NorthStar Asset Management Group, a New York-based real estate and investment manager, fell 46 percent. And Amaya Inc., a Canadian entertainment technology company, declined nearly 40 percent.\n\nLewis was not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for Bellatrix declined to comment and InnVest Real Estate Investment Trust, another Canadian company that Lewis is a director of, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOrange, co-founded by Russell Hoffman, its president, had otherwise produced strong returns. Its main fund averaged annual returns of 9.7 percent since inception in mid-2005.
