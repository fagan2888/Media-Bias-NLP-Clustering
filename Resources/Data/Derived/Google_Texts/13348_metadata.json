Behavioral health integration: As providers receive reimbursement for outcomes rather than volume of services and procedures, nonprofits can begin to integrate behavioral health into their services while treating chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease and obesity.\n\n2. Shifting demographics: As the baby boomer generation ages, nonprofits can expect an increase in service demands.\n\n3. Workforce development challenges: Many healthcare professionals are nearing retirement age, which means nonprofits will have to attract and retain a new generation of quality workers. Hospitals will have to entice professionals from a smaller pool of applicants.\n\n4. Fundraising opportunities: Traditional hospital development and construction means money, so hospitals must look to diversify not only their fundraising base, but also their expansion plans in general. Nonprofits can use endowments and fund drives to support charity care and research initiatives to attract high-quality specialists. More than ever before, charitable support will be essential for success.\n\nEarlier this year, FierceHealthcare examined four trends the healthcare industry could expect as a whole throughout 2014, including the evolution of Pioneer accountable care organizations, the impact of ICD-10 transition, hospital CEO turnover and more hospitals becoming insurers.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nYear-in-Preview: 4 trends hospitals should watch in 2014\n\nTop healthcare CEO compensation trends in 2014\n\nPwC survey reveals the tops health industry trends of 2014\n\nReport: ACOs expected to double by end of 2014\n\nMore hospitals interested in launching health plans\n\nHealthcare expereinces the most CEO turnover", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the wake of sweeping healthcare reform and shifting priorities throughout the industry,\u00a0nonprofit hospitals\u00a0can expect to see new trends in 2014,\u00a0according to\u00a0the\u00a0Nonprofit Quarterly.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "In the wake of sweeping healthcare reform and shifting priorities throughout the industry,\u00a0nonprofit hospitals\u00a0can expect to see new trends in 2014,\u00a0according to\u00a0the\u00a0Nonprofit Quarterly.", "title": "4 nonprofit hospital trends to watch this year", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/4-nonprofit-hospital-trends-watch-year/2014-02-10", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Baby Boomer Generation,Care Delivery,Diabetes,Executive Compensation,Healthcare Trends,heart disease,HR & Workforce Management,ICD-10,Nonprofit Hospitals,Obesity,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9efa\"", "article_summary": "He then identified four emerging nonprofit hospital trends for 2014:1.\nIn the wake of sweeping healthcare reform and shifting priorities throughout the industry, nonprofit hospitals can expect to see new trends in 2014, according to Nonprofit Quarterly.\nTo learn more:- here's the articleRelated Articles:Year-in-Preview: 4 trends hospitals should watch in 2014Top healthcare CEO compensation trends in 2014PwC survey reveals the tops health industry trends of 2014Report: ACOs expected to double by end of 2014More hospitals interested in launching health plansHealthcare expereinces the most CEO turnover\nEarlier this year, FierceHealthcare examined four trends the healthcare industry could expect as a whole throughout 2014, including the evolution of Pioneer accountable care organizations, the impact of ICD-10 transition, hospital CEO turnover and more hospitals becoming insurers.\nShifting demographics: As the baby boomer generation ages, nonprofits can expect an increase in service demands."}
