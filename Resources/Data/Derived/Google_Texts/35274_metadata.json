HHS will collect the 2014 fees during 2015.\n\nFor 2015, the fee will fall to $44, or $3.67 per month per covered life. The lower fee reflects the ACA\u2019s requirement that the government raise $10 billion under the program for 2014 and $6 billion for 2015. For 2016, the last year of the temporary program, $4 billion must be raised.\n\nThe law requires insurers to pay the fee on behalf of their fully insured employer clients, but it is widely expected that premium rates will be adjusted to reflect that new cost. Self-insured employers generally will pay the fee directly, although the ACA allows them to designate a \u201ccontributing entity,\u201d which likely will be their third-party administrator.\n\nHHS also proposed an exemption from the 2015 and 2016 fees for employers that have self-insured group health plans and do not use a third-party administrator for claims processing or adjudication, or for processing and communicating plan enrollment information.\n\nThe ACA specified that government revenue from the fees would be allocated to three purposes: a reinsurance fund on behalf of health insurers; a contribution to the U.S. treasury; and a payment for administrative expenses of the program. For 2015, for example, the allocations will be $6 billion to the reinsurance fund, $2 billion to the treasury and $25.4 million for administrative expenses.\n\nThe fees for a particular year will be collected in two installments in the following year. In January of 2015, 2016 and 2017, employers and insurers will pay for the reinsurance fund and the administrative costs. In the fourth quarter of those years, they will pay the contribution to the treasury. Employers are required to submit to the government by Nov. 15 of each benefit year the number of lives covered by their group health plans.\n\nSources of information for this report: HHS, Towers Watson, Coventry Health Care.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obamacare-mandated transitional reinsurance fee (sometimes called a \"tax\"), $63 per life covered under group plans for 2014, will fall to $44 next year.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"New Obamacare Fee to Be Less in 2015: HHS\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2014\\/01\\/new-obamacare-fee-less-2015-hhs\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-07 11:00:33\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-11-04 14:27:01\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":24810,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"ACA\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Fee\",\"HHS\",\"Reinsurance\"],\"categories\":[\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\",\"Regulation\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/12\\/medicare-1.jpg\"}", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "The Obamacare-mandated transitional reinsurance fee (sometimes called a \"tax\"), $63 per life covered under group plans for 2014, will fall to $44 next year.", "title": "New Obamacare Fee to Be Less in 2015: HHS", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2013/12/medicare-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-04T14:27:01+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2014/01/new-obamacare-fee-less-2015-hhs/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "The Obamacare-mandated transitional reinsurance fee (sometimes called a \"tax\"), $63 per life covered under group plans for 2014, will fall to $44 next year.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "New Obamacare Fee to Be Less in 2015: HHS", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "New Obamacare Fee to Be Less in 2015: HHS", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "date": 20140107, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Regulation", "tag": "Transitional Reinsurance Tax", "published_time": "2014-01-07T11:00:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-04T14:27:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "aca, affordable care act, fee, hhs, reinsurance, transitional reinsurance, transitional reinsurance fee, transitional reinsurance program, transitional reinsurance tax"}, "article_summary": "The 'transitional reinsurance' fee, $63 per life covered under group plans for 2014, will fall to $44 next year.\nThe lower fee reflects the ACA\u2019s requirement that the government raise $10 billion under the program for 2014 and $6 billion for 2015.\nFor 2015, the fee will fall to $44, or $3.67 per month per covered life.\nIn January of 2015, 2016 and 2017, employers and insurers will pay for the reinsurance fund and the administrative costs.\nSelf-insured employers generally will pay the fee directly, although the ACA allows them to designate a \u201ccontributing entity,\u201d which likely will be their third-party administrator."}
