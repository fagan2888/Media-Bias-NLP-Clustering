President Barack Obama turns 53 today (August 4), and for someone in his age bracket, he is pretty in-tune with what happens in today's pop culture. Whether he is texting his pal Jay Z, delivering a hilarious speech at the Correspondents' dinner, or joking around with comedienne Ellen Degeneres, he has been a part of some of today's most talked-about moments.

Obviously, it is not easy to be the leader of the free world, but when he isn't addressing the union about the Affordable Health Care Act, job stability or international events, he makes it look pretty cool.

In celebration of America's smoothest president since Bill Clinton, here are "14 of President Obama's Most Epic Pop Culture Moments."

1) When he brushed the "Dirt Off of [His] Shoulder" in 2008.

During his first presidential campaign, he dealt with a lot of hate from Hilary Clinton and other frontrunners. He had the perfect response and hip hop culture immediately fell in love.

2. When he shouted out Young Jeezy at the 2012 White House Correspondent's Dinner.

3. When he appeared on Funny or Die with "Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis." (What should we do about North Ikea? **Dies Laughing**)

4. All of the jokes from the 2014 White House Correspondents' Dinner. ("MSNBC is here. They're a little overwhelmed, they've never seen an audience this big before." **Ohhhh Burn**)

5. Pretty much anytime he's around Jay and Bey.

8. When Jay Z revealed that he has the President's personal number, and texts him during his one-time Twitter Q&A on July 9, 2013 and in his controversial song Open Letter.

B.O.: Hov, song wasn't funny.

Jay: **Jigga Laugh**

Here's what he said in his interview with Hot 97 of chatting with Obama: “Yeah, I’ve spoken to [Obama] on the phone and had texts… Yes, that’s happened and it’s amazing. He’s a regular guy as well. He’s very heavy into sports so a lot of his analogies end in sports… I don’t know if this is reaching National Security, but when he was getting elected the second time, he was like, ‘Fourth quarter, just gimme the ball.’”

9. And this, Obama said in response to all of the Cuba trip drama.

10. His hilarious comeback when Ellen told him that she broke his record for retweets with her Oscar's Super Selfie.
