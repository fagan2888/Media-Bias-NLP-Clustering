And, now, the threat of severe weather Monday night into Tuesday has increased.\n\nThe National Weather Service says all of North Texas is facing an \u201cenhanced\u201d threat of severe weather tomorrow night and especially early Tuesday morning, meaning there\u2019s a 30 percent chance there will be damaging winds, big hail and heavy rain within 25 miles of your location if you\u2019re in the red-shaded area below.\n\nMore tomorrow. For now, enjoy the rain.\n\nOriginal post at 10:41 a.m.: \u201cIt\u2019s cold and dreary.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s this morning\u2019s weather summary from Jamie Gudmestad, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service\u2019s Fort Worth office. It comes as no surprise to anyone who has been outside or has a window.\n\nAnd, for most, that will be today\u2019s forecast: There is but a 33 percent chance of rain for Dallas, as an upper level trough begins its march across the country. There is rain on the radar out west, but, for now, it\u2019s trailing to the northeast as it heads up Interstate 20. If nothing else, it\u2019s a good day to stay in and watch the Cowboys game \u2026 I guess?\n\nBut look to the west \u2014 all the way to California. That\u2019s our next weather-maker, and it\u2019s no small thing. Says Gudmestad, we should begin to feel its effects as early as this evening and Sunday night, as increased moisture from the south commingles with instability associated with yet another upper-level low sparked by a strengthening El Ni\u00f1o that has erased our extreme drought in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cExpect rain tonight, with isolated storms,\u201d says Gudmestad. But accumulation should be light, around a quarter of an inch. Rinse and repeat early Monday morning, with another round of rain due in during the pre-dawn hours. And more to come during the day, as temperatures warm to pre-cold-front highs of springlike lower 70s.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough instability to suggest there\u2019ll be thunder,\u201d she says, no doubt referring to this forgotten gem by The Common People.\n\nBut The Big Show isn\u2019t expected until the wee small hours of Tuesday morning \u2014 around 3-5 a.m., when severe storms are likely with strong winds and heavy rains and the potential for flash flooding, all associated with the trough now in California. The timing remains a bit up in the air; so too its impact. But for now, the NWS puts our chance of rain at 90 percent. We could see more than two inches in some places.\n\nRick Mitchell, meteorologist for our media partners at KXAS-Channel 5, concurs: \u201cOur latest Microcast model shows line of strong/severe storms in DFW at 4 a.m. Tuesday.\u201d\n\nTuesday morning \u201ccould be rough,\u201d says Gudmestad. We\u2019ll get to that tomorrow. Today \u2014 overcast, dreary. Much like the Cowboys\u2019 season so far.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL2Nvb2wtY2xvdWR5LWFuZC1kYW1wLXN1bmRheS1pbi1kYWxsYXMtd2lsbC1saWtlbHktZ2l2ZS13YXktdG8tYS1zdG9ybXktbW9uZGF5Lmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Update at 6:35 p.m.: The rain -- and thunder and lightning -- has moved into Dallas-Fort Worth, and is likely to stick around, on and off, through tomorrow.
