A homeowner was displaced Sunday afternoon after a major fire erupted in his garage.

It happened on Summer Grace Street in northeastern Colorado Springs.

Two men were working on a truck in the garage, they told 11 News they were fixing the fuel pump when a spark flew off.

The garage, now visibly charred, was totally engulfed by flames. Neighbors told us they heard several loud explosions.

Colorado Springs fire crews said the fire was mainly contained to the garage. Unfortunately, there is extensive smoke damage to the inside of the home, forcing the homeowner to stay somewhere else.

Greg Jamison was the only other person inside the garage working on truck with homeowner.

"We were working on the truck trying to get fuel out of it and a spark or a flame or something just really quick popped up before we could even think about it and kind of just got out of there," Jamison said.

Lisa Joffrion lives nearby.

"We've got a lot of military people in the neighborhood so my first thought was ‘Oh my gosh is that a bomb’ you know because the explosions were so loud,” Joffrion said. “It wasn't like it just caught on fire it was a lot of explosions going on, so it was scary."

Jamison and the homeowner were the only two in the home at the time. No injuries were reported.

They were able to rescue a dog from the backyard. Fire crews told us this Memorial Day weekend has been a very busy one for them responding to emergencies.
