Without question, the close alignment of the two parties with groups of voters who do (older white people) and don't (younger and minority people) participate in non-presidential elections has been a big part \u2014 along with the normal backlash against the party controlling the White House \u2014 of the massive Republican gains of 2010 and 2014. The prospect of heightened midterm turnout from under-30 voters alone could be a big and important deal for the Donkey Party.\n\nBut the closer you get to the Sandernistas' Brand New Congress initiative \u2014 the new project by recently laid-off Bernie staffers to create a revolution in Congress beginning with the 2018 elections \u2014 the less it looks like the instrument for a difficult but achievable task and the more it looks like the product of a very strange set of beliefs about American politics. It's not focused on boosting progressive turnout in general elections, but on recruiting and running candidates in Republican as well as Democratic primaries who meet a rigid set of policy litmus tests. The idea is very explicitly that people alive with the Bern can literally elect a \"brand-new Congress\" in one election cycle to turn public policy 180 degrees. Or so says key organizer Zack Exley:\n\n\u201cWe want a supermajority in Congress that is fighting for jobs, criminal justice reform and the environment,\u201d Exley said. \u201cMost Americans actually want that, and I think we get it by running Dems in blue areas, Republicans in deep red areas, and by running independents wherever we didn\u2019t defeat incumbents.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, too?\n\nCorbin Trent, another former Sanders staffer, said bringing Republicans on board is \u201cthe key to it being a successful idea\u201d and there\u2019s enough overlap between Sanders\u2019 platform and tea party conservatives to make the PAC\u2019s goals feasible. Reality television star Donald Trump\u2019s current status as the Republican front-runner demonstrates that GOP voters are eager for candidates who, like Trump, criticize the corrupting influence of money in politics and the impact of free trade deals on American workers, Trent said. \u201cThis will allow Republicans to say \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m a Republican, but I believe climate change is real and I don\u2019t believe all Muslims are terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will allow people to think differently in the Republican Party if they want to pull away from the hate-based ideology.\u201d\n\nYes, that was what I feared: The discredited notion that lefties and the tea party can make common cause in something other than hating on the Clintons and Barack Obama is back with a vengeance. And worse yet, Donald Trump \u2014 Donald Trump \u2014 is being touted as an example of a Republican capable of progressive impulses because he shares the old right-wing mercantilist hostility to free trade and has enough money to scorn lobbyists. Does your average Trump supporter really \"believe climate change is real\" and disbelieve that \"all Muslims are terrorists\"? Do Obamacare-hating tea-partiers secretly favor single-payer health care? Do the people in tricorn hats who favor elimination of labor unions deep down want a national $15-an-hour minimum wage? And do the very activists who brought the Citizens United case and think it's central to the preservation of the First Amendment actually want to overturn it?\n\nIt's this last delusion that's the most remarkable. If there is any one belief held most vociferously by tea-party activists, it's that anything vaguely approaching campaign-finance reform is a socialist, perhaps even a satanic, conspiracy. These are the people who don't think donors to their political activities should be disclosed because Lois Lerner will use that information to launch income-tax audits and persecute Christians. The tea folk are much closer to the Koch brothers in their basic attitudes toward politics than they are to conventional Republicans.\n\nBut there persists a sort of \"tea envy\" in progressive circles. Here's Salon staff writer Sean Illing in a piece celebrating Brand New Congress:\n\nReal change in this country will require a sustained national mobilization, what I\u2019ve called a counter-Tea Party movement. While their agenda was nihilistic and obstructionist, the Tea Party was a massive success by any measure. And they succeeded because they systematically altered the Congressional landscape.\n\nWell, you could say that, or you could say the tea party's excesses cost Republicans control of the Senate in 2012, and produced an environment that's made Donald Trump and Ted Cruz the GOP's only two options for this year's presidential nomination. Indeed, you can probably thank the tea party for the likelihood of a very good Democratic general election this November.\n\nBut that will again produce excellent conditions for another Republican-dominated midterm in 2018. It sure would make sense for progressives to focus on how to minimize the damage in the next midterm and begin to change adverse long-term turnout patterns. Expending time, money, and energy on scouring the earth looking for Republican primary candidates willing to run on a democratic-socialist agenda will not be helpful.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "The notion that there's some bipartisan supermajority out there waiting to be mobilized to enact Bernie Sanders's agenda is, in a word, delusional.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "The notion that there's some bipartisan supermajority out there waiting to be mobilized to enact Bernie Sanders's agenda is, in a word, delusional.", "title": "The Bernie Camp\u2019s Really Bad Idea of a \u2018Tea Party of the Left\u2019", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/04/really-bad-idea-of-a-tea-party-of-the-left.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/04/29/29-bernie-sanders-supporters.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The notion that there's some bipartisan supermajority out there waiting to be mobilized to enact Bernie Sanders's agenda is, in a word, delusional.", "creator": "@ed_kilgore", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/04/29/29-bernie-sanders-supporters.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "The Really Bad Idea of a \u2018Tea Party of the Left\u2019", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "politics, bernie sanders, tea party", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "politics,bernie sanders,tea party", "published_time": "2016-04-29T15:51:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, politics, bernie sanders, tea party", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "Indeed, you can probably thank the tea party for the likelihood of a very good Democratic general election this November.\nWhile their agenda was nihilistic and obstructionist, the Tea Party was a massive success by any measure.\nAnd worse yet, Donald Trump \u2014 Donald Trump \u2014 is being touted as an example of a Republican capable of progressive impulses because he shares the old right-wing mercantilist hostility to free trade and has enough money to scorn lobbyists.\nCorbin Trent, another former Sanders staffer, said bringing Republicans on board is \u201cthe key to it being a successful idea\u201d and there\u2019s enough overlap between Sanders\u2019 platform and tea party conservatives to make the PAC\u2019s goals feasible.\nThe prospect of heightened midterm turnout from under-30 voters alone could be a big and important deal for the Donkey Party."}
