Weyer Jr. once noted, \u201cis like a corridor into which we can see only by the light coming from behind.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, that didn\u2019t stop pundits and politicians from making bold calls based on little other than guesswork and a willingness to be wrong. As Daniel Kahnemann, the Nobel laureate, explained the game, \u201cYou can make predictions, and a year later people won't remember them.\u201d But Google never forgets, and neither do we at Politico Magazine. In the words of one economic forecaster: \u201cHe who lives by the crystal ball soon learns to eat ground glass.\u201d Herewith, the year\u2019s biggest prophecies gone awry.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n***\n\nThe Obamacare Rollout Will be Great\n\nSlate writer Matt Yglesias: \u201cI wanted to once again take the opportunity to lay down a marker and say once again that Obamacare implementation is going to be a huge political success.\u201d And here: \u201c\u2026conservatives are certainly fooling themselves if they\u2019re expecting a backlash driven by problems around implementation. \u2026 Snafus will be real enough, but broadly speaking, the rollout is going to be a huge success.\u201d Slate.com, July 17\n\nMSNBC host Ed Schultz: \u201cIf you go to this Web site, you will find out how easy it is to read, how easy it is to navigate all the information, all the basic questions, and all the direction you need to take to get involved, to get health care.\u201d MSNBC, Sept. 30\n\nPresident Barack Obama: \u201cIf you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. (Applause.) If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period.\u201d Chicago address, June 15, 2009\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi: \u201c[E]verybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\u201d Meet the Press, July 1, 2012\n\nThe roster of mistaken predictions about the Oct. 1 launch of HealthCare.gov, the federal website where Americans can shop for health care plans, would fill an error log that would make Kathleen Sebelius blush. Suffice it to say that the implementation of Obama\u2019s signature health law was a universally acknowledged fiasco that has taken the president\u2019s approval numbers to new lows. His credibility also took a major hit as insurance companies notified hundreds of thousands of Americans that their plans would be canceled to meet the health law\u2019s requirements, forcing Obama to apologize on Thursday, Nov. 14: \u201cThere is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate. It was not because of my intention not to deliver on that commitment and that promise.\u201d\n\nSyria\u2019s Assad Will Fall\n\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove: \u201cSyria's Bashar Assad will be forced from power, but Mr. Obama's failure to provide active, sustained U.S. leadership will result in a new Islamist regime in Damascus friendly with Iran.\u201d Wall Street Journal, Jan. 2, 2012\n\nRove is hardly the only pundit to get this call wrong\u2014many inside the Obama administration thought the Assad regime would collapse, prompting the president to declare in August 2011: \u201cFor the sake of the Syrian people, the time has come for President Assad to step aside.\u201d But Rove\u2019s geopolitical analysis here is questionable, too\u2014Syria\u2019s Islamist rebels despise Tehran, which is backing the Syrian regime to the hilt. Either way, Assad doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere. (Rove also missed the mark on unemployment, which he said would remain \u201caround 8%.\u201d It\u2019s now down to 7 percent.)\n\nWashington\u2019s Partisan Gridlock Is Coming to an End\n\nPresident Barack Obama: \u201cI believe that if we're successful in this election, when we're successful in this election, that the fever may break, because there's a tradition in the Republican Party of more common sense than that. My hope, my expectation, is that after the election, now that it turns out that the goal of beating Obama doesn't make much sense because I'm not running again, that we can start getting some cooperation again.\u201d Minneapolis speech, June 1, 2012\n\nMonths before his re-election, in June 2012, a self-assured President Obama predicted that Republicans would prove more congenial in his second term. In many ways, it was the signal mistake of his fifth year\u2014a na\u00efve expectation (his word) that informed the White House\u2019s strategies on immigration, taxes and the budget. An anonymous aide then repeated the line to Mark Leibovich of the New York Times: \u201cOur winning will teach them a lesson. It will make them look at themselves and realize that their positions are untenable. It will, finally, break the fever.\u201d In October 2012, Obama even said he was \u201c absolutely confident\u201d he could reach a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with the GOP on the country\u2019s biggest fiscal questions. Instead, Republicans and Democrats were throwing down over the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d even before his second inauguration, heralding a rocky 2013 marked by unprecedented gridlock and partisan rancor.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "The worst predictions of 2013.", "title": "Crystal Balderdash", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/12/worst-predictions-2013-crystal-balderdash-101360.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/12/19/131219_hounshell_crystal_istock.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Predictions (4),Politics (173),The Friday Cover (3),2013 (13)", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "The worst predictions of 2013.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In the words of one economic forecaster: \u201cHe who lives by the crystal ball soon learns to eat ground glass.\u201d Herewith, the year\u2019s biggest prophecies gone awry.\nEither way, Assad doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere.\n(Rove also missed the mark on unemployment, which he said would remain \u201caround 8%.\u201d It\u2019s now down to 7 percent.)\nIf you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period.\u201d Chicago address, June 15, 2009House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi: \u201c[E]verybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\u201d Meet the Press, July 1, 2012The roster of mistaken predictions about the Oct. 1 launch of HealthCare.gov, the federal website where Americans can shop for health care plans, would fill an error log that would make Kathleen Sebelius blush.\nAn anonymous aide then repeated the line to Mark Leibovich of the New York Times: \u201cOur winning will teach them a lesson."}
