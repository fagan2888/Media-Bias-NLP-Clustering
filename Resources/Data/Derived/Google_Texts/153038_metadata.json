While society has perpetuated the idea a tan gives people a \u201chealthy glow,\u201d in reality tanning is the skin trying to protect itself from sun damage. Premature aging, eye damage, and skin cancer are not only risk factors associated with sunbathing, but also indoor tanning. However, Blake Goldston, business owner of tanning salon Neon Sun in Texas claims tanning beds and sun lamps can help with skin cancer prevention, and other diseases, manipulating claims from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThere is no research that exists that shows a causal relationship between indoor tanning and increased incidents of skin cancer and melanoma,\u201d Goldston told KVII-TV, an ABC affiliate station in Amarillo. Goldston claims several reports from the CDC back his claim showing there is no direct correlation between tanning beds and skin cancer. The tanning salon owner also remarks current studies don\u2019t actually show enough evidence, and the number of skin cancer cases are actually decreasing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that in the U.S., the incidence of melanoma has been on the decline and I quote from the American Cancer Society is significantly less than two-tenths of one percent, and to the people who tan indoor is exactly the same. There's just no evidence showing anything different,\" Goldston said.\n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum, U.S. Surgeon General Boris D. Lushniak, has for the first time shed some light primarily on skin cancer in his report, urging ordinary Americans to take long-recommended preventive steps such as wearing sunscreen and seeking shade when outdoors. Lushniak\u2019s \u201cCall to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer,\u201d presents the following five strategic goals to support skin cancer prevention in the U.S.: increase opportunities for sun protection in outdoor settings; provide individuals with the information they need to make informed, healthy choices about ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure; promote policies that advance the national goal of preventing skin cancer; reduce harms from indoor tanning; and strengthen research, surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation related to skin cancer prevention.\n\nThe surgeon general\u2019s warning comes after a spike in the cases of deadly melanoma. The report cites a 200 percent jump in deadly melanoma cases since 1973, emphasizing a continuously growing generation of tanners. This sun worshiping has led to $8 billion spent to treat all forms of skin cancer each year. \"We need more states and institutions on board with these policies that discourage or restrict indoor tanning by our youth,\" Lushniak said. \"Tanned skin is damaged skin.\"\n\nDespite the concrete evidence, and warnings from the surgeon general, Goldston and other tanning salon owners like Lisa Ferguson, who owns Baja Tan in Ohio, don\u2019t agree with the recommendations and believes her salon is a \u201csafe environment\u201d for kids to tan. \u201cIf kids tan outside it\u2019s not controlled, so that\u2019s where I think our safety inside tanning salons is a lot safer,\u201d Ferguson told WHIO. Approximately five years ago, Ferguson was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma after she noticed a bump on her chest. She got it removed by her doctor and continues to do indoor tanning. \u201cI\u2019ve been tanning and the cancer doesn\u2019t come from in here, it comes from outside,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nA ban on indoor tanning by youth could help prevent skin cancer rates from increasing, cutting down on a potentially deadly habit. The social norm in regard to tanning needs to change, along with the myth that tanned skin is a sign of youth and health. To prevent falling victim into tanning myths circulated by salon owners, and the media, here are three common myths dispeled:\n\n1. Indoor tanning doesn\u2019t cause melanoma.\n\nFalse: Researchers have found the link between ultraviolet exposure from the sun or tanning beds and melanoma is evident. A 2007 study published in the International Journal of Cancer reviewed 19 studies on the association of tanning beds and skin cancers found usage before age 35 boosts melanoma risk by 75 percent.\n\n2. Base tan protects your skin.\n\nFalse: A base tan may give you some protection, but the real problem is that a change in skin color is actually the body\u2019s natural reaction to ultraviolet (UV) rays. It\u2019s visible proof that the skin is damaged. Continuous exposure to these UV rays will increase the risk of premature aging and skin cancer.\n\n3. You need sunlight to get enough vitamin D.\n\nWhile tanners may use this as their defense, people can get adequate levels of vitamin D from supplements, or foods fortified with vitamin D such as milk. Exposing the skin to about two to 10 minutes a day without sunscreen is adequate to produce enough vitamin D, but it\u2019s not necessary to get all your intake from UV radiation.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tan, indoor tanning, tanning beds, tanning salon, sunbathing, skin cancer, melanoma", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Neon Sun, a Texas tanning salon, claims its tanning beds prevent skin cancer and cut mortality risk by half for customers.", "title": "Tanning Salon Falsely Advertises Tanning Beds For Skin Cancer Prevention [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/texas-tanning-salon-claims-tanning-beds-prevent-skin-cancer-3-sunbathing-myths-296620", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/05/tanning-salon-claims-tanning-beds-help-skin-cancer-prevention.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Neon Sun, a Texas tanning salon, claims its tanning beds prevent skin cancer and cut mortality risk by half for customers.", "title": "Tanning Salon Falsely Advertises Tanning Beds For Skin Cancer Prevention [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/texas-tanning-salon-claims-tanning-beds-prevent-skin-cancer-3-sunbathing-myths-296620", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/05/tanning-salon-claims-tanning-beds-help-skin-cancer-prevention.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/05/tanning-salon-claims-tanning-beds-help-skin-cancer-prevention.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-05T14:45:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-04T15:35:36-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Neon Sun, a Texas tanning salon, claims its tanning beds prevent skin cancer and cut mortality risk by half for customers."}, "article_summary": "Goldston claims several reports from the CDC back his claim showing there is no direct correlation between tanning beds and skin cancer.\nPremature aging, eye damage, and skin cancer are not only risk factors associated with sunbathing, but also indoor tanning.\nThe tanning salon owner also remarks current studies don\u2019t actually show enough evidence, and the number of skin cancer cases are actually decreasing.\nA ban on indoor tanning by youth could help prevent skin cancer rates from increasing, cutting down on a potentially deadly habit.\nHowever, Blake Goldston, business owner of tanning salon Neon Sun in Texas claims tanning beds and sun lamps can help with skin cancer prevention, and other diseases, manipulating claims from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."}
