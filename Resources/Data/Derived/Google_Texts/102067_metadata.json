Chrissy discovered a lump on her chest in October, and was diagnosed with secretory carcinoma, an extremely rare form of the disease \u2014 and one that is more likely to be found in older women. At only 8 years old, Chrissy and her parents were devastated to find out it was cancer.\n\n\u201cI was scared to figure out what it was,\u201d Chrissy told ABC TV. \u201cBut I knew I could fight it off and I hope that I can fight it off.\u201d\n\nBoth of Chrissy\u2019s parents \u2014 Annette and Troy Turner \u2014 have battled cancer themselves. Annette Turner had cervical cancer, while Troy is currently battling Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma. He was first diagnosed when Chrissy was an infant and had relied on her energy and charm to get him through his first rounds of chemotherapy.\n\n\u201cShe was our therapy when he was going through chemotherapy,\u201d Annette told The Guardian. \u201cShe was always making us laugh and she\u2019s got the wit of someone far beyond her age.\u201d\n\nChrissy Turner waiting for treatment at a hospital.

Facebook / Chrissy's Alliance\n\nNow, Chrissy will be undergoing a mastectomy in December to remove the cancerous breast tissue, as it\u2019s too dangerous for a child her age to receive radiation. Fortunately, Chrissy\u2019s doctor, Brian Bucher, believes she\u2019ll recover as her type of cancer is \u201cvery treatable.\u201d\n\n\u201cChrissy will need to undergo a simple mastectomy to remove all of her remaining breast tissue, to prevent this cancer from coming back,\u201d Bucher told The Guardian.\n\nAnnette\u2019s best friend, Melissa Papaj, has started a GoFundMe page to raise money for Chrissy\u2019s treatment, and is also sharing news of her progress on her Facebook page, Chrissy\u2019s Alliance.\n\nOn her GoFundMe page, Papaj writes that Chrissy\u2019s cancer is \u201ca cancer that no specialist across the country has even seen in a child so young. In fact, 1 in 1,000,000 adults are diagnosed with this cancer and maybe only 15 cases to compare it to. Her case is being presented nationally and is being reviewed by top oncologists in the country along with being taken to the Utah state tumor board next week\u2026 Chrissy is in for the biggest fight of her life and the Turner Family needs all the help they can get.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to fight this as a family,\u201d Annette told The Guardian. \u201cWe are going to be there for Chrissy, no matter what.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "youngest, person, be, diagnosed, breast, cancer, 8, year, old, chrissy, turner, heres, her, story", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Chrissy Turner was diagnosed with a rare form of breast cancer at the young age of 8.", "title": "The Youngest Breast Cancer Patient Ever Is An 8-Year-Old Utah Girl", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/youngest-person-be-diagnosed-breast-cancer-8-year-old-chrissy-turner-heres-her-story-362990", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/25/chrissy-turner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chrissy Turner was diagnosed with a rare form of breast cancer at the young age of 8.", "title": "The Youngest Breast Cancer Patient Ever Is An 8-Year-Old Utah Girl", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/youngest-person-be-diagnosed-breast-cancer-8-year-old-chrissy-turner-heres-her-story-362990", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/25/chrissy-turner.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/25/chrissy-turner.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-11-25T12:43:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-25T12:43:53-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Chrissy Turner was diagnosed with a rare form of breast cancer at the young age of 8."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0416\"", "article_summary": "One of the youngest patients ever diagnosed with breast cancer, however, is 8-year-old Chrissy Turner, a girl living in Utah.\nBut breast cancer mainly affects adult women, and it\u2019s extremely rare for a young girl to be diagnosed with breast cancer.\nOn her GoFundMe page, Papaj writes that Chrissy\u2019s cancer is \u201ca cancer that no specialist across the country has even seen in a child so young.\nBreast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women outside of skin cancer, with diagnosis rates as high as one in eight women (about 12 percent of women) in the U.S.\n\u201cI was scared to figure out what it was,\u201d Chrissy told ABC TV."}
