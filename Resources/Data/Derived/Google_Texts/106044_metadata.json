The looming prospect of tighter monetary policy could, in theory, have been expected to rattle markets, as it did in mid-2013 when investors had a \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d once confronted with the impending winding down of the Fed\u2019s \u201cquantitative easing\u201d bond-buying stimulus.\n\nThis time, though, stocks surged when the Fed released its statement at 2 p.m. and kept climbing as Janet Yellen explained the Fed\u2019s outlook during her afternoon press conference. The S&P 500 finished the day up 25 points, or 1.2 percent. Treasuries rallied as well, driving the yield on the benchmark 10-year note from 2.036 percent to below 2 percent.\n\n^SPX data by YCharts\n\nWhat gives?\n\nThe answer lies in the details of the Fed\u2019s cautious statement and updated outlook. While the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee dropped its promise to remain \u201cpatient\u201d as it considers when to start raising interest rates for the first time in years, Yellen told reporters that change \u201cdoes not mean we are going to be impatient\u201d in deciding when to take action.\n\nRelated: Will Fed Rate Hikes Cost You in Higher Taxes?\u200b\u200b\n\n\u201cThe FOMC remains clearly focused on hedging downside risk,\u201d Diane Swonk of Mesirow Financial wrote in a blog post, adding that \u201cmembers would rather wait and raise rates too slowly than risk stamping out growth and having to reverse course and lower rates soon after the first increase. They also want to make sure the recovery is truly self-sustaining before removing the proverbial punch bowl.\u201d\n\nThe FOMC\u2019s policy statement was revised to say that the committee would raise rates \u201cwhen it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.\u201d And Yellen emphasized, as usual, that the timing of a decision to raise rates would depend on economic data.\n\nIn another important way, from a market perspective, the Fed actually signaled that it would be even more patient than before: The Fed\u2019s board members and bank presidents lowered their overall forecasts for how high rates would be by the end of the year and over the next three years \u2014 suggesting that even if central bankers do raise rates in June, or perhaps more likely in September, the process of normalizing interest rates will be more gradual than they had signaled before.\n\nRelated: Why the \u2018Smart Money\u2019 Is Bailing Out of the Bull Market\u200b\n\nThe median projected interest rate for the end of 2015 is now 0.625 percent, down from 1.125 percent as of December. The median for 2016 is now 1.875 percent, down from 2.5 percent three months ago. And the median for 2017 is now 3.125 percent, down from 3.63 percent.\n\n\u201cOfficials are still suggesting more tightening than markets are pricing in, but the differential has dropped, along with the estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate -- those changes were more dovish than expected,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.\n\nThose projections reflect the Fed\u2019s newly downgraded forecasts for economic growth this year and trimmed its inflation expectations while also lowering its estimate of how far the unemployment rate can fall without creating additional inflation pressure.\n\nRelated: America Is In Deflation. So What?\u200b\n\n\u201cThis is a defensive Fed,\u201d Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote to clients. \u201cThey've made the minimum change expected, but then backpedalled furiously, as if to say, 'We've done it, but we didn't really mean it, and we're now very keen to avoid giving the impression that we might take the next step soon.'\"\n\nThat, apparently, was more than enough to prevent any sort of \u201ctightening tantrum\u201d for now.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the Obama administration is upset at the \u201cdivisive rhetoric\u201d that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used toward Israel\u2019s Arab citizens during the final days of the campaign that saw his Likud Party gain 28 seats in the Israeli parliament.", "title": "Yellen Really Doesn\u2019t Want to Take Away the Punch Bowl", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/18/Yellen-Really-Doesn-t-Want-Take-Away-Punch-Bowl", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Janet%20Yellen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/18/Yellen-Really-Doesn-t-Want-Take-Away-Punch-Bowl", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Janet%20Yellen.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the Obama administration is upset at the \u201cdivisive rhetoric\u201d that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used toward Israel\u2019s Arab citizens during the final days of the campaign that saw his Likud Party gain 28 seats in the Israeli parliament.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b35\"", "article_summary": "The Federal Reserve, as widely expected, indicated Wednesday that it might raise interest rates as soon as June.\nThis time, though, stocks surged when the Fed released its statement at 2 p.m. and kept climbing as Janet Yellen explained the Fed\u2019s outlook during her afternoon press conference.\nRelated: Why the \u2018Smart Money\u2019 Is Bailing Out of the Bull Market\u200bThe median projected interest rate for the end of 2015 is now 0.625 percent, down from 1.125 percent as of December.\nThe answer lies in the details of the Fed\u2019s cautious statement and updated outlook.\nTreasuries rallied as well, driving the yield on the benchmark 10-year note from 2.036 percent to below 2 percent."}
