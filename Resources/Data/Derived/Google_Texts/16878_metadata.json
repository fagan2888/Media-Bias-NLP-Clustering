From some 6.2 million medical plans cancelled last year to doctors whom patients liked but no longer can keep, Obamacare turned out to be a $2.6 trillion lie. This humongous new entitlement\u2019s affordability was supposed to be among its chief benefits. However, as Jed Graham of Investor\u2019s Business Daily recently showed, health premiums are zooming skyward in most parts of the country.\n\nIDB analyzed the costs for Obamacare\u2019s cheapest \u201cbronze\u201d plans in 16 cities across America. A 40-year-old non-smoker earning $26,260 (225 percent of the poverty line) would see bronze-plan expenses increase in 12 of these 16 cities. Premiums would drop 30 percent in Hartford, Connecticut, and 6 percent in Portland, Maine. However, they would jump 38 percent in Providence, Rhode Island, and a stunning 64 percent in Seattle, Washington. Colorado voters might focus on the 26 percent increase that such 40-year-olds will have to shell out in Denver.\n\nAll told, Obamacare\u2019s bronze-plan premiums for people in these cities and this demographic will grow by 13.9 percent, on average. And this figure includes the program\u2019s government subsidies.\n\nSo, despite its gargantuan expense and inconvenience, Obama\u2019s giant redistribution machine costs real people real money. Despite Democrats\u2019 magical thinking, it appears that one cannot get something for nothing, after all.\n\nThird, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee launched ads in late October attacking Republican Senate challengers for allegedly threatening Medicare.\n\n\u201cWhen Scott Brown represented Massachusetts, he voted to cut Medicare,\u201d declares the announcer in one spot against the man challenging incumbent Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.).\n\n\u201cYou work hard earning your Medicare,\u201d states another ad, as a graphic says that \u201cCotton Voted to Cut Medicare.\u201d This commercial is designed to help Senator Mark Pryor (D., Ark.) pick off Republican Representative Tom Cotton.\n\nAnd Senator Mark Udall (D., Colo.) hopes to bury GOP Representative Cory Gardner with an ad that asks, \u201cWhy would Cory Gardner vote to cut education and essentially end Medicare?\u201d\n\nThe DSCC\u2019s chutzpah has drained America\u2019s known reserves of guttural fricative.\n\nShaheen, Pryor, Udall, and the other Democrats \u2014 and zero Republicans \u2014 who enacted Obamacare are 1,000 percent guilty of cutting Medicare. And not by a little. As this Heritage Foundation graph proves, Democrats chopped $716 billion from Medicare between 2013 and 2022 in order to finance Obamacare. This includes $17 billion sliced out of hospice services for elderly Americans on the verge of death. Democrats carved another $66 billion from home-health services. Democrats gouged $260 billion out of hospital services.\n\nThe DSCC has no right to moan about Republican votes on Medicare when Democrats hacked nearly three-quarters of a trillion dollars from Medicare to underwrite Obamacare.\n\nShame on them!\n\nIf all of this fills you with disappointment about Obama, you are not alone.\n\nAfter Obama\u2019s nearly flawless 2008 presidential campaign, many Americans who voted against him thought that, at least, he would run a smooth, professional, and well-oiled government. While we might oppose Obama\u2019s policies, surely their execution would be ably managed.\n\nWrong!\n\nFrom the Beer Summit to Fast and Furious, Benghazi, the IRS political abuse of conservatives, HealthCare.gov, the VA-hospitals meltdown, the Bergdahl/Guantanamo-detainee swap, rule by decree, ISIS, Ebola, a top adviser calling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cchickens***,\u201d and much more, the Obama years have featured one embarrassment, after another fiasco, after another scandal, after another broadside against the Constitution.

Obama basked in 70 percent job approval as he entered office.
