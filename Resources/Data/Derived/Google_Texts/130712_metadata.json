The climate is just changing but not that much. If sea levels are rising, maybe insurance companies should stop providing policies to people in Miami Beach. Australia, he says, does health care better than the disaster that is this country\u2019s Affordable Care Act. And maybe wealthy people like him should not collect Social Security.\n\nFarrell is a colorful, smart and very conservative scientist and businessman, and he sat down with me for an interview that sometimes seemed more like an argument that I enjoyed.\n\nFarrell founded the San Diego-based company ResMed, which manufactures the apparatuses that have helped millions with sleep disorders and sleep apnea. He told me why he\u2019s so passionate about free trade and why he preferred to make his product in Singapore rather than in this country. And he also explained how hard it was to turn ResMed over to his son, who is the current CEO.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to hear what happened when he confronted Mayor Kevin Faulconer about his Climate Action Plan. Faulconer listened politely but Farrell says Faulconer\u2019s wife agreed with him that the mayor\u2019s plan to cut carbon emissions was a futile effort. \u201cThere\u2019s no impact at all of CO2 on the climate, end of story,\u201d Farrell recounts Faulconer\u2019s wife, Katherine, as telling her husband.\n\nSupport Nonprofit Journalism Today", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The San Diego businessman and influential conservative sat down for a special podcast interview.
