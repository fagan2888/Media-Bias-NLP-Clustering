Almost 9 in 10 respondents said Obamacare would be \"important\" in determining their vote, and 60 percent said debate on the health care law should not be over.\n\nPolitico polled likely voters from competitive House districts across the country, and found that respondents preferred Republican candidates over Democratic candidates 41 percent to 34 percent.\n\nWhile voters still care about progressive issues \u2014 71 percent want to see sweeping immigration reform and 79 percent want tougher measures on gun purchases \u2014 Obamacare remains the deciding issue in voters' minds. This is good for Republicans, who have spent a lot of time railing against the ACA and not a lot of time figuring out how to pass immigration reform. Politico's Alexander Burns explains,\n\nThe poll reveals that voters \u2014 even in the more conservative midterm states like Georgia and Arkansas, and tossup House districts in states such as Illinois, West Virginia and California \u2014 still lean in a liberal direction on several issues ... But none of those issues comes close to approaching health care as a major concern for midterm voters. By comparison, only 28 percent said that immigration reform was 'very important' to determining their vote, and 16 percent who said the same of male-female income disparity.\n\nDemocrats have continuously championed equal pay for women and immigration reform over the past year, but those issues just don't resonate with voters the way \"death panels\" do. Ed Morrisey at the conservative blog Hot Air is already celebrating: \"Even if one takes this with a small grain of salt based on the composition of the sample, it\u2019s bad news almost all the way around for Democrats. ... Democrats appear to be rolling into disaster, and the only real debate is its scope.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a not-totally-surprising Politico poll\u00a0released Monday morning, the numbers show \"mounting danger\" for Democrats as we get closer to November's midterm elections.", "title": "News, opinion and aggregation on business, politics, entertainment, technology, global and national \u2013 The Wire", "og": {"site_name": "The Wire", "description": "In a not-totally-surprising Politico poll\u00a0released Monday morning, the numbers show \"mounting danger\" for Democrats as we get closer to November's midterm elections.", "title": "Voters Hate Obamacare More Than They Want Immigration Reform", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/05/19/AP697037944668-1/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/05/voters-hate-obamacare-more-than-they-want-immigration-reform/371144/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a not-totally-surprising Politico poll\u00a0released Monday morning, the numbers show \"mounting danger\" for Democrats as we get closer to November&#39;s midterm elections.", "title": "Voters Hate Obamacare More Than They Want Immigration Reform", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/05/19/AP697037944668-1/lead_large.jpg", "creator": "@allierileyjones", "site": "@thewire", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "app_id": 192759427473466}, "keywords": "The Wire, TheWire.com, TheWire.com, news, opinion, aggregation, business, politics, entertainment, technology, global, national", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlanticWire"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0789\"", "article_summary": "While voters still care about progressive issues \u2014 71 percent want to see sweeping immigration reform and 79 percent want tougher measures on gun purchases \u2014 Obamacare remains the deciding issue in voters' minds.\nThis is good for Republicans, who have spent a lot of time railing against the ACA and not a lot of time figuring out how to pass immigration reform.\nDemocrats have continuously championed equal pay for women and immigration reform over the past year, but those issues just don't resonate with voters the way \"death panels\" do.\nBy comparison, only 28 percent said that immigration reform was 'very important' to determining their vote, and 16 percent who said the same of male-female income disparity.\nBut none of those issues comes close to approaching health care as a major concern for midterm voters."}
