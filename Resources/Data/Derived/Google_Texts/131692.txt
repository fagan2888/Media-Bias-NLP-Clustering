Neil deGrasse Tyson isn’t just championing science education, and climate change action, he’s also focusing on creativity and innovation. Earlier this week he spoke at the Cannes Lions festival, as part of the Ogilvy & Mather Inspire lecture series. There he had a strong message: If our trends, culture and value move away from innovation we stop solving some of the world’s biggest problems.

Ad Week reports from Cannes:

“Instead of showing slides of star maps or X-ray images of distant galaxies, Tyson chose to feature pictures of money in his appearance at the festival’s fourth annual Ogilvy & Mather Inspire lecture. He presented slide after slide of international currency that featured and honored scientists as cultural icons. Today, few such bills can be found, and Tyson fears the world is losing its admiration for science. “‘Somebody cared enough about it to put it on the currency. These are the things that affect your culture. A whole culture can be given to problem solving simply by the forces operating within it and around it, forces you might not even be aware of while you’re in the middle of it.'”

A historic example of this, according to Tyson, is the Islamic world at around 1000 A.D., which was at the time a petri dish of intellectual thought and discovery.

“Mathematics, agriculture, engineering, medicine, navigation — all of that happened while Europe was disemboweling heretics at the same time,” Tyson explained. “So what happened? Well, it wasn’t forever.”

According to Tyson, Al-Ghazali, an influential philosopher in the early 11th century, had a different thought: “manipulating numbers was outside your spiritual accountability,” Ad Week reports.

“If you’re content with everything you see as being the will of a divine force, you have been removed from the equation of all those whose curiosity leads to solutions to problems,” Tyson said.
