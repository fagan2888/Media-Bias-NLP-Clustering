But that\u2019s exactly what governments proffer all the time.\n\nThey pass a government-expanding law \u2013 which warps, distorts and otherwise damages the private marketplace. They don\u2019t offer to repeal the law \u2013 of course not. They instead pass another government-expanding law \u2013 to \u201cfix\u201d the mess they made with the last one. Lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nJust wait \u2013 soon the Democrats will propose as the \u201csolution\u201d to the disastrous ObamaCare\u2026all-government-all- the-time single payer.\n\nBut we already had Huge Government health care \u2013 Medicare and Medicaid. Which face tens of trillions of dollars in looming shortfalls. Did the Left proffer less government reform? Of course not. They gave us government-expanding ObamaCare \u2013 and stole (at least) $741 billion from already-broke Medicare to do it.\n\nYou know why the federal government is the only entity delivering First Class Postage?\n\nThe Postal Service has a legal government monopoly on delivering first-class mail\u2026. (Prospective competitors) are required by law to charge a high minimum price and cannot undercut USPS rates.\n\nNothing like the government gaming the system \u2013 to favor the government. And how\u2019s their monopoly working?\n\nPostal Service Loss Of $15.9 Billion Sets Record\n\nAnd guess who\u2019s screwing up cable and Internet delivery? Why, it\u2019s government.\n\nDon\u2019t Blame Big Cable. It\u2019s Local Governments That Choke Broadband Competition\n\nGame of Kickbacks\n\nLocal governments and their public utilities charge ISPs far more (for building rights) than these things actually cost. For example, rights of way and pole attachments fees can double the cost of network construction\u2026.\n\nThese (government) incumbents \u2013 the real monopolists \u2013 also have the final say on whether an ISP can build a network. They determine what hoops an ISP must jump through to get approval.\n\nThis reduces the number of potential competitors who can profitably deploy service.\u2026 The lack of competition makes it easier for local governments and utilities to charge more for rights of way and pole attachments.\n\nIt\u2019s a vicious circle\u2026(A) system of forced kickbacks\u2026.(also) includ(ing) ISPs\u2026building out service where it isn\u2019t demanded, donating equipment, and delivering free broadband to government buildings.\n\nHow bad does it get?\n\nVideo franchises are the revenue-sharing agreements that cable TV companies sign with local governments in return for the exclusive right to offer video services to customers.\n\nGet that? It\u2019s the government creating the monopolies \u2013 not the (very un-free) market. The answer? Less government.\n\nVideo Franchise Reform Would Support Competition and Consumer Choice\n\nBecause (private providers) were able to go directly to the state capital for permission to deploy video services anywhere in the state, they were able to accelerate their rollout. Consumers saw quick results.\n\nAmazing what happens when you can bypass all the local governments and their myriad shakedowns.\n\nThe Left\u2019s response? More government. They want local government broadband \u2013 ObamaCare for the Internet.\n\nThe Promise of Municipal Broadband\n\nMunicipal Broadband Networks Bridge the Digital Divide\n\nTo Help Connect the Two New Yorks, Bill de Blasio Should Build More Community Broadband\n\nMunicipal Broadband Would Provide the Competition Necessary to Make Seattle\u2019s Broadband Market Function\n\nGovernment mandates create private monopolies \u2013 government then decries the dearth of competition as justification for government broadband.\n\nGovernment taxes private broadband companies \u2013 and then uses their money to fund competitors to their businesses.\n\nAnd imagine these private companies trying to set up service \u2013 having to ask the permission of the governments that are competing with them.\n\nThe people wanting this nonsense are the same ones demanding Network Neutrality imposition to prevent Comcast-NBC from slowing Netflix so as to favor their video service. Which has never happened \u2013 and never will. Because their customers would freak \u2013 and fire them.\n\nWill government block private companies to favor their service? Of course. See: Medicare. And the U.S. Postal Service. Because no matter how much we \u201ccustomers\u201d freak \u2013 we can\u2019t fire them. Government law says so.\n\nPresident Barack Obama loves the local government broadband approach. It\u2019s community broadband organizing \u2013 building single-payer government-only service from the ground up.\n\n\u201c(T)he ultimate goal is to get rid of the media capitalists in the phone and cable companies and to divest them from control.\u201d\n\nThe 2009 \u201cStimulus\u201d law contained a $7.2 billion down payment towards it. How\u2019s it all worked? Predictably \u2013 terribly.\n\nThe Internet \u2018Stimulus\u2019-Just as Destructive as the Rest of the \u2018Stimulus\u2019\n\nYet Another Terrible Internet \u2018Stimulus\u2019 Project\n\nDespite Glossy Reports, Muni Broadband is Still a Net Money Loser\n\nProvo\u2019s Failed Muni Broadband Purchased by Google for $1\n\nGoogle did not assume the thirty nine million dollar debt already hanging over the project. The city is still on the hook for that\u2026.\n\nGoogle will be subsidized in Provo by the citizens, some of whom in delusion think that they are getting \u2018free\u2019 internet\u2026.\n\nA citizen who opts for a competitor will be paying the fee for the service, and also the elevated taxes and fees the failed municipal broadband project has left behind.\n\nHard to fathom why Google favors government broadband.\n\nNorth Carolina Taxpayers Face Bailout of Muni Broadband Service\n\nBurlington, Vermont Broadband Mess Haunts Northland, Minnesota\n\nIt\u2019s so bad.\n\n20 States Now Have Restrictions on Municipal Broadband\n\nIs the Barack Obama Administration thinking less government? And federalism? Of course not.\n\nFCC Thinks It Can Overturn State Laws that Restrict Public Broadband\n\n\u201cThe Commission will look for opportunities to enhance Internet access competition,\u201d (FCC Chairman Thomas) Wheeler said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOne obvious candidate for close examination was raised in Judge Silberman\u2019s separate opinion, namely legal restrictions on the ability of cities and towns to offer broadband services to consumers in their communities.\u201d\n\nAccording to this Administration, the \u201csolution\u201d to government-mandated monopolies and disastrous government broadband is\u2026more government broadband.\n\nAnd if they have to unConstitutionally steamroll the states to do it \u2013 so be it.\n\n[First published at Human Events.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/03/governments-mandate-monopolies-then-complain-about-a-lack-of-competition/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/monopoly-money.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Governments Mandate Monopolies Then Complain About a Lack of Competition"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc371\"", "article_summary": "Government taxes private broadband companies \u2013 and then uses their money to fund competitors to their businesses.\nIt\u2019s Local Governments That Choke Broadband CompetitionGame of KickbacksLocal governments and their public utilities charge ISPs far more (for building rights) than these things actually cost.\nAmazing what happens when you can bypass all the local governments and their myriad shakedowns.\nAnd imagine these private companies trying to set up service \u2013 having to ask the permission of the governments that are competing with them.\nVideo franchises are the revenue-sharing agreements that cable TV companies sign with local governments in return for the exclusive right to offer video services to customers."}
