Scott Walker became an official candidate for president, he told reporters that he would give detailed plans on entitlement reform once he started his official run. While we wait for that speech, Walker did provide a solid hint during an interview with The Daily Signal conducted in Iowa back in April.\n\n\u201cI was born on November 2, 1967 and so the reason I say that is that anyone older than me should be protected,\u201d Walker says. \u201cThe cinch should be, \u2018hey you made plans for your retirement no matter who you are, no matter what your background, no matter what your income, you made decisions about your retirement based upon a commitment that the government had made, a commitment to people to say you worked this many years under the system and that ultimately this is where Social Security and Medicare are going to be at.\u2019 I think those individuals should be protected going forward.\u201d\n\nBut what about Americans who are older than Walker? \u201cFor people my age and younger, we live in a whole different world,\u201d Walker continues. \u201cWe live in a 401K society, we\u2019re ready for reform.
