To the Editor:

Re “Donald Trump, Traitor to His Class” (column, Aug. 30):

Ross Douthat’s analogy between Donald Trump and Franklin D. Roosevelt is off-base.

While both Mr. Trump and F.D.R. had great wealth, the similarity ends there. By the time he ran for president in 1932, Roosevelt had served as assistant secretary of the Navy, an elected state senator and governor of the most populous state in the nation. He had already implemented pathbreaking ideas in the fields of conservation and unemployment relief. He had surrounded himself with serious and innovative thinkers (including his wife, Eleanor).

When campaigning for office in the depths of the Depression, F.D.R. did not fire up one part of his base by demonizing other poor, hard-working people — as Mr. Trump has done, to his shame.

To paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen’s 1988 debate remark on Dan Quayle and John Kennedy: As a historian, I have studied F.D.R., and Donald Trump is no F.D.R.
