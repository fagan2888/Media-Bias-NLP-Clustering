An MBA may make more sense from a strategic point of view, but \u201cthe CPA is still very important. It makes for a less risky hire.\u201d\n\nThe greater demands being placed on healthcare CFOs require individuals that meet a much broader set of criteria.\n\nFor starters, some experience in healthcare is a must. There is too much change going on in the industry, and the CFO plays too critical a role today to not understand the issues facing it, Quinn said.\n\n\u201cThe track record for those hired from outside of healthcare is pretty mixed. They still need some healthcare experience,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHistorically, organizations hire candidates that have grown up in the healthcare system or in physician groups,\u201d Quinn said. In cases that he knows of where a CFO was hired from outside the healthcare industry, \u201cthey still had some experience on a [healthcare] board.\u201d\n\nAs to credentials, a traditional CPA and an MBA degree are preferred today. If given the option of only one or the other in a hire, \u201cmost will still say the CPA,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nTerri Houchen agrees.\n\nAs director of candidate progression at Kansas-based healthcare executive search firm B.E. Smith, Houchen exclusively deals with the placement of executive leaders in the healthcare industry. She has worked with \u201chundreds of CFOs,\u201d and the trend is definitely away from the traditional numbers cruncher.\n\nPick a region of the country, and pick a market size, the desire everywhere is for a CFO that can serve as the right-hand man or woman to the CEO.\n\n\u201cI am rarely asked for someone who isn\u2019t going to serve on the leadership team,\u201d Houchen said.\n\nThe good news: CFOs are evolving nicely into this new role, Houchen said. They have been able to expand their skills as their role demands have increased.\n\n\u201cMany CFOs have really grown and really understand the needs of the organization,\u201d she said.\n\nSo what are the skills that today\u2019s healthcare CFO should have?\n\nOn the business side, they should have experience in helping to drive an organization; in finding new revenue sources; in managing reimbursements; in organizational modeling; in physician employment; with mergers and acquisitions; and they should have vision.\n\nIn terms of personal traits, CFOs should be collaborative, flexible, confident, a coach and a team builder, Houchen said.\n\nAnd a CFO candidate in healthcare should have industry experience. \u201cWith all of the challenges and complications in healthcare, it is desirable to have some background in healthcare,\u201d she stressed.\n\nAs to the idea of the CFO being a strong candidate for the CEO role, Houchen said it is not unusual to see a CFO moving into the CEO position. \u201cOftentimes, I see it when the CEO leaves, and the CFO will take over on an interim basis.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Houchen said 2014 should be a good year for those aspiring to CFO posts in healthcare, and also for those looking to hire them.\n\n\u201cThe good news on the recruiting front is that, it is competitive, but there are many individuals out there that can do this type of work,\u201d Houchen concluded.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/do-cfos-still-need-cpa", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/tom_quinn_100_DPI.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "As healthcare providers grapple with more complex issues, the CFO is being asked to take on a leadership role that in many cases extends beyond the realm of accounting.", "title": "Do CFOs still need a CPA?"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/tom_quinn_100_DPI.jpg"}, "title": "Do CFOs still need a CPA?", "description": "As healthcare providers grapple with more complex issues, the CFO is being asked to take on a leadership role that in many cases extends beyond the realm of accounting.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "As healthcare providers grapple with more complex issues, the CFO is being asked to take on a leadership role that in many cases extends beyond the realm of accounting.&#13; \u201cA much more sophisticated skill set is now required of the healthcare CFO,\u201d said Nelson Mann, a senior partner at Witt/Kieffer, a healthcare executive search firm. \u201cHospitals and health networks are looking for a more strategic, versus operational, executive \u2013 someone with the kind of background and expertise suited for a top leadership role.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ba1\"", "article_summary": "It makes for a less risky hire.\u201dThe greater demands being placed on healthcare CFOs require individuals that meet a much broader set of criteria.\nThey still need some healthcare experience,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA much more sophisticated skill set is now required of the healthcare CFO,\u201d said Nelson Mann, a senior partner at Witt/Kieffer, a healthcare executive search firm.\nThe good news: CFOs are evolving nicely into this new role, Houchen said.\nAs director of candidate progression at Kansas-based healthcare executive search firm B.E."}
