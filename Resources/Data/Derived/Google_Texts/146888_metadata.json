The message:\n\nYou are not required to purchase health insurance through an Obamacare exchange! There are cheaper, better options for young people.\n\nThe campaign's website features minute-long PSAs (which you can see above) that shows the \u201cdangers\u201d of choosing Obamacare. Young people are led into a doctor\u2019s offices (there are both female and male versions of the ad), where the young person declares that they are choosing Obamacare as their preferred health care coverage. The doctors exchange judgmental glances and from there, sh*t gets weird.\n\nWhen the doctor leaves the room, a creepy Uncle Sam reminiscent of the Burger King mascot rises from the floor with a speculum (a terrifying tool used by gynecologists) in the female version and a snappy pair of blue latex gloves for the male version. What the commercial seems to imply is that, quite literally, Obamacare is Uncle Sam violating you and your rights to choose. Extreme? We think so.\n\nThe ads then encourage visitors to sign their petition that you will opt-out of Obamacare.\n\nAdd your voice to those young Americans who know the truth about Obamacare. The more who sign the petition the greater our voice. Opt out!\n\nThe campaign is designed to deter young America from signing up for the health care law when the enrollment period for health care exchanges starts on October 1. So what options do they have?\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo News discussing the ads, Generation Opportunity's president Evan Feinberg said this:\n\n\"What we\u2019re trying to communicate is, 'No, you\u2019re actually not required to buy health insurance,'\u201d Generation Opportunity President Evan Feinberg told Yahoo News in an interview about the campaign. \u201cYou might have to pay a fine, but that\u2019s going to be cheaper for you and better for you.\"\n\nGeneration Opportunity claims on their website that they\u2019re \u201ca free-thinking, liberty-loving, national organization of young people promoting the best of Being American: opportunity, creativity and freedom.\u201d\n\nThe organization is funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, who have given money to and gathered an empire of independent groups seeking more influence with public policy \u2013 and are known for their anti-Obama ways.", "article_metadata": {"contenttype": "Blog_Post", "publication": "Philly.com", "pubdate": 20160526, "title": "Anti-Obamacare ad is the creepiest thing ever", "og": {"site_name": "Philly.com", "description": "A campaign urging young Americans to say no to Obamacare is using a creepy video to get its message across.", "title": "Anti-Obamacare ad is the creepiest thing ever", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/Anti-Obamacare-ad-is-the-creepiest-thing-ever.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/091913_Optout_Obamacare_man_600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentid": 224484711, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/Anti-Obamacare-ad-is-the-creepiest-thing-ever.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/091913_Optout_Obamacare_man_600.jpg", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Anti-Obamacare ad is the creepiest thing ever"}, "cg": "news", "fb": {"app_id": 938226082960499}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-19T17:12:36-04:00", "editdate": "20130919T17:12:36", "searchdate": "2013-09-19", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "db3T5L3C8_JvO-55gJ22lGGUnZLlNulgzTwX1NhCV3o", "verify-v1": "3x82DC93LZlv0I/hQEBoyVVjlGPtX7VxHFgv1upr+9I=", "y_key": "ccf0cd67e5f1e33c", "livedate": "20130919T17:12:36", "sourcepublication": "Philly.com", "description": "A campaign urging young Americans to say no to Obamacare is using a creepy video to get its message across."}, "article_summary": "The campaign is designed to deter young America from signing up for the health care law when the enrollment period for health care exchanges starts on October 1.\nOptOut.org, headed by the right-leaning non-partisan group Generation Opportunity, is a campaign that aims to dissuade audiences \u2013 specifically college students \u2013 from accepting President Barack Obama\u2019s health care plan.\nYoung people are led into a doctor\u2019s offices (there are both female and male versions of the ad), where the young person declares that they are choosing Obamacare as their preferred health care coverage.\nThe campaign's website features minute-long PSAs (which you can see above) that shows the \u201cdangers\u201d of choosing Obamacare.\n\u201cYou might have to pay a fine, but that\u2019s going to be cheaper for you and better for you.\""}
