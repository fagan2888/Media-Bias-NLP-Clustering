Dave Brat\u2019s most ardent supporters \u2013 the sprawling, heavily rural 7th District still figures to be friendly turf for Brat\u2019s first re-election bid.\n\nThat didn\u2019t deter Bedell from filing her campaign paperwork in January. When nobody else sought the Democratic nomination by the filing deadline last Friday, the first-time candidate happily embraced the opportunity to unseat Brat in November\u2019s general election.\n\n\u201cYou have to believe in the underdog,\u201d she said during an interview Saturday morning.\n\nThis is a district where you can overturn conventional wisdom think about what Dave Brat did to Eric Cantor two years ago. I truly believe if you give the voters a reasonable alternative, it will result in a competitive election.\u201d\n\nStrip club owner Mike Dickinson, a liberal, was the first to express interest in pursuing the Democratic nomination in the 7th District. He filed campaign documents last November and has obtained enough signatures required to put his name on the ballot, but he announced last Thursday that he had decided instead to run as nominee of the independent Green Party.\n\n\u201cI felt that the local Democratic committees were not going to give me a fair shake. They have an idea of someone they want to run and in turn go out of their way to keep others out,\u201d said Dickinson, who insisted he\u2019ll be the \u201creal Democrat\u201d running in the 7th District.\n\n\u201cI can assure you whoever they run will not take Democratic stances on such critical issues as gun control, police corruption, student loan debt and opiate abuse.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Hardin, chair of the Chesterfield Democratic Committee, said that 7th District Democrats couldn\u2019t have asked for a better candidate than Bedell.\n\n\u201cEileen is incredibly intelligent and accomplished as an attorney and small business owner, and she is very much in tune with the concerns of the citizens of the 7th District,\u201d Hardin added. \u201cShe is great at bringing people together.\u201d\n\nWhile Bedell praised Dickinson\u2019s energy and said he\u2019s \u201cobviously a very passionate Democrat,\u201d history suggests that his hard-left agenda will have difficulty gaining traction in a district that includes rural counties such as Orange, Louisa, Amelia, Powhatan and Nottoway.\n\nMidlothian attorney Wayne Powell ran the most effective campaign of any Democrat in the modern 7th District, tapping into a vein of citizen frustration with Cantor to earn 41 percent of the vote in 2012.\n\nMost Democrats have fared far worse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot of people who said they\u2019re happy I\u2019m running, but that I can\u2019t win,\u201d Bedell said. \u201cYou can\u2019t approach any competition that way.\u201d\n\nBedell described herself as \u201cfiscally responsible, socially liberal\u201d and cited U.S. Sen. Mark Warner as the type of Democrat capable of connecting with moderate Republicans in the 7th District.\n\nShe also claimed that Brat\u2019s ideology is further right on the political spectrum than a majority of the district\u2019s Republican voters.\n\n\u201cBrat absolutely wants to cut Social Security and Medicare \u2013 I don\u2019t understand why more people aren\u2019t hearing that,\u201d Bedell said.\n\nBrat, an economics professor at Randolph-Macon College, shocked Cantor in the 2014 GOP primary with a novel political strategy: He ran hard to the incumbent\u2019s right, successfully branding Cantor as a supporter of amnesty for undocumented immigrants, while blaming him for Congressional Republicans\u2019 failure to rein in federal spending and overturn the controversial Affordable Care Act.\n\nSince going to Congress, Brat has continued to bang the drum on spending; at a town hall last month in Midlothian, he suggested that if nothing is done to address the nation\u2019s $19 trillion debt, eventually all federal revenue will be allocated to Social Security, Medicare, the prescription drug benefit for seniors, and paying interest on the debt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s na\u00efve to think that anyone is ignoring the debt and the deficit,\u201d Bedell said. \u201cThere are different ways to responsibly address the budget without cutting Social Security and Medicare.\u201d\n\nNoting that Brat\u2019s nickname in Washington is \u201cMr. No,\u201d Bedell said it should be difficult to convince voters that you\u2019re effectively representing their views if your entire agenda revolves around obstructing the federal government.\n\n\u201cI believe voters want someone who will go to Congress and do the work \u2013 that these simplistic approaches to complex problems aren\u2019t the answer,\u201d she added. \u201cHe has identified problems. I\u2019m looking to identify solutions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chesterfield Observer", "description": "Eileen Bedell is nobody&rsquo;s sacrificial lamb.\nBedell, a 43-year-old attorney and Bon Air resident, has heard that a Democrat can&rsquo;t win the 7th District&rsquo;s seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.", "title": "Local attorney will challenge Brat in new-look 7th District", "headline": "Local attorney will challenge Brat in new-look 7th District", "image": "http://www.chesterfieldobserver.com/sites/www.chesterfieldobserver.com/files/images/2016-04-06/6p1.jpg", "url": "http://www.chesterfieldobserver.com/news/2016-04-06/News/Local_attorney_will_challenge_Brat_in_newlook_7th_.html", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": "emma.breeden"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ourhometowninc", "image": "http://www.chesterfieldobserver.com/sites/www.chesterfieldobserver.com/files/images/2016-04-06/6p1.jpg", "description": "Eileen Bedell is nobody&rsquo;s sacrificial lamb.\nBedell, a 43-year-old attorney and Bon Air resident, has heard that a Democrat can&rsquo;t win the 7th District&rsquo;s seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Local attorney will challenge Brat in new-look 7th District"}}, "article_summary": "Local attorney will challenge Brat in new-look 7th DistrictBy Jim McConnell STAFF WRITEREileen Bedell is nobody\u2019s sacrificial lamb.\n\u201cEileen is incredibly intelligent and accomplished as an attorney and small business owner, and she is very much in tune with the concerns of the citizens of the 7th District,\u201d Hardin added.\nThis is a district where you can overturn conventional wisdom think about what Dave Brat did to Eric Cantor two years ago.\nBedell, a 43-year-old attorney and Bon Air resident, has heard that a Democrat can\u2019t win the 7th District\u2019s seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\u201cBrat absolutely wants to cut Social Security and Medicare \u2013 I don\u2019t understand why more people aren\u2019t hearing that,\u201d Bedell said."}
