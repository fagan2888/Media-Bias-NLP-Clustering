The oil boom came and went, the population dropped, and some companies took their jobs to bigger cities. This year, a large Amazon distribution center closed in Montgomery County, which includes Independence. But even then, many in town said they never thought the hospital, opened by local physicians in 1910 and taken over by the Sisters of Mercy in 1927, would follow suit.\n\nLinda Swenson, 68, said she was often at Mercy, for tests, doctor\u2019s appointments or emergency room visits. She knows many of the employees there, and is especially fond of the nursing staff. \u201cIt\u2019s crushing to think that it\u2019s closing,\u201d she said last week before getting lunch downtown at the Vintage Steak House.\n\nMercy\u2019s emergency room had 8,000 visits a year, hospital officials said, of which roughly 250 were actual medical emergencies. Joanne Smith, a Mercy spokeswoman, said the preliminary agreement called for the opening of an advanced urgent care center that might eventually offer full emergency care.\n\nBut even if that happens, the economic cost of losing the hospital could be stark, local officials said. Though there are two other hospitals within a half-hour\u2019s drive, Micky Webb, the city manager, said companies considering coming to Independence often asked whether there was a hospital in town, and that residents felt more secure with one within a few minutes\u2019 reach. The fire department recently bought a new ambulance because the closing will lead to longer transport times, and there are plans to buy another soon.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRod Zinn, a land surveyor who lives in town, said he had hoped that his aging parents would move to Independence from another part of the state, but that they were dissuaded by uncertainty about the hospital\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great community,\u201d he said, \u201cand for a community this size, it should have a hospital.\u201d\n\nThis slice of southeast Kansas, about 90 minutes by car from Tulsa, Okla., and about two hours from Wichita, Kan., has long struggled to attract businesses and educated young people. But Independence is still an economic center for the stretches of farmland surrounding it. The downtown area has ample foot traffic and few empty storefronts. Along the highway leading into town, fast-food restaurants and car dealerships stand near a faded blue \u201cH\u201d sign pointing toward Mercy.\n\nMardie Long, a nurse practitioner at Mercy, said many of her patients, especially the older ones, had expressed anxiety since learning last month that the hospital would close. Ms. Long has pledged to her patients she will continue her practice in town.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI see my patients at Walmart. I see them at the grocery store,\u201d said Ms. Long, who was born at Mercy 51 years ago. \u201cAnd many times, the first question is, \u2018What will you do?\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut Ms. Long was an increasingly rare figure at Mercy. Many doctors left after only a few years in town, and Kim Day, the hospital\u2019s interim president, said the high turnover helped explain why about half of Independence residents had gone elsewhere for their care in recent years.\n\n\u201cThey get frustrated with not having consistent care,\u201d he said, \u201cso they start reaching out to larger communities where there is more continuity.\u201d\n\nWhile hospital closings clearly have an economic and emotional impact, it is less clear whether they jeopardize people\u2019s health. A study published in May in the journal Health Affairs found that hospital closings had no measurable effect on hospitalization rates or mortality rates in the affected communities. One reason could be that the hospitals that closed were of lower quality than those in the region that remained open, the study said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIs it an inconvenience? Sure,\u201d said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, a professor of health policy at Harvard and an author of the study. \u201cBut do patients do worse when they have to travel a little farther, at least from a clinical health point of view? They don\u2019t \u2014 even for really time-sensitive conditions.\u201d\n\nMr. Day said the Mercy system, which owns 46 hospitals in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, tried for years to keep the Independence hospital afloat. But it never succeeded in referring patients to larger Mercy hospitals for specialty care, he said, thus hurting the system\u2019s bottom line. The closest large Mercy hospital was about 85 miles away in Joplin, Mo., and Independence residents preferred to travel to Tulsa or the 40 miles to Bartlesville, Okla.\n\nTwo Republican state legislators from Independence, Senator Jeff King and Representative Jim Kelly, said they hoped some version of state-based Medicaid expansion would seriously be considered in the next legislative session to help prevent more hospital closings. Mr. King said that while he still opposed a straight expansion of Medicaid, he was open to the type of alternative model that Indiana and several other Republican-led states have pursued.\n\n\u201cMy children\u2019s children will not be born in Mercy \u2014 like I was, like my kids were,\u201d said Mr. King, a father of two. \u201cThat is a new fact of life that we are addressing in the best way we can.\u201d\n\nMr. Kelly, who is also the hospital\u2019s board chairman, said he feared that Independence might be just the \u201ctip of the iceberg,\u201d and that lawmakers needed to act to help rural communities like his.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t want to expand Medicaid,\u201d he said, \u201cwe need to find an answer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151008201311,
