Theriault, who was running 14th, held his ground against Keselowski before the Sprint Cup Series champion gave the rookie a nudge in the bumper.\n\n\u201cWe could really hold our own on the long runs,\u201d said Theriault. \u201cBut restarts are where you have to get track position. I gave up a lot of time on restarts.\u201d\n\nKeselowski became the first driver on the season to win from the pole. He led 152 laps. Kyle Busch mounted a late charge, but settled for second. Matt Kenseth, Kyle Larson and Chris Buescher rounded out the top five.\n\nAfter falling a lap down, Theriault was caught up in a multi-car crash that started after Brian Scott got into Elliott Sadler, turning Sadler\u2019s No. 11 Toyota around. Theriault ran into the back of Scott\u2019s car during the wreck.\n\n\u201cThings happen so quick that you really can\u2019t anticipate it,\u201d said Theriault. \u201c[The damage] wasn\u2019t too bad. It didn\u2019t really affect the car too much.\u201d\n\nAfter a caution on lap 141, Theriault and four others stayed on track when the leaders pitted. The move placed them back on the lead lap, but at a price.\n\nIn order to gain back the lap, they were unable to pit. The distance to the end of the race was too long for Theriault to make it on fuel.\n\n\u201cWe got off sequence early after going a lap down, but we never gave up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tried to play a few games at the end, and we came up short. You have to gamble though.\u201d\n\nTheriault was running solidly in 12th place before his fuel tank ran dry.\n\n\u201cIt was a great weekend having everybody out supporting us. I wish we could\u2019ve come through with a decent finish,\u201d said Theriault, who received one of the loudest ovations from the crowd during driver introductions. \u201cWe were in position to salvage one, but it\u2019s one of those days. You got to keep going. You can\u2019t get down on yourself.\u201d\n\nTheriault finished 15th in his series debut at Iowa Speedway in May. In September, he\u2019ll make his final scheduled start for JR Motorsport\u2019s No. 5 Chevrolet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to the next race in Kentucky. I think we\u2019ll have a good rebound finish, and I\u2019ll try not to make the same mistakes I made in this race and learn more. That\u2019s what you have to do. You can\u2019t give up,\u201d Theriault said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LOUDON, N.H. \u2014 Fort Kent\u2019s Austin Theriault was looking for a strong run in his second start behind the wheel of the No. 5 JR Motorsports Chevrolet on Saturday.
