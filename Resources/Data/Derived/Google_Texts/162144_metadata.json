Now, the nation\u2019s largest non-profit co-op is under investigation by state authorities.\n\nNew York\u2019s largest co-op Health Republic, also on the failure closure list, is in far worse shape than originally reported. Other co-ops will continue offering their plans through the end of the year, but Health Republic of New York is in such dire financial shape, they\u2019re closing a month early. The closure will leave more than 200,000 New Yorkers with cancelled health insurance plans.\n\nMonday, The Hill reported the New York Department of Financial Services launched an investigation into Health Republic\u2019s financial reporting:\n\n\u201cNYDFS investigators are collecting and reviewing evidence relating to Health Republic\u2019s substantial underreporting to NYDFS of its financial obligations,\u201d the state said in a statement. \u201cAmong other issues, the investigation will examine the causes of the inaccurate representations to NYDFS regarding the company\u2019s financial condition.\u201d The co-op responds that it has been transparent. \u201cWe have been working closely and transparently with our state and federal regulators since our inception, including monthly regulatory filings and numerous meetings to discuss potential avenues to improve our financial position,\u201d Health Republic said in a statement.\n\nSo far, taxpayer dollars lost because of co-op closures clocks in at around $1.1 billion.\n\nAs we discussed when the eleventh co-op closure was announced:\n\nThe administration was warned non-profit co-ops would ultimately be a bust with a hefty price tag, yet they forged ahead anyway. By the end of 2014, 21 of the 23 non-profit health insurance co-ops created under the ACA were losing money. Enrollment was well beneath expectations in 13 of the 23 plans. Less than a year later, almost half have closed. The Wall Street Journal attributed the lack of federal funding to state level non-profit co-ops to the hard work of Congressional Republicans who through budget negotiations, were able to whittle the administration\u2019s $10 billion bailout bid down to about $2.4 billion. Slim federal pickings have left co-ops starved for cash and unable to meet the demands of their enrollees.\n\nAnd so the Obamacare dumpster fire rages on.\n\nFollow Kemberlee on Twitter @kemberleekaye", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York digs into to Health Republic's financials", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion", "description": "New York digs into to Health Republic's financials", "title": "Nation's Largest Non-Profit Obamacare Co-op Under Investigation", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/obamacare-health-insurance-e1446053440206.png", "updated_time": "2015-11-11T16:34:55+00:00", "url": "http://legalinsurrection.com/2015/11/countrys-largest-non-profit-obama-co-op-under-investigation/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2015-11-11T16:30:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-11T16:34:55+00:00"}, "keywords": "obamacare", "google-site-verification": "f_SDILa9XMa3xcLX9n6eq0yDinw8hWKIjXr-0IOcgIE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Now, the nation\u2019s largest non-profit co-op is under investigation by state authorities.\n\u201cAmong other issues, the investigation will examine the causes of the inaccurate representations to NYDFS regarding the company\u2019s financial condition.\u201d The co-op responds that it has been transparent.\nNew York\u2019s largest co-op Health Republic, also on the failure closure list, is in far worse shape than originally reported.\nBy the end of 2014, 21 of the 23 non-profit health insurance co-ops created under the ACA were losing money.\nMonday, The Hill reported the New York Department of Financial Services launched an investigation into Health Republic\u2019s financial reporting:\u201cNYDFS investigators are collecting and reviewing evidence relating to Health Republic\u2019s substantial underreporting to NYDFS of its financial obligations,\u201d the state said in a statement."}
