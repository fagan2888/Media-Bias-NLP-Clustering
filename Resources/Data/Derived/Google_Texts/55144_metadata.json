And it was straightforward: Now is not the time to let comprehensive immigration reform fizzle.\n\nThe day\u2019s civil disobedience, followed by visits with lawmakers, occurred at a moment in Washington, D.C. when it remains unclear whether House lawmakers will act on immigration policy this year. The Senate has approved a comprehensive immigration reform package.\n\nWe Belong Together, a national grassroots group, served as a key organizer of the event in which participants said too much is at stake to stop now, given that immigration touches the entire country.\n\nThere\u2019s family unity, the issue of deportation, a path to citizenship, the economy and recognition that immigrants contribute to the country, they said.\n\nAn estimated 400 people attended the event, making it one of the largest acts of civil disobedience by women in recent history, said the Rev. Susan Sneed, a participant. She put the arrest number at 121.\n\nSince 1986, U.S. immigration law has not undergone a major overhaul. This year, reform efforts gained much political and popular momentum, especially with the realization that the country\u2019s population has grown in diversity.\n\n\u201cImmigration reform is not just a piece of legislation but the ability for us to take care of our families,\u201d Pramila Jayapal, co-chair of We Belong Together, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cImmigration reform is about being able to live, breathe free and remember the values that brought us all here in the first place: democracy, freedom and justice.\u201d\n\nU.S. Capitol Police move in to arrest women who participated in Thursday\u2019s act of civil disobedience in support of families and immigration.

Photo source: SEIU/Twitter\n\nMembers from the National Organization for Women joined about 100 women during the blocking of traffic outside of Congress. The reason: Immigration reform. Photo source: SEIU/Twitter\n\nAt the intersection of Independence Avenue Southeast and New Jersey Avenue Southeast, within view of the U.S. Capitol, women from Texas, Pennsylvania, Washington state, California, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee, New York and other places gathered at about 10:15 a.m. (ET).\n\nThey joined arms, proceeded from the sidewalk and entered the streets. Then, they folded their legs and sat in a circle at the intersection.\n\nAt times, their hands, clutched with others, slowly swayed in the air, according to a live video feed that supporters broadcast.\n\n\u201cYes, we can! Yes we can!\u201d the protesters and supporters on sidewalks shouted. \u201cWhat do we want? Immigration reform! When do we want it? Now!\u201d\n\nThey also modified a popular chant heard at rallies: \u201cThe women united will never be defeated!\u201d\n\nParticipants included domestic workers, undocumented immigrants, grandmothers, deferred action students, U.S. citizens, faith leaders, domestic violence survivors and 11-year-old Josie Molina Marcaraeg. She is active with the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition.\n\nShe is a U.S. citizen but her father, she told hundreds of people at news conference that morning, is in deportation proceedings.\n\n\u201cCourage is all of the children who go to school every day wondering if their parents will still be there when they come home,\u201d she said, according to a statement.\n\nBefore blocking the intersection and arrival of the U.S. Capitol Police, other speakers at the news conference addressed why comprehensive immigration reform is important to them, their families, colleagues and neighbors.\n\n\u201cOur fight for civil rights is not done. We refuse to sit by when civil rights abuses are perpetrated on other groups,\u201d Bertha Lewis, president of The Black Institute, said.\n\n\u201cAn injustice to one is an injustice to all.\u201d\n\nAi-jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, talked about being the daughter of immigrants and helping an organization that supports women who work in other people\u2019s homes.\n\n\u201cI refuse to stand by while women bear the brunt of the \u2018broken\u2019 immigration system,\u201d she said. \u201cI am proud to be risking arrest today with 105 courageous women who are stepping forward for what is right.\u201d\n\nThe group and the National Asian Pacific American Women\u2019s Forum also were key organizers of the event.\n\nIt was a day of free speech and elevating concerns to elected lawmakers. In the middle of the intersection, advocates unfurled a large white banner in support of comprehensive immigration reform in Congress.\n\nThe day\u2019s peaceful civil disobedience is the second one outside Congress since early August but it comes at a different moment for federal lawmakers, who have a tighter fall legislative calendar.\n\nSince Members of Congress returned from their summer recess on Monday, possible military action in Syria has consumed much of the national debate.\n\nCongress also only has about two weeks to find a solution to funding the federal government. Funding for many federal operations will end at the end of September.\n\nIn addition, the Affordable Care Act, which remains controversial for many people, still has its critics. They might maneuver legislatively in the coming weeks before the health care marketplaces, a cornerstone of the law, open on Oct. 1.\n\nWhile the Senate approved a comprehensive immigration reform package in June, the House of Representatives is considering ideas that would address specific issues, such as border security and possible citizenship for some undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Senate bill includes a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country.\n\nRecently, there\u2019s also been talk that the House might consider immigration legislation in October.\n\nOne House committee chair has talked about the possibility that immigration legislation might not even come to a vote in that chamber, noting that federal lawmakers often consider bills but never bring them before the entire body for final action.\n\nAlso, some federal lawmakers are philosophically opposed to offering a path to citizenship to the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country.\n\nWith the chance of immigration reform moving through both houses of Congress this year unclear, some grassroots groups and policy analysts have talked about the possibility of limited executive action from President Barack Obama as an alternative.\n\nBut on Thursday in Washington, D.C., grassroots advocates remained determined that immigration be a Congressional priority.\n\n\u201cI want my grandkids to grow up in a world that\u2019s like the dream Dr. King spoke (of) right here in D.C.,\u201d the Rev. Susan Sneed, who is from Metropolitan Congregations United in St. Louis, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI am putting my body on the line for that dream.\u201d\n\nShe also is affiliated with Gamaliel, a Chicago-based group made up of faith organizations in the country.\n\nThe Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles said its members and executive director, Angelica Salas, attended to lend their voices at the rally.\n\n\u201cDoing things the same over and over again has not led to a fix to our \u2018broken\u2019 immigration system,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nPetra Falcon of Promise Arizona, which works with immigrants in the Southwest, talked about how a federal push for deportations continues to hurt millions of women, children and families.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s morally unconscionable and it makes no sense given that our economy needs immigrants in order to prosper,\u201d Falcon, the group\u2019s executive director, said in a statement.\n\nOneAmerica, a Seattle-based social justice group, said two women affiliated with their organization also were present in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cWomen and children constitute three-quarters of immigrants to the U.S. and disproportionately bear the burden of our failed immigration system,\u201d Ada Williams Prince, the group\u2019s policy and advocacy director, said in a statement.\n\nDuring the summer, immigration reform activists visited numerous federal lawmakers in their home districts to raise awareness about how immigration policy affects people.\n\nAt one point, even critics of reform efforts conceded that the summer was dominated by these local visits.\n\nParticipants at Thursday\u2019s act of civil disobedience hinted they know comprehensive reform might not occur this year.\n\nIf policy reform fizzles, they said, they are ready to ask elected officials a simple question: What was your role in this issue?\n\nFor now, with Congress back in session, millions of people will be watching to see what might unfold before the year ends.\n\n___________\n\nBrad Wong is assistant news editor for Equal Voice News.
