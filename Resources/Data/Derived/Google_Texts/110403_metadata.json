Travis\u2019s father was largely absent from his life. His mother lacked the means to support him and his brother.\n\nAlthough Travis never intended to go down a destructive path, growing up in the Chicago projects, he thought he had little choice.\n\n\u201cI had no way out,\u201d he recalls in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\n>>> Robert Rector: How the War on Poverty Has Hurt Marriage\n\nBy eighth grade, Travis was smoking marijuana, drinking alcohol and selling drugs. He was kicked out of school for fighting members of rival gangs.\n\nWhen he didn\u2019t return to school for months, it was clear he was in trouble.\n\n\u201cAll I could do is fit in,\u201d Travis recalls, \u201cso I could have a life and not sit in the house the whole time.\u201d\n\nHe was barely 15. That\u2019s when a neighborhood ministry worker, Sarah James, unofficially adopted the Crockett family.\n\n\u201cAuntie Sarah\u201d made it possible for a cousin to travel across the country to a place called Jubilee Leadership Academy. She asked Travis if he wanted to go too.\n\n\u201cI just burst into tears,\u201d Travis says, recalling his response: \u201cYeah, I want to go to Jubilee. I always wanted to go to Jubilee.\u201d\n\nTravis\u2019s story, sketched out in the accompanying video from The Daily Signal, is one reason that World magazine selected Jubilee Leadership Academy from among five finalists to receive its 2014 Hope Award for Effective Compassion.\n\nJubilee Executive Director Rick Griffin and his wife, Leann, accepted the award and a check for $25,000 from World\u2019s Warren Cole Smith and Jamie Dean at a Nov. 20 luncheon in Washington, D.C. The ceremony took place during The Heritage Foundation\u2019s annual Antipoverty Forum bringing together politicians and policymakers, government and nonprofit officials and faith leaders to advance conservative solutions to poverty and human need.\n\nFounded in 1995, Jubilee Leadership Academy is an all-boys Christian boarding school just outside Prescott, Wash., a small town two hours southwest of Spokane.\n\nJubilee is situated on 400 acres donated by philanthropists Ralph and Cheryl Broetje, owners of Broetje Orchards, one of the largest privately owned apple orchards in the U.S. Their vision for Jubilee was to plant seeds of hope in the lives of troubled boys.\n\nThrough counseling, a fully accredited academic program and a range of vocational and athletic activities, Jubilee\u2019s staff of 45 offers struggling boys ages 13 to 18 a way out of poverty, drugs and violence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that chance for a comeback, that leveling of the playing field,\u201d says Griffin, one of Jubilee\u2019s five founders as well as the school\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where all their debts before won\u2019t be counted against them.\u201d\n\n>>> Commentary: Is There a Link Between Childhood Homelessness and Single Parenthood?\n\nIndeed, the academy\u2019s name comes from the Bible\u2019s Old Testament. It recounts that every 50th year the Israelites would celebrate the year of Jubilee, when God desired to mark release from indebtedness and bondage. Prisoners, captives and slaves were released, debts were forgiven and property was returned to original owners.\n\nIn other words, it was an opportunity to begin again.\n\nGriffin, in an interview with The Daily Signal before learning the Hope Award would go to Jubilee, says he hopes to raise enough money to renovate the academy\u2019s dorm, construct a new one and build a gym.\n\nThe academy, while not much to look at, provides what he describes as a Christ-centered community where troubled youth can make that new beginning.\n\n\u201cI always knew [God] was there,\u201d Travis recalls of growing up in Chicago:\n\nThrough the ages 5 to 11, I stayed in a church every single Sunday. But I still had this anger issue and it affected me one day. God\u2014he never let go. He brought me to this place in the middle of nowhere so I could find Him again.\n\nAlthough some boys pay their own way through the program, Jubilee offers scholarships to those who can\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cIt is really important to our mission that we offer the program to anyone who desires to change their life,\u201d says Griffin, 50, a native of Wyoming.\n\nThe average stay at Jubilee Leadership Academy is just over a year. Travis is about four months shy of two years.\n\nAt first resistant, Travis, now 16, has grown to appreciate the program and the staff. He has taken on a leadership role.\n\n\u201cHe is now choosing to serve others that are starting out, as a mentor for other young men,\u201d Griffin says:\n\nTravis knows what they\u2019re going through and he can walk them through that. He\u2019s choosing now to give out of his skill set instead of just advancing for himself.\n\nIf it weren\u2019t for Jubilee, Travis says, he still would be on the streets.\n\n\u201cI would probably be in Chicago with my friends\u2014or my so-called friends\u2014gang-banging and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nNow, he hopes to return to the projects for a different reason: to help other kids in need, as part of a ministry:\n\nI just want to share my testimony of what I\u2019ve been through and the things that I have seen, and I just want to help them not to go down that same path that I did.\n\nIn the meantime, Travis has big dreams of graduating high school, attending Eastern Washington University and making it to the NBA.\n\n\u201cBut I have to get taller, of course,\u201d he jokes.\n\nGriffin, who overcame his own difficult circumstances to earn a master\u2019s degree in education from the University of Phoenix, hopes to continue helping to give direction to troubled adolescents and teens.\n\n\u201cEvery dollar that comes in means one more dollar we get to give to an individual who doesn\u2019t have one,\u201d Griffin says. \u201cOur hope is that we could build another dorm to help more kids who are struggling.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Travis Crockett's journey from the Chicago projects to a Christian boarding school in Washington state reveals the power of relationships in new beginnings.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Travis Crockett's journey from the Chicago projects to a Christian boarding school in Washington state reveals the power of relationships in new beginnings.", "title": "A Street Kid Leans on Helping Hands to Lift Self Out of Poverty", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-11-20-at-4.59.12-PM.png", "updated_time": "2014-11-23T22:32:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1r20elr"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Travis Crockett's journey from the Chicago projects to a Christian boarding school in Washington state reveals the power of relationships in new beginnings.", "title": "A Street Kid Leans on Helping Hands to Lift Self Out of Poverty", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-11-20-at-4.59.12-PM.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Marriage and Family,welfare", "published_time": "2014-11-24T03:01:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-23T22:32:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "jubilee leadership academy, juiblee, war on poverty, poverty, hope awards, travis crockett"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d00\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAuntie Sarah\u201d made it possible for a cousin to travel across the country to a place called Jubilee Leadership Academy.\nThe average stay at Jubilee Leadership Academy is just over a year.\nIf it weren\u2019t for Jubilee, Travis says, he still would be on the streets.\nAlthough some boys pay their own way through the program, Jubilee offers scholarships to those who can\u2019t afford it.\nFounded in 1995, Jubilee Leadership Academy is an all-boys Christian boarding school just outside Prescott, Wash., a small town two hours southwest of Spokane."}
