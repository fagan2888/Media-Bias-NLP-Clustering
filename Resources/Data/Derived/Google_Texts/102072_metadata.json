In its lawsuit, the Federal Trade Commission said fraudulent robocalls told seniors they were about to be shipped a \"free\" alert system that had been purchased for them by a family member or friend. And not just any system; the recorded message falsely said it was a Life Alert\u2014the original \"I've fallen and can't get up\" product advertised on TV. (Life Alert had nothing to do with this. In fact, it sued to have the robocalls stopped.)\n\nRelated: More Older Americans Are Receiving High-Risk Medicine\n\nThe FTC received more than 67,000 complaints about this telemarketing campaign.\n\n\"These telemarketers used illegal robocalls to make a sales pitch that was 100 percent false,\" said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection in a statement. \"Their M.O. was to take advantage of older people's concerns about their health.\"\n\nPeople who responded to the robocall pitch and pressed \"1\" on their phone were connected to a sales representative who allegedly continued the deception by providing false information about the monthly monitoring charge.\n\nAccording to the FTC, customers were told the monthly monitoring fee would only be charged once the system was installed and activated. In reality, victims were charged $34.99 as soon as they agreed to receive the system, whether it was activated or not.\n\nIt's believed the companies that ran this marketing campaign took in more than $13 million in commissions since March 2012. Prosecutors said some people who responded to the bogus pitch suffered from dementia.\n\nRelated: 5 Surprising Ways to Help Prevent Dementia\n\nThe court has frozen the assets of the fraudsters and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who worked with the FTC on the case, said her office will do everything possible to compensate the thousands of people who lost their money.\n\n\"We will not tolerate unscrupulous individuals targeting the elderly,\" Bondi said.\n\nRead more about the case on the FTC website.
