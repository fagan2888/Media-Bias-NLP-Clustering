Depressed with her performances and disillusioned with the sport, she had moved back to Boulder that year and went to work with Mark Wetmore and Heather Burroughs, the coaches who made her a three-time NCAA champion at Colorado.\n\nThey gave her hope and rebuilt her confidence, but she fell short of making her third U.S. Olympic team Saturday, finishing fourth in marathon trials staged in oppressive heat. The top three finishers make the team, and Goucher was devastated, weeping through emotional interviews near the finish area.\n\n\u201cI had a dream that I\u2019m going to have to let go of now,\u201d Goucher said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a really hard pill to swallow, but they were better.\u201d\n\nGoucher clung tenaciously to fourth place in the race\u2019s later stages, hoping someone ahead of her would falter.\n\n\u201cI just kept thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t have to win, I just have to be in the top three.\u2019 But I pretty much knew at 22 (miles) that it wasn\u2019t going to happen,\u201d she said.\n\nGoucher made the 2008 Olympic team in the 10,000 meters after claiming a bronze medal in that event at the world championships the year before. She ran the marathon in the 2012 Olympics, but the past couple of years have been tough.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a dreamer,\u201d said Goucher, 37. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way I\u2019m wired. I love it still. I love racing, I love training, I feel alive when I\u2019m preparing for something. I feel happy. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t go the way you hoped, but I have such a good life. Mark and Heather taking me back, it just turned my life around. They brought me back to myself. They gave me my life back. I would do it again in a heartbeat, even with the same result. I wouldn\u2019t even hesitate.\u201d\n\nTemperatures in the mid-70s caused everyone to rethink race tactics. Shalane Flanagan, the favorite and 2012 trials winner, barely made it to the finish line before collapsing, taking third place.\n\n\u201cI was hoping that would happen to someone in the race,\u201d Goucher said, meaning someone ahead of her failing to finish because of the heat. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s awful but, you know, there\u2019s a dream on the line. That\u2019s what I was hoping, that they would be in over their head, someone would peel off and I would be there. I was still fighting, but they were all composed until the end. They ran really great.\u201d\n\nShe will try to make the Olympic team in the 10,000 meters at the track and field trials in June.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t fight this hard to just fold right now,\u201d Goucher said.\n\nShe fought to make one more Olympic team. She also went to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency with concerns about former coach Alberto Salazar, and USADA has been investigating his methods. If this is how her career ends, she will hold her head high.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m proudest of the last year,\u201d Goucher said, \u201cspeaking out against what I saw and not backing down and coming back against all the odds.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kara Goucher\u2019s backup plan could be her ticket to Rio Olympics", "title": "Kara Goucher\u2019s backup plan could be her ticket to Rio Olympics", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/13/kara-gouchers-backup-plan-could-be-her-ticket-to-rio-olympics/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160213__BN20160214_C12_BNSP14OLYMARATHONSIDEp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160213__BN20160214_C12_BNSP14OLYMARATHONSIDEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-13T21:19:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:45:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "She fought to make one more Olympic team.\nGoucher made the 2008 Olympic team in the 10,000 meters after claiming a bronze medal in that event at the world championships the year before.\nThey gave her hope and rebuilt her confidence, but she fell short of making her third U.S. Olympic team Saturday, finishing fourth in marathon trials staged in oppressive heat.\nThey ran really great.\u201dShe will try to make the Olympic team in the 10,000 meters at the track and field trials in June.\nThe top three finishers make the team, and Goucher was devastated, weeping through emotional interviews near the finish area."}
