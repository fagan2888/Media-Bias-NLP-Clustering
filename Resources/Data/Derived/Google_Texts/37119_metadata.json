The legislation also would defund Planned Parenthood for a year.\n\nBut a great majority of health care taxes would remain intact. Of the 13 tax provisions originally included in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the House bill repeals just two. The bill would erase only taxes on medical devices and the so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d insurance plans.\n\nThe report by the Congressional Research Service compares the effect of partial and full repeal of Obamacare on federal outlays, revenues and deficits from 2016 to 2025.\n\nThe House reconciliation package sent to the Senate could cut about $211 billion in revenues over the 10 years, according to the report. Even with that reduction, taxpayers would be left to shoulder a tax burden of nearly a trillion dollars over the next decade.\n\nFull repeal of Obamacare and its taxes, in contrast, would reduce federal revenues by $1.17 trillion as of 2025, the report finds.\n\nIt says wiping away the Affordable Care Act completely would add $353 billion to the budget deficit over the 10 years; partial repeal would reduce the shortfall by $78.1 billion in the same period.\n\nAs the Senate takes up the House bill for consideration, plenty of opportunities remain for the legislation to stall. Democrat and Republican leaders are at odds over whether it qualifies for special status as a reconciliation bill.\n\nAt issue is whether the bill could neutralize a filibuster by Democrats and pass with 51 votes instead of the regular 60 needed in the 100-member Senate. To qualify for this status, Senate rules require legislation to be budgetary in nature.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said in a Nov. 12 memo that the bill is dead on arrival as a reconciliation measure because it doesn\u2019t \u201cprimarily have a budgetary effect.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., however, counters that the bill can be revived with a \u201csubstitute amendment\u201d that fixes certain procedural problems.\n\nIf the bill escapes the Senate and makes it to his desk, Obama is expected to veto it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House's proposed 'repeal' of Obamacare leaves the vast majority of the health care law's economic burden in place, a congressional agency says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The House's proposed 'repeal' of Obamacare leaves the vast majority of the health care law's economic burden in place, a congressional agency says.", "title": "Memo: Partial Repeal Keeps 82% of Obamacare Burden", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151118_ACATax.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-19T12:21:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QNOBOR"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The House's proposed 'repeal' of Obamacare leaves the vast majority of the health care law's economic burden in place, a congressional agency says.", "title": "Memo: Partial Repeal Keeps 82% of Obamacare Burden", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151118_ACATax.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-11-18T18:25:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-19T12:21:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Congressional Research Service, Healthcare, Affordable Care Act"}, "article_summary": "The report from the Congressional Research Service, dated Nov. 17, shows that 82 percent of the economic burden caused by Obamacare taxes would remain in effect even if what critics call the \u201cpartial repeal\u201d bill became law.\nBut a great majority of health care taxes would remain intact.\nThe House bill takes aim at specific provisions of Obamacare, such as the individual and employer mandates to purchase health insurance.\nOf the 13 tax provisions originally included in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the House bill repeals just two.\nFull repeal of Obamacare and its taxes, in contrast, would reduce federal revenues by $1.17 trillion as of 2025, the report finds."}
