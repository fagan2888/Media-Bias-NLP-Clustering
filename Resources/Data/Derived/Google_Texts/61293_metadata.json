Her page is peppered with links from noted tea partier and anti-Common Core activist Glenn Beck, N.C. Lieutenant Governor and Common Core opponent Dan Forest, and other stories that portray Common Core in a negative light.\n\nBack in May, Metcalf declared herself an opponent of Common Core, citing a California story about how teachers in the Rialto school district came up with a writing assignment that asked students to write a persuasive essay about whether or not the Holocaust actually happened. The assignment was meant to satisfy a Common Core standard for critical thinking; however, there is nothing in the Common Core standards that invites this particular assignment, according to Washington Post journalist Valerie Strauss.\n\nJeannie Metcalf (click here to read more about her) will co-chair the Academic Standards Review Commission with pro-Common Core IBM executive Andre Peek. The next meeting of the review commission should be held sometime in October.\n\nUPDATE: Metcalf emailed N.C. Policy Watch on Tuesday to say she does oppose Common Core.\n\n\u201cI will say I am much more concerned that the math standards be revamped. The ELA standards have some good points,\u201d said Metcalf. \u201cMy co chair is chairman of the NC Business Committee for Education, which is solidly behind common core so I thinks it\u2019s good to have different perspectives moving forward,\u201d Metcalf added.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce603\"", "article_summary": "Lieutenant Governor and Common Core opponent Dan Forest, and other stories that portray Common Core in a negative light.\nJeannie Metcalf (click here to read more about her) will co-chair the Academic Standards Review Commission with pro-Common Core IBM executive Andre Peek.\nThe assignment was meant to satisfy a Common Core standard for critical thinking; however, there is nothing in the Common Core standards that invites this particular assignment, according to Washington Post journalist Valerie Strauss.\nMetcalf, a Winston-Salem/Forsyth school board member, confirmed on Tuesday that she administers the Facebook page RE-elect Jeannie Metcalf for School Board.\nUPDATE: Metcalf emailed N.C.
