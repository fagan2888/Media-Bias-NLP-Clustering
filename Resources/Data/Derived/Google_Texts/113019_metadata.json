Our goal is to provide substantive commentary for a general readership. By screening submissions, we provide a space where readers can share intelligent and informed commentary that enhances the quality of our news and information.\n\nWhile most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderating decisions are subjective. We will make them as carefully and consistently as we can. Because of the volume of reader comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with readers.\n\nWe value thoughtful comments representing a range of views that make their point quickly and politely. We make an effort to protect discussions from repeated comments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either by the same reader or different readers.\n\nWe follow the same standards for taste as the daily newspaper. A few things we won't tolerate: personal attacks, obscenity, vulgarity, profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes), commercial promotion, impersonations, incoherence, proselytizing and SHOUTING. Don't include URLs to Web sites.\n\nWe do not edit comments. They are either approved or deleted. We reserve the right to edit a comment that is quoted or excerpted in an article. In this case, we may fix spelling and punctuation.\n\nWe welcome strong opinions and criticism of our work, but we don't want comments to become bogged down with discussions of our policies and we will moderate accordingly.\n\nWe appreciate it when readers and people quoted in articles or blog posts point out errors of fact or emphasis and will investigate all assertions. But these suggestions should be sent via e-mail. To avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction. Instead, corrections will be made in a blog post or in an article.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Michael Hasch", "description": "The death of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer at the agency's field office in the South Side was ruled a suicide on Friday ...", "pubdate": "2014-06-06 21:30:13", "author": "Michael Hasch", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "The death of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer at the agency's field office in the South Side was ruled a suicide on Friday ...", "title": "Death of federal ICE officer in South Side ruled suicide", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVELogo.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-06 21:00:01.298", "url": "http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/6242699-74/agency-federal-building", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The death of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer at the agency's field office in the South Side was ruled a suicide on Friday ...", "creator": "@triblive", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "title": "Death of federal ICE officer in South Side ruled suicide", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVETwitter.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-06 21:30:13", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.title": "Death of federal ICE officer in South Side ruled suicide", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/6242699-74/agency-federal-building", "keywords": "agency, building, death, examiner, federal", "headline": "Death of federal ICE officer in South Side ruled suicide", "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, News, Breaking", "article": {"category": "News", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2014-06-06 21:30:13", "subcategory": "Admin Page", "mainsection": "News", "section": "News", "publishedtoweb": "2014-06-06 21:30:13", "modified_time": "2014-06-06 21:00:01.298", "tag": "agency, building, death, examiner, federal", "subsection": "Admin Page", "title": "Death of federal ICE officer in South Side ruled suicide", "author": "Michael Hasch"}, "docauthor": "Michael Hasch", "sailthru.description": "The death of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer at the agency's field office in the South Side was ruled a suicide on Friday ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1721\"", "article_summary": "We moderate comments.\nPittsburgh homicide detectives and the Federal Protective Service \u2014 the agency that polices federal buildings \u2014 also were involved in the investigation.\nThe death of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer at the agency's field office in the South Side was ruled a suicide on Friday by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office.\nBecause of the volume of reader comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with readers.\nTo avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction."}
