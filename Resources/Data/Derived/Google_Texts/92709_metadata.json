At the risk of stating the obvious, getting pregnant is not like catching a contagious disease. If the Government intends to broaden the definition of \u2018women\u2019s health and well-being,\u2019 and thus the goal of the Mandate, to include non-health related concepts such as emotional well-being and economic prosperity, then it should likewise have considered the documented negative effects the widespread availability of contraceptives has on women\u2019s ability to enter into and maintain desired marital relationships. This in turn leads to decreased emotional wellbeing and economic stability (out-of-wedlock childbearing being a chief predictor of female poverty), as well as deleterious physical health consequences arising from, inter alia, sexually transmitted infections and domestic violence.\n\nAmerican Freedom Law Center\n\nThus, it has come to pass that the widespread use of contraceptives has indeed harmed women physically, emotionally, morally, and spiritually \u2014 and has, in many respects, reduced her to the \u201cmere instrument for the satisfaction of [man\u2019s] own desires.\u201d Consequently, the promotion of contraceptive services \u2014 the very goal of the challenged mandate \u2014 harms not only women, but it harms society in general by \u2018open[ing] wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards.\u2019 Responsible men and women cannot deny this truth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Court briefs from Hobby Lobby's supporters show how the case is all about controlling women's sex lives", "author": "Katie McDonough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Court briefs from Hobby Lobby's supporters show how the case is all about controlling women's sex lives", "title": "How Hobby Lobby supporters talk about \u201creligious liberty\u201d: 5 outrageous quotes that show it\u2019s all about sex", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/06/how_hobby_lobby_supporters_talk_about_religious_liberty_5_outrageous_quotes_that_show_its_all_about_sex/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/04/hobby-lobby1.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Court briefs from Hobby Lobby's supporters show how the case is all about controlling women's sex lives", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/04/hobby-lobby1.jpeg", "title": "How Hobby Lobby supporters talk about \u201creligious liberty\u201d: 5 outrageous quotes that show it\u2019s all about sex", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "How Hobby Lobby supporters talk about \u201creligious liberty\u201d: 5 outrageous quotes that show it\u2019s all about sex", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Birth Control, Contraception, Hobby Lobby, religious liberty, reproductive health, reproductive justice, Supreme Court", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0bbe\"", "article_summary": "It should probably be noted that virtually everything these groups claim about birth control (including calling it an \u201cabortifacient\u201d) is wrong.\nFor actual information about birth control, please see here.\nThat veneer falls away pretty quickly when you read the court briefs filed in support of Hobby Lobby, which are almost uniformly about controlling women\u2019s sexuality and the apparent horrors of decoupling sex from reproduction.\nAt the risk of stating the obvious, getting pregnant is not like catching a contagious disease.\nHere are five excerpts (emphasis added):Beverly Lahaye InstituteRelying entirely on the 2011 IOM Report, the Government asserts that by increasing access to contraceptives, the Mandate will promote public health by decreasing unintended pregnancies."}
