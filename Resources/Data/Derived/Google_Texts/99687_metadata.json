Christie makes point on Obamacare\n\nRepublican Gov. Chris Christie said Tuesday that he doesn\u2019t like Obamacare but that he found a way to deal with it in New Jersey, another signal that he sees the government shutdown as an opportunity to contrast himself with feuding parties in Washington.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with the law, but we\u2019ve complied with it, and that\u2019s the job you have as governor,\u201d Christie said at a gubernatorial debate at William Paterson University in Wayne. \u201cYou don\u2019t always agree with every law you have to enforce, but I\u2019ve enforced this one, and I\u2019m proud of our record on health care.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nChristie sailed through the first debate against his Democratic challenger, state Sen. Barbara Buono. He landed several jabs but stayed cool and largely steered away from going personal, except to say that he commended Buono as a \u201cgood and caring mother\u201d and public servant.\n\nChristie was noncommittal when moderator Kristine Johnson asked him whether he was going to run for president. If reelected as governor, Christie would be in the midst of his second term at the onset of the 2016 cycle.\n\n\u201cThe fact is after 2017, I would be looking for a new job anyway, so as we go forward I\u2019m going to continue to do my job the best way I possibly can and I am not going to declare tonight, Kristine, for you or for anybody else that I am or I am not running for president,\u201d Christie said.\n\n\u201cI can walk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d he added. \u201cI can do this job and also deal with my future and that\u2019s exactly what I will do.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates said they would be open to releasing medical records if voters had questions about their physical suitability for the job. Christie has publicly acknowledged undergoing lap-band surgery in February.\n\n\u201cPeople see whether you\u2019re fit for the job by whether you can do the job or not,\u201d he said.\n\nBuono assailed Christie on issues ranging from property taxes to jobs to his handling of Superstorm Sandy recovery during the hour-long debate. She repeatedly used variations of the phrase \u201cRomney-style economics\u201d in her argument and said that the economy is \u201cin the tank.\u201d\n\nResponding to an early question on gay marriage, the lawmaker criticized Christie\u2019s position that voters, not elected officials, should decide the state\u2019s law on gay marriage.\n\n\u201cMy daughter, who\u2019s openly gay, is not a political agenda,\u201d Buono said.\n\nIn a statement provided by the Buono campaign, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida blasted Christie on social and economic issues.\n\n\u201cIn Barbara Buono, New Jersey will have a governor who always reflects their mainstream values, not just when the cameras are rolling,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said.\n\nThe Republican Governors Association issued a statement saying Christie \u201cclearly defeated Buono.\u201d\n\nThe race is an easy one for Republicans compared to the other off-year gubernatorial battle they are waging, in Virginia. Christie has led in polling and fundraising and is expected to claim victory in the Nov. 5 election. The candidates are slated to debate one more time on Oct. 15.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Republican sails through his first debate.", "title": "Christie makes point on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/chris-christie-obamacare-new-jersey-debate-98036.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/08/16/131508_christie_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "New Jersey (483),Barbara Buono (15),2013 Elections (172),Elections (1527),Chris Christie (898)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Republican sails through his first debate.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1663\"", "article_summary": "If reelected as governor, Christie would be in the midst of his second term at the onset of the 2016 cycle.\nChristie makes point on ObamacareRepublican Gov.\nBuono assailed Christie on issues ranging from property taxes to jobs to his handling of Superstorm Sandy recovery during the hour-long debate.\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with the law, but we\u2019ve complied with it, and that\u2019s the job you have as governor,\u201d Christie said at a gubernatorial debate at William Paterson University in Wayne.\nChristie has led in polling and fundraising and is expected to claim victory in the Nov. 5 election."}
