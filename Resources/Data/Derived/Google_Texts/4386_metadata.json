For the woman. Just ask Erin Andrews.\n\nIt has been eight years now. Eight years since Fox reporter Erin Andrews was a rising ESPN sports star whose work took her to hotels around the country. Eight years since Michael David Barrett was traveling too, secretly filming her on his cellphone from peepholes he\u2019d doctored. It\u2019s been seven years since Barrett, finding himself in what he now calls a \u201cfinancial bind,\u201d sold a video of her, alone and nude in her room.\n\nIn 2010, Barrett pleaded guilty to obtaining hotel rooms next to Andrew in three cities and filming her in two of them. He was sentenced to 27 months in prison. At the time, Andrews said, \u201cYou violated me and you violated all women. You are a sexual predator, a sexual deviant and they should lock you up.\u201d And she added, \u201cIt\u2019s my body on the Internet. I\u2019m being traumatized every single day for what he did\u2026. This will never be over for me.\u201d And it\u2019s not.\n\nOn Monday, Andrews\u2019 $75 million civil trial against the Nashville Marriott at Vanderbilt University, as well as the hotel chain\u2019s West End Hotel Partners and Windsor Capital Group, as well as Michael David Barrett, commenced in Tennessee. In a Nashville court last week, Penn State Professor Bernard Jansen estimated that 17 million people have subsequently watched the four and a half minute footage. \u201cRight now,\u201d he said, \u201csomeone is watching that video.\u201d\n\nIn his chilling 2013 deposition, Barrett revealed the relative ease with which he was able to obtain such close proximity to Andrews, saying he\u2019d asked to be connected to her via the hotel house phone, which then revealed her room number. Once he had the information, he rigged her room peephole, and then, as he admitted at one point, \u201cI went back to the room, and unfortunately for both of us, I could hear that the shower was on in her room when I walked by\u2026 Then I pulled out the plug and waited for the opportunity.\u201d Yes. How unfortunate for him that he then chose to try to ruin a woman\u2019s life.\n\nBut the Andrews case is already making very clear \u2014 if you really seek to destroy a woman, it takes a village. What Barrett did was despicable. What the millions of viewers of her private moment as she imagined herself safe in the confines of her room \u2014 the viewers who are still clicking on that footage even now \u2014 are doing is despicable too. And how about her former employer, ESPN? On Monday, Andrews said that after the video went public in 2009, the network told her she wouldn\u2019t be allowed back to work until she agreed to do a damage control interview to, as the Washington Post reports, \u201cdispel suspicions that she had staged the whole thing in order to gain greater publicity.\u201d She told the courtroom, \u201cThat was the only way I was going to be allowed back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "8 years after a stalker invaded her life and blew apart her privacy, the invasiveness continues", "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "8 years after a stalker invaded her life and blew apart her privacy, the invasiveness continues", "title": "The endless shaming of Erin Andrews: When a woman is sexually victimized online, the damage endures", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/01/the_endless_shaming_of_erin_andrews_when_a_woman_is_sexually_victimized_online_the_damage_endures/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/erin_andrews.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "8 years after a stalker invaded her life and blew apart her privacy, the invasiveness continues", "creator": "@embeedub", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/erin_andrews.jpg", "title": "The endless shaming of Erin Andrews: When a woman is sexually victimized online, the damage endures", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The endless shaming of Erin Andrews: When a woman is sexually victimized online, the damage endures", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Erin Andrews, ESPN, Lara Logan, Michael David Barrett, Rape Culture", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Eight years since Michael David Barrett was traveling too, secretly filming her on his cellphone from peepholes he\u2019d doctored.\nJust ask Erin Andrews.\nEight years since Fox reporter Erin Andrews was a rising ESPN sports star whose work took her to hotels around the country.\nTopics: Erin Andrews, ESPN, Lara Logan, Michael David Barrett, Rape Culture, Life News, Entertainment NewsThe consequences of a violation of a woman\u2019s privacy, for victimizing her sexually, are steep and enduring.\nBut the Andrews case is already making very clear \u2014 if you really seek to destroy a woman, it takes a village."}
