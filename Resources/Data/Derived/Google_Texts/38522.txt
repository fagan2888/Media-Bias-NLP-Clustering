Geraldo Rivera is trying to replace the late Dick Clark as the world’s oldest teenager – on Twitter anyway.

Not only does the 70-year-old have a weakness for tweeting half-naked selfies, he’s got a high school kid’s vocabulary when it comes to his competition.

Rivera is losing his national radio syndication Jan. 1, including KABC in Los Angeles, one of the country’s biggest radio markets.

On Monday, syndicated shock jock Tom Leykis took to the airwaves to make fun of the former newsman

@KABCRadio (remember them?) debuts new radio show replacing @GeraldoRivera (remember him?). Compelling new subject matter: Obamacare. #fail — Tom Leykis (@tomleykis) December 16, 2013

And Rivera struck back like the high schooler he is at heart – cafeteria language and all.

@tomleykis@KABCRadio#fail Here’s some compelling subject matter: LA radio gets another right wing jerk off Rush wannabe — Geraldo Rivera (@GeraldoRivera) December 16, 2013

Onanism aside, it sounds like Geraldo thinks “Rush wannabe” is supposed to be an insult in the radio trade.

Is there a radio talk show host in America who isn’t a “Rush wannabe”? As far as insults go, that’s like calling a professional golfer a “Tiger wannabe.”

During his next dark night of the soul, Rivera might want to hold off on the bourbon-and-ginger topless photos and ponder whether there are any “Geraldo-wannabes” out there. (Hint: There aren’t. Not sane ones, anyway.)

Leykis quickly hit back.

@GeraldoRivera@KABCRadio Really, Geraldo? Your ratings were so low they couldn’t be seen with an electron microscope. FACT. — Tom Leykis (@tomleykis) December 16, 2013

And the #LeykisArmy piled on.

@GeraldoRivera you should call @tomleykis on his show today and put him in his place…yes some people still have shows #LeykisArmy — Adrian Gonzalez (@thebatcommander) December 16, 2013

@GeraldoRivera @tomleykis @KABCRadio Stop being a hater Jerkraldo! #leykisarmy — Liz Escobar (@FocoYouFocoMe) December 16, 2013

@GeraldoRivera@tomleykis@KABCRadio Geraldo’s so bitter he can’t even insult Leykis accurately. Not even in the ballpark of accuracy. — Dropwise Selector™ (@DropwiseBrian) December 16, 2013

If Geraldo’s got accuracy problems, one tweet hinted at why.

#Leykisarmy cabrones: I will NOT be on @tomleykis tomorrow for my usual #askamexican hour due to a super-secret bourbon mission in Kentucky! — GustavoArellano (@GustavoArellano) September 24, 2013

Al Capone’s vault was a long time ago. Geraldo’s career should have stayed there.

Jerk.
