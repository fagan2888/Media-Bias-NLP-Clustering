Four district court judges are challenging the constitutionality of a new state law that threatens the budget of the judicial branch.

The lawsuit was filed Friday in Shawnee County District Court on behalf of judges from the counties of Douglas, Kingman, Labette and Riley.

Issues first arose in 2014 with the passage of a law that said judges in each of the state's 31 judicial districts pick their chief judges, taking that power from the Kansas Supreme Court. A Shawnee County judge ruled this month that the law was unconstitutional. But that ruling doesn't address another law, which is the focus of the new lawsuit.

The new law declares that if the administrative policy is invalidated, the court system's funding through June 2017 is "null and void."
