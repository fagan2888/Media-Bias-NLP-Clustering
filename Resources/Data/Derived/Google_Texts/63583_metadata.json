The remaining cases on the docket involve congressional redistricting, power plant emissions and execution methods. Here\u2019s a list of the cases.\n\n* * *\n\n1. Execution Methods\n\nGlossip v. Gross\n\nAt issue: Whether the sedative midazolam presents an unconstitutional risk of severe pain in executions of condemned criminals.Three men on Oklahoma\u2019s death row claim that midazolam, the anesthetic the state plans to administer before introducing paralytic and heart-stopping drugs to their bloodstreams, is unreliable, exposing them to an unconstitutional risk of severe pain as they are put to death.\n\n2. Power-Plant Emissions\n\nUtility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA et. al.\n\nIssue: Whether the EPA unreasonably disregarded costs when it decided to regulate power plant emissions of mercury and other air toxins. The regulations would cost $9.6 billion annually, according to EPA estimates. But the agency said it was appropriate to consider only public health risks\u2014not industry costs\u2014when it decided to regulate coal- and oil-fired generation plants.\n\n3. Congressional Redistricting\n\nArizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission\n\nIssue: Whether a state may transfer redistricting authority from the legislature to a nonpartisan independent commission. Arizona voters in 2000 passed a ballot initiative that shifted responsibility for drawing congressional districts from the state legislature to an independent redistricting commission made up of two Democrats, two Republicans and an independent.\n\nMore\n\nSupreme Court Decisions of 2014-2015", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "After big rulings last week on same-same marriage and the Affordable Care Act, the Supreme Court is scheduled to issue its final three decisions of the term on Monday.
