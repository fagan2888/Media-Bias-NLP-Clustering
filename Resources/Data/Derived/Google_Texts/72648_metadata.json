The retailer is cramming primary health services into its big boxes, just up the isle from the hunting rifles and silverware, electronics and landscaping accessories.\n\nSo far, five locations have opened in South Carolina and Texas. Executives are waiting to see how those fare before expanding to other spots, but a sixth is reportedly on the way in Palestine, Texas. There's mixed speculation about whether the concept will take hold. The company says it's targeting rural areas where doctors are sparsely situated, combining \"walk-in convenience with budget-friendly prices,\" the company says on its website.\n\nThe New York Times reported that experts are divided on the wisdom of the idea. Physicians, of course, are skeptical, their logic following an obvious course: Do you want a company that specializes in bare-bones corporate efficiency treating your bladder infection or removing your warts?

Now it's taking a more serious route than its drug-store competitors, ambitiously marketing itself as a primary care provider. For management and staffing of the clinics, it is contracting with a company called QuadMed, a former commercial printing company that branched out to primary health care in 1991. Based in Wisconsin, the company specializes in selling health-care clinics to companies who would rather provide direct care to employees than subsidize health insurance.\n\nIn other words, a grocery/sporting goods/lawn care/electronics store has hired medical professionals from a printing company to monitor your diabetes.
