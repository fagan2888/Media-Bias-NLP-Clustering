In Oklahoma and Oregon, the variance in premiums was $29.33 and $24.67, respectively. However, in Virginia, the results revealed that monthly insurance premiums were lower by $14. At the moment, only 23 out of 51 State Health Exchanges cover obesity treatment using bariatric surgery.\n\n\u201cThis study shows it\u2019s not really a cost issue as to why bariatric surgery isn\u2019t covered,\u201d said study co-author Wayne English, MD, associate professor of surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in a news release. \u201cIt may be an issue of false notions about the true costs of bariatric surgery or it may be discrimination. Either way, poor policy is affecting millions of people every day, in many states. It shouldn\u2019t matter where you live as to whether or not you have access to bariatric surgery. There is great inequality throughout state health exchanges operating under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe study data was collected from Avalere PlanScape, which conducted an analysis of the 2015 State Exchange Plan features using data from the Benefits and Cost Sharing Public Use Files (PUF) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Plan Attributes. Only Virginia, Oregon and Oklahoma have one or more regions within each state a portion of the insurance plans includes coverage for bariatric surgery.\n\nWhile obesity is a nationwide endemic, each state makes its own decisions in the treatment of obesity under the ACA, according to John M. Morton, MD, MPH, president of the ASMBS, and chief of the Bariatric and Minimally Invasive Surgery at the Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cThere is a real geographic disparity,\u201d said Dr. Morton, who was not involved in the study. \u201cAnd it\u2019s sad to say that many of the states expected to exclude obesity treatments can be found in the South, where the highest rates of obesity can also be found. We are working very hard to change the equation so that all people with obesity, no matter where your home happens to be, can have access to evidence-based prevention and treatment programs including bariatric surgery.\u201d\n\nAccording to the most recent data, rates of obesity in the United States now exceed 35 percent of the population in three states (Arkansas, West Virginia and Mississippi), 22 states have rates above 30 percent, 45 states are above 25 percent, and every state is above 20 percent. Arkansas has the highest adult obesity rate at 35.9 percent, while Colorado has the lowest at 21.3 percent. The data also show that 23 of 25 states with the highest rates of obesity are in the South and Midwest.\n\nObesity Week is the largest global conference with a focus on basic science, prevention, clinical application and treatment of obesity, and is hosted by The Obesity Society (TOS) and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Read more about a Study showing US states often leave Bariatric Surgery out of Affordable Care Act coverage, despite low Impact on Insurance Premiums.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Obesity News Today", "description": "Read more about a Study showing US states often leave Bariatric Surgery out of Affordable Care Act coverage, despite low Impact on Insurance Premiums.", "title": "Bariatric Surgery Often Bypassed in Affordable Care Act Coverage", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://obesitynewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/shutterstock_256773271.jpg", "height": 667}, "updated_time": "2015-11-09T11:28:38-05:00", "url": "http://obesitynewstoday.com/2015/11/09/bariatric-surgery-often-bypassed-affordable-care-act-coverage/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Read more about a Study showing US states often leave Bariatric Surgery out of Affordable Care Act coverage, despite low Impact on Insurance Premiums.", "creator": "@obnewstoday", "image": "http://obesitynewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/shutterstock_256773271.jpg", "title": "Bariatric Surgery Often Bypassed in Affordable Care Act Coverage", "site": "@obnewstoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://obesitynewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-bionews-square-2-512x512-270x270.png", "keywords": "Obesity Week 2015bariatric surgery", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "The Obesity Society", "published_time": "2015-11-09T07:01:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-09T11:28:38-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt may be an issue of false notions about the true costs of bariatric surgery or it may be discrimination.\nIt shouldn\u2019t matter where you live as to whether or not you have access to bariatric surgery.\nAt the moment, only 23 out of 51 State Health Exchanges cover obesity treatment using bariatric surgery.\nOnly Virginia, Oregon and Oklahoma have one or more regions within each state a portion of the insurance plans includes coverage for bariatric surgery.\nAccording to the findings of a recent study presented during the Obesity Week 2015, most U.S. states do not provide coverage for bariatric surgery under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) despite the urgent need for efficient obesity treatments and the minimal impact such surgery has on monthly premiums."}
