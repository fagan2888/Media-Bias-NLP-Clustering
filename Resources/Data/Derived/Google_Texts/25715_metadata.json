Beginning her journey in July of 2011 at 222 lbs., she embarked on a mission to lose weight through a ketogenic diet \u2014 a diet high in fats, moderate in protein, and low in carbohydrates. The 26-year-old conceded she did \u201cvirtually zero intentional exercise\u201d over the course of her weight loss journey, just simple dietary swaps and the occasional picture as a reminder.\n\n\u201cI knew that I had to start somewhere,\u201d Amanda told ABC News. \u201cI figured if I did it [took pictures] at least once a month, at the end of however long it took, I would have this really cool end product.\u201d\n\nWhat Is The Ketogenic Diet?\n\nAmanda\u2019s diet consisted mostly of eggs, fish, pork, chicken, beef, vegetables, and nuts. On Reddit, she wrote that the diet was a keto/paleo hybrid, referring to a combination of ketogenic components \u2014 high fats, moderate protein, low carbs \u2014 and the newly popularized paleo, or \u201ccaveman,\u201d diet that consists of similar foods, permitting only those a caveman would theoretically have had access to. (Amanda still admitted to the occasional gluten-free cupcake.)\n\nKetogenic diets differ from many diet plans in their minimal reliance on carbohydrates. When the body is deprived of the necessary energy sources from grains and starches \u2014 two things keto/paleo diets want to keep as low as possible \u2014 it starts to draw energy from fat stores instead. Where carbohydrates normally get converted into glucose, which is then used for energy, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and biochemicals known as ketones. These ketones then pass through the brain and replace glucose for energy.\n\nThe year-long journey wasn\u2019t one Amanda was prepared for, she told Good Morning America.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I was actually prepared for the amount of emotional investment,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople bare their souls when they want to take back their health.\u201d\n\nIf the widening smiles across each picture are any indication, Amanda\u2019s internal health, which she says plagued her with poor self-esteem and low self-confidence, has also improved. Dr. Jen Ashton, ABC News\u2019 senior medical contributor, remarked that Amanda\u2019s outward appearance reveals an even deeper inner journey.\n\n\u201cThe waist got smaller. The bustline got bigger. The neckline got smaller,\u201d Ashton told ABC News. \u201cBut the more significant changes actually occur inside our bodies. Changes to one\u2019s sense of self, to one\u2019s physiology, to one\u2019s internal metabolism.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "time-lapsed video, transformation, weight loss, 88 lbs, seconds, amanda, ketogenic diet, paleo, reddit", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A time-lapsed video shows a woman's year-long, 88-lb. transformation in only five seconds.", "title": "Time-Lapsed Video Shows Woman\u2019s Transformation With Ketogenic Diet", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/time-lapsed-video-shows-womans-transformation-ketogenic-diet-88-lbs-lost-5-seconds-255799", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/still.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A time-lapsed video shows a woman's year-long, 88-lb. transformation in only five seconds.", "title": "Time-Lapsed Video Shows Woman\u2019s Transformation With Ketogenic Diet", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/time-lapsed-video-shows-womans-transformation-ketogenic-diet-88-lbs-lost-5-seconds-255799", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/still.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/still.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-06T10:06:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-06T10:06:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A time-lapsed video shows a woman's year-long, 88-lb. transformation in only five seconds."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd54\"", "article_summary": "Beginning her journey in July of 2011 at 222 lbs., she embarked on a mission to lose weight through a ketogenic diet \u2014 a diet high in fats, moderate in protein, and low in carbohydrates.\n\u201cI figured if I did it [took pictures] at least once a month, at the end of however long it took, I would have this really cool end product.\u201dWhat Is The Ketogenic Diet?\nChanges to one\u2019s sense of self, to one\u2019s physiology, to one\u2019s internal metabolism.\u201d\nKetogenic diets differ from many diet plans in their minimal reliance on carbohydrates.\nDr. Jen Ashton, ABC News\u2019 senior medical contributor, remarked that Amanda\u2019s outward appearance reveals an even deeper inner journey."}
