INDIANAPOLIS — Houston quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick was carted off the field with an air cast covering his left leg early in the second quarter at Indianapolis.

The team did not provide details about the injury other than to say Fitzpatrick would not return. Rookie Tom Savage replaced Fitzpatrick.

Fitzpatrick was injured on a 2-yard run with 13:29 to go.

Fitzpatrick opened the season as Houston’s starter, was replaced by Ryan Mallett and then reclaimed the starting job three weeks ago when Mallett went down with a season-ending injury. Fitzpatrick had won two straight and was 3 of 6 for 30 yards Sunday before the injury.

Houston must win the game to stay alive in the AFC South chase.
