Henry Kissinger, David Petraeus, James D. Wolfensohn and Richard Perle are among those representing America. \u201cUSA\u201d and \u201cUS elections\u201d are on the organization\u2019s 15-item to-do list, along with Russia, terrorism, globalization and cybersecurity \u2014 but there\u2019s nothing on climate change.\n\nAnd yes, it is possible to see who will be there. There\u2019s a spare but well-meaning press release and a complete list at the official website here: Bilderbergmeetings.org.\n\n\u2018NOTHING MORAL ABOUT GUTTING THE CONSTITUTION\u2019\n\nWhen in doubt, buff up the moral argument and add some earnest trimmings. President Obama, indeed, framed the Affordable Care Act in dramatic, almost heroic moral terms in a speech before a Catholic health association on Tuesday, advising his audience, \u201cAmerica is not a place where we simply turn away from the sick or turn our backs on the tired, the poor, the huddled masses. It is a place sustained by the idea, \u2018I am my brother\u2019s keeper, I am my sister\u2019s keeper.\u2019\u201d\n\nCarrie Severino, chief counsel to the Judicial Crisis Network and former law clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, is not buying any of it \u2014 particularly as the Supreme Court gears up to rule in King v. Burwell, a major case that could deal a devastating blow to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s moral case boils down to this: If you like your morals, you can keep your morals. There is nothing moral about gutting the Constitution, playing politics with the health care plans of millions of Americans or forcing people to violate their deeply held religious convictions,\u201d Ms. Severino says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing moral about attempting to bully the Supreme Court by presenting a false choice between the rule of law and love for one\u2019s neighbor.\u201d\n\nBEACH READING\n\nNeed a book? Some summer selections here, courtesy of David M. Whalen, provost and professor of English at Hillsdale College, who offers a list of must-reads for those craving more than a vacation potboiler. The recommendations, followed by Mr. Whalen\u2019s personal commentary:\n\n\u201cThe Inn at the Edge of the World\u201d by Alice Thomas Ellis. (\u201cWhat better time than summer to read a novel about Christmas, especially Christmas as experienced by people trying to avoid it?\u201d)\n\n\u201cThe Writing Life\u201d by Annie Dillard. (\u201cShort, intense, dense and lyrical at once, this is as thoughtful a book as it is beautifully done. Substance and style are one.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThe Age of Exuberance: Backgrounds to Eighteenth-Century English Literature\u201d by Donald Greene.(\u201cOriginally published in 1970, this small gem would be considered dated by now. But then, so would the 18th century.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThe Four Men\u201d by Hilaire Belloc. (\u201cA whimsical, elegiac, outrageous and profound meditation on many things wrapped in a tribute to Sussex, England.\u201d)\n\n\u201cParochial and Plain Sermons\u201d by John Henry Newman. (\u201cGood for the soul.\u201d)\n\nTHE TENACITY OF BEN CARSON\n\nThe mainstream news media must be getting nervous. Following twin polls that placed Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson among the top five GOP candidates, press reports are getting aggressive. \u201cFrom idol to sellout: how Ben Carson is losing his legacy,\u201d read one MSNBC headline, while The Washington Post reported in-house problems within the Carson campaign. But he soldiers on and stays on message.\n\n\u201c\u2018We the people.\u2019 By opening our Constitution with these three simple words, the Founders made it clear that in America, the citizens would be the center of power. Government would only act with our consent. This was the true American revolution. I am running for President because too many people in Washington have forgotten this,\u201d Mr. Carson said in a campaign message to voters released Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI am not interested in picking fights with my fellow candidates. I am interested in working together with you to heal, inspire and revive this great nation that we all love. You\u2019ll often hear cynics in the Washington political class discount me by saying, \u2018Dr. Carson has no political experience,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cThere are a lot of people in politics who are wise and can solve our problems. But there\u2019s some people in politics I wouldn\u2019t let tie my shoes.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson is in Iowa for a half-dozen grass-roots stops, including volunteer work at a food bank in Waterloo and some time at an ice cream social at a wildlife club in Eldora. He is advising folks to use their \u201cGod-given common sense.\u201d\n\nSCIENCE CORNER\n\nYes, life is frantic and chaotic because of smartphones and because of those who are mesmerized by them \u2014 which appears to be much of the known universe. A new study of phone use habits in 14 nations finds that Americans check in with the social media outlets of their choice an average of 20 times a day \u2014 but that\u2019s nothing.\n\n\u201cSmartphone users in Thailand, Argentina, Malaysia, Qatar, Mexico and South Africa launched social apps a staggering 40 or more times per day,\u201d reports Informate, a Seattle-based marketing research group, which also notes that fussing with Facebook and Twitter represents up to half the total time consumers spend on their mobile phones. And yes, there are psychological studies revealing that this can make people despondent or edgy for a variety of reasons. Neck and posture problems are also being reported.\n\n\u201cWhile social networking may have started as a viral craze for U.S. teenagers,\u201d says Will Hodgman, CEO of the company, \u201cit\u2019s steadily matured into an everyday lifestyle for many adults around the world, who are now eclipsing teens and young adults as most-frequent users.\u201d\n\nROMNEY ON THE RADAR\n\nPrepare for a brief Romney re-emergence. Mitt Romney will likely garner significant news coverage with his three-day Experts and Enthusiasts Summit, to be staged at a five-star resort east of Salt Lake City on Thursday. The event is conveniently known as the E2 Summit. Headed out that way from the presidential crowd: Sens. Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham, Govs. Scott Walker, Chris Christie and John Kasich and Carly Fiorina, who will be arriving from a campaign stop in New Hampshire. Also among the 250 guests: Sen. Kelly Ayotte, American Enterprise Institute President Arthur Brooks, Yahoo anchor lady Katie Couric, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates \u2014 and, interestingly enough, former White House adviser David Axelrod.\n\nAlong with much presidential posturing, activities for the politically inclined include flag football, skeet shooting, horseback riding, early morning hikes, a hot-air balloon ride (with an unnamed special guest) and yoga.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 79 percent of Americans say middle-class people are \u201cfalling\u201d into a lower economic class.\n\n\u2022 75 percent say achieving a middle-class lifestyle is harder now than it was in the past.\n\n\u2022 60 percent are worried and concerned about \u201cwhat the future holds\u201d for the U.S.\n\n\u2022 56 percent say a \u201cdecent-paying job\u201d is the most important part of a secure middle-class lifestyle.\n\n\u2022 41 percent say the nation is still in the midst of a housing crisis.\n\n\u2022 21 percent have taken a second job to pay rent or mortgage, while 17 percent have stopped saving for retirement.\n\nSource: A MacArthur Foundation poll of 1,401 U.S. adults conducted April 27-May 5 and released Tuesday.\n\n\u2022 Iambic pentameter, onomatopoeias to jharper@washingtontimes.com; follow her @HarperBulletin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's a fair amount of fuss about the Bilderberg Conference, which gets underway in Austria on Thursday and attracts titillating media coverage, angry protesters and public curiosity about the idea that 140 powerful people from 22 nations are meeting to figure out what the world should do at this alarming juncture.
