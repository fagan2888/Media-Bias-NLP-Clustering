Pat Roberts a boost in his tighter than expected re-election race.\n\nIn the taped telephone calls, sponsored by the The Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, Mr. Wolf, who ran against Mr. Roberts in a hard fought primary, stops short of endorsing the veteran lawmaker.\n\n\u201cI am urging you to vote Republican on Tuesday,\u201d Mr. Wolf says in the call. Do politicians deserve your vote? Maybe not. But you deserve to see Barack Obama cry when we Republicans work together to send Democrats like Harry Reid packing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWant to see Obama tears? Then join me, Dr. Milton Wolf, and vote Republican on Tuesday.\n\nThe latest Real Clear Politics average of polls show that Mr. Roberts is running neck-and-neck with in his race against Independent Greg Orman.\n\nRepublicans need to flip a six seats net to take over the Senate and a loss in Kansas would throw a kink in their plans.\n\nJenny Beth Martin, head of the TPPCF, said that too much is at stake for conservatives to sit on their hands in this election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re honored that Dr. Wolf is helping us send out this appeal; he knows the only way to check the radical Obama agenda is to fire Harry Reid,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cTaking away Harry Reid\u2019s majority and his nuclear option is the first step in working toward personal freedom, economic freedom and a debt-free future,\u201d Martin said.\n\n\u201cWe thank Dr. Wolf for stepping up, and we urge all conservatives in Kansas to follow his lead and vote Republican tomorrow. It\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A national tea party group has started running robo calls in Kansas in which Dr. Milton Wolf urges people to vote Republican \u2014 a move that could give Sen.
