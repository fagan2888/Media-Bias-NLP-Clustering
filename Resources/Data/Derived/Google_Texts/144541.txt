Billionaire Leon G. Cooperman, chairman and chief executive of Omega Advisors, a New York hedge fund, has committed $25 million to St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. N.J.

The gift, timed to the hospital’s 150th anniversary in 2015, will fund a 200,000-square-foot pavilion for patient care, which will include a neonatal intensive care unit. Mr. Cooperman formerly served as chairman of the hospital’s foundation.

The gift follows several Mr. Cooperman and his wife, Toby, have made in recent years, including a gift of $25 million in 2012 to Columbia Business School, his alma mater, to fund buildings at the school’s new Manhattanville Campus in West Harlem.

Another $25 million was given in 2013 to Hunter College, part of the City University of New York. The couple attended Hunter College and became sweethearts while students. The gift, that college’s largest, is to benefit the school’s library and to fund scholarships.

The couple’s family foundation, based in Clifton, N.J., has assets of roughly $200 million.

In 2010, Mr. and Mrs. Cooperman joined the Giving Pledge, a public commitment started by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett in which billionaires agree to dedicate the majority of their wealth to charity.

In an interview last August in advance of the gift to Hunter College, Mr. Cooperman, who grew up in the Bronx and is the son of a plumber, denied that he was on a “giving spree” with his philanthropy.

“I intend to give away more than I make and reduce my wealth,” he said at the time. “The trouble is that there are more worthwhile organizations than I have money.”
