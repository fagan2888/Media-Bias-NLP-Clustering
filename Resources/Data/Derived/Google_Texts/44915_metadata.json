An e-mail is making it\u2019s way around full of tax rate hike announcements for 2015.\n\nThe main problem according to our research partners at PolitiFact, is that it\u2019s a recycled e-mail from 2014, and most of the changes actually took effect in 2013. They gave it a rating of PANTS ON FIRE on the Truth-o-Meter.\n\nHere\u2019s the e-mail text:\n\nReminder for those who forgot or for many that didn\u2019t know\n\nHere is what will happen on January 1, 2015 :\n\n-Top Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35%\n\n-Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6%\n\n-Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2%\n\n-Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28%\n\n-Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6%\n\n-Estate tax went from 0% to 55% Remember this fact:\n\n-These taxes were all passed only with democrat votes, no republicans voted for these taxes.\n\n-These taxes were all passed under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. If you think that it is important that everyone in the U.S. should know this, pass it on. If not, then delete it.\n\nPolitiFact reports most of the numbers are exaggerated. In fact, it gets very few things correct.\n\nAlso factored into the rating, was the political spin at the end of the e-mail.\n\nThe e-mail blames Democrats and Obamacare, saying no Republicans voted for these taxes. PolitiFact says most of the tax hikes stem from another bill passed in 2012. It received support from most senate republicans and some republicans in the house.\n\nFor accurate information, the IRS lists federal tax rates here.\n\nTo read the entire PolitiFact article, click here.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Eileen Cofre", "og": {"image": "http://cdn.winknews.com/wp-content/uploads/taxemailthumb.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.winknews.com/wp-content/uploads/20160525160432/cropped-wink_512x512-270x270.png", "msvalidate.01": "9D96911C753B2042F5BC7FEF6303FB84", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccdf5\"", "article_summary": "WINK News Investigates: Tax Hikes in 2015?\nAn e-mail is making it\u2019s way around full of tax rate hike announcements for 2015.\nPolitiFact says most of the tax hikes stem from another bill passed in 2012.\nThe e-mail blames Democrats and Obamacare, saying no Republicans voted for these taxes.\nHere\u2019s the e-mail text:Reminder for those who forgot or for many that didn\u2019t knowHere is what will happen on January 1, 2015 :-Top Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35%-Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6%-Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2%-Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28%-Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6%-Estate tax went from 0% to 55% Remember this fact:-These taxes were all passed only with democrat votes, no republicans voted for these taxes."}
