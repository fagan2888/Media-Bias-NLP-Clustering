The legislation is a direct response to the measles outbreak that began at Disneyland earlier this year and has since infected some 150 people.\n\nOpponents of the new measure, on the other hand, are all over the place.\n\nThe Guardian reports on anti-vaxxers\u2019 attacks on California state legislators: they\u2019ve \u201cbombarded them with emails and phone calls, heckled them at public meetings, harassed their staff, organized noisy marches and vilified them on social media,\u201d demonstrating the power of a small, but vehemently vocal minority, to control the terms of the debate. It was similar activism, reporter Andrew Gumbel points out, that ultimately defeated efforts to eliminate personal belief exemptions in three other states.\n\nComments made within and outside a health committee meeting in Sacramento Wednesday illustrate the alarmism that\u2019s taken hold of vaccine opponents. One activist told the committee she believed vaccines were responsible for her child\u2019s death, and argued that if the exemption is removed, \u201cinnocent children will be killed.\u201d A protestor outside the meeting told NPR she fears the effect vaccines may have on her child: \u201cI am afraid that her big beautiful blue eyes will not focus on me anymore,\u201d she said, \u201cand she won\u2019t be the kid that she is.\u201d\n\nThe most extreme statement, though, may have come from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who at a Tuesday night film screening compared vaccinations to the Holocaust. \u201cThey get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,\u201d he told a captive audience.\n\nAn immediate frustration with the protestors is how far their accusations diverge from the science, which has found no evidence that vaccines cause autism or are otherwise unsafe.\n\n\u201cThe danger I feel as a policymaker is that when assertions are made in public comment that aren\u2019t fact-based, that\u2019s irresponsible,\u201d state senator Holly Mitchell told the Guardian.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opponents of California's attempt to strengthen vaccine laws have completely abandoned science", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Opponents of California's attempt to strengthen vaccine laws have completely abandoned science", "title": "Anti-vaxxers are waging war on our rights: Here\u2019s what they get backwards about individual choice", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/10/anti_vaxxers_are_waging_war_on_our_rights_heres_what_they_get_backwards_about_individual_choice/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_251541388.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Opponents of California's attempt to strengthen vaccine laws have completely abandoned science", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_251541388.jpg", "title": "Anti-vaxxers are waging war on our rights: Here\u2019s what they get backwards about individual choice", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Anti-vaxxers are waging war on our rights: Here\u2019s what they get backwards about individual choice", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, anti-science, anti-vaxxers, California, measles, vaccines", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf890\"", "article_summary": "Comments made within and outside a health committee meeting in Sacramento Wednesday illustrate the alarmism that\u2019s taken hold of vaccine opponents.\nThe legislation is a direct response to the measles outbreak that began at Disneyland earlier this year and has since infected some 150 people.\n\u201cThe danger I feel as a policymaker is that when assertions are made in public comment that aren\u2019t fact-based, that\u2019s irresponsible,\u201d state senator Holly Mitchell told the Guardian.\nIt was similar activism, reporter Andrew Gumbel points out, that ultimately defeated efforts to eliminate personal belief exemptions in three other states.\nOpponents of the new measure, on the other hand, are all over the place."}
