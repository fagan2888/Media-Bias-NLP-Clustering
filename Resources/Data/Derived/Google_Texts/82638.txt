HD-15: Christiana Endorses Rubio

Written by Chris Calabrese, Contributing Writer

State Representative Jim Christiana has officially endorsed Marco Rubio in the Republican Presidential Primary.

Christiana is the second PA lawmaker in as many days to endorse Rubio, as State Senator Ryan Aument announced yesterday he would also be supporting the Florida Senator. Team Marco Pa. is led by its Chairman Chris Bravacos and Finance Chairman Bob Asher.

“Marco is a once in a generation leader who knows what America needs – a conservative President who will reform government, repeal Obamacare, rebuild our middle class, and steady our resolve to keep us safe,” Christiana said.

“Marco shares my passion for reform and renewal, and I know that as President of the United States he will give our nation the leadership it deserves, both at home and abroad.”

The State Rep. also lauded Rubio for his previous position as Florida Speaker of the House, saying that “Marco Rubio led the fight in Florida to change government and make life better for the people he served.”

With many pundits, and also you the readers, believing that the Pennsylvania GOP primary will matter, it’s important for the candidates to build a base of support among the commonwealth’s lawmakers.

Christiana represents the 15th district in the State House, which covers parts of Beaver and Washington Counties.
