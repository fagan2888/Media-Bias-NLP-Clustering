Lahey recounts that the House Committee on Veterans Affairs condemned doctors' decision to secretly monitor the family of a brain-damaged patient at a Tampa, Fla., VA hospital.\n\nThe debate touched Lahey's own hospital when neonatal intensive care unit nurses suspected parents were abusing their premature child after the baby returned to the emergency room within a week of discharge, according to the piece.\n\nNurses observed the baby only experience breathing problems when he was alone with his mother, never with a nurse. One nurse suggested putting a small camera in the room to try and figure out what was happening, while another nurse worried about betraying patient trust, Lahey explains\n\nHospital administrators decided that if confronting the parents didn't work, they would deem it acceptable to secretly monitor the baby's room to ensure his safety. However, a few days later, the baby's mother confessed to neglect and holding a pillow over her child's face to keep him from going home--no camera necessary.\n\nBut Lahey says hospitals should use hidden cameras as a last resort, making it clear to patients that they use covert monitoring systems only in rare and unusual circumstances, and only with the approval of hospitals' ethics committees.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the opinion piece\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSurveillance cameras help prevent patient falls\n\nCDT: Privacy, security concerns at forefront of telehealth\n\n3 reasons for the demise of patient privacy", "article_metadata": {"description": "Video cameras in hospitals can monitor at-risk patients and ensure doctors take proper safety and sanitary measures--but their use may compromise\u00a0patient privacy,\u00a0according to a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0opinion\u00a0piece.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Video cameras in hospitals can monitor at-risk patients and ensure doctors take proper safety and sanitary measures--but their use may compromise\u00a0patient privacy,\u00a0according to a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0opinion\u00a0piece.", "title": "Do video cameras violate patient privacy?", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/do-video-cameras-violate-patient-privacy/2014-02-18", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center,HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,New York Times,Patient Care & Outcomes,Tim Lahey,video cameras,video surveillance", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6e6\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the opinion pieceRelated Articles:Surveillance cameras help prevent patient fallsCDT: Privacy, security concerns at forefront of telehealth3 reasons for the demise of patient privacy\nVideo cameras in hospitals can monitor at-risk patients and ensure doctors take proper safety and sanitary measures--but their use may compromise patient privacy, according to a New York Times opinion piece.\nHowever, video surveillance remains controversial.\nLahey recounts that the House Committee on Veterans Affairs condemned doctors' decision to secretly monitor the family of a brain-damaged patient at a Tampa, Fla., VA hospital.\nNurses observed the baby only experience breathing problems when he was alone with his mother, never with a nurse."}
