Paul Wieland (R-Hillsboro) won his appeal in his suit aimed at the Affordable Care Act from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Wieland v. Sebelius Monday.\n\nWieland has already spent nearly two years fighting against a clause in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), more commonly known as Obamacare, that requires insurance plans to provide contraceptive and abortive medicines.\n\nAs an employee of the state, Wieland receives health insurance from the Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan, one which must follow federal statutes, including the ACA\u2019s contraception mandate. Wieland, a devout Catholic, considers it an affront to his sincerely held religious belief, and as parents to three daughters, he and his wife consider it an \u201coffensive\u201d rule. Wieland sued, saying he shouldn\u2019t be required by the government to provide contraceptive medicine to his daughters.\n\n\u201cI have to participate in a plan that provides abortion drugs; that is against my religious conscience,\u201d Wieland said. \u201cEven if I didn\u2019t have daughters, it would be offensive against my religion. Everything that I\u2019ve taught you about our faith should be ignored because the government knows better than your dad.\u201d\n\nThe state senator from Jefferson County also noted that this was not a case of him being a \u201cstone age\u201d patriarch.\n\n\u201cMy wife is probably more livid than I am as far as the government trying to tell us how to raise our children,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that for-profit corporations were exempt from laws that their owners objected to based on religious grounds in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, a case that also revolved around contraception medication, Wieland believes that courts now have precedent for individuals to also have the freedom to opt out of that kind of coverage.\n\nWieland first started his case in August 2013, before he was even elected to the senate, but in October of that year, Judge Jean C. Hamilton granted a motion by the defendant for a lack of standing. The team for Kathleen Sebelius, the former Secretary of Health and Human Services, argued the ACA contraceptive mandate only applied to employers, not individuals.\n\nThe win for Wieland yesterday in the Court of Appeals found he did in fact have standing. Now, the case will go back to district court to be decided on merit.\n\nWieland says the case could remain ongoing for years but that both sides will likely attempt to take it all the way to the Supreme Court.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "JEFFERSON CITY, MO. \u2013 State Sen.
