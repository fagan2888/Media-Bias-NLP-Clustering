Last week, the CBO itself felt compelled to offer a lengthy and detailed rebuttal to the spin that millions of Americans will \u201close their jobs\u201d as a result of Obamacare.\n\nSo let\u2019s first be clear about what the CBO report concluded: As a result of the ACA, millions of Americans will choose to work less, if at all. That doesn\u2019t mean that they will \u201close their jobs.\u201d Rather, it means that many will choose to give up working double-shifts just so they can make enough to afford health insurance or leave jobs they hate but have kept simply because they can\u2019t maintain their coverage otherwise. In virtually all cases, these are decisions people are making for themselves and presumably welcome. As the CBO points out, as opposed to \u201closing their jobs,\u201d in which case we\u2019d all feel sad for them, friends and neighbors will invariably feel happy for these individuals.\n\nBut, of course, not everyone. To conservatives, the CBO report demonstrates what they have said about Obamacare \u2013 and about the government dole generally \u2013 all along: It creates \u201cperverse incentives\u201d encouraging people not to work.\n\nThe conservative argument is based on several underlying assumptions, like a DirecTV ad: When you give things to people, they work less. When they work less, they\u2019re worse off. When they\u2019re worse off, they demand more. When they demand more, liberals give them more. And when liberals give them more, society collapses. Don\u2019t have society collapse: Stop the Affordable Care Act.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Obamacare.]\n\nOf course, the CBO report did in fact find that providing this health coverage will induce millions of people to work less or not at all. So let\u2019s look a little more closely at this syllogism.\n\nIt\u2019s undoubtedly true that if you give things to some people, they\u2019ll work less. But it\u2019s not true in all cases. Unfortunately, this sort of assertion is a staple of anti-government rhetoric: For any government expenditure, it can be shown to have enriched some deadbeat or rip-off artist. But so has the derivatives market. Meanwhile, plenty of people work more when you give them more.\n\nIn fact, most conservative policies these days are based on the idea that certain people need to be given more to induce them to work harder and to produce more. Of course, those highly-sensitive individuals are the rich and corporate executives, who, without more money (including from the government) simply wouldn\u2019t keep working and creating. By the same logic, though, we should extend even more benefits to more working people \u2013 perhaps even raise wages at the low end \u2013 to encourage them to work. But for some reason low-income Americans, unlike the wealthy, are presumed to work best if we take incentives and benefits away from them.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the economy.]\n\nMoreover, as the CBO pointed out, there is indeed a \u201cperverse\u201d work disincentive in Obamacare \u2013 but it\u2019s the opposite of what conservatives have taken the report to say. Rather, it\u2019s that, as people\u2019s incomes rise, they get less support \u2013 a \u201ctax,\u201d in effect, on work. And, of course, taxes are bad. So we actually should be less stingy about giving even better health care benefits to even more people.\n\nOf course, we\u2019d need to pay for those expanded benefits, which appears to be the real point of the \u201ccollapse of our culture\u201d argument \u2013 not so much that people won\u2019t work as that people who do work will wind up having to support them. But there\u2019s then an obvious way to pay for these benefits if you want to encourage work: tax unearned income (which accrues, by definition, to nonworkers) at a higher rate than we tax earned income. And if giving people money or benefits for which they didn\u2019t have to work encourages sloth, then we\u2019d best start taxing away all inheritance post-haste, as well.\n\nWe don\u2019t, of course, because that would tax primarily the rich. But most parents want to leave something behind for their children, because we know that getting a leg up is usually the way to climb even higher. Few people throw their kids out of the house with no means of support, on the grounds that that will make them more successful. Nevertheless, many argue that helping other people\u2019s children only cripples them as opposed to, well, helping them.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the budget and deficit.]\n\nIt is incumbent upon liberals to assert not just that children \u201cdeserve\u201d health care or that people \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to\u201d work grueling hours and still not make ends meet. Such assertions are, after all, merely subjective. But if investments in human capital actually improve total productivity, then the only argument against is that \u201cthe poor you always have with you\u201d actually is a commandment, not a condemnation. And various studies (such as this and this) have shown \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 that health care is one of the better bets for boosting productivity and workforce engagement.\n\nAnd productivity, after all, is really the issue. No one longs for the days when people had to toil every waking moment to scrape out subsistence livings, instead of a modern world where a 40-hour work week can enable one to produce more economic value than the greatest medieval monarchs could even dream of. So do we really think it\u2019s good if more and more Americans feel compelled to work 80 hours a week just to make ends meet? Would it mean our economy, or our morals, were headed downhill if more Americans decided they didn\u2019t need to work two shifts every day but could get by, having all they want, on only one?", "article_metadata": {"zone": "eric-schnurer/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "The Conservative Contradictions on Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Just because the CBO says the Affordable Care Act will cause people to work less, it doesn't mean society will collapse.", "title": "Obamacare Won't Cause Society to Collapse", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/eric-schnurer/2014/02/22/the-conservative-contradictions-on-obamacare", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/29/19/c95bfd9a403aa29b3205d771c14f/140204-obamacare-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Just because the CBO says the Affordable Care Act will cause people to work less, it doesn't mean society will collapse.", "card": "summary", "title": "The Conservative Contradictions on Obamacare"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "eric-schnurer", "date_published": "Feb. 22, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Eric Schnurer,health care,Affordable Care Act,politics,economy,employment,picks,health care reform,Congressional Budget Office,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Just because the CBO says the Affordable Care Act will cause people to work less, it doesn't mean society will collapse."}, "article_summary": "So we actually should be less stingy about giving even better health care benefits to even more people.\nTo conservatives, the CBO report demonstrates what they have said about Obamacare \u2013 and about the government dole generally \u2013 all along: It creates \u201cperverse incentives\u201d encouraging people not to work.\nAnd various studies (such as this and this) have shown \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 that health care is one of the better bets for boosting productivity and workforce engagement.\nThe conservative argument is based on several underlying assumptions, like a DirecTV ad: When you give things to people, they work less.\nLast week, the CBO itself felt compelled to offer a lengthy and detailed rebuttal to the spin that millions of Americans will \u201close their jobs\u201d as a result of Obamacare."}
