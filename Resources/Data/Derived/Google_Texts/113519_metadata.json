She is also not a privacy expert. According to her, she is just a mom \u2013 a mom forced to defend the decision to save her daughter\u2019s life.\n\nFei came into the spotlight in February 2014 when Tim Armstrong, AOL\u2019s CEO, sparked an nationwide debate about healthcare and privacy when he told employees that he was cutting their retirement benefits because of Obamacare and costs associated with two \u201cdistressed babies\u201d born to the tech company\u2019s employees. One of those babies was Fei\u2019s.\n\nNow the novelist is telling her story in a new book and hoping to shine a light on the complex and frightening intersection between health, privacy and insurance.\n\nMila was born nearly four months premature in October 2012. Afterward Fei and her husband Peter Goodman, then an editor at AOL, had a hard time connecting with people, Fei said. She spent months living in fear that her daughter, who was on life support, was not going to make it. In addition to worry and fear, there were also shame and guilt. Was she a bad mother? Was this her fault? Did she do something to make this happen? Should she have done something differently?\n\nWhen Armstrong called her daughter \u201ca distressed baby\u201d and \u201cput a price tag on her life\u201d \u2013 $1m to be precise \u2013 he forced Fei to take a step back and say: \u201cWhy have I been judging her and myself so harshly all the time? This is something that happens,\u201d she said.\n\nSitting in her stroller last month as her mother pushed her through Brooklyn\u2019s Prospect Heights, Mila looked anything but distressed. \u201cUPS truck!\u201d she yelled as one of the delivery company\u2019s brown trucks came into view. The brown truck is a familiar sight, often delivering packages ordered by Fei. Her brother Leo, who is three and a half, rode in circles around her and their mom on his scooter.\n\n\u201cThey kind of rule our days,\u201d said Fei, describing Mila as fierce. \u201cEvery day is a blessing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deanna Fei\u2019s book, Girl in Glass. Photograph: Courtesy of Deanna Fei\n\nMila is the main subject of Fei\u2019s forthcoming book Girl in Glass, which tells the story of Mila\u2019s birth and survival. The book, which comes out on 14 July, concentrates on the family\u2019s struggle to save their fragile child and on the enormous challenges people face when their healthcare needs clash with the companies providing them.\n\n\u201cThis feeling is common in American society now, where everyone kind of feels squeezed financially in one way or another. It\u2019s very easy to feel that it\u2019s always a zero sum game,\u201d said Fei. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is for 99% of us \u2013 you know, the not-Tim Armstrongs of the world.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Armstrong made it seem that the company had no other choice than to change its 401(k) retirement plan after care for two premature babies cost company more than it expected in healthcare costs.\n\nIn the early 2014, he said:\n\nTwo things that happened in 2012. We had two AOL-ers that had distressed babies that were born that we paid a million dollars each to make sure those babies were OK in general. And those are the things that add up into our benefits cost. So when we had the final decision about what benefits to cut because of the increased healthcare costs, we made the decision, and I made the decision, to basically change the 401(k) plan.\n\nWhile Fei\u2019s family was not mentioned by name, it was easily identified as there were not many families with premature newborns. That, according to Deborah Peel, constitutes a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. Peel, a physician, is the founder and board member of Patient Privacy Rights, a foundation with a mission to restore patient control over personal health information.\n\n\u201cOf course, it is [a HIPAA violation], because he identifies people from their information. It doesn\u2019t matter if he didn\u2019t use their names. He outed them,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cPeople in the company knew them. Their neighbors maybe knew that they worked for the company. They were immediately outed.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Fei had barely heard of HIPAA.\n\n\u201cThe emotional impact was so foremost to me that the legal aspect of this felt completely irrelevant,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one knows exactly what Armstrong knew, but the fact that he disclosed enough information to make my family immediately identifiable in itself counts as a violation of HIPAA.\u201d\n\nOther privacy experts dispute that Armstrong broke the privacy rules. AOL declined to comment for this story. But after the story went viral Armstrong apologized for the comments and for using specific examples to make his case when speaking with employees.\n\n\u201cI made a mistake and I apologize for my comments last week at the town hall when I mentioned specific healthcare examples in trying to explain our decision making process around our employee benefit programs,\u201d he said in a memo.\n\nWith his lupine good looks and jet black hair Armstrong is the perfect \u201cdesigned for TV villain\u201d, said Peel. What she didn\u2019t say that he is exactly the villain her movement needs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deanna Fei\u2019s daughter, Mila, subject of her forthcoming book. Photograph: Courtesy of Deanna Fei\n\nAfter learning of Fei\u2019s ordeal, Peel decided to reach out to her directly and see if she would be interested in joining her to advocate for patients\u2019 rights. In 2004, Peel started Patient Privacy Rights to lobby on behalf Americans like Fei regarding their privacy and their health records. Increasingly those records, the most intimate people generate, are online and vulnerable to hacking as well as the careless comments of CEOs.\n\n\n\n\u201cI saw her story when the idiot CEO of AOL was stupid enough to take action with the 5,000 employees and tell them he was [changing their 401(k) benefits] because of $2m premature babies,\u201d Peel said. \u201cYou\u2019d think that somebody who runs a technology company would understand privacy, but no.\u201d\n\nWhen she first heard from Peel, Fei\u2019s immediate reaction was: you have the wrong person.\n\n\u201cPrivacy was never on top of my list of priorities,\u201d she said. \u201cI am the kind of person who appreciates when I get an unsolicited reminder from Amazon that I need diapers or Google\u2019s directions to an appointment I made. I appreciate things like that.\u201d\n\nNews about things like overreach in government surveillance make her uneasy but she said her tendency would be to shrug and say: \u201cAs long as I have no plans to threaten the national security, I don\u2019t really have any reason to worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn term of health privacy though, once we start thinking about health and our families, I think it\u2019s very easy to realize that this is the most sensitive personal information about us,\u201d she said.\n\nPutting a human face on the issues of patients\u2019 rights \u2013 which is only now coming to the forefront of the national conversation on privacy \u2013 is key, according to Peel.\n\n\u2018We blame the sick people for being expensive\u2019\n\n\n\nAfter her story was picked up by national media, Fei was bombarded with emails of support and sympathy.\n\n\u201cEveryday I was waking up to dozens and dozens of messages from strangers saying: \u2018Something like this has happened to me and I always stayed silent. Thank you for speaking up\u2019,\u201d Fei said. People who had cancer, difficult pregnancies and other medical conditions reached out to Fei. \u201cThese stories were so heartbreaking to me and I think in the past I might have been tempted to dismiss them.\n\n\u201cNobody knows how often it happens but judging just from my inbox, it\u2019s certainly not a rare occurrence and what struck me as I started to learn about the issue of health privacy is that employees are defenseless against things like this happening to them.\u201d\n\nFei said that she also received her fair share of emails saying: \u201cWhat makes you think your baby was entitled to million dollars worth of care? She should have been left to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a part of me that went: \u2018Maybe her care did cost too much money. Maybe I don\u2019t have a right to complain\u2019,\u201d said Fei. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a callous CEO to feel like: \u2018Wow, a million dollars for a single tiny life seems like a lot of money.\u2019 On the other hand, we have become completely accustomed to hearing of $12m salary for a CEO. That\u2019s completely ordinary.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Armstrong\u2019s pay climbed to $12.1m. His pay package included \u201ca $500,000 cash bonus, stock awards of $2.8m, options of $5.1m and a non-equity incentive plan compensation of $2.8m, in addition to his $1 million salary,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deanna Fei, author of Girl in Glass. Photograph: Peter S Goodman/Bloomsbury\n\n\u201cThis is what we do in the US. We blame the sick people for being expensive, but the same sick people everywhere else \u2013 in the UK \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t be causing excess costs to the system,\u201d said Peel.\n\n\u2018We are talking about real people\u2019\n\nPeel said even she didn\u2019t fully appreciate how much damage privacy intrusions like the one the Fei suffered had on people.\n\n\u201cNot having control over your information really is psychologically and emotionally damaging to human relationships, which we need desperately. All of us. We are built that way. We need love. We need closeness. We need to be able to trust,\u201d Peel said. \u201cThe way that internet works to destroy the kind of boundaries that people need to have relationships, it\u2019s a fucking disaster.\u201d\n\nPeel was shocked at the overwhelming amount of responses Fei had received when her story came to light. Earlier this June, when Fei delivered a keynote during Patient Privacy Rights summit, Peel also did not expect Fei to focus on the emotional aspect of the ordeal \u2013 the feelings of shame and guilt that this kind of exposure created \u2013 but Fei did just that.\n\n\u201cMaybe I should\u2019ve been all over that from the very beginning,\u201d said Peel. \u201cI also have this prejudice against wanting to talk about people\u2019s emotional damage as a result of this technology because that\u2019s a hardest thing for certain kinds of people to see.\u201d\n\nFei is hoping to change that.\n\n\u201cAmong privacy advocates, the discussion can often be quite theoretical,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my hope that in telling my story and bringing light to the stories that people shared with me, I can bring a reminder that we are talking about real people, real trauma, real vulnerability; that this is an issue most ordinary Americans know little about but it still affects them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "After AOL\u2019s CEO told employees he was cutting retirement benefits partly because of the cost of Deanna Fei\u2019s \u2018distressed baby\u2019, the mother fought back", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Jana Kasperkevic", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "After AOL\u2019s CEO told employees he was cutting retirement benefits partly because of the cost of Deanna Fei\u2019s \u2018distressed baby\u2019, the mother fought back", "title": "'We blame the sick for being expensive': the mother whose baby cost AOL $1m", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/04/deanna-fei-aol-distressed-baby-healthcare-privacy", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434390143551/742ae577-aef3-4bc9-981b-d10706f1b2a5-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=2909aa347721263d6831ef8471e846ae", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jul/04/deanna-fei-aol-distressed-baby-healthcare-privacy?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/04/deanna-fei-aol-distressed-baby-healthcare-privacy", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jul/04/deanna-fei-aol-distressed-baby-healthcare-privacy?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@kasperka", "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434390143551/742ae577-aef3-4bc9-981b-d10706f1b2a5-2060x1236.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jul/04/deanna-fei-aol-distressed-baby-healthcare-privacy?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US healthcare,US work & careers,AOL,Health,Healthcare industry,Health insurance,US personal finance,US news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-07-04T11:00:09.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jana-kasperkevic", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T14:07:50.000Z", "tag": "US healthcare,US work & careers,AOL,Health,Healthcare industry,Health insurance,US personal finance,US news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434390143551/742ae577-aef3-4bc9-981b-d10706f1b2a5-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=df7c6bf2c573300b891b3a31266ede94", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US healthcare,US work & careers,AOL,Health,Healthcare industry,Health insurance,US personal finance,US news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17fa\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEvery day is a blessing.\u201dFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deanna Fei\u2019s book, Girl in Glass.\nNow the novelist is telling her story in a new book and hoping to shine a light on the complex and frightening intersection between health, privacy and insurance.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deanna Fei\u2019s daughter, Mila, subject of her forthcoming book.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deanna Fei, author of Girl in Glass.\nDeanna Fei is not a healthcare expert."}
