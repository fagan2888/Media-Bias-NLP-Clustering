Lubbock Mayor Glen Robertson officially launched his congressional campaign with an event Monday morning at the Bayer Museum of Agriculture in Lubbock.

Robertson, who will maintain the office of Mayor of Lubbock while campaigning, unveiled a 10-point plan that he says will help strengthen Texas and the U.S.

The first three points in Robertson’s plan are:

1) Secure the border, ban sanctuary cities, oppose amnesty, and enforce immigration laws.

2) Repeal and replace Obamacare with a free market solution that keeps the government out of our healthcare.

“3) Repeal and replace the tax code with a simpler, fairer tax system that encourages investment and savings.

Another one of Robertson’s campaign points concerns term limits. He feels both U.S. Representatives and Senators should be limited to 12 years in office.

Robertson also announced that he, with personal funds, will match dollar-for-dollar all campaign contributions from individual donors through the March Primary Election. During his announcement, Robertson said he is doing this show that he is not beholden to “special interests”.

KFYO’s Rob Snyder interviewed Robertson after his Monday announcement. You can listen to the interview in the YouTube video below.
