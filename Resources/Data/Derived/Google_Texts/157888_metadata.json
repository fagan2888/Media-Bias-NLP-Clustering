On March 8, in New York federal court, Amarin Pharma reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in a First Amendment case involving restrictions placed on off-label promotion.\n\nSeven months prior to the settlement, the Irish drugmaker scored a landmark victory over the FDA regarding limits on truthful statements about unapproved uses of the pharmaceutical company\u2019s drug Vascepa. With the product approved for some patients with triglycerides, the court ruled that Amarin had the right to make broader statements about potential benefits of the drug in patients with persistently high triglycerides.\n\nIn the settlement, Amarin agreed to stay current on relevant science and to update its promotional materials accordingly. For its part, the FDA agreed \u201cto be bound by the court\u2019s conclusion that Amarin may engage in truthful and nonmisleading speech promoting the off-label use of Vascepa, i.e., to treat patients with persistently high triglycerides.\u201d\n\nThe settlement goes on to stipulate that \u201cAmarin bears the responsibility, going forward, of assuring that its communications to doctors regarding off-label use of Vascepa remain truthful and non-misleading.\u201d\n\nThe FDA did win the right, through 2020, to give advance review to either one or two promotional communications annually for off-label uses of Vascepa. But this could be seen as winning back a small portion of what the agency has lost in the way of oversight.\n\nAccording to the website Law360.com, Amarin\u2019s triumph \u201chas already emboldened other drugmakers. Only one month after the win, Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc. sued over the FDA restrictions on its promotion, and the agency quickly backed down.\u201d\n\nIt appears that the courts are handing the job of industry oversight to the pharmaceutical industry itself. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nSource: law360.com.
