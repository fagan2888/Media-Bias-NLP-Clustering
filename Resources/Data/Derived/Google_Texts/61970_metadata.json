(AP) - John Deere and other farm and heavy equipment manufacturers told the New Hampshire Supreme Court on Thursday that a new state law looping them into protections designed for automobile and truck dealers unconstitutionally interferes with their existing and future contracts with dealers.\n\nLawyers for John Deere and the state faced off over the so-called Auto Dealers Bill of Rights law, which lawmakers expanded to encompass manufacturers of tractors and yard and garden equipment.\n\n\u201cIt protects dealers and, I would argue, it hurts consumers,\u201d attorney Gordon MacDonald, representing John Deere, told the court. Because the law is retroactive, it affects every existing contract the company has with dealers, he said.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Francis Fredericks argued that the new law is a merger of laws that previously dealt separately with automobile manufacturers and farm and tractor manufacturers. The new law bars manufacturers from terminating contracts with dealers without just cause and places the burden on the manufacturers to justify any terminations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the regulation of a relationship,\u201d Fredericks told the justices.\n\n\u201cTermination is the overriding issue,\u201d said attorney Gregory Holmes, arguing in support of the law on behalf of Frost Farm Service of Greenville, an intervener in the case.\n\nMacDonald argues that that undermines the essence of Deere\u2019s contracts with its dealers.\n\n\u201cWe agree with the dealers to sell certain products, where they can sell them and who can sell them,\u201d MacDonald argued, saying provisions of the new law violate constitutional protections.\n\nAttorney Brian Cullen, representing Kubota Tractor Corp., said the law amounts to \u201ca hostile takeover\u201d of the industry.\n\nThomas Collin, a lawyer representing Husqvarna Professional Products, said applying the law to his client is \u201carbitrary and irrational.\u201d He said Husqvarna sells products unconditionally to any dealers that want them.\n\n\u201cWhat happened here is that Husqvarna was taken hostage, essentially,\u201d Collin told justices. He said lawmakers had \u201cno information whatsoever about the relationship between yard and garden manufacturers and their dealers.\u201d\n\nIn court documents, lawyers for Husqvarna claim the law \u201cradically interferes\u201d with the company\u2019s contractual rights and puts up roadblocks to establishing new dealerships.\n\n\u201cIn populous areas of New Hampshire, where Husqvarna has the greatest incentive to establish additional dealerships, notice would need to be given to multiple dealers,\u201d attorney Michael Delaney wrote. \u201cEach could initiate a protest and effectively veto or delay appointment of a new dealership.\u201d\n\nThe bill was signed into law in June 2013 but a judge barred it from taking effect after Deere and others filed suit. A lower court judge ruled in the state\u2019s favor last September, saying the law serves an important public purpose and does not substantially infringe on existing contracts. But the validity of the law remains in limbo until the Supreme Court issues its ruling.\n\nThe justices did not indicate when they would rule.", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Deere and other farm and heavy equipment manufacturers told the New Hampshire Supreme Court on Thursday that a new state law looping them into protections designed for automobile and truck dealers unconstitutionally interferes with their existing and future contracts with dealers.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/10/john-deere-appeals-inclusion-in-auto-dealer-protec/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "John Deere and other farm and heavy equipment manufacturers told the New Hampshire Supreme Court on Thursday that a new state law looping them into protections designed for automobile and truck dealers unconstitutionally interferes with their existing and future contracts with dealers.", "title": "John Deere appeals inclusion in auto dealer protection law"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Deere and other farm and heavy equipment manufacturers told the New Hampshire Supreme Court on Thursday that a new state law looping them into protections designed for automobile and truck dealer", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "John Deere appeals inclusion in auto dealer protection law"}, "Author": "LYNNE TUOHY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf4b3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt protects dealers and, I would argue, it hurts consumers,\u201d attorney Gordon MacDonald, representing John Deere, told the court.\nLawyers for John Deere and the state faced off over the so-called Auto Dealers Bill of Rights law, which lawmakers expanded to encompass manufacturers of tractors and yard and garden equipment.\nThe new law bars manufacturers from terminating contracts with dealers without just cause and places the burden on the manufacturers to justify any terminations.\nBecause the law is retroactive, it affects every existing contract the company has with dealers, he said.\nBut the validity of the law remains in limbo until the Supreme Court issues its ruling."}
