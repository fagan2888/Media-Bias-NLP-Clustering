Twitter users are responding by the thousands in the wake of a mass shooting in Isla Vista, Calif. Friday night by a man who pledged revenge on women who had rejected him.

Suspected slayer Elliot Rodger killed six people before taking his own life. In YouTube videos and a manifesto he detailed a "war on women."

He wrote: All of my suffering on this world has been at the hands of humanity, particularly women, it has made me realize just how brutal and twisted humanity is as a species."

Using the #YesAllWomen hashtag, women – and some men, too – have weighed in with their own stories of sexual harassment, rape, abuse and misogyny.

Below is a compilation of #YesAllWomen tweets from across Middle Tennessee.
