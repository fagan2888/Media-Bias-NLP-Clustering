Why do people react so differently to the same drug?\n\nThe question itself may be something of a fallacy. Cannabis is not a single drug \u2014 it contains dozens of compounds, and they appear to have varying, and sometimes opposing, effects on the brain. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, and cannabidiol, or CBD, have been the subject of some intriguing research. In 2010, researchers showed that pretreating people with a dose of CBD can protect against the less pleasant effects of THC, such as paranoia.\n\nIn a similar 2012 study, participants took pills that contained only one of the two chemicals, rather than the combination that you receive in cannabis. The subjects who took THC pills were more likely to suffer paranoia and delusion than those who took CBD.\n\nThe researchers\u2019 interpretation is that THC may undermine our ability to ignore routine, unimportant stimuli. Ignoring the ordinary is an important skill \u2014 we can\u2019t function if every chirping bird or billboard grabs our attention and refuses to let go. Focusing obsessively on every meaningless detail in the environment may contribute to the paranoia that some pot users experience.\n\nThe differing effects of THC and CBD partially explain why some marijuana strains \u2014 which differ in the ratios and amounts of THC and CBD \u2014 are believed to provide giddy, highs, while others are thought to mellow the user.\n\nThere is probably also a psychological element in addition to the neurochemical explanation. Consider the effects of alcohol: There are mean drunks, loud drunks, amorous drunks, withdrawn drunks, teary drunks and many more kinds. There are no differences in the drug itself so there has to be another explanation.\n\nOne theory is that some people don\u2019t care very much about the consequences of their actions, even when they\u2019re sober. When these people drink, they get aggressive.\n\nSeveral other personality characteristics, such as anxiety levels, have been suggested as explanations for how people behave when intoxicated. Most of these studies are based on laboratory scenarios that don\u2019t mimic well the drinking experiences you get in the wild.\n\nIn a 2010 twin study, researchers attributed one-third of the variation in alcohol-induced aggression levels to genetic factors. The research was based on self-reporting, though, and the ability to estimate our own anger and aggression levels isn\u2019t necessarily consistent from person to person.\n\nAlthough the research hasn\u2019t settled on simple explanations, it\u2019s clear that some combination of personality traits, genetics and experience affects how people respond to intoxicants. You can\u2019t blame it all on the drug.\n\n\u2013 Brian Palmer, Slate", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/07/hfqa01.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc93b\"", "article_summary": "The subjects who took THC pills were more likely to suffer paranoia and delusion than those who took CBD.\nConsider the effects of alcohol: There are mean drunks, loud drunks, amorous drunks, withdrawn drunks, teary drunks and many more kinds.\nIn a 2010 twin study, researchers attributed one-third of the variation in alcohol-induced aggression levels to genetic factors.\nFocusing obsessively on every meaningless detail in the environment may contribute to the paranoia that some pot users experience.\nIn 2010, researchers showed that pretreating people with a dose of CBD can protect against the less pleasant effects of THC, such as paranoia."}
