My predecessors acknowledged this, [the bishops of Latin America] said it, and I too wish to say it. Like Saint John Paul II, I ask that the Church \u2018kneel before God and implore forgiveness for the past and present sins of her sons and daughters.\u2019 I would also say, and here I wish to be quite clear, as was Saint John Paul II: I humbly ask forgiveness, not only for the offenses of the Church herself, but also for crimes committed against the native peoples during the so-called conquest of America.\u201d\n\nThat is a powerful statement, from the Argentine pope, the first Latin American pontiff, and delivered in Bolivia, whose people suffered so much colonial depredation.\n\nBut Francis\u2019 off-the-cuff follow up was just as interesting, and important, given that he will be facing the same issue when he makes his first visit to the U.S. in September. A centerpiece of that five-day trip will be an outdoor Mass of canonization in Washington for the Rev. Junipero Serra, the Spanish Franciscan who helped establish the mission system in 18th-century California.\n\nSerra has long been criticized for personally mistreating indigenous people (a claim many contest) or for being part of the Spanish imperial enterprise that brought devastation and disease to Native Americans, along with the Gospel. They say there is no way Serra should be declared a saint, and there are efforts to have his statue removed from the U.S. Capitol, where it is one of two statues representing the State of California.\n\nDefenders say Serra actually worked to mitigate the excesses of the Spanish forces against the Native Americans, and that he should not be judged by present-day standards.\n\nThat was the point Francis hit in his impromptu additions on Thursday:\n\n\u201cAnd with this request for forgiveness, and to be just, I also would like us to recognize the priests and bishops who strongly opposed the logic of the sword with the strength of the cross. There was sin. There was sin, and in abundance, and for this we ask forgiveness. But there as well where there was sin, where there was abundant sin, grace abounded, through these men who defended the justice of the native peoples.\u201d\n\nWill Americans accept such a nuanced view when it comes to Junipero Serra?\n\nWe don\u2019t do nuance and ambiguity very well these days: religion is seen as all good or wholly terrible.\n\nSimilarly, saints are seen as plaster icons of piety rather than flesh-and-blood Christians who made mistakes as well as pursuing holiness, for themselves and others.\n\nA good part of that blame can be laid at the door of the Catholic Church, whose canonization process has too long focused on elevating the unblemished, or seeking to scrub away any stains that might darken a prospective saint\u2019s image.\n\nFrancis\u2019 approach seems far more realistic, both about sin and saints. But is it what believers want in their saints? And is it simply a different way of explaining away the sins of people like Serra? Does it resolve the question of whether Serra should be made a saint? Can anyone qualify? Heck, Mother Teresa has her vocal critics.\n\nThe Catholic Church is seen as more concerned with elevating its reputation than acknowledging its failings, and that has far too often been true. Yet for decades, especially since John Paul II \u2014 who established a veritable \u201ctheology of apology\u201d \u2014 popes have been making efforts to confess the church\u2019s sins.\n\nThe next step, one Francis is trying to take, is to take notions of sin and sanctity \u2014 and religion itself \u2014 out of the realm of black and white judgments. Those either/or verdicts are a kind of fundamentalism, forcing a blinkered acceptance of everything as good or a puritanical rejection of the whole because it is polluted by one failing or another \u2014 shortcomings that are the very reason for the church\u2019s existence, and the pilgrimage of holiness.\n\nEND GIBSON", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Ethics, Institutions, Opinion, canonization, Catholic, Christian, Junipero Serra, Native Americans", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "Are Americans ready for a nuanced view of the Spanish missionary's history in California -- and his sanctity -- when Pope Francis arrives in the U.S. with the canonization of Serra on his agenda?
