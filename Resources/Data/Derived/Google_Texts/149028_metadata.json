He started a drive, with CSU-Pueblo trailing 7-3, with consecutive runs of 13 and 14 yards.\n\nBut on the championship play, the CSU-Pueblo running back and former Columbine star was merely a decoy.\n\nMcDondle took the snap out of the wildcat formation and handed the ball to his brother, Bernard McDondle. Bernard then flipped the ball to quarterback Chris Bonner, who had lined up on the outside as a receiver.\n\nAll Bonner had to do was loft the ball to tight end Zach Boyd, who didn\u2019t have anyone within 20 yards of him.\n\nTouchdown, CSU-Pueblo.\n\nStill, there was much work to be done for a CSU-Pueblo defense that answered the bell time and time again. West Georgia drove quickly down the field behind the quick feet of quarterback Dallas Dickey, the visitors faced a third-and-4 at the CSU-Pueblo 12-yard line with 4:50 left.\n\nDickey scrambled, then threw for the end zone, where senior Levon Floyd picked the ball off for CSU-Pueblo\u2019s Division II-best 29th interception of the season.\n\nWest Georgia quickly forced a punt \u2014 CSU-Pueblo\u2019s ninth of the game \u2014 and got the ball back at its own 33-yard line with 2:28 left.\n\nAfter West Georgia quickly moved to the CSU-Pueblo 39, linebacker Seth Brown sacked Dickey for an 11-yard loss. Then, Joe Rosenbrock sacked Dickey on the next play.\n\nTwo more desperation passes for West Georgia couldn\u2019t gained back the massive yards lost, and the players flooded the field in celebration of the first trip to a championship in school history.\n\nCSU-Pueblo senior defensive end Darius Allen was often a one-man wrecking crew. In the first half alone, Allen had seven tackles \u2014 three for loss \u2014 and two sacks. When West Georgia moved an extra blocker over to help slow the speedy pass rusher, it opened lanes for others to reach Dickey.\n\nWest Georgia put the clamps on McDondle, who entered the game fourth in the nation with 1,825 yards rushing.\n\nMcDondle gained just 22 yards on nine carries in the first half. He finished with 76 yards, breaking a string of 10 straight 100-yard rushing games.\n\nNick Kosmider: nkosmider@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickkosmider", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU-Pueblo beats West Georgia to advance to Division II national championship", "title": "CSU-Pueblo beats West Georgia to advance to Division II national championship", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/13/csu-pueblo-beats-west-georgia-to-advance-to-division-ii-national-championship/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141213__20141214_CC8_SP14FBCCSUPUEBLOp1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141213__20141214_CC8_SP14FBCCSUPUEBLOp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-13T19:50:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:01:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "After West Georgia quickly moved to the CSU-Pueblo 39, linebacker Seth Brown sacked Dickey for an 11-yard loss.\nWhen West Georgia moved an extra blocker over to help slow the speedy pass rusher, it opened lanes for others to reach Dickey.\nWest Georgia put the clamps on McDondle, who entered the game fourth in the nation with 1,825 yards rushing.\nIn the fourth quarter, CSU-Pueblo running back Cameron McDondle finally started to make cracks in a West Georgia defense that had stonewalled him all day.\nWest Georgia quickly forced a punt \u2014 CSU-Pueblo\u2019s ninth of the game \u2014 and got the ball back at its own 33-yard line with 2:28 left."}
