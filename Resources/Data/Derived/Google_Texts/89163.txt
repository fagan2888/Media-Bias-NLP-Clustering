Four people were displaced from their home by a fire early on Friday, Jan. 1, according to the Northwest Fire District.

Fire crews were dispatched to the fire in the 12200 block of West Moore Road just after 5 a.m.

According to a news release, 22 firefighters brought the fire under control in 45 minutes. A defensive approach was employed because the three women and several of their dogs had already escaped the fire. Three other dogs and several rabbits that were in the home were unaccounted for at the time of this report.

Four people lived in the house, the tree women (aged 87, 68 and 66) and a 16-year-old girl.

The Northwest Fire District's Community Assistance Program and the Southern Arizona chapter of the American Red Cross will assist them with shelter and other needs.

NWFD investigators were unable to access the area of the fire's origin because of significant structure damage and instability, so the official cause of the fire is undetermined. Investigators suspect the use of a portable electric heater as a potential cause.

Damages were estimated at approximately $70,000.
