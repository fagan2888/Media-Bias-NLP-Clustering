What's up with those green rectangles? Why does the bike lane cross the traffic lane sometimes?

Here's a guide to understanding the new markings on the "right-sized" Folsom Street.

STREET MARKINGS

• Green markings

Green is the color approved by the Federal Highway Administration for bike facilities. Green-colored pavement can be used to increase the visibility of the bike lane and identify areas of conflict so that drivers and cyclists pay more attention. Green pavement may be used along the length of a bike lane or as a spot treatment, such as to mark a bike box or intersection crossing.

• Intersection crossing

Dotted green lines at intersections indicate the intended path of cyclists through that intersection. They can also help bicyclists navigate difficult turns.

• Bike box

A bike box, marked by a large green rectangle at an intersection, is a designated area in front of the traffic lane at an intersection with a traffic light. Cyclists can wait there in front of cars during a red light to cross the intersection ahead of cars, which are slower to start. Bike boxes prevent "right-hook" accidents and allow cyclists to clear an intersection as a group to reduce interference with other users. Vehicles cannot turn right on red and must yield to cyclists in the bike box.

INTERSECTION MARKINGS

• Green dashes

Dashed green lines at intersections indicate that right-turning vehicles and cyclists share the right lane. It marks a safe area for the cyclist in the absence of a dedicated bicycle through lane. This is used where there is a relatively low volume of right-turning vehicles.

• Mixing zone

Marked by a green rectangle with a white arrow, a mixing zone is a combined bike lane and vehicle turn lane. It puts the cyclist on the inside portion of a dedicated vehicle turn lane. It gives the cyclist's position legitimacy and clarifies where the cyclist should be in the shared lane. This is used where there is a moderate volume of right-turning vehicles.

• Transition

Where there are a lot of cars making right turns, the bike lane moves from next to the curb into the street, and a green skip marking marks the transition point where cars cross the bike lane into the right turn lane. This increases the visibility of cyclists and cars and reduces "right-hook" crashes.
