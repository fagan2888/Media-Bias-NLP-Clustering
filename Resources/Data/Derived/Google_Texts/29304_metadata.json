Why just recently Paul Krugman at the New York Times denounced the failure of states to back ObamaCare as a Confederate conspiracy.\n\nBut now finally its return can be averted forever by banning Dukes of Hazzard merchandise.\n\nWarner Brothers has stepped in to ban licensing of the General Lee car, which will be renamed the Margaret Sanger and decorated with a rainbow flag. eBay will continue selling Nazi paraphernalia, but the General Lee will be scoured from otherwise legitimate auctions involving stolen merchandise shipped by parcel post from Hong Kong.\n\nEven Walmart will take a break from teaching its workers how to apply for food stamps to clean up the General Lee out of its stores. Meanwhile the Che stuff will remain. And no one is banning Communist signage despite millions dead.\n\nIt's okay to sell stuff with logos from a racist mass murdering political movement that killed millions... as long as it's of the left.\n\nStill now that the Dukes of Hazzard have been banned, surely a new and more tolerant era is upon us. As long as we continue banning things, denouncing our neighbors for having a General Lee lunchbox in their garage and joining cyber-lynch mobs hashtag mobbing people for social media offenses.\n\nThe return of the Confederacy has been stopped.
