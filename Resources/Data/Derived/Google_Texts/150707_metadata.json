It just means that you\u2019re black. And the people who get in trouble are the people who forget they\u2019re black,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cYou can\u2019t just think I\u2019m so successful that I\u2019ve reached another realm. And I\u2019m in a so-called post \u2026\u201d at which point Lee asked the audience for help remembering the term \u2018post-racial\u2019. \u201cYeah, that bullsh*t, where now that we have a black, African-American president that race no longer matters. And there are times, even today, it\u2019s hard for me to catch a cab sometimes. In New York City.\u201d\n\nAsked by Ramos why, in 2014, incidents like the deaths of Garner and Brown by police officers still happening, Lee said, \u201cThere\u2019s a big division for the police departments, I think, in this country, versus people of color.\u201d\n\nAddressing the death of Garner, Lee noted that the chokehold was banned over twenty years ago.\n\nLee said that, after seeing the video of Garner being held and choked to death by police officers, he couldn\u2019t help but notice the similarities to the chokehold that killed the character Radio Raheem (see video below), in his landmark 1989 film, Do The Right Thing.\n\nIn the film, the death of Raheem set off rioting and the destruction of the neighborhood.\n\nWatch the video below from Fusion:\n\nScene from Do the Right Thing uploaded to YouTube by Phillip Branch:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/spikelee-fusion-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Spike Lee: Idea that America is a post-racial society under Obama is \u2018bullsh*t\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c66\"", "article_summary": "And the people who get in trouble are the people who forget they\u2019re black,\u201d Lee explained.\n\u201cThat you\u2019re black.\nIt just means that you\u2019re black.\nAnd I\u2019m in a so-called post \u2026\u201d at which point Lee asked the audience for help remembering the term \u2018post-racial\u2019.\nAsked by Ramos what he tells his children about race in America, Lee replied \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, if you\u2019re African-American in this country, you know know what the deal is.\u201dPrompted to elaborate by Ramos, Lee continued."}
