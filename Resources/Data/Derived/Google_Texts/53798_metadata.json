What I\u2019m about to say next might surprise you: That\u2019s fine.\n\nFive years ago, I might have worried more about the potential for financial trickery or abuse. But now we have a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and it was created for situations like this, to prevent financial operators of all kinds from preying on their customers. In fact, depending on Walmart\u2019s business arrangement on these accounts, they may face increased regulatory scrutiny of their entire business, not just banking.\n\nWalmart has longed to get into financial services for some time. It tried to obtain its own banking license at one point, but then withdrew the idea after resistance from lawmakers and regulators. It already offers money transfers, cashes checks and sells prepaid debit cards. So the checking account just completes the menu.\n\nThe retail giant\u2019s ambition has to do with its low-income customer base. According to the latest statistics from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), more than one in four households have little or no access to traditional banking. As a result, they use alternative financial services like payday loans or check cashing stores, which cost the average family over $2,400 a year in interest and fees, a substantial chunk of their annual income.\n\nRelated: Why So Many Americans Believe the Recession Never Ended\n\nThe high cost of these alternatives means, well, less money to shop at Walmart, so the retailer has incentives to offer a simpler and cheaper product. Walmart wants to gain back customers who have left for low-cost alternatives, and offering banking could entice them. Customers are likely to appreciate a bank account that makes it a little less expensive to be poor. I\u2019d prefer that a non-profit entity like the U.S. Postal Service provided low-cost bank accounts, but while we wait for that, it makes sense to create alternatives, both to save people money and to get them on a path to using stable financial services, which is practically a prerequisite for modern society.\n\nFor this endeavor, Walmart has partnered with Green Dot Bank, best known for its prepaid cards. The new checking product, GoBank, will be sold exclusively at Walmart stores starting next month. After purchasing a $2.95 starter kit, anyone over 18 years old with proper ID can set up a \u201ccheckless\u201d checking account within minutes, without needing to submit a credit report.\n\nThe accounts are FDIC-insured, can be accessed by cell phone, and include mobile check depositing, online bill pay, personal budgeting tools, person-to-person money transfers to other GoBank customers, and a MasterCard debit card that can be used at over 42,000 in-network ATMs to withdraw cash.\n\nMost important for Walmart, the fees are low. GoBank charges no overdraft or minimum balance fees, and an $8.95 monthly membership fee gets waived if customers make $500 in monthly direct deposits. With \u201cfree\u201d checking a thing of the past, GoBank carries some of the lowest prices in the industry.\n\nIt\u2019s not all great. The accounts don\u2019t earn interest. The \u201cearly payroll\u201d feature, which allows customers with direct deposit to start spending their payroll funds up to two days before the money arrives, sounds like a terrible idea from a personal budgeting standpoint. The GoBank account agreement acknowledges that the company \u201cmay share your personal information with service providers.\u201d\n\nIt also states that GoBank \u201crequires all disputes to be resolved by way of binding arbitration,\u201d a growing practice for retail products but one that seems dangerous for a bank account. This limits individual and class action lawsuits for any abusive conduct, instead remanding disputes to an arbitrator handpicked by the bank. One study alleged that corporations win 99.8 percent of all arbitration cases.\n\nThe real fear is that Walmart and Green Dot could lure customers in with the promise of low fees and then gradually change the rules to increase profits. Fortunately, customers would have the CFPB on their side. Since its creation under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, CFPB has been fairly adept at targeting consumer-based financial fraud, returning billions of dollars to those tricked by various schemes. In June, the bureau issued a request for information about mobile banking, so the product Walmart will sell is already in its sights. Regulators there are even studying the impact of mandatory arbitration in financial product agreements.\n\nRelated: Banks Fight Back Against CFPB Complaint Database\n\nCFPB already has the authority to supervise Green Dot\u2019s banking services. However, it can also examine non-bank purveyors of financial services, and depending on the manner in which Walmart makes money from GoBank, that supervision could extend to them. \u201cIf Walmart is involved with the design of the product, getting a share of the profits, etc. it\u2019s a different story,\u201d said Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University.\n\nOfficially, Walmart would not comment on its financial stake in GoBank. However, economic research firm Moebs Services suggested that Walmart would get a cut of the swipe fees triggered when customers use their GoBank debit card. That could certainly make Walmart a third-party \u201cservice provider\u201d under the Consumer Financial Protection Act.\n\nAs Levitin pointed out with respect to Apple\u2019s move into mobile payments through the new Apple Pay service, such a designation would open Walmart up to CFPB examination, as well as the federal statute against \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices,\u201d or UDAAP. Seen as \u201cthe most dangerous weapon in the CFPB\u2019s arsenal,\u201d UDAAP gives CFPB a broad mandate to root out and enforce any manner of practices that harm consumers. What\u2019s more, Levitin explains, under the statute, UDAAP would apply to any of Walmart\u2019s activities, not just banking. States can also enforce under UDAAP, meaning enterprising Attorneys General could investigate Walmart as well.\n\nA Walmart spokesperson told the Washington Post that the company believes compliance with CFPB strictures \u201capplies to its issuer, Green Dot Bank.\u201d And CFPB regulators aren\u2019t tipping their hand either. But the consumer agency has filed a number of enforcement actions under the UDAAP statute, and has said it would reserve the right to do so again on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSo Walmart may want to win over millions of customers with an attractive banking option. But that could come at the cost of putting its whole business model under the spotlight. That\u2019s good for consumers, who for decades got scarce protection from the federal government, particularly on financial services.\n\nElizabeth Warren created the concept of a consumer agency so your bank account would be just as protected from blowing up as your toaster. This kind of security is just what she had in mind.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This week, Walmart rolled out a", "title": "Walmart\u2019s Latest Move into Banking a Controversial Win for Consumers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/09/26/Walmart-s-Checking-Accounts-Controversial-Win-Consumers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12132011_Walmart_bank_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/09/26/Walmart-s-Checking-Accounts-Controversial-Win-Consumers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12132011_Walmart_bank_article.jpg", "creator": "@ddayen", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "This week, Walmart rolled out a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb0d\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s good for consumers, who for decades got scarce protection from the federal government, particularly on financial services.\nElizabeth Warren created the concept of a consumer agency so your bank account would be just as protected from blowing up as your toaster.\nCustomers are likely to appreciate a bank account that makes it a little less expensive to be poor.\nRelated: Banks Fight Back Against CFPB Complaint DatabaseCFPB already has the authority to supervise Green Dot\u2019s banking services.\nWalmart has longed to get into financial services for some time."}
