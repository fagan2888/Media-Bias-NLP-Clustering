The U.S. House’s recent vote to extend the popular Children’s Health Insurance Program was an unusual victory for bipartisanship — and for parents across the country struggling to pay for their kids’ health insurance. The House approved the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 by a vote of 392-37, and if the bill gets through the U.S. Senate, it will secure coverage for 8 million children in low- to moderate-income households for two more years.

Although the outlook for CHIP is sunny, it’s not enough to simply make funding available. I’m willing to bet that many employees at your company don’t even know their kids are eligible to receive coverage through CHIP, and that means they could be missing out on major health care savings.
