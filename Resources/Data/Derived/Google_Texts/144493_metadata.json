Larry Taylor, would prevent both private health insurance plans and federal plans offered through the Affordable Care Act marketplace from providing any coverage for abortion save for cases of medical emergency, such as a threat to the pregnant woman\u2019s life or major physical function. SB 575 explicitly excludes psychological and emotional conditions in its medical emergency guidelines, and also prohibits coverage for \u201ca potential future medical condition that may result from a voluntary act of the woman or minor\u201d \u2014 such as, perhaps, attempting suicide in lieu of being able to terminate a pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThis is not a ban on elective abortions,\u201d Taylor explained in a committee hearing last month. \u201cIn fact, this bill is all about choice.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Texas Tribune, the senator added that the legislation is intended to give Texans a \u201cchoice\u201d as to whether or not they will pay for other people\u2019s abortions via the health plans they buy. The bill doesn\u2019t completely limit all insurance coverage for \u201celective\u201d abortions, and would allow women who do seek to terminate their pregnancies \u2014 including victims of rape or incest \u2014 to purchase supplemental insurance plans to cover the procedure.\n\nAs State Sen. Kirk Watson (D) pointed out in a challenge to Taylor\u2019s bill, the cost of additional insurance could easily make abortion inaccessible for women who face devastating fetal anomalies or, as previously mentioned, became pregnant as the result of rape or incest. (Of course, Taylor\u2019s Texas GOP colleague Matt Schaefer thinks women who face fetal anomalies should have to carry their non-viable pregnancies and deceased fetuses to term, a view he has worked to codify into law this session. So, at least that part is taken care of!)\n\nWatson offered several hypothetical scenarios in which women might find themselves unable to access abortion care as a result of SB 575, which Taylor wrote off as \u201cextreme\u201d \u201cworst-case scenarios.\u201d Watson\u2019s response aptly summarizes some of the most glaring issues with the bill (via Texas Tribune):", "article_metadata": {"description": "State senate approves abortion coverage only for \"medical emergencies\" -- with no exception for rape or incest", "title": "Texas GOP lawmaker pushes to ban insurance coverage for all \u201celective\u201d abortions", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "State senate approves abortion coverage only for \"medical emergencies\" -- with no exception for rape or incest", "title": "Texas GOP lawmaker pushes to ban insurance coverage for all \u201celective\u201d abortions", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/05/texas_gop_lawmaker_pushes_to_ban_insurance_coverage_for_all_elective_abortions/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/AP501965299930-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "State senate approves abortion coverage only for \"medical emergencies\" -- with no exception for rape or incest", "title": "Texas GOP lawmaker pushes to ban insurance coverage for all \u201celective\u201d abortions", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/AP501965299930-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenny Kutner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, abortion coverage, abortion restrictions, Affordable Care Act, antiabortion lawmakers, antiabortion legislation, Conservatives, GOP, insurance coverage, larry taylor, Republicans, Texas", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Alas, that is not the world we live in, and thus I have unsurprising news: On Tuesday, the Texas Senate gave its preliminary approval for SB 575, a bill to eliminate insurance coverage for \u201celective\u201d abortions.\nThe bill doesn\u2019t completely limit all insurance coverage for \u201celective\u201d abortions, and would allow women who do seek to terminate their pregnancies \u2014 including victims of rape or incest \u2014 to purchase supplemental insurance plans to cover the procedure.\n\u201cThis is not a ban on elective abortions,\u201d Taylor explained in a committee hearing last month.\nTopics: Abortion, abortion coverage, abortion restrictions, Affordable Care Act, antiabortion lawmakers, antiabortion legislation, Conservatives, GOP, insurance coverage, larry taylor, Republicans, Texas, Social News, News, Politics NewsWhat a world it would be, if it were even a little bit surprising that the Texas Senate just approved a measure to prohibit health insurance companies from covering abortion in all cases except for medical emergencies.\nSo, at least that part is taken care of!)"}
