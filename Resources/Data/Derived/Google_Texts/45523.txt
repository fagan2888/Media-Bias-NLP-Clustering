The platform will provide Care Everywhere â€“ Epic's EHR-based interoperability network, which will enable Walgreens to connect with other healthcare organizations to securely share a patient's medication list, assist with medication reconciliation and review during clinic visits.

"With our shared focus on interoperability, Walgreens will also become a part of the nation's largest network of care organizations securely sharing patient information with hospitals, laboratories, private practices, federal agencies, local care providers and state HIEs," said Carl Dvorak, Epic president, in a statement.
