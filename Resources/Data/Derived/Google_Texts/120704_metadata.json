Johnson stood in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty and signed a law that few Americans knew or much cared about, then or now. But that law may be one of the most consequential pieces of 20th century legislation, the basis of the modern U.S. immigration system, which has diversified America \u2014 and forced millions into the shadows.\n\nYet in 1965, even President Johnson downplayed the law\u2019s ramifications, remarking that the Immigration Act \u2014 ending discriminatory, country-specific quotas for migrants \u2014 \u201cis not a revolutionary bill. It does not affect the lives of millions. It will not reshape the structure of our daily lives.\u201d Other proponents of the bill agreed, including a young Sen. Ted Kennedy, in his third year in office. Professor Erika Lee, director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota, insists that wasn\u2019t just a put-on: Kennedy and other reformers, including the law\u2019s sponsors, Rep. Emanuel Celler and Sen. Philip Hart, viewed the law as \u201cpretty conservative,\u201d she says.\n\nThey were wrong. Granted, it was merely the first step in a broader agenda to reform immigration laws (the only step that would be enacted), but the law did turn out to be pretty revolutionary all by itself. \u201cI don\u2019t think lawmakers could have predicted just how much immigration would grow in the late 20th century,\u201d after the law passed, Lee tells OZY. And, unexpectedly, it brought in waves of \u201cimmigrants who are quite different both class-wise and in country of origin than previous pre-World War II immigration.\u201d\n\nThe Immigration Act is honored as a great step forward for racial equality, in the same vein as the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAt the time, reformers argued the new law would primarily benefit Southern and Eastern Europeans, important allies in America\u2019s Cold War battle against communism. But it was Asians \u2014 who had been all but banned from migrating to the United States in the first half of the 20th century \u2014 who took the greatest advantage of the open door. The 1920s laws that created the quota system favored Western European immigrants \u2014 mostly Germans and Brits \u2014 and a xenophobic Congress passed laws in the early 20th century that explicitly excluded migrants from Asia. The Immigration Act of 1965 altered the flavor of America\u2019s melting pot, introducing the communities of Filipino-Americans, Korean-Americans, Chinese-Americans and Indian-Americans that are now integral to the country\u2019s social fabric.\n\nToday, the Immigration Act, when it is remembered at all, is honored as a great step forward for racial equality, in the same vein as its more famous \u201960s brethren, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. Backers argued that an immigration system that gave preferential treatment to white Northern Europeans was as archaic as segregated lunch counters. But there\u2019s a darker side to the story. According to Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California Davis Law School and professor of Chicana/o studies, it also contributed to the sharp rise in illegal immigration from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. \u201cFor all of American history, there had been no specific limits on migration numbers for the Western Hemisphere,\u201d explains Johnson, even when the rest of the world faced restrictive quotas. But the 1965 law put a cap on migration from the Western Hemisphere, as well as the Eastern Hemisphere. It also tightened the \u201clabor certification\u201d requirements that low- and medium-skilled workers needed to obtain employment visas. Johnson says congressional records from the time show these were concessions to immigration skeptics, made to get the bill passed.\n\nEven though the rate of legal immigration from Mexico to the United States has grown since the 1960s, Johnson says it hasn\u2019t come close to meeting the surging demand as America\u2019s economy grew, either from migrants or from companies looking to employ migrant labor. And \u201cthe more you\u2019re out of sync with labor demands, the more you\u2019re going to have unlawful migration,\u201d he says. That\u2019s a lesson those involved in the immigration reform debate might want to take to heart. And it\u2019s not the only one.\n\nJohnson says the 1965 law also underscores the need for caution in today\u2019s pro-reform movement as it weighs the inevitable trade-offs attached to any compromise bill. Immigration rights advocates must consider whether \u201cthe positives of immigration reform outweigh the negatives,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard calculus.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The law LBJ signed in 1965 continues to reverberate in today\u2019s polarizing immigration debate.", "author": "Emily Cadei", "og": {"site_name": "OZY", "description": "The law LBJ signed in 1965 continues to reverberate in today's polarizing immigration debate.", "title": "When Lyndon B.
