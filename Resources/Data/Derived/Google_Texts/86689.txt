The Hudson County Schools of Technology’s two high schools are at the top of the class among the county’s high schools, according to rankings by “Inside Jersey” magazine.

High Tech in North Bergen and County Prep in Jersey City were given “A” grades according to the recently updated formula, which takes into consideration four years of standardized test scores.

High Tech saw a 0.4 percent rise during the four-year span, jumping from a score of 347.6 in 2008 to 349 in 2012. County Prep boasted a larger margin of improvement, showing a 4.4 percent increase from 311.5 to 325.2.

According to the magazine, which is a Star-Ledger publication, the grades are based on a “proprietary formula” that uses data from the state Department of Education regarding trends from the preceding four years in both High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA) and SAT scores. The outcomes are sorted into grades of A, B, C and D.

Schools that attained grades of “A” and “B” had higher-than-average test results, while “B” schools showed the most academic progress.

“I am proud of our schools’ placement in these new rankings because they allow us to celebrate the amazing achievements our students accomplish every single day,” said HCST Superintendent Frank Gargiulo.
