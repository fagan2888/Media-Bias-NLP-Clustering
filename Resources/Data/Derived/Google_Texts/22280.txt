A 23-year-old Cañon City man died after being run over twice by a vehicle Saturday, according to the Colorado State Patrol.

Nathaniel Smallwood died at the scene, said CSP Trooper Nate Reid.

The man suspected of running Smallwood over has been identified as Randall Crosby, 23, of Penrose.

Reid said the incident occurred at the intersection of South Fourth Street and West Grand Avenue.

"(Smallwood) exited the vehicle from the right rear and was ran over by the right rear of the vehicle. The driver then reversed the SUV, and he backed over the pedestrian," Reid said. "Then the vehicle fled the scene."

Soon after, the 2003 Ford Explorer rolled a short distance away, he said.

Reid said he doesn't know if Crosby was arrested.

Authorities believe alcohol is a factor in the incident.

The investigation is ongoing, and is being led by CSP, the Fremont County Sheriff's Office and the Cañon City Police Department.
