Like many people interviewed for this article, the executive spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying he did not wish to alienate the federal officials with whom he works. \u201cThe extent of the problems is pretty enormous. At the end of our calls, people say, \u2018It\u2019s awful, just awful.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThose working on the project missed deadlines again and again. One contractor, CGI Federal, got a $94 million deal in December 2011, but the firm couldn\u2019t do its job in designing software code until the spring because government officials took so long getting CGI specifications for the work, according to The Times. That held up everything else, including feature changes and password protection requirements.\n\nThen there\u2019s the overload factor. In what The Times called a highly unusual decision, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services took on the role of \u201cproject quarterback,\u201d \u201cmaking sure each separately designed database and piece of software worked with the others, instead of assigning that task to a lead contractor,\u201d The Times wrote. With the already-understaffed agency charged with overseeing 55 contractors while also running the site, many called its role a \u201cmajor risk\u201d to the entire project, according to The Times.\n\nA Times researcher was able to register at 6 a.m. on Oct. 1, but was unable to log in over the next 11 days, the article said.\n\nAs conservatives watch this train wreck, they wait patiently for more and more Obamacare advocates to see what is right before their eyes. It\u2019s nice for lawmakers who stand firm on their unwillingness to give in to be able to tell the leftist media to read their own news before attacking them.\n\n[poll id=\u201d124\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The man who designed the Obama administration\u2019s new-fangled online health exchange website told industry officials that he had serious misgivings about the debut of his creation. \u201cLet\u2019s just make sure it\u2019s not a third-world experience,\u201d Henry Chao said, according to an Oct. 12 New York Times article.
