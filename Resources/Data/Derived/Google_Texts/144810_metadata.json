The referee quickly signaled that the fight was over, probably several rounds later than many observers anticipated with Wilder a heavy favorite.\n\n\u201cI was really surprised he kept coming and hanging in there,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cA lot of people said he wouldn\u2019t even be around, he wouldn\u2019t last. There were a lot of doubters, but he showed a lot of heart and I needed that kind of guy to fight here in Alabama.\n\n\u201cA lot of people at the fight tonight were first-timers so I wanted to put on a good show. When you have a tough guy with a lot of heart in front of you, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get.\u201d\n\nThe 6-foot-7 Wilder knocked down Molina (23-3) in the fourth and twice again in the fifth, practically running across the ring after him before Molina went down the third time. The Texan withstood barrages to the head in the sixth from Wilder, and then came back strong two rounds later, landing some hard body shots.\n\nBut the fight ended 1:57 into the ninth.\n\nWilder became the first American heavyweight to claim a piece of the title with a Jan. 17 unanimous decision over Bermane Stiverne. That came after Wilder had recorded 32 consecutive knockouts within the first four rounds.\n\nThis one went deep, too, against Molina, whom some oddsmakers had installed as a 50-to-1 underdog. He was trying to become the first Mexican-American heavyweight champion.\n\n\u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t think I had a shot but they had no idea what I was coming with in my heart,\u201d Molina said. \u201cI knew this was my opportunity, and I have no regrets. I left it all in the ring. \u201c\n\nWilder is hoping to fight twice more in 2015, ultimately seeking a matchup with Wladimir Klitschko, who owns the other belts. He proclaimed afterward this title defense will be the \u201cfirst of many.\u201d\n\nWilder, who had surgery on his right hand after the Stiverne fight, delivered some of his best blows with the left hook. He landed 141 of 303 punches (47 percent). Molina connected on about three-quarters of his power punches in his last fight, but was 49 of 188 overall (26 percent) against Wilder.\n\nMore known for his powerful right hand, Wilder knocked Molina down with a left hook in the final seconds of the fourth moments after the crowd began chanting \u201cDeontay.\u201d Molina, who teaches kids with disabilities full-time, said he twisted his left ankle after one of the early knockdowns.\n\nHe didn\u2019t question the referee\u2019s decision to stop the fight, but thought he could have kept going.\n\n\u201cIt was two good shots and I went down, and I was going to keep getting up until he really put me to sleep,\u201d Molina said. \u201cI got up and felt like I was fine, but that\u2019s what they pay the referee to do. He did his job, and I\u2019m fine with that.\u201d\n\nMolina appeared to shake Wilder up momentarily with a right in the third.\n\n\u201cIt was a couple-second buzz and then I came back to the fight,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cIt was a great shot. I definitely wasn\u2019t hurt at any time in the fight.\u201d\n\nThe match about an hour from Wilder\u2019s hometown of Tuscaloosa was his first fight in Alabama since 2012, and the state\u2019s first title fight in any weight class. Not surprisingly, the sellout crowd on the UAB campus was almost exclusively cheering for Wilder, booing Molina whenever he was shown on the video screen before the fight.\n\nDon King, Molina\u2019s 83-year-old promoter, stood in the center of the ring waving a number of flags in the air during the pre-fight introductions.\n\nFour-time heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield, who was born in Atmore, Alabama, was in the arena.\n\nWilder had no complaints about the evening.\n\n\u201cEverything went just like I wanted it to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy with the performance. I\u2019m happy with the crowd. I\u2019m happy with everything.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Deontay Wilder retains WBC heavyweight title with KO of Eric Molina", "title": "Deontay Wilder retains WBC heavyweight title with KO of Eric Molina", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/14/deontay-wilder-retains-wbc-heavyweight-title-with-ko-of-eric-molina/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150614_092949_deontay-wilder.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150614_092949_deontay-wilder.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-14T09:28:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T04:36:46+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2014 Deontay Wilder gave his Alabama fans what they expected in his first WBC heavyweight title defense: a knockout.\nWilder successfully defended his WBC heavyweight title with a ninth-round knockout of Eric Molina on Saturday night at Bartow Arena, a short drive from his hometown.\n\u201cIt was a couple-second buzz and then I came back to the fight,\u201d Wilder said.\nWilder (34-0) delivered a right hand that turned Molina around and sent him falling on his back.\nWilder became the first American heavyweight to claim a piece of the title with a Jan. 17 unanimous decision over Bermane Stiverne."}
