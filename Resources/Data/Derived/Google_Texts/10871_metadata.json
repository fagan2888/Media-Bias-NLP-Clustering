But that doesn't change the fact that police officers routinely risk their lives for the benefit of the community,\" the statement said.\n\n(Reporting by Victoria Cavaliere; Editing by Daniel Wallis; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Victoria Cavaliere", "Author": "Victoria Cavaliere", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "A man who filmed a New York City police officer use a choke hold on a suspect who later died has been arrested on weapons charges, law enforcement officials said on Sunday.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "title": "Man who filmed NYPD choke hold video arrested on weapons charges", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, USA, NEW, YORK, CHOKEHOLD", "DCSext.ChannelList": "domesticNews;everything;treasuryMarkets;Continental;Shell;Verizon;Amtrak;Amtrak2;yahoo3;VerizonMap;echoActivityStream;Boston;AllianzInvestments;HSBC_US;TDAmeritrade;Goldman;everythingButHugin;AXAinsurance;OutloudFeed;UPS;JPMorgan;CFA;sprintxpert2;samsung;Pfizersafe;cfaglobal;merrilledge;PrudentialInvestments;greenpeace;MLGZero;fedex_neg;MLedge;BNY;Intel;intelmicrosite;BNYForesight;PFG", "keywords": "US,USA,NEW,YORK,CHOKEHOLD,United States,New York City,Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions,General News,Tobacco (TRBC),Crime / Law / Justice,New York,Gun Control,Crime", "DCSext.Comments": 1, "DCSext.ContentID_domesticNews": "USKBN0G30V220140803", "description": "A man who filmed a New York City police officer use a choke hold on a suspect who later died has been arrested on weapons charges, law enforcement officials said on Sunday.", "WT.cg_n": "World", "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "domesticNews", "sailthru.date": "2014-08-03T23:40:46+0000", "sailthru.title": "Man who filmed NYPD choke hold video arrested on weapons charges", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Man+who+filmed+NYPD+choke+hold+video+arrested+on+weapons+charges", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKBN0G30V220140803", "WT.cg_s": "U.S", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "news_keywords": "US;USA;NEW;YORK;CHOKEHOLD;United States;New York City;Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions;General News;Tobacco (TRBC);Crime / Law / Justice;New York;Gun Control;Crime", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "DCSext.rAuthor": "Victoria Cavaliere", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "sailthru.description": "A man who filmed a New York City police officer use a choke hold on a suspect who later died has been arrested on weapons charges, law enforcement officials said on Sunday.", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/us/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-domesticNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "A man who filmed a New York City police officer use a choke hold on a suspect who later died has been arrested on weapons charges, law enforcement officials said on Sunday.", "title": "Man who filmed NYPD choke hold video arrested on weapons charges", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-new-york-chokehold-idUSKBN0G30V220140803", "article": {"section": "World", "tag": "US,USA,NEW,YORK,CHOKEHOLD,United States,New York City,Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions,General News,Tobacco (TRBC),Crime / Law / Justice,New York,Gun Control,Crime", "published_time": "2014-08-03T23:40:46+0000", "modified_time": "2014-08-03T23:40:46+0000", "author": "Victoria Cavaliere"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Sun Aug 03 23:40:46 UTC 2014", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd84fb\"", "article_summary": "A man who filmed a New York City police officer use a choke hold on a suspect who later died has been arrested on weapons charges, law enforcement officials said on Sunday.\nThe choke hold is banned by the NYPD, which says it is investigating why the maneuver was used.\nAt some point during his arrest, Orta told officers, \"You're just mad because I filmed your boy,\" an NYPD spokeswoman said.\nGarner later died, and the New York City medical examiner ruled the his death a homicide.\nPolice did not immediately comment on Orta's assertion that he was arrested as retribution for taking the video."}
