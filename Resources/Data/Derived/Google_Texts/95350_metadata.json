The reasons Time listed were spot on:\n\nPro-life laws Public sentiment Pro-abortion generational in-fighting Playing defense (defending the status quo) Science Stigma Aging abortionists\n\nIndeed, abortion advocates have been in an admitted state of panic for quite some time over building pro-life momentum.\n\nBut within the past several days two abortion advocates have separately admitted their side is losing\u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just Hobby Lobby: the pro-life movement is winning\u201d ~Sarah Kliff, formerly of the Washington Post, now senior editor at Vox.com\n\n\u201cTen reasons women are losing while gays keep winning\u201d ~Dr. Jay Michaelson at The Daily Beast.\n\nOther recent abortion articles have hit on the same theme\u2026\n\nHere are 15 reasons why abortion proponents think pro-lifers are crushing them, as lifted from the aforementioned abortion articles. A couple were included in Time\u2019s list, but most are in addition:\n\nObama\u2019s election and reelection prompted pro-life groups to focus on state avenues to pass legislation rather than federal. Due to the Republican wave of 2010, in part in response to Obama\u2019s election in 2008, there has indeed been a huge spike in pro-life laws passed on the state level \u2013 226 since 2011, more than the entire previous three decades combined. The convoluted passage of Obamacare in 2010 was \u201crocket fuel\u201d to the pro-life movement, writes Kliff, quoting Americans United for Life\u2019s Charmaine Yoest, which led to the introduction of some of those bills. A profusion of abortion clinic closures, 81 in 2013 alone, according to Operation Rescue. The number of abortion clinics has decreased by 73% to 759 from a high of 2,176 in 1991. Moves to defund Planned Parenthood. The Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision. The Supreme Court\u2019s buffer zone decision. The abortion lobby\u2019s inability to reframe the debate into one about discrimination. \u201cUnfortunately, even the name \u2018pro-choice\u2019 reinforces that the movement is about acts and not identity,\u201d writes Michaelson. The abortion lobby\u2019s inability to reframe the issue into one all can relate to. The abortion lobby\u2019s shortage of poster children. Sandra Fluke, for instance, was a dud. Their opponents (us!) are \u201csophisticated\u2026 smart and methodical,\u201d according to Michaelson. Even liberals as a political body aren\u2019t united in support of abortion, because as Michaelson admits, \u201cAbortion is a kind of murder.\u201d Ew. No Fortune 500 corporations are lining up to support abortion, as they are with the homosexual lobby, which would bring \u201cmovement dollars and public awareness,\u201d writes Michaelson. \u201cFeminism has an image problem,\u201d writes Michaelson. Religion: \u201cSecular arguments about the separation of church and state may play well to the base,\u201d writes Michaelson. \u201cBut they don\u2019t move the middle.\u201d\n\nIn a nutshell, quoting VanEgeren:\n\nWhether it\u2019s through hundreds of laws passed at the state level or the recent Hobby Lobby decision that allows companies to deny birth control coverage to employees on religious grounds, the pro-life movement is on a winning streak over access to abortions and birth control.

Quoting Sarah Weddington (pictured right), the lawyer who successfully persuaded the Supreme Court in Roe v Wade, speaking at an event on July 12, via KnoxNews.com:\n\n\u201cToday, the young people are so much further (along) than I was at their age,\u201d she said. \u201cThey speak more languages. They go on more trips. They have to show me how to use my iPhone \u2026 but one of the things we haven\u2019t quite managed to do is to give them the same burning motivation to change things that we believe are wrong in the way that we did.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the pro-choice crowd has no rear guard. They killed them.\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Jill Stanek fought to stop \u201clive birth abortions\u201d after witnessing one as an RN at Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn, Illinois. That led to the Born Alive Infants Protection Act legislation, signed by President Bush, that would ensure that proper medical care be given to unborn children who survive botched abortion attempts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "15 Reasons Why the Pro-Life Movement is Winning on Abortion", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of Roe v Wade\u00a0in January 2013,\u00a0Time magazine published\u00a0a surprising and iconic cover story about how the pro-choice s", "title": "15 Reasons Why the Pro-Life Movement is Winning on Abortion", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/07/16/15-reasons-why-the-pro-life-movement-is-winning-on-abortion/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/prolifestudents36-190x126.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "15 reasons why the pro-life movement is winning on abortion", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd93f\"", "article_summary": "Other recent abortion articles have hit on the same theme\u2026Here are 15 reasons why abortion proponents think pro-lifers are crushing them, as lifted from the aforementioned abortion articles.\nThe convoluted passage of Obamacare in 2010 was \u201crocket fuel\u201d to the pro-life movement, writes Kliff, quoting Americans United for Life\u2019s Charmaine Yoest, which led to the introduction of some of those bills.\nEven liberals as a political body aren\u2019t united in support of abortion, because as Michaelson admits, \u201cAbortion is a kind of murder.\u201d Ew.\n\u201cUnfortunately, even the name \u2018pro-choice\u2019 reinforces that the movement is about acts and not identity,\u201d writes Michaelson.\nBut within the past several days two abortion advocates have separately admitted their side is losing\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s not just Hobby Lobby: the pro-life movement is winning\u201d ~Sarah Kliff, formerly of the Washington Post, now senior editor at Vox.com\u201cTen reasons women are losing while gays keep winning\u201d ~Dr."}
