An appeal by the owner\u2019s shortly after was rejected\u2014but the three-person panel of judges granted a motion to stay the case until the Supreme Court made a decision regarding Hobby Lobby.\n\nThe high court\u2019s ruling last week paved the way for places like Eden Foods to refuse paying for birth control services. But unlike Hobby Lobby, who rejected just four types of contraception, Eden Foods is rejecting all of them. Under the Affordable Care Act, companies are required to cover 20 different preventive methods and services, including things like pregnancy counseling and sterilization. If Eden Foods wins their case, they can refuse to pay for all 20.\n\n\u201cEven though the companies before the Court objected to only some forms of contraceptives, the majority opinion\u2019s analysis could be read to apply to all contraceptives,\u201d says Gretchen Borchelt, Senior Counsel for the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\n\nIn a question and answer session shortly after the Hobby Lobby decision, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg confirmed the possibility of companies winning the right to reject all 20. \u201c[T]he Court\u2019s reasoning appears to permit commercial enterprises like Hobby Lobby and Conestoga to exclude from their group health plans all forms of contraceptives.\u201d\n\nWhole Foods responded to the backlash in an email to The Daily Beast:\n\n\u201cWe really do appreciate everyone who has reached out to us to share their feelings about Eden Foods. When reviewing products for our shelves, our primary consideration is whether the product\u2019s ingredients meet our Quality Standards. We recognize and respect that customers may have their own personal criteria for buying or not buying a product, and it\u2019s every shoppers\u2019 right to vote with their dollars on that basis. We hope that if people have feedback for Eden Foods, they share it with them directly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "abbyhaglage"}, "keywords": "Whole Foods, Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., Obamacare, Health", "publicationDate": 201407091935, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/tech-and-health", "description": "A movement is underway to tell the grocer to drop Eden Foods, which seeks to quit covering all birth control and preventative services for its employees.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Hobby Lobby Backlash Hits Whole Foods", "tags": "whole_foods,entity:company/hobby_lobby_stores_inc,Obamacare:Industryterm,topic:lifestyle/health", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Hobby Lobby Backlash Hits Whole Foods\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/09/the-hobby-lobby-backlash-hits-whole-foods.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/07/09/the-hobby-lobby-backlash-hits-whole-foods/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46831341.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/07/09/the-hobby-lobby-backlash-hits-whole-foods\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-09T19:35:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Tech + Health\",\"author\":\"Abby Haglage\",\"tags\":[\"whole_foods\",\"hobby_lobby_stores_inc\",\"Industryterm\",\"health\"]}", "news_keywords": "Whole Foods, Hobby Lobby Stores Inc, Obamacare, Health", "sectionTaxanomies": "tech-and-health", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Abby Haglage", "article": {"section": "health", "published_time": "2014-07-09T19:35:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/abby-haglagehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/07/09/the-hobby-lobby-backlash-hits-whole-foods", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "A movement is underway to tell the grocer to drop Eden Foods, which seeks to quit covering all birth control and preventative services for its employees.", "title": "The Hobby Lobby Backlash Hits Whole Foods", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/09/the-hobby-lobby-backlash-hits-whole-foods.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/07/09/the-hobby-lobby-backlash-hits-whole-foods/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1404940244882.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/a/abby-haglage", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1aa\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhile individual-level boycotting of Eden Foods may not have much of an impact, telling Whole Foods to stop carrying Eden Foods\u2019 products in their stores around the nation should have a much bigger effect,\u201d the letter reads.\nWhole Foods isn\u2019t dropping contraception coverage for employees but nevertheless, it\u2019s facing a Hobby Lobby backlash.\nBut unlike Hobby Lobby, who rejected just four types of contraception, Eden Foods is rejecting all of them.\nWe hope that if people have feedback for Eden Foods, they share it with them directly.\u201d\nIf Eden Foods wins their case, they can refuse to pay for all 20."}
