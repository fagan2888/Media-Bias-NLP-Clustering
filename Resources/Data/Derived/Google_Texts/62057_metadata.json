The display, he said, \"allows millions of visitors the chance to recognize the extraordinary bravery of the men and women who sacrifice so much for this country at home and abroad.\"\n\nThe shirt and coin will join an existing display with a brick from the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the terrorist at the helm of the attacks was killed.\n\nThe uniform shirt, tan with camouflage sleeves and an American flag patch on the right shoulder \u2014 stars forward to invoke the historical role of a flag-bearer leading a charge into battle \u2014 belonged to a now-retired member of SEAL Team Six, which put an end to the long manhunt for the world's most wanted terrorist. The garment \"connects us in a powerful and immediate way to that operation,\" Museum Director Alice Greenwald said.\n\nThe red, white and blue coin was made to commemorate its conclusion. The coin bears the date \u2014 May 1, 2011, in U.S. time \u2014 on one side and a red \"X'' on the other. It was owned by the CIA officer, known as \"Maya,\" who formed the basis for the main character in the Oscar-winning 2012 movie \"Zero Dark Thirty.\"\n\nThe museum is keeping both donors' identities secret.\n\nThe museum, which opened in May and has drawn more than 900,000 visitors so far, has faced controversy over some of its exhibits. Atheists unsuccessfully sued over the \"ground zero cross,\" a beam from the trade center wreckage; Muslim advocates complained that a film about the rise of al-Qaida unfairly linked Islam and terrorism.\n\nGiven the complex reactions bin Laden's death spurred around the world, the new exhibit may \"engender discussion,\" Daniels said, but \"I think most people will believe it belongs there.\"\n\n\"It is a part of the story, whatever you think of its symbolism or its meaning.\"", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/TRAVEL/GENERAL/Museums Exhibits", "dcterms.modified":
