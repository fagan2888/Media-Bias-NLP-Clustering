When Congress passes a gigantic piece of legislation that includes 10,535 pages of federal regulations that will impact American citizens and businesses across the nation, one would hope that all U.S. lawmakers would read them before voting for that bill.

Good luck with that.

Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) was asked by CNSNews.com whether he had read the 10,535 pages of Obamacare regulations, a question he considered to be “propaganda,” and provided a surprising answer.

CNSNews.com has the transcript of the brief interview:

CNSNews.com: “What I was going to ask you is if you’ve read those [10,535 pages] of regulations.” Waxman said: “Have you read them?” CNSNews.com: “No. Have you read them?” Waxman said: “Is it important that I read it?” CNSNews.com: “Do you think that the American people should read it? I just asked you a very honest question. Whether you’ve read them? It’s a yes or no question.” Waxman: “I think it is a propaganda question, and I refuse to talk to you about it.”

While the congressman didn’t flat-out admit that he hasn’t read the regulations, he certainly didn’t suggest that he had.

As the website also correctly notes, the Obamacare regulations, which add up to 10,535 pages in the Federal Register, amount to eight times as many pages as there are in the Gutenberg Bible.
