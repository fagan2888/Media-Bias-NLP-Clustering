Fast-track, which faces broad Democratic opposition, would give Congress an up-or-down vote on any trade deal that reaches Capitol Hill.\n\nCongress last approved three deals in 2011: South Korea, Panama and Colombia.\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and his counterpart in the House, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, have each said the issue is atop their agenda and that they want to complete trade promotion authority early this year.\n\nThe last fast-track bill expired in 2007.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Senate\u2019s top Democrat said he won't consider giving President Obama expanded trade powers until he is convinced that far-reaching trade agreements will help the middle class.", "description": "The Senate\u2019s top Democrat said he won't consider giving President Obama expanded trade powers until he is convinced that far-reaching trade agreements will help the middle class.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Vicki Needham", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Senate\u2019s top Democrat said he won't consider giving President Obama expanded trade powers until he is convinced that far-reaching trade agreements will help the middle class.", "title": "Reid expresses opposition to trade promotion authority", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/230467-reid-expresses-opposition-to-trade-promotion-authority", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-22T18:40:46-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-22T18:40-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/230467-reid-expresses-opposition-to-trade-promotion-authority", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-22T17:30-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Vicki Needham", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "fast-track, Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),Harry Reid,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-22T17:30:14-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-22T18:40:46-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/230467-reid-expresses-opposition-to-trade-promotion-authority", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Senate\u2019s top Democrat said he won't consider giving President Obama expanded trade powers until he is convinced that far-reaching trade agreements will help the middle class.", "card": "summary", "title": "Reid expresses opposition to trade promotion authority"}, "dcterms.title": "Reid expresses opposition to trade promotion authority"}, "article_summary": "Reid has said that the trade agreements of the past have not been good for U.S. workers, a central complaint of many Democrats.\nThe Senate\u2019s top Democrat said he won't consider giving President Obama expanded trade powers until he is convinced that far-reaching trade agreements will help the middle class.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cI\u2019ve always been suspect my entire career in Congress of these trade agreements,\u201d Reid said during his first public appearance on Capitol Hill since an accident sidelined him earlier this month.\n\"I don\u2019t support fast-track because I have not been shown that trade agreements have helped the middle class,\" he told reporters.\nFast-track, which faces broad Democratic opposition, would give Congress an up-or-down vote on any trade deal that reaches Capitol Hill."}
