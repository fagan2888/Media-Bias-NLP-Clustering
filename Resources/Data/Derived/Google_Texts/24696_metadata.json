It\u2019s motivation for me. Not only Adrian Peterson but all those other guys you\u2019ve never heard about coming off an ACL. I did a lot of research, a lot of reading into ACL surgery.\u201d\n\nGiven his own knee surgery, Miller has looked surprisingly strong during the team\u2019s offseason practices. He participates full speed in individual and position drills. He bows out when the team goes through its 11-on-11 set of plays, but continues to work on the side with cornerback Chris Harris, who is also recovering from a torn ACL.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting after it,\u201d Miller said.\n\nEven when he shouldn\u2019t. Apparently, no one has been playing harder during the team\u2019s morning walkthrough sessions than Miller.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been on me for going too hard, and temper it back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut hey this is the only reps I get. Walkthroughs are more for me and hopefully when I get cleared I can start easing my way into live practice.\u201d\n\nMiller said he will be examined in a few weeks by his knee surgeon, Dr. James Andrews. The hope is for Miller to be cleared for limited contact by the first week or two of training camp and be fully ready to play in the Broncos\u2019 season opener Sept. 7 against the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe Broncos have four more offseason practices \u2014 Monday through Thursday next week \u2014 then get a month off until training camp in late-July.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis\n\nUpdated June 12 at 3:59 p.m. The following corrected information has been added to this article: Because of a reporter error, the year Adrian Peterson tore the ACL and MCL left knee was incorrect.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Von Miller looks at Adrian Peterson for motivation after ACL injury", "title": "Von Miller looks at Adrian Peterson for motivation after ACL injury", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/12/von-miller-looks-at-adrian-peterson-for-motivation-after-acl-injury/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140612_013917_von-miller.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140612_013917_von-miller.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-12T13:36:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:03:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9908\"", "article_summary": "No one knows the particulars of the great Adrian Peterson comeback better than Von Miller.\nNot only Adrian Peterson but all those other guys you\u2019ve never heard about coming off an ACL.\nThe following corrected information has been added to this article: Because of a reporter error, the year Adrian Peterson tore the ACL and MCL left knee was incorrect.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at the Adrian Peterson story every single day.\nPeterson, the Minnesota Vikings star running back, tore the ACL and MCL in his left knee in December 2011."}
