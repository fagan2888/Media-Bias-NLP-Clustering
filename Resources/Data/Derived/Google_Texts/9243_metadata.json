Opponents say that society is shifting, and becoming more pro-life.\n\nCharmaine Yoest, the president of Americans United for Life told the AP that the reduced rate reflects \u201ca change in attitudes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an entire generation of women who saw a sonogram as their first baby picture,\u201d Yoest said. \u201cThere\u2019s an increased awareness of the humanity of the baby before it is born.\u201d\n\nAdvocates of abortion, such as Cecile Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, say that making birth control more readily available has reduced the number of abortions.\n\n\u201cBetter access to birth control and sex education are the biggest factors in reducing unintended pregnancies,\u201d Richards told the AP. \u201cMore restrictive abortion laws do not reduce the need for abortions.\u201d\n\nThe AP notes that their report excludes California, Maryland, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Wyoming, where \u201ccomprehensive data\u201d on the number of abortions is not compiled.\n\nSarah Torre, a policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Signal that \u201cwhile there are many possible reasons for declining abortion rates, we cannot discount the pro-life movement\u2019s tireless witness to the truth that has reoriented countless hearts and minds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThousands of pregnancy centers across the country are empowering women with the material and emotional support to make life-affirming choices, many providing a woman the chance to see a sonogram picture of her child \u2013 one of the most persuasive arguments for the humanity of unborn children. And hundreds of commonsense, pro-life laws have been enacted over the past few years that protect women and children,\u201d Torre said.\n\n\u201cWhile the apparent drop in the percentage of abortions is something to cheer, the U.S. abortion rate is still high among other developed nations and our laws remain among the most permissive in the world. The U.S. is currently one of only seven countries \u2013 among them North Korea and China \u2013 in which elective late-term abortions after 20 weeks are allowed. Protecting women and unborn children from such dangerous and gruesome procedures is something the American people overwhelmingly support and our collective conscience demands,\u201d Torre concluded.\n\nThis article has been updated to include Sarah Torre\u2019s quotes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The abortion rate is declining in the U.S.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The abortion rate is declining in the U.S.", "title": "Since 2010, Abortion Rate Has Dropped 12%", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150608_Abortion_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-08T13:39:18+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GlPnNX"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The abortion rate is declining in the U.S.", "title": "Since 2010, Abortion Rate Has Dropped 12%", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150608_Abortion_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-06-08T11:55:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-08T13:39:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Abortion, pro-life, abortion rate, Americans United for Life"}, "article_summary": "According to the AP, the abortion rate has dropped about 12 percent since 2010.\nThe abortion rate is declining in the United States, according to a report by the Associated Press.\nSupporters of abortion say that making contraception readily available has reduced the rate of unexpected pregnancies.\n\u201cWhile the apparent drop in the percentage of abortions is something to cheer, the U.S. abortion rate is still high among other developed nations and our laws remain among the most permissive in the world.\n\u201cBetter access to birth control and sex education are the biggest factors in reducing unintended pregnancies,\u201d Richards told the AP."}
