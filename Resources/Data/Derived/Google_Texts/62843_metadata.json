In the latest installment of what\u2019s becoming a growing movement of so-called \u201cnurse-ins,\u201d several mothers gathered at the store to feed their babies at once, hoping to send a public message that businesses shouldn\u2019t stop women from nursing.\n\nIngrid Wiese-Hesson told local outlets that she was asked to finish feeding her six-week-old in the clothing store\u2019s bathroom, which didn\u2019t have anywhere to sit except for the toilet. She said she felt uncomfortable and judged. \u201cWhen I sat down in the car, I thought, \u2018Is this what it means to be a mom?'\u201d Wiese-Hesson told ABC7.\n\nCalifornia is one of 46 states that protects women\u2019s right to breastfeed in public. Even in places where it\u2019s legal, however, women are often asked to cover up or step inside a bathroom while they\u2019re nursing. \u201cI would never eat a meal in a bathroom, and I would never force a child to,\u201d one of protesters who attended Wedsnesday\u2019s nurse-in pointed out.\n\nThe Anthropologie incident came at an inopportune time for the high-end retailer, which largely caters to women. August is Breastfeeding Awareness Month, intended to highlight the numerous health benefits of breastfeeding children during the first year of their life. Government agencies have been attempting to boost rates of breastfeeding, particularly among low-income and non-white women, and the national rate of women who choose to nurse has been on the rise. Nonetheless, women still come up against the societal assumption that it\u2019s not appropriate to feed their children in public.\n\n\u201cNurse-ins\u201d have become a popular method of pushing back. Just a few days ago, dozens of Oregon moms staged this type of protest at a restaurant where a breastfeeding woman was asked to cover herself up. Earlier this month, a group of mothers in Oklahoma made a statement by breastfeeding together in a public park. A mother who was was asked by a middle school principal to more \u201cdiscretely\u201d feed her baby in the cafeteria responded by staging a nurse-in the next week. There was a nurse-in at an American Airlines terminal last year and in Target stores across the country three years ago. Women in Detroit organized something similar in 2011 after a nursing mother was kicked off a bus.\n\nThis fight has even been taken to the internet, where Facebook and Instagram have repeatedly flagged images of nursing mothers as \u201cgraphic\u201d or \u201cobscene\u201d and removed them from their sites. That\u2019s spurred women to create online groups to share photos of breastfeeding more widely.\n\nProtesters across states all have the same message: Women shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of taking care of their children, and breastfeeding should be normalized as something that isn\u2019t considered to be inappropriate or sexual.\n\nObamacare took some steps forward in this area by requiring all U.S. employers to provide their workers with \u201creasonable break time\u201d to pump breast milk. Under the law, women must have access to a private and sanitary space for that activity. Advocates praised health reform for \u201cbringing breastfeeding out of the bathroom.\u201d\n\nWiese-Hesson says she received a personal apology from Anthropologie about the incident. The store also posted a response on Facebook addressing the issue. \u201cAs a company comprised of hundreds of mothers, which seeks to put the customer first, we celebrate women in all of their life stages,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cGiven our staff\u2019s dedication to providing exceptional customer service, we welcome this as an opportunity to enhance our customer experience by providing further training and education for our staff.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "After a women was told to breastfeed her baby in the store's bathroom, mothers decided to fight back.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "After a women was told to breastfeed her baby in the store's bathroom, mothers decided to fight back.", "title": "California Moms Stage \u2018Nurse-In\u2019 At An Anthropologie Store", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/08/21/3474172/california-moms-nursing-protest/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ingrid-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a women was told to breastfeed her baby in the store's bathroom, mothers decided to fight back.", "title": "California Moms Stage \u2018Nurse-In\u2019 At An Anthropologie Store", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ingrid-2-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ingrid-2.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ingrid-2.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-21T13:18:04+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce846\"", "article_summary": "'\u201d Wiese-Hesson told ABC7.\nHealth California Moms Stage \u2018Nurse-In\u2019 At An Anthropologie Store CREDIT: ABC7 Ingrid Wiese-Hesson, who says she was told by a store manager to nurse her baby in the bathroomIngrid Wiese-Hesson, who says she was told by a store manager to nurse her baby in the bathroom CREDIT: ABC7Several nursing moms staged a protest at a Beverly Hills area Anthropologie store on Wednesday after a shopper says a store manager asked her to breastfeed her child in the bathroom.\nThis fight has even been taken to the internet, where Facebook and Instagram have repeatedly flagged images of nursing mothers as \u201cgraphic\u201d or \u201cobscene\u201d and removed them from their sites.\nThere was a nurse-in at an American Airlines terminal last year and in Target stores across the country three years ago.\nEven in places where it\u2019s legal, however, women are often asked to cover up or step inside a bathroom while they\u2019re nursing."}
