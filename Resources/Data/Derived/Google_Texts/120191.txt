SHAYNNA Blaze has defended the low score she gave Block twins Lysandra and Alisa last night and hit back at accusations from viewers that she is jealous of the twins because they have started up a rival interior design firm.

“I’m a big supporter of women so for them (viewers) to say I’m jealous of them (twins) is laughable,” Blaze says.

“For people to say I’m being mean to the twins is just not true. I judge it from what I see.

“Last year I was battered for giving them favouritism but this year I’m being pounded because I’m the total opposite and jealous of them — which is hilarious.

“It is ridiculous to have that small a bathroom in that size and apartment. If people know what I’ve been doing for 25 years, it is about practicality. These girls have really let slip what a practical bathroom is.”

The feisty twins Alisa and Lysandra threatened to walk off the show in an explosive F-bomb laden rant after receiving harsh feedback on their latest room reveal.

The duo, once labelled the “bathroom queens”, were so furious at being awarded a score of five for their room that they accused the judges of favouritism and said they “should never have come on this show”.

Their controversial bathroom was slammed as “bizarre” and “uncomfortable” by the judges, with Shaynna Blaze adding that it wouldn’t sell their property.

“They’re trying too hard. Sometimes when you try too hard it comes across as try-hard.”” Blaze said.

While Neale Whittaker described it as “bizarre” and he felt “boxed in” and “uncomfortable”.

Added Darren Palmer: “It hasn’t been planned well. That’s something you can’t fix.”

And as the scores 6.5, 5 and 7 were revealed, Alisa only had two words; “that’s bulls***”.

Kyle and Kara received three perfect tens which only added to their fury as they stormed out of the building in tears.

“Any more and I’ll be f***ing walking, I’ll be f***ing walking,” said an enraged Alisa.

“F*** them, F*** them, F*** them, you know F*** them.

“I’m f***ing sick of it, enough is enough, if you’re (producers) going to be like this then we may as well go home.

“Kyle and Kara produced probably the worst room of The Block and they get 6.5, is that really f***ing fair? Is it? It’s not.

“That is not a five bathroom.

“It’s all about fairness and it’s f***ing so obvious what’s happening and it’s not fair.”

Added Lysandra: “It doesn't matter how hard we work to produce anything anymore, it doesn't matter.

“We’re halfway and we’ve been pretty good about it.”

When a producer asked the twins if they were serious about walking off, Alisa replied: “If they keep up this f***ing five bulls**t, then f***ing oath, we’ve got a reputation to uphold.”

As the girls got into their car and drove away one of them was heard saying: “We should never have come on this show. Ever. That’s my biggest regret.”

The comments came after host Scotty Cam questioned the girls commitment to the project, saying they were acting more like Geordie Shore-style reality stars that live in a share house and “party too hard”, than contestants on The Block.

The twins had been out the night before only to confess the next day that they were still drunk, spending more time debating which McMuffin to eat than thinking about their room reveal.

Foreman Keith Schleiger also said the twins were “in trouble at the moment”.

“I think the girls aren’t going 100 per cent,” Schleiger said. “If you take it easy it’s just not going to happen. They’re not winning challenges so they’re low on money.”

But despite the criticism, the girls said they felt they were in with a chance of winning and loved their room.

“It’s simple, nice, understated and we’re happy with it,” they said.

We will just have to try even harder to impress our judges. Fingers crossed we can knock all their socks off next week! #TheBlock — Alisa and Lysandra (@Alisa_Lysandra) March 2, 2014

@Alisa_Lysandra are just being sore losers, cop it on the chin and get over it! Well done @KyalAndKara you deserved to win! #TheBlock — Jordy Simms (@jordanasimmss) March 2, 2014

I agree with the constructive comments for the twins' bathroom but "try hard" is not constructive it's personal and rude. #TheBlock — Sarah Smith (@generic1stname) March 2, 2014

Scotty Cam, great show tonight, logie in the bag mate #TheBlock #ScottyCamRulez — Joel McInnes (@JFlava) March 2, 2014

I feel for the twins. It must be confidence shattering to get such a low score. @Alisa_Lysandra @TheBlock9 #TheBlock #RoomReveal — Momma G (@Oh_Glorious_One) March 2, 2014
