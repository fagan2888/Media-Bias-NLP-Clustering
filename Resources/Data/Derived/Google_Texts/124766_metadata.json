From students triggered by pro-Trump slogans written in chalk to physical altercations about cultural appropriation and hairstyle, political correctness is the destructive and contagious Black Death infesting the progressive left. So, it should come to no one\u2019s surprise that it\u2019s struck Harvard.\n\nFox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly had on Rachel Huebner, staff writer for The Harvard Crimson, who detailed how the PC police are destroying these institutions of learning because the latest batch of college students are coddled, soft, and downright incorrigible. One would think that the faculty or the administration would be the point of the lance in this war of free speech, but it\u2019s not; it\u2019s the students.\n\nHuebner described an incident where a student felt she could not learn, let alone be in the same room, if she knew a classmate was pro-life. Having a view that\u2019s different from your own is very, very offensive in delicate snowflake land. More disconcerting is a separate incident involving Huebner\u2019s friend trying to put an American flag on the wall of his dorm room. He\u2019s a freshman who was unpacking his things, when his roommate stopped him from displaying the flag, considering it an intolerable political statement that \u201che was unwilling to make.\u201d This story drew laughter from Kelly\u2019s crew\u2013and rightfully so.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wow..05/27/2016 10:56:53AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Wow.", "title": "\u2018Cupcake Nation Alert!\u2019 Harvard Students Find Pro-lifers And American Flags Offensive", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/01/cupcake-nation-alert-harvard-students-find-prolife-students-and-american-flags-offensive-at-harvard-n2141926", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/4/1/0.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Wow.", "title": "\u2018Cupcake Nation Alert!\u2019 Harvard Students Find Pro-lifers And American Flags Offensive", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/01/cupcake-nation-alert-harvard-students-find-prolife-students-and-american-flags-offensive-at-harvard-n2141926", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/4/1/0.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "\u2018Cupcake Nation Alert!\u2019 Harvard Students Find Pro-lifers And American Flags Offensive , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "More disconcerting is a separate incident involving Huebner\u2019s friend trying to put an American flag on the wall of his dorm room.\nFox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly had on Rachel Huebner, staff writer for The Harvard Crimson, who detailed how the PC police are destroying these institutions of learning because the latest batch of college students are coddled, soft, and downright incorrigible.\nHaving a view that\u2019s different from your own is very, very offensive in delicate snowflake land.\nFrom students triggered by pro-Trump slogans written in chalk to physical altercations about cultural appropriation and hairstyle, political correctness is the destructive and contagious Black Death infesting the progressive left.\nIdiocy has been running through America\u2019s college campuses like a brush fire."}
