You may not know the face of June Foray, nor even her name. But the voice sure is familiar.

Foray, who’s about to turn 96, has been the voice of Rocky the Flying Squirrel (and his Russian nemesis Natasha Fatale), Hazel the Witch (Bugs Bunny’s broom-flying foil), Cindy Lou Who (The Grinch’s pint-sized conscience) and Granny (Tweety Bird’s protector), not to mention dozens of other characters, in hundreds of theatrical and TV cartoons since 1943.

Last year, Foray won her first Emmy Award – for her work on the Garfield cartoon show. And just a few days ago she was presented with the lifetime achievement Governor’s Award by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.

Foray was my guest on the Movies for Grownups Radio Show shortly after her first Emmy win last year. Not only did she tell me about the time she played a dog on I Love Lucy, but she also let me have a word with everyone’s favorite Flying Squirrel.
