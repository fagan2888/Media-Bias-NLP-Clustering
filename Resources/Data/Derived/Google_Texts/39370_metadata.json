It's kind of common knowledge that grandmas are rockstars, the ones to pick up the slack when parents aren't around or doing the job. Now, a new study states there\u2019s an evolutionary importance to the nurturing nature of grandparents: Since primitive times, they contributed significantly to their families and grandchildren when it came to food.\n\nThe study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, examined indigenous people living in Bolivia in the Amazon, known as the Tsimane people. This community of people rely on hunting, gathering, or cultivating their food \u2014 and actually depend a lot on grandparents in the families to provide them with calories. While parents contributed the highest amount of calories to their families, they were followed by grandfathers and grandmothers, and finally uncles, aunts, and children over the age of 12.\n\n\u201cWe quantified the net flow of calories among individuals in an environment where access to food is limited and depends on people generating it themselves,\u201d Paul Hooper, an anthropologist at Emory University and an author of the study, said in a press release. \u201cThe results support the theory that grandparents are key to our relatively long childhood and long lifespan, which are a big part of what makes us human. Their efforts have likely been underwriting human society for hundreds of thousands of years.\u201d Some evolutionary theories expound that one of the reasons why humans live much longer than other primates is because of the bolstering of resources that grandparents provide their families.\n\nThe researchers worked on gathering data for the study over five years, spending time with 239 Tsimane families from eight different villages \u2014 which are located along the Maniqui River in the Amazon rainforest. Examining their lifestyles and communities gave the researchers insight into how \u201chumans lived before modern industrialization,\u201d Hooper said in the press release. The Tsimane relied primarily on their own cultivated food, including cassava, plantains, rice, and corn \u2014 as well as fish, deer, tapirs, and monkeys.\n\nThe researchers examined the amount of calories each individual consumed on a daily basis, then estimated the number of calories that various family members contributed to the diet. Amazingly, the grandparents were major contributors.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s often easy to overlook the importance of grandparents in a modern, industrialized society, where young people are forced to become competent earlier than in the past. \u201cWhether you\u2019re a hunter-gatherer or an accountant, you\u2019re good at what you do because someone supported you while you developed and learned skills,\u201d Hooper said in the press release. \u201cThe economics of learning are what makes grandparents so important to humans compared to other primates.\u201d\n\nHooper admitted he was inspired by his own maternal grandmother in his research, noting that she influenced his career choice as she earned a biology degree in the 1930s. And perhaps this study is a reminder that we should appreciate our grandparents for their support as we grew up, and even as we became adults; their wisdom and caring made us into who we are today.\n\nSource: Hooper P, Gurven M, Winking J, Kaplan H.
