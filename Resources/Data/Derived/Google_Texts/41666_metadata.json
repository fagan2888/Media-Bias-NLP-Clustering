The tribal payday lending companies Great Plains Lending LLC and Clear Creek Lending LLC were fined $800,000.\n\nThe appeals were filed on Friday in Connecticut Superior Court, The Oklahoman reported (http://bit.ly/15rCIcW ). Based in Red Rock, in Noble County, the Otoe-Missouria tribe has about 3,000 members, mostly in Oklahoma.\n\nIn their appeals, Shotton and the companies contend that tribal sovereignty protects them from having to comply with many state and federal laws on interest rates and disclosures to borrowers.\n\nThe companies are an important part of the Otoe-Missouria\u2019s business portfolio that generate new revenue for the tribe, Heather Payne, a spokeswoman for the tribe, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis revenue is used to provide critical support services for tribal elders, educational programs for our children and funding for tribal members in financial emergencies,\u201d Payne said. \u201cThese entities are also an important source of jobs in northern Oklahoma. We will not allow the state of Connecticut to attack our sovereignty, our community or our most vulnerable members.\u201d\n\nThe Otoe-Missouria Tribe is one of several American Indian tribes that have entered the payday lending business in recent years.\n\nEarlier this month, two online payday lending companies affiliated with the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma settled Federal Trade Commission charges that they broke the law by charging consumers undisclosed and inflated fees by agreeing to pay $21 million as well as waive another $285 million in charges that were assessed but not collected from customers.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission is pursuing similar claims against the online payday lender Red Cedar Services, Inc., affiliated with the Oklahoma-based Modoc Tribe.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Oklahoman, http://www.newsok.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The head of an Oklahoma-based Indian tribe and two Internet payday loan companies it owns are appealing $1.5 million in fines from banking regulators in Connecticut.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/24/oklahoma-tribe-appeals-15-million-in-payday-lendin/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The head of an Oklahoma-based Indian tribe and two Internet payday loan companies it owns are appealing $1.5 million in fines from banking regulators in Connecticut.", "title": "Oklahoma tribe appeals $1.5 million in payday lending fines"}, "twitter": {"description": "The head of an Oklahoma-based Indian tribe and two Internet payday loan companies it owns are appealing $1.5 million in fines from banking regulators in Connecticut.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Oklahoma tribe appeals $1.5 million in payday lending fines"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8fd\"", "article_summary": "The tribal payday lending companies Great Plains Lending LLC and Clear Creek Lending LLC were fined $800,000.\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - The head of an Oklahoma-based Indian tribe and two Internet payday loan companies it owns are appealing $1.5 million in fines from banking regulators in Connecticut.\nBased in Red Rock, in Noble County, the Otoe-Missouria tribe has about 3,000 members, mostly in Oklahoma.\nThe Federal Trade Commission is pursuing similar claims against the online payday lender Red Cedar Services, Inc., affiliated with the Oklahoma-based Modoc Tribe.\nThe Connecticut Department of Banking earlier this month fined Otoe-Missouria Tribal Chairman John Shotton $700,000 for loans to Connecticut residents that allegedly violate caps on interest rates there."}
