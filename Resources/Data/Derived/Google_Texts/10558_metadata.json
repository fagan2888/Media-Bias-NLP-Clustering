Which races this year might surprise us?\n\nEvery election has its surprises \u2014 candidates come out of seeming nowhere to score upsets. Think the stunning loss of Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, in his GOP primary in Virginia.\n\nSo who will the surprise winners be this November?

That (plus Obama\u2019s 38 percent approval rating) gives Udall\u2019s opponent, businessman Allen Weh, a chance to pull an upset \u2014 especially if he pulls money out of his own wallet for last-minute ads.\n\nWhat other races could surprise? Out of a group of about 20 possibilities, I\u2019ve picked three below. The decision was based as much on their possible lessons or significance for the future as on their \u201cwow\u201d factor.\n\n\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nNot a single Republican currently represents any of the six New England states in the House. Marilinda Garcia, a 31-year-old state representative from New Hampshire, aims to change that. She is running a plucky campaign against Democratic freshman Annie Kuster, who is almost twice her age. Kuster won her first term in 2012, 50 to 45 percent, on the strength of Barack Obama\u2019s coattails. Running for reelection, she has decided to hide her liberal voting record. She has declined to hold a single town-hall meeting, agreed to only two debates, and has stored up $1 million in cash for attack ads against Garcia \u2014 almost all of them focused on abortion and social issues.\n\nGarcia, who is pro-life, told me that it is nonetheless frustrating to be outspent 4 to 1 on television over an issue that is involved in less than 2 percent of the roll-call votes that Kuster casts in Congress. \u201cShe wants that to be the entire campaign,\u201d Garcia said, \u201cwhile I travel every day and talk to small-business owners who have to drop health-care coverage due to Obamacare or have to buy a brand-new tractor to comply with a very small EPA regulatory change.\u201d\n\nGarcia, an accomplished harp player who has also earned a master\u2019s degree from Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, would be the freshest face possible for the Republican party. Despite her smaller campaign budget, she is making an impact. Who is ahead pretty much depends on which of two statewide independent polls you give most credence to. The poll run by WMUR-TV and the University of New Hampshire this week has Garcia leading 41 to 37 percent. But the survey published at the same time by New England College gives Kuster a 50\u201338 percent edge. Much of the difference can be explained by different interpretations of just who will actually vote. What is certain is that Kuster\u2019s campaign is suddenly acting as if the race has closed. Her campaign manager sent out a statement this week saying that her lead had been \u201cerased\u201d and that the race was \u201ca pure toss up.\u201d\n\n\n\nHAWAII\n\nHawaii is perhaps the most Democratic of all the states. Barack Obama won 71 percent of the vote there in 2012, and only one Republican serves in the 25-member state senate. But a three-way race for governor presents the GOP with an opportunity. Democrat David Ige defeated unpopular governor Neil Abercrombie in the Democratic primary this year, but he has struggled to separate himself from Abercrombie\u2019s record of tax hikes and service cutbacks.\n\nRepublican Duke Aiona served two terms as lieutenant governor of Hawaii under Linda Lingle, who was only the second Republican ever elected the state\u2019s chief executive since statehood in 1959. Aiona lost to Abercrombie by a 3-to-2 ratio in 2010, but since then his criticisms of state government have gained credibility. The latest RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Ige with 40 percent, Aiona with 38, and 9 going to Mufi Hannemann, a former Honolulu mayor running as an independent.\n\nAiona is certainly a moderate Republican, but he has released compelling position papers spelling out how he would right the state\u2019s financial boat without raising taxes as well as address the state\u2019s burgeoning homeless problem \u2014 the worst in the nation, by some measures.\n\n\n\nNEBRASKA\n\nRepublican Lee Terry was elected to the House from Omaha in 1998 to a seat once held by Howard Buffett, the father of uber-investor Warren Buffett. But Terry won in part on the strength of his pledge to serve only three consecutive terms in Congress. But only five months after winning election, he changed his mind on the term limit, saying he could better serve his constituents without it.\n\nEver since, a sizable chunk of his district\u2019s independent voters have looked at him askance. In 2012, Terry won reelection with only 51 percent of the vote, even as Mitt Romney carried his district with 53 percent.\n\nSince then, Terry has moved leftward in his composite conservative rating by National Journal, falling from 77 percent in 2011 to only 58 percent in 2013. That led him to underperform over a poorly financed GOP challenger in this year\u2019s primary.\n\nAlthough his seat was rated \u201clikely Republican\u201d by various pundits for much of the summer, Terry has seen the gap between him and Democratic state senator Brad Ashford consistently close. An upset may be in the making.\n\n\u2014 John Fund is national-affairs correspondent for NRO.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Fri, 2014-10-10 04:00", "sailthru.author": "John Fund", "description": "Every election has its surprises \u2014 candidates come out of seeming nowhere to score upsets.
