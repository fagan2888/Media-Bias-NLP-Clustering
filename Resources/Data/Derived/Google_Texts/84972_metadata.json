I think others had the same idea,\u201d she said.\n\nTara Jackson was in the supermarket\u2019s liquor section studying the beer selection. The 29-year-old wore orange Sorel boots, pajama bottoms and a Denver D Broncos shirt.\n\n\u201cI think coming here definitely helps settle the nerves,\u201d she said.\n\nAt a nearby Target, Sarah Camp, 29, was checking out a rack full of Bronco\u2019s T-shirts. She and her boyfriend were headed to a party, she said, and he is not a football fan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to buy my boyfriend a shirt because he doesn\u2019t have one,\u201d she said.\n\nIf the Broncos win, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods stores in the area, which normally close at 7 p.m., will reopen immediately following the game to peddle an assortment of Super Bowl championship gear.\n\nA drumline will greet visitors to the chain\u2019s location at the Belmar Center in Lakewood.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver game day jitters lead some to find activities while awaiting Super Bowl 50", "title": "Denver game day jitters lead some to find activities while awaiting Super Bowl 50", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/07/denver-game-day-jitters-lead-some-to-find-activities-while-awaiting-super-bowl-50/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160207_021530_photos.denverpost.com-010515_bronco_fans_52-XL.jpg", "height": 682}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160207_021530_photos.denverpost.com-010515_bronco_fans_52-XL.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-07T14:10:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:12:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Super Bowl 2016"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMaybe they\u2019re trying to wear their kids out by 4:30,\u201d when the Super Bowl begins, the 61-year-old security guard said.\nHistory Colorado offered free admission to anyone wearing orange, and offered some Bronco game day activities for the team\u2019s besotted fans.\nJovanna Toppi, 32, and Kevin Eckenrod, 33, decided to come to the museum, in part to tamp down game day jitters, said Eckenrod.\nThe two usually watch the game with their parents, but this year they got tickets to the big show.\nKristen Myers, 36, planned to join her sister to make some good food and watch the game, she said."}
