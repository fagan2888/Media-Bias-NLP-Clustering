To the Editor:

In his Bookends essay about the reception of James Joyce’s “Ulysses” (June 14), Charles McGrath refers to a “fascinating detail” reported in my recently published biography of James Merrill: that Judge John Woolsey, whose decision cleared “Ulysses” of obscenity charges, had asked Merrill’s father, Charles, for his view of the novel’s obscenity.

Woolsey, I have learned, did not speak with the poet’s father and the co-founder of Merrill Lynch, but with Charles E. Merrill Jr., a small publisher who served on the Literature Committee of the Century Association, where Woolsey went for lunch after the “Ulysses” hearing. For more information, consult Kevin Birmingham’s “The Most Dangerous Book: The Battle for James Joyce’s ‘Ulysses.’ ” At times a headline-grabber like Charlie Merrill gets credit where none is due, while the modest committee man loses the distinction he deserves.

Overcritical Reader

To the Editor:

I have been a reader of the Book Review for many years and have encountered many critical reviews. However, I do not remember reading anything as meanspirited as Leah Price’s review of Alexander McCall Smith’s “Emma: A Modern Retelling” (May 31). Any legitimate criticism she may have had was lost in the snide tone of her remarks. One can only hope that she is more constructive in her assessment of her students.

Poetry Recital

To the Editor:

I wasn’t surprised David McCullough included Billy Collins among the “best contemporary writers” (By the Book, May 31). I had the privilege of meeting McCullough in November 2013. When our talk turned to poetry, his bright eyes took on even more of a twinkle, and he began reciting poetry he had learned as a child with such joy and enthusiasm that I no longer saw an 80-year-old historian, but the 8-year-old who fell in love with language and hasn’t stopped playing with it since.

To the Editor:

Re Vanessa Grigoriadis’s review of Wednesday Martin’s memoir “Primates of Park Avenue” (May 31): How insecure Martin must be to require a Birkin bag as her “sword and shield” for navigating the sidewalks of the Upper East Side. Whenever I wander into the “honeyed and moneyed” precincts west of Lexington Avenue (from my plebeian home eastward) with nothing but my guile and ratty tote bag to fortify me, I somehow manage to secure safe passage.

Art of the Profile

To the Editor:

Calling Joseph Mitchell’s work “nonfiction,” as it is in Blake Bailey’s review of “Man in Profile” (May 24), does a disservice to every journalist trying to get it right. Mitchell’s routine use of what Bailey calls “composites of various New York characters” is by definition fiction. There must be some way to honor Mitchell’s talent without mischaracterizing his work as journalism.

Loving Lovelace

To the Editor:

We are not amused. In what dusty attic at Windsor Castle did you discover a reviewer for Sydney Padua’s “The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage” (June 7), that learned and brilliantly absurdist pictorial romp? I’ve had a copy for weeks and have shown it to several friends who fell all over themselves laughing; it was hard to get it back into my own hands.

No, I am neither a teenage geek nor a steampunk fan — I’m an 81-year-old woman who knows a thing or two about both Lovelace and Babbage. My 87-year-old husband knows nothing about them, or steampunk either, and as I write he is sitting in the living room chuckling as he reads the book and snickering at your review.

An Astonishing Life

To the Editor:

Phillips Verner Bradford, who wrote “Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo” with me, died in 2013. He cannot respond to your review of “Spectacle,” by Pamela Newkirk (June 7), and defend our portrayal of his grandfather, Samuel Phillips Verner, who played an important role in the story.

So I will do it for us both: At no time did we try to shield S. P. Verner from responsibility for bringing African pygmies to the United States, first for display at the St. Louis World’s Fair of 1904, and then, in the case of Ota Benga, for particular exploitation by William Temple Hornaday, director of the Bronx Zoo.

If Newkirk has indeed uncovered new material, that is welcome news to me, as it would have been to my co-author. Ota Benga led, as the subtitle of Newkirk’s book asserts, an “astonishing life.” But nobody owns Ota Benga, neither the racist zookeeper who sought to cage him nor any subsequent authors or artists.
