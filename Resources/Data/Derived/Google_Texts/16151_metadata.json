One teacher in Hong Kong, Ryan Au, was so concerned that his students were starting to smoke, so he set up a demonstration showing the effects of what smoking cigarettes would do to a set of pig lungs. Au is a teacher at Yan Chai Hospital Tung Chi Ying Memorial School in Hong Kong.\n\nThe demonstration shows two sets of healthy pigs\u2019 lungs. Then, one of the lungs is inflated with clean air and the other with smoke that would equal 60 cigarettes. At the end of the experiment, Au cuts open the trachea of both the lungs. What he reveals is that the one without the smoke is perfectly pink and the other smoke-filled one is black and charred in appearance.\n\nOf course, smoking affects the color of lungs, but what\u2019s shocking to see is how quickly this happens only after 60 cigarettes. Many chain smokers smoke about a pack of cigarettes per day \u2014 that\u2019s 20 cigarettes. So over the course of three days, this is how a person\u2019s lungs might look.\n\nAccording to the Action On Smoking & Health, there have been over one billion tobacco-related deaths worldwide, and that number is supposed to increase to 1.6 billion over the next two decades.\n\nDespite efforts of many public health organizations to warn people of the effects of smoking, it\u2019s still a growing and problematic epidemic.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lung cancer, smoking", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "One Hong Kong teacher decided to show his students the effects of smoking using pigs' lungs.", "title": "After Smoking Only About 60 Cigarettes, Your Lungs Probably Look Like This [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/effects-smoking-scientists-demonstrate-incredible-damage-just-60-cigarettes-can-do-your-lungs-284186", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/23/lungs-after-smoking-30-cigs.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One Hong Kong teacher decided to show his students the effects of smoking using pigs' lungs.", "title": "After Smoking Only About 60 Cigarettes, Your Lungs Probably Look Like This [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/effects-smoking-scientists-demonstrate-incredible-damage-just-60-cigarettes-can-do-your-lungs-284186", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/23/lungs-after-smoking-30-cigs.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/23/lungs-after-smoking-30-cigs.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-05-23T12:12:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-23T12:12:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "One Hong Kong teacher decided to show his students the effects of smoking using pigs' lungs."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ba2\"", "article_summary": "Then, one of the lungs is inflated with clean air and the other with smoke that would equal 60 cigarettes.\nOf course, smoking affects the color of lungs, but what\u2019s shocking to see is how quickly this happens only after 60 cigarettes.\nMany chain smokers smoke about a pack of cigarettes per day \u2014 that\u2019s 20 cigarettes.\nBy now, most people know that smoking can cause a number of illnesses, such as lung cancer and heart disease.\nAccording to the Action On Smoking & Health, there have been over one billion tobacco-related deaths worldwide, and that number is supposed to increase to 1.6 billion over the next two decades."}
