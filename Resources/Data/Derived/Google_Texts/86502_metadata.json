Asa Hutchinson\u2019s version, Arkansas Works.\n\nWhat\u2019s all the fuss about? I\u2019ll try to answer your questions.\n\nWhat exactly is the private option?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the background. The Affordable Care Act, which created Obamacare, expanded the number of Americans eligible for Medicaid, the program that pays for medical care for poor people. Americans with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level became eligible. Meanwhile, the act cut the federal government\u2019s reimbursements to hospitals that serve a high number of uninsured patients, who often don\u2019t pay for their own care. The assumption was those people would be on Medicaid.\n\nBut then the Supreme Court ruled that states could choose whether or not to participate in the Medicaid part. Most Republican-leaning states said no, but their hospitals\u2019 reimbursements were still cut. Arkansas in 2013 said, \u201cYes, but.\u201d Instead of putting people on Medicaid, a government program, it used those dollars to purchase private insurance. Republican legislators and Gov. Mike Beebe\u2019s administration created it, and the federal government approved it.\n\nWhat have been the results?\n\nAs of the end of January, 267,590 Arkansans had qualified. A Gallup poll last year found Arkansas\u2019 adult uninsured rate had dropped from 22.5 percent in 2013 to 9.1 percent in 2015 \u2014 the country\u2019s biggest improvement. Hospitals are treating fewer patients who don\u2019t pay.\n\nOther states that turned down the Medicaid money have faced consequences. Rural hospitals have closed. Oklahoma this week proposed cutting what Medicaid pays doctors and hospitals by 25 percent. That\u2019s huge because Medicaid already doesn\u2019t pay much, which is why many doctors won\u2019t treat Medicaid patients. Louisiana, which first said no to Medicaid expansion under a Republican governor, recently elected a Democrat who promised to take the money.\n\nWhat do opponents say?\n\nThe private option as it currently exists would cost $1.63 billion in 2017. Currently, the federal government pays for almost all of it, but next year the state starts picking up 5 percent, which increases to 10 percent by 2020 \u2014 assuming Congress doesn\u2019t change the rules and make the state pay more. So the state will have to find that money.\n\nSome legislators have a major philosophical problem with the private option. They say it\u2019s a health-care entitlement with roots in Obamacare that increases government dependency and adds to the national debt. Those federal dollars aren\u2019t a gift; they come from American taxpayers, current and future.\n\nLast year, Hutchinson convinced legislators to approve the private option through the end of 2016 while the state figured out what to do next. In the meantime, he\u2019s proposed Arkansas Works, which changes the program in a few ways. Beneficiaries with incomes from 100 to 138 percent of the federal poverty level would pay up to 2 percent of their income for insurance premiums \u2014 about $19 a month. Private option recipients would be referred to work and work training opportunities, though they wouldn\u2019t be required to take advantage of them. Hutchinson would like to do more in that area, but the Obama administration won\u2019t let him.\n\nIs it really that different from the private option?\n\nNo.\n\nWhy does the Republican governor support government-funded health care?\n\nHe says he opposed and still opposes Obamacare, but he inherited this situation. If Arkansas does nothing, the private option would go away at the end of this year, and then all those people would lose their health insurance, and hospitals would have to go back to providing all that uncompensated care. Also, losing those federal dollars would blow a $100 million hole in the state budget.\n\nWhat does the next month look like?\n\nLegislators are meeting starting Wednesday in a special session to vote on Arkansas Works and another bill that I don\u2019t have space to describe. Google \u201cmanaged care, Arkansas\u201d if you\u2019re interested. Arkansas Works must pass with a simple majority vote. Then starting April 13, legislators meet in the fiscal session that occurs every even-numbered year. Because Arkansas Works will cost money, it requires a three-fourths vote in both the House and Senate. In other words, 26 representatives or nine senators could kill it.\n\nWhat\u2019s the vote count look like?\n\nHutchinson doesn\u2019t have a three-fourths majority yet in either the House or the Senate. But he\u2019s trying.\n\nWhat will the outcome be?\n\nI don\u2019t know.\n\nSteve Brawner is an independent journalist in Arkansas. Email him at brawnersteve@mac.com.
