There\u2019s something wrong with Thanksgiving.\n\nAs with so many other holidays, we have ruined its original concept with enforced \u201ctraditions\u201d: Macy\u2019s parade, turkey, stuffing and pumpkin pie, televised football. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like all of these traditions, I just don\u2019t know what they have to do with gratitude, or with immigrants thanking locals for helping them survive.\n\nThe secret to relegitimizing the day isn\u2019t the food, or even family. It\u2019s the name. Can we return to actually giving thanks?\n\nTo find a way, I turn to the greatest teachers on gratitude I\u2019ve ever known: dogs. Never unselfish, but habitually giving credit whenever they see it due.\n\nSo, from their pure integrity, here are some canine keys to a true Thanksgiving:\n\n1. Sit in your front doorway and look around. A clever pooch knows this is the best place to relax. He can watch everything going on outside, while poised to jump if any food should drop. And it\u2019s a perfect first stop on the gratitude trail.\n\nWhat sort of home do you have? Do you rent or own? Does the doorway reveal a \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d landscape or a parking lot? Whichever, sit on that threshold and find 20 things you appreciate about your shelter and the astounding world outside it. If you can\u2019t, you\u2019re not looking hard enough.\n\n2. Pretend that everyone in your life didn\u2019t have to be there, or do what they\u2019ve done for you. Then realize that\u2019s the truth. We laugh at the enthusiasm pups show over the simplest things \u2013 their human, a treat or a leash. But only because we take those sights for granted. What if you never assumed the one who\u2019d cared for you would come home? What if you harbored doubts about ever tasting another cookie?\n\nThen look at your present relationships. Your parents, your spouse, your friends, and even your dog. Take a moment to ask what your life would be like with any of them not there, or not caring about you.\n\nScary? Then take it further; focus on your love for them. Feel it till your heart could burst. That appreciation, that pain, is what dogs feel for us all the time. When they\u2019re staring up from the floor, unable to intellectualize their feelings as we do. That\u2019s being alive.\n\n3. Whatever your religious beliefs, pretend you\u2019re wrong. Dogs lack dogma. Their brains aren\u2019t big enough to perceive a rationale for the universe. Dogs are neither theist nor atheist, sectarian nor agnostic.\n\nInstead, they just appreciate. Do any of us honor the sun like a pup who shifts her sleeping to follow the rays? Do we run out after rains to absorb every enhanced scent?\n\nTake a breath, close your eyes, and forget all that you believe about why the world is. And when you free your brain from the \u201cwhy,\u201d let it all roll over you: The enormity of outer space, the miracle of an ant, the luck of our proximity to the sun, the breathtaking complexity of your own body. And just try not to feel grateful.\n\n4. Even if you absolutely, 100 percent, know it\u2019s completely and totally wrong, pretend for just a wee moment that things are actually better today than they were a year ago. And see how many of them you can count. Have we ever been told as often that our world, our leaders, our lives are horrible? News channels screaming, rants on Facebook, forcing us to focus on lousiness. And then all the great people who\u2019ve died, all the pollution, and get a load of what the kids listen to \u2013 it\u2019s just garbage!\n\nBut if we put aside that all these worst-politicians-ever just lie and cheat, maybe we could remember that most of them, most of the time, are trying to do their best, and often get things right.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It doesn't take much to please a dog, and they're not afraid to show it.
