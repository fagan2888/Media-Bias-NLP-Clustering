Among these examples were\u201d\n\nSouth Boston resident Adam Romanow, who answered \u2018No\u2019 to a question asking if he\u2019s currently incarcerated. \u201cIt immediately brought up, \u2018We couldn\u2019t electronically verify your incarceration status. Please submit proof of your incarceration.\u2019\u201d Romanow told the Herald. \u201cIt was crazy \u2026 I\u2019ve never had handcuffs on in my life.\u201d\n\nAnother example was Nancy Wilde, who the paper said lived in a Boston suburb. She clicked \u201cNo\u201d to the incarceration question on the website. She was then asked if she was locked up in a mental hospital or awaiting arraignment.\n\nTwo women posted to the Connector\u2019s Facebook page that the site wouldn\u2019t let them complete their applications because their last names are hyphenated. The Connector suggested one of them call customer service.\n\nThe problems for the North Carolina website are slight different, the state\u2019s top insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield told WNCN-TV in Charlotte. The biggest problem is only one person successfully used Healthcare.gov in the state to enroll in the new exchange, but that lone person hasn\u2019t paid, which means the application is incomplete.\n\nMeanwhile in North Carolina, about 1,000 people filled out applications for the insurance as of Oct. 15.\n\nThe exchanges opened on Oct. 1.\n\nInternal Blue Cross e-mails obtained by WNCN determined the system had too many glitches and opted not to upload data because it was afraid false information might enter its computer system.\n\nThe email shows that a scammer was using the insurers names to obtain personal information, with someone making calls claiming to be with the \u201cNational Health Care Registry\u201d to falsely claim it was taking over healthcare reform contracts from the Blue Cross.\n\nBlue Cross spokesman Lew Borman told WNCN-TV, \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that the issues can be resolved quickly so the Exchange will work seamlessly for our customers.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Some Massachusetts residents found the Obamacare website wouldn't take no for an answer on whether they were prisoners, while North Carolina insurers feared the lax security of the website make their customers prone to fraudsters.
