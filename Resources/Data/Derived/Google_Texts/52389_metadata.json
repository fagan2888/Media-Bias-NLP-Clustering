But when end-of-life conversations with doctors were encouraged by the government back in 2009 during the Obamacare debate, opponents called them \u201cdeath panels,\u201d and the idea became toxic. Some called it \u201cpulling the plug on grandma.\u201d That was then.\n\nLACHLAN FORROW: It is exactly the opposite. It is about grandma controlling the plug.\n\nLYNN SHERR: Dr. Lachlan Forrow, a specialist in ethics and palliative care at Boston\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, is at the forefront of a new national movement to make talking about death public policy. He chaired the expert medical panel that helped lead to new Massachusetts regulations \u2014 the first in the nation, which took effect in December \u2013 mandating that health facilities \u2013 from hospitals to assisted living communities \u2013 tell terminally ill patients their end-of-life options.\n\nLACHLAN FORROW: The full range of the choices. From \u201cKeep me alive, no matter what, as long as medicine can do that,\u201d to \u201cI just want to be home with my family, with hospice,\u201d to anything in between or any sequence. We are just starting to emerge, so that politicians and others realize this is not the third rail of politics.\n\nLYNN SHERR: Since this story first aired, a major development. Last month \u2014 six years after the original Obamacare end-of-life proposal was dropped \u2014 Medicare announced plans to reimburse doctors for having those conversations with patients. Supporters call it a major victory, and hope the decision will spur more private insurers to pay for the talks, too. Among the critical first steps: signing an advance directive and a health care proxy, so someone you trust can legally make decisions if you\u2019re incapacitated.\n\nLYNN SHERR: The Medicare plan will likely take effect in January. But holding such private conversations in the public arena may require a new approach, as advocates in Massachusetts have learned.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Sometimes people think you talk about dying and you let it into the room.\n\nLYNN SHERR: Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Ellen Goodman is on a mission to make death part of popular conversation. For more than 35 years, she chronicled American social change in her widely syndicated columns for the Boston Globe. She wrote about the values instilled in her as a child, by her father, who helped run John F Kennedy\u2019s first Senate campaign, and her homemaker mother, Edith. But Goodman only realized the consequences of leaving certain things unsaid about a dozen years ago, when her mother\u2019s health started to fail.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: I think we all have this fantasy that we\u2019re gonna live to 90 and then, Kaboom! You know? But in fact the reality is that many of us will face a long period of being frail and declining. And I would say that my mother began to decline somewhere in her 80s, really.\n\nLYNN SHERR: After her mother moved to a long-term care facility a few miles away, Goodman found herself making medical decisions she hadn\u2019t dreamed of, especially because Edith began to suffer from dementia.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: My mother could really no longer decide what she wanted for lunch, let alone what she wanted for health care decisions. So, I was faced with a kind of cascading number of decisions, for which I was unprepared. In fact, blindsided.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: And I remember particularly one day when I got a call on the phone and I was on deadline. And the doctor said to me, \u201cYour mother has another bout of pneumonia. Do you want her to have antibiotics?\u201d\n\nAnd I remember my hands being poised over the keyboard, saying, \u201cWhat is he asking me? Is he asking me do I want her to live or die? You know, can I call you back? Could I have a minute?\u201d And so, it was quite shocking to me that those decisions fell to me. I\u2019d just never thought about it before.\n\nLYNN SHERR: What you\u2019re saying is, you never talked to her about these things ahead of time?\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Well, we didn\u2019t talk in a way that was useful. From time to time if we were together my mother would say, \u201cI never want to be like that. Pull the plug.\u201d You know. A lot of people say that. Well, there\u2019s generally no plug to pull.\n\nLYNN SHERR: Edith Holtz died at 92 in 2006. Four years later, Goodman co-founded The Conversation Project, a non-profit to urge people to express their end-of-life desires \u2014 to have The Conversation with those close to them \u2014 early on, before it\u2019s too late. Advised by a group of healthcare professionals (including Dr. Forrow), its website has attracted almost a quarter million visitors; more than half have downloaded the Starter Kit, a kind of security blanket to jump start the process.\n\nLYNN SHERR: When you download the Kit, you\u2019ll find plenty of useful and practical advice on how to get an otherwise uncomfortable discussion going. For openers, you are asked to complete the following sentence: \u201cWhat matters to me at the end of life is\u2026\u201d You\u2019re also invited to consider when you want to have The Conversation, with whom, and where. And there are suggestions of the actual words you can use to break the ice. For instance, \u201cI need to think about the future, will you help me?\u201d\n\nCHUCK KOPLIK: We talked about nursing homes and you know, living at home. We talked about pain management. We talked about all kinds of issues that we wouldn\u2019t otherwise have ever talk about, until the time was upon us.\n\nLYNN SHERR: Husband and wife Chuck Koplik and Sue Tafler of Lexington, Massachusetts, recently had The Conversation with their only child, Sarah Yukich. Inspired by a workshop on The Conversation Project at their synagogue, Chuck and Sue \u2014 in their 60s, and in good health (except for recent surgery on Sue\u2019s foot) \u2014 sat down here, in their living room. They were most concerned about the effect on Sarah.\n\nSUE TAFLER: I could just tell I was unsettling her. So that was difficult.\n\nSARAH YUKICH: I\u2019m 32. I have a two-year-old. I\u2019m an adult, and I know that, but at the same time interacting with my parents, I\u2019m their child. I\u2019m not their caretaker. And trying to think about that eventual role reversal is very scary.\n\nLYNN SHERR: So when they suggested having the conversation, your first reaction was\u2026\n\nSARAH YUKICH: I was happy that they were suggesting it. Because it\u2019s something that I have wanted to talk to them about. But I didn\u2019t really have any idea of how to bring it up.\n\nLYNN SHERR: Sarah says she was especially relieved when they said that moving them to Maryland, where she lives, for long-term care, would be acceptable.\n\nSARAH YUKICH: It was like, \u2018Oh, OK.\u201d So now I don\u2019t have to be sort of holding that inside, but not really knowing how to bring it up.\u201d\n\nLYNN SHERR: Was this about gaining control over the end of your life?\n\nSUE TAFLER: Yeah, I\u2019m very much a planner and manager. I think in some ways it kind of gives me a little bit of a sense of control.\n\nCHUCK KOPLIK: Yeah, my biggest fears would be that you know, that I\u2019d be in pain, or maybe I wasn\u2019t so clearheaded, and the doctors would be making decisions on what my treatment would be. And then they\u2019d be making the decisions.\n\nLYNN SHERR: Individuals\u2013 not medical staff \u2014 should determine those issues, says The Conversation Project. According to a survey the group conducted, more than 90% of people agree, saying they should have The Conversation. But only 30% have done so. Which is why they\u2019re expanding their public engagement campaign. Goodman herself, who used to cover social change and its influence on our institutions, now makes it happen.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Let me show you statistics. 70% of Americans say they want to die at home, and 70% of Americans are dying in hospitals and institutions\u2026\n\nLYNN SHERR: They\u2019re co-sponsoring \u201cDeath over Dinner\u201d parties\u2014social gatherings to approach the subject in a cozy setting, so people can break bread while breaking the taboo\u2026\n\nDR. IRA BYOCK: Thank you all for being here\u2026\n\nLYNN SHERR: They\u2019ve also had some luck convincing TV writers to include family conversations about death in their scripts\u2026\n\n\u201cIt was a decision we made together.\u201d\n\nLYNN SHERR: It\u2019s all about making the subject safe, bringing it home, because, The Conversation Project says, nothing will change until people start talking about it.\n\nLYNN SHERR: You have kids. You have grandkids. You have a husband. Have you had the conversation?\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Oh yes, I\u2019ve had it. My daughter\u2019s a comedian, and her first response when I said, \u201cLet\u2019s have this conversation,\u201d was, \u201cCan\u2019t we have lunch?\u201d But we did get through it. We did talk about it. And I have talked about it with my husband and with most of the people in my family.\n\nPeople, when they have these conversations with each other, describe them as some of the richest personal moments they\u2019ve had with people they love. Someone described having the conversation to us as a gift. It\u2019s a gift you give your family.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A national movement to normalize end-of-life discussions among family and friends is on the rise.
