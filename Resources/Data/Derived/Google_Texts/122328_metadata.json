According to the Gallup polling organization, support for stricter gun laws hit 58 percent in the following days \u2014 the highest since 2004.\n\nHowever, that passion cooled. A poll last month from Gallup found that just 1 percent of Americans say gun control is the most important non-economic issue.\n\nPublic opinion hasn\u2019t stopped gun groups on both sides from spending, though, as the chart shows.\n\n[Article continues after chart.]\n\nSome details on the groups and their spending:\n\nNational Rifle Association\n\nSo far, the National Rifle Association, the largest and best-known defender of the Second Amendment, has spent more than $19 million in congressional races, according to campaign finance records compiled by Open Secrets, a nonpartisan organization that tracks money in politics.\n\nAmong candidates it supports, the NRA has devoted the most money \u2014 $2.8 million \u2014 to Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who currently leads in his Senate race with incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor.\n\nAmong those it opposes, the NRA devoted more than $2.4 million to defeat Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, who is neck-and-neck in Iowa\u2019s Senate race with Republican challenger Joni Ernst.\n\nAmericans for Responsible Solutions\n\nThe well-established NRA, however, has far outspent Americans for Responsible Solutions, the gun control group created by Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was seriously wounded in a shooting spree while meeting with constituents at a shopping center near Tucson in January 2011.\n\nAmericans for Responsible Solutions has emerged as the leading spender among gun control groups this election cycle, spending $3.3 million so far.\n\nWith a focus on House races, Giffords\u2019 organization has contributed $373,572 to Rep. Michael Fitzpatrick, R-Pa. But it has spent much more \u2014 $1.2 million \u2014 against Republican candidate Martha McSally, who is seeking the 2nd Congressional District. seat in Arizona previously held by Giffords.\n\nIndependence PAC USA\n\nBacked by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Independence PAC USA focuses on stricter gun laws, improving education and advancing same-sex marriage.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s group has spent close to $3 million supporting Democrats. Bloomberg himself, though, is the second-biggest individual donor this election cycle.\n\nThe former mayor has spent more than $11 million, with 96 percent of it to back Democrats. He has said he plans to spend $25 million more this month through Independence USA PAC.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Groups on either side of the gun control question spend millions on targeted U.S. House and Senate races.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Groups on either side of the gun control question spend millions on targeted U.S. House and Senate races.", "title": "Gun Show: Issue Fades, but Groups AIm to Influence Midterms", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141008_GunSpending_Quinn-feature.png", "updated_time": "2014-10-14T12:33:44+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1EM5Jh9"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Groups on either side of the gun control question spend millions on targeted U.S. House and Senate races.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141008_GunSpending_Quinn-feature.png"}, "title": "Gun Show: Issue Fades, but Groups AIm to Influence Midterms", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "elections,firearms", "published_time": "2014-10-13T03:01:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-14T12:33:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "National Rifle Association, midterm elections, Tom Cotton, Mark Pryor, Americans for Responsible Solutions, Bruce Braley, Joni Ernst, Gabrielle Giffords, Mike Fitzpatrick, Martha McSally, gun control"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf556\"", "article_summary": "A poll last month from Gallup found that just 1 percent of Americans say gun control is the most important non-economic issue.\nPublic opinion hasn\u2019t stopped gun groups on both sides from spending, though, as the chart shows.\nGun control appeared to loom large for 2014 campaigns after the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\nThis year, although gun control isn\u2019t a major issue, groups on both sides support and oppose targeted candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate.\nAmericans for Responsible Solutions has emerged as the leading spender among gun control groups this election cycle, spending $3.3 million so far."}
