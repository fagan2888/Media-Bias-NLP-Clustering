The botched Obamacare rollout is just the beginning of a "disaster" so bad it eventually will fail when people simply opt out of the system, says Ron Paul, a former congressman and presidential candidate who is also a medical doctor."It's going to be the biggest political issue in the whole next year," Paul predicted Thursday on Fox News Channel's " Your World with Neil Cavuto Paul admitted the only way to do anything about the law, which took effect January 1, is for Republicans to take over Congress. Even then, without a veto-proof majority, foes would have to wait for a chance to put a Republican in the White House in 2016."The only way it's going to disappear quickly is if it totally self-destructs, which is conceivable," Paul said of Obamacare. "Everybody just quits because they're getting nowhere with it, and they just opt out."Eventually, Paul said, dealing with the problems he expects from the Affordable Care Act will push individuals to simply quit the system. He didn't explain what he meant, though as it stands, people can pay a fine rather than buy health insurance under the law.Despite Paul's belief that the law is destined to fail, he doesn't see it as the end of activist government."I wish, but no, there's a lot of die-hards up there" on Capitol Hill, Paul told Fox News."There'll be excuses made, and the politicians will spin it a certain way."
