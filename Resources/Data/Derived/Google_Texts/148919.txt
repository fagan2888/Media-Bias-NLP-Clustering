The Palo Alto, California-based electric car maker says deliveries of Tesla's Model X are 'in line.'

Tesla Motors delivered 17,400 vehicles during the fourth quarter of 2015 and a total of 50,580 for the year, the company said on Sunday.



The Palo Alto, California-based pioneering automaker delivered about 75 percent more of its Model S than during the same period of the previous year, Tesla said.

Deliveries of Tesla's Model X are "in line" with the company's early stages of producing the new electric sports utility vehicle, the company said. Tesla delivered its first Model X in September.

Tesla was producing 238 Model X vehicles per week by the last week of 2015, the company said.
