He walks down the hallway toward the Broncos locker room. He checks to make sure he isn\u2019t forgetting anything.\n\n\u201cI got my keys, I got my phone,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI think I have everything.\u201d\n\nThis week left Thomas satisfied, exuberant and motivated in a way that he never could have imagined when he was 13 dreaming of playing in the NBA. Monday, President Barack Obama commuted the sentence of Thomas\u2019 mother, Katina Stuckey Smith. Wednesday, Thomas signed a five-year, $70 million contract with $43.5 million in guaranteed money. Friday, he revealed a breathtaking goal.\n\n\u201cI want to lead the league in yards, touchdowns, basically about everything a receiver can do,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI kind of want to break the NFL record in yards. There\u2019s big plays to be made (in this offense).\u201d\n\nDetroit\u2019s Calvin Johnson owns the single-season mark with 1,964 yards set in 2012. Thomas ranks 15th all-time with 1,619 yards last season.\n\n\u201cI know (it\u2019s roughly 2,000 yards),\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIf the first few games weren\u2019t bad this past year I would have gotten it.\u201d\n\nStanding alone at the podium, dressed in a navy blue suit with a Broncos pin on his lapel, Thomas talked softly about the greatest week of his life. His mom should be in a halfway house soon, and possibly released to see him play for the first time in November. His right ankle, stepped on during practice on Dec. 2, has healed, allowing him to drop from 229 to 222 pounds through several months of jump training known as plyometrics. His contract is official, and it never worried him despite the anxiety shared by the Broncos and his agent.\n\nMost salient moving forward, Thomas said he likely would have attended training camp and said, \u201cI definitely wasn\u2019t going to sit out games. I was still going to play.\u201d\n\nThe gravitational pull of football remains strong in Thomas. When a team makes a player the second-highest paid in franchise history, character matters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely part of the decision-making,\u201d general manager John Elway said.\n\nThe Broncos know Thomas can produce in any offense with any quarterback \u2014 he has starred with Kyle Orton, Tim Tebow and Peyton Manning \u2014 but the expectations extend beyond the field. His statistics \u2014 he has averaged 99 catches, 1,494 yards and 12 touchdowns since becoming a starter in 2012 \u2014 provide a soundtrack for his success, but his voice can provide guidance.\n\nAs the longest-tenured Bronco with left tackle Ryan Clady sidelined by injury, Thomas welcomes a larger leadership role after serving as a co-captain last season. He said he should have been more assertive last season when he heard teammates grousing about playing in the cold weather in New England if the Broncos had beaten the Indianapolis Colts in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cI knew it was not a good situation,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI have heard from guys like (former Broncos) Brian Dawkins, Shannon Sharpe, Champ (Bailey) saying I need to step up. When I hear it from those guys, it means something. I know I need to step up and have the guys listen to me.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos view Thomas as part of the core as the team transitions over the next few seasons. Beyond Rod Smith, one of his early mentors, Thomas ranks as arguably the most prolific receiver in team history. He owns Broncos\u2019 records for receiving yards in a regular-season game, a playoff game and a season.\n\nNearly two hours after his news conference, Thomas walked out Friday with his keys and phone, but missing a ring.\n\nAn ideal team finish starts with him.\n\n\u201cI watched some games I played, and there were some where I took a play or two off and missed a couple of blocks. If I have to take a play off, I should get out. Not having drops and not taking plays off, if I do that it will make everyone around me better,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSo far we haven\u2019t gotten the Super Bowl. We still have work to do. I look forward to getting that before I am done.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
