He is the author of the new book, \"The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress and the Battle for the Great Society.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) Mitt Romney took himself out of the picture last week, but Republicans still have a huge number of potential presidential candidates. While it seems as if Democrats will probably coalesce around one candidate, whenever Hillary Clinton announces her intent to run, the Republicans have a number of key figures -- including Chris Christie, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Mario Rubio, to name a few -- vying for the nomination.\n\nAt some level, this is exciting news for the GOP. There are many talented figures in the pool so Republicans will have an opportunity in the primaries to pick the best of the lot. A number of them could pose a serious threat to the Democrats.\n\nJulian Zelizer\n\nRepublicans are buoyed by the thought that they have a real chance to win in 2016. The soft approval ratings of President Barack Obama as well as the underlying fragility of the economic recovery have boosted their confidence that the White House could be theirs for the taking. Some Republicans believe that Hillary Clinton will not be as strong a candidate as she was in her losing effort to win the Democratic nomination in 2008, and that she will be saddled with the problems of the Obama administration following her service as secretary of state as well as the never-ending personal controversies surrounding her husband.\n\nBut an abundance of candidates comes with an abundance of problems. Although many conservatives are still enjoying the afterglow of the 2014 midterm elections, the GOP faces a number of significant challenges that have been building in recent years.\n\nForemost is what's been called the Goldwater problem, with memories of how the GOP suffered after the 1964 election when Republican candidate Barry Goldwater ran for the White House from the far right. His party suffered a devastating defeat as Lyndon Johnson won a landslide election and liberal Democrats secured huge majorities in the House and Senate.\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans will have to overcome years of damage inflicted on their party's reputation.", "pubdate": "2015-02-03T19:55:53Z", "author": "Julian Zelizer, CNN Contributor", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Republicans will have to overcome years of damage inflicted on their party's reputation.", "pubdate": "2015-02-03T19:55:53Z", "title": "An army of GOP candidates for 2016?", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/03/opinion/zelizer-gop-candidates-obstacles/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150119180843-jeb-bush-large-169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "opinion", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150119180843-jeb-bush-large-169.jpg", "template-top": "opinion,art-gal", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/03/opinion/zelizer-gop-candidates-obstacles/index.html"}, "keywords": "opinion,  An army of GOP candidates for 2016? - CNN.com", "lastmod": "2015-02-03T20:05:50Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "(CNN) Mitt Romney took himself out of the picture last week, but Republicans still have a huge number of potential presidential candidates.\nForemost is what's been called the Goldwater problem, with memories of how the GOP suffered after the 1964 election when Republican candidate Barry Goldwater ran for the White House from the far right.\nThe soft approval ratings of President Barack Obama as well as the underlying fragility of the economic recovery have boosted their confidence that the White House could be theirs for the taking.\nJulian ZelizerRepublicans are buoyed by the thought that they have a real chance to win in 2016.\nAlthough many conservatives are still enjoying the afterglow of the 2014 midterm elections, the GOP faces a number of significant challenges that have been building in recent years."}
