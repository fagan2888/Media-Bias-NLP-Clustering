So President Barack Obama is marshaling his own numbers \u2014 and an unusual moral weight \u2014 to stress the achievements of his health overhaul law.\n\nAddressing the Catholic Health Association on Tuesday, Obama spoke about the 100 years it\u2019s taken to reform health care in the United States, and the millions of people Obamacare has helped over its five years of implementation.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThis is now part of the fabric of how we care for one another,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThis is health care in America.\u201d\n\nPeppered with religious and historical references, Obama\u2019s speech was part victory lap and part plea: an assertion of the law\u2019s success, even as the courts and the Republican-controlled Congress threaten to dismantle the overhaul.\n\nSaying broadening access to health care had been the goal of historic leaders \u201cfrom Teddy Roosevelt to Teddy Kennedy,\u201d Obama asserted that health care is \u201cnot a privilege, it is a right.\u201d\n\nAs many as 6.4 million people are at risk of losing the subsidies that make their health insurance affordable if the government loses in the high court. Known as King v. Burwell, the case considers whether the subsidies, based on the wording of the law, can legally be distributed to customers in states that use the federal exchange on Healthcare.gov instead of building their own state-based marketplaces.\n\nThe case has huge practical and political implications. The administration has consistently expressed confidence that it will prevail but said there\u2019s no administrative fix if it loses.\n\nCongressional Republicans, meanwhile, have said they don\u2019t want to see Americans lose their subsidies, but they\u2019ve struggled to coalesce around a single alternative. On Monday, a top Senate Republican once again rejected the prospect of making the simple language tweak that Obama would like to see.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: If the Supreme Court rules against the administration, Congress will not pass a so-called one-sentence fake fix,\u201d said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), ruling out simply clarifying the section in question that talks about subsidies for exchanges \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d\n\nThough he did not refer directly to Republicans, Obama called attempts to roll back the law \u201cdeeply cynical,\u201d especially in light of the law\u2019s successes, which include a record low percentage of uninsured Americans.\n\n\u201cThe rugged individualism that defines America has always been bound by a set of shared values, an enduring sense that we are in this together,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat we have an obligation to put ourselves in our neighbor\u2019s shoes, and to see the common humanity in each other.\u201d\n\nThe future of Obamacare is also playing out on the campaign trail. Most of the Republican presidential candidates have whipped up crowds by pledging to repeal the law, but have not offered full blueprints of what a replacement might look like. Hillary Clinton has strongly supported the law through various tweets and has warned of the dangers of unraveling the legislation.\n\nAnd Republicans are already gearing up to pin their persistent critiques of Obamacare on Clinton.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s spin doesn\u2019t change the fact ObamaCare is a deeply flawed law that no one read before Democrats rammed it through Congress on a highly partisan basis,\u201d said Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short, in a statement. \u201cWhether it\u2019s skyrocketing costs, cancelled insurance plans, or the law\u2019s legal issues, the problems caused by ObamaCare rest squarely at the feet of this president, Hillary Clinton and the rest of the Democrat party.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s frustration with the court was clear on Monday, when he said during a news conference in Germany that the King case \u201cprobably shouldn\u2019t even have been taken up.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama tried to transcend the legal issues and political debate and instead focus on what the law has accomplished.\n\n\u201cThere are outcomes that we can calculate and enumerate \u2014 the number of newly insured families, the number of lives saved \u2014 those numbers all add up to success in this reform effort,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut there are also outcomes that are harder to calculate,\u201d whether it was bankruptcies avoided, the ability of a parent to bring a child to the doctor, or a wife being able to take a walk with her husband after recovering from an illness. He continued, \u201cIs there any greater measure of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness than those simple pleasures that are afforded by good health?\u201d\n\nThe audience for the speech had special resonance for Obama. The Catholic Health Association, which was celebrating its 100th anniversary, is led by Sister Carol Keehan. The nun helped round up Catholic support for the Affordable Care Act when it was opposed by bishops who were concerned about funding for abortion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is appropriate, but I just told Sister Carol, I love her,\u201d Obama quipped after she introduced him.\u201cWe would not have gotten the Affordable Care Act done had it not been for her.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cFive years in, what we\u2019re talking about is no longer just a law.&quot;", "title": "Obama makes moral case for preserving his health care law", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/obama-moral-argument-keep-obamacare-118775.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/09/150608_barack_obama_obamacare_cast_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Barack Obama,King V.
