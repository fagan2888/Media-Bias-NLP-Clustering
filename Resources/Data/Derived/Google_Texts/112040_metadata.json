She held other jobs since, including serving as a probation officer at a juvenile court in Denver and as a hostess at a ranch in Creede.\n\nGinny married her second husband, David Rice \"D.R.\" Pulliam, in 1967. D.R, a rancher, banker and land developer, was the son of pioneers D.T. and Lillian Pulliam, who had five children. He died in 1990 at age 89.\n\nAfter they married, the Pulliams moved to a ranch near Masonville to run cattle, staying there until the Big Thompson flood of 1976.\n\nGinny later sold the 2,600 acres of ranchland to Fort Collins, creating the Bobcat Ridge Natural Area that opened to the public in 2006. The D.R. and Virginia Pulliam Charitable Trust made it possible for all fifth-graders in Thompson School District to travel to the natural area to study its environment and history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They would have parties there,\" Sandy Olson said about the ranch. \"She loved to cook, and would do a lot of cooking for these parties.\"\n\nDuring the 1976 flood, their home and swimming pool were destroyed, Sandy Olson said.\n\nThey moved to the highest point in the loft of the tack room, and as 22 feet of water broke into their house, D.R. grabbed a central beam and she clasped onto him, Sandy Olson said. The two were swept up to a cottonwood tree and held on, staying there for three or four hours until help came, she said.\n\n\"She was a very courageous person,\" said Lynn Hammond, an attorney in Loveland. \"She handled that like it was something you had to go through.\"\n\nHammond recalled Ginny's \"remarkable memory for detail\" and ability to remember conversations weeks after the fact.\n\n\"She was considerate,\" Hammond said. \"She was concerned about the other person.\"\n\nGinny and D.R. moved to Lake Loveland after losing everything in the flood, not having flood insurance. Starting over, they got a boat they named \"Grandchildren's Bait\" to lure Sandy Olson's daughters, Kelly and Julie Olson, over for a visit and some jet skiing.\n\n\"When I brought friends, (Ginny) would always cook, making sure they had seconds and thirds,\" Julie Olson said. \"She just tried to make everyone happy and comfortable.\"\n\nJulie Olson, who lives in Denver, described Ginny as generous and thoughtful.\n\n\"She had a great sense of adventure and shared a lot of her travel stories with me,\" Julie Olson said, adding that Ginny brought back dolls to give to her and Kelly from every country they visited. \"It was her way of sharing her adventure.\"\n\nGinny ate healthy foods, cooked from scratch and, even at 100 and beyond, did not take any medications. But she did drink four pots of coffee a day, Kelly said.\n\n\"She ate like we were supposed to eat,\" Julie Olson said.\n\nGinny also was described by many as caring and giving.\n\nHer family donated land and helped fund the construction of the Pulliam Community Building, completed in 1939 and renamed in 1988.\n\nShe donated $1 million over five years to the Loveland Boys & Girls Club, serving as its namesake for the Pulliam Youth Center.\n\nDuring the grand opening of the clubhouse, she gave a talk, which she didn't prepare in advance.\n\n\"It was a good talk,\" Sandy Olson said. \"At age 99, that's pretty amazing.\"\n\nThe grand opening was on Ginny's birthday, said Kathi Wright, executive director of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Larimer County.\n\n\"She was just so tickled,\" Wright said. \"She honestly was like a kid.\"\n\nWright described Ginny as a delight to be around.\n\n\"She had the most beautiful blue eyes,\" Wright said. \"I just loved to sit and talk with her.\"\n\nShelley Widhalm can be reached at 669-5050, ext. 531, or swidhalm@\n\nreporter-herald.com.
