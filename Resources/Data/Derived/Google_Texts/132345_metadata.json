It is credited with having a toolset that allows journalists to edit and illustrate their copy in dramatic fashion, promote their work on social media, and interact with readers \u2014 all seamlessly and intuitively.\n\nEven the competing website TechCrunch has written a love letter to Chorus, calling it \u201cnext generation\u201d technology, while noting that comparatively \u201cthe rest of us have been stuck turning screwdrivers.\u201d\n\nReporters and multimedia journalists say the enhanced technology of Chorus enables them to do things like make photos appear as a cursor slides down a page; add links automatically to copy; and identify problem commentators through word identification.\n\n\u201cMost journalists hate their content management systems,\u201d said Melissa Bell, who was director of platforms at The Post before she left with Mr. Klein to join Vox. \u201cThe joke is that Chorus is a unicorn with a kitten on its back. People think it is a magical system that fixes everything.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChorus does not fix everything, of course, said Jim Bankoff, Vox Media\u2019s ambitious chief executive, but it is sexy enough to be a recruiting tool. \u201cFor this generation of talent, which grew up digitally, having the proper tools to ply their craft is essential,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cBeing able to offer them the best possible platform to achieve their goals is a great advantage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRecruiting is important for Vox, which was the fastest growing digital media site in 2013, according to comScore. (It reached 75 million unique visitors in March, according to its internal site metrics, which are measured by Google Analytics.)\n\nVox is adding publications as well as readers. Since its inception in 2008, the company has raised nearly $80 million in capital from Accel Partners and Comcast Interactive Capital, among others, and has used it to build The Verge, a technology site, and to acquire the food site Eater and the real estate and design platform Curbed.\n\nLike Mr. Klein, the founders of all those sites confirmed that Chorus was crucial to their decision to team with Vox. Josh Topolsky, editor in chief of The Verge, came over in 2011 after growing frustrated with the limits of the computer system at Engadget, an AOL technology publication. He had grand ideas for a site that could do in-depth science coverage while integrating new design elements.\n\nAfter looking widely, he said, he decided Chorus was the best option. \u201cIt was so obvious and where we needed to go,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a storytelling perspective it couldn\u2019t be accomplished in any other place that I have seen.\u201d\n\nOthers are catching up, but the rich graphic interface and facile reader interaction have helped Vox earn a reputation for quality and attract a highly desirable audience: its largest demographic is educated households headed by individuals under 35 years old with incomes over $100,000.\n\nPerhaps more important for its long-term survival, Vox\u2019s formats attract attention directly, so the site does not have to turn to gimmicky features like quizzes, teasing headlines or lists to generate traffic through Facebook or Twitter.\n\nThe company\u2019s attitude toward content management has its roots in the basement of Trei Brundrett, now Vox\u2019s chief product officer. It was there that he and some partners developed SB Nation, a sports blogging website that became wildly popular when it was introduced nine years ago. Mr. Brundrett and his crew cast themselves as equal parts journalists and software developers.\n\nBecause SB Nation needed a platform where sports fans could communicate with one another, the team created word-recognition software that would help police comments. Because it covered live sports events, it created an organizational tool, called story stream, that allowed editors to click and drag relevant material \u2014 from previous stories, Twitter posts or commentary by the writers \u2014 all into one continuous flow.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat culture has translated forward into more conventional journalistic enterprises. Developers at Vox Media call themselves journalists and work continually with writers and reporters to build the tools they require. \u201cIt is thrilling as a journalist being able to envision a tool and having it become a real thing,\u201d Mr. Topolsky said. \u201cAnd it is rare.\u201d\n\nMr. Klein, hoping to avoid incrementalism \u2014 \u201cthe biggest source of waste is everything the journalist has written before today,\u201d he said \u2014 instead wants his journalists responsible for constantly updating pages that are the ultimate resource on a topic.\n\n\u201cIt would be like a wiki page written by one person with a little attitude,\u201d Ms. Bell explained.\n\nTo help accomplish this, the developers have been building a tool they call the card stack. The cards, trimmed in brilliant canary yellow, contain definitions of essential terms that a reader can turn to if they require more context. For example, a story updating the battle over the Affordable Care Act might include cards explaining the term \u201cinsurance exchange.\u201d\n\nMs. Bell said Vox.com would start with roughly 20 reporters with expertise around specific topics, a limited travel budget, and, of course, very inchoate technology.\n\nMs. Bell confessed that she was both \u201cexcited and terrified\u201d to go out with a product that has had just three months to gestate. \u201cI worry people will say, \u2018Hey, you guys promised us magic,\u2019 \u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019ll say, \u2018Hey, wait a minute. Give us some time and we will get there.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140406183545, "twitter": {"description": "The new site, led by Ezra Klein, the founder of Wonkblog, features a next-generation content management tool that greatly enhances digital storytelling.", "title": "Vox Takes Melding of Journalism and Technology to a New Level", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/business/media/voxcom-takes-melding-of-journalism-and-technology-to-next-level.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002798758"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/07/business/VOX/VOX-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/business/media/voxcom-takes-melding-of-journalism-and-technology-to-next-level.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002798758", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/business/media/voxcom-takes-melding-of-journalism-and-technology-to-next-level.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business/media", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/media/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 6, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/leslie_kaufman/index.html", "section": "Media", "modified": "2014-04-07", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/media/index.jsonp", "tag": "Computers and the Internet", "published": "2014-04-06", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "keywords": "Vox Media Inc,News and News Media,Klein  Ezra,Computers and the Internet", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Leslie Kaufman", "SCG": "media", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Klein, Ezra", "slug": "07vox", "byl": "By LESLIE KAUFMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The new site, led by Ezra Klein, the founder of Wonkblog, features a next-generation content management tool that greatly enhances digital storytelling.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/07/business/VOX/VOX-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The new site, led by Ezra Klein, the founder of Wonkblog, features a next-generation content management tool that greatly enhances digital storytelling.", "CG": "business", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 6, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Vox Media Inc", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140407113945, "hdl_p": "Vox Takes Melding of Journalism and Technology to New Level", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/business/media/voxcom-takes-melding-of-journalism-and-technology-to-next-level.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/07/business/VOX/VOX-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The new site, led by Ezra Klein, the founder of Wonkblog, features a next-generation content management tool that greatly enhances digital storytelling.", "title": "Vox Takes Melding of Journalism and Technology to a New Level"}, "pdate": 20140406, "des": "Computers and the Internet", "articleid": 100000002798758, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Vox Takes Melding of Journalism and Technology to a New Level", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/07/business/VOX/VOX-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde0d8\"", "article_summary": "Developers at Vox Media call themselves journalists and work continually with writers and reporters to build the tools they require.\nLike Mr. Klein, the founders of all those sites confirmed that Chorus was crucial to their decision to team with Vox.\n\u201cMost journalists hate their content management systems,\u201d said Melissa Bell, who was director of platforms at The Post before she left with Mr. Klein to join Vox.\n(It reached 75 million unique visitors in March, according to its internal site metrics, which are measured by Google Analytics.)\nIn this high-tech universe, Vox Media\u2019s content management system \u2014 which even has its own name, Chorus, and is used to publish all the company\u2019s websites \u2014 has earned recognition."}
