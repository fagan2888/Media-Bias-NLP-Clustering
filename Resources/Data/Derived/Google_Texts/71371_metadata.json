With her 2013 eponymous album up for Best Urban Contemporary Album, Beyonc\u00e9 now has the most nominations\u201447 and counting, since more nominations are still to be announced\u2014of any female artist in Grammy history. But looking at the nominee field for Record of the Year, the absence of \u201cDrunk In Love,\u201d one of the most compelling singles of the last year, is notable.\n\nAlbum of the Year won\u2019t be announced until tonight (on the broadcast of \u201cA Very Grammy Christmas,\u201d no less) and a snub for the full \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u201d would be ludicrous. But Record of the Year is a crucial category in a singles-driven music landscape. A quick recap of the crucial all-genre categories: Album of the Year recognizes full albums\u2014they do still exist!\u2014across all genres. Then there\u2019s Song of the Year (nominees TBA), which is primarily a songwriting award. Record of the Year recognizes performance, production and engineering/mixing. It\u2019s sort of a Best All-Around superlative for a single song. For that category, \u201cDrunk In Love\u201d clearly deserves a nomination, especially considering that Iggy Azalea\u2019s \u201cFancy\u201d and Meghan Trainor\u2019s \u201cAll About That Bass\u201d got nods instead.\n\nThe steamy, sexy strength of \u201cDrunk in Love\u201d lies not only in the pure power of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s voice, but in the song\u2019s many surprises\u2014the varied vocal delivery, the layers of strings, skittering beats, weird vocal additions, and tempo changes. When Jay Z\u2019s contribution to a song is its least-essential component (can we get a remix treatment on that Ike Turner reference, please?), you know you\u2019ve crafted a complex, compelling song that it infinitely listenable and potentially influential. This song has legs.\n\nIggy Azalea\u2019s \u201cFancy\u201d (obligatory legal note: feat. Charli XCX) is a fun song, but there\u2019s not a lot of there there. Aside from Azalea\u2019s kind of delightful snarly attitude, it\u2019s a fairly simple little party jam whose \u201cClueless\u201d homage video is the most interesting thing about it. Azalea\u2019s nod for Best New Artist, which, if she\u2019s lucky, she won\u2019t win, is a much better fit. Meghan Trainor is charming and talented, and there\u2019s nothing terribly objectionable about her virulently catchy hit, but \u201cAll About That Bass\u201d is two jaunty steps up from a novelty song. It\u2019s cute enough the way the bass line underscores her ode to \u201cthat booty, booty,\u201d but ultimately simplistic. Again, the candy-colored video offers a hard sell for this one. I happen to like both of these songs, but in a just world, they wouldn\u2019t be considered Record of the Year material.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nominee \"All About That Bass\" is one step up from a novelty song--but the Grammys work in mysterious ways", "author": "Erin Keane", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Nominee \"All About That Bass\" is one step up from a novelty song--but the Grammys work in mysterious ways", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 gets snubbed: This morning\u2019s bizarre Grammys announcements", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/05/beyonce_gets_snubbed_this_mornings_bizarre_grammys_announcements/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/trainor_beyonce.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nominee \"All About That Bass\" is one step up from a novelty song--but the Grammys work in mysterious ways", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/trainor_beyonce.jpg", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 gets snubbed: This morning\u2019s bizarre Grammys announcements", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 gets snubbed: This morning\u2019s bizarre Grammys announcements", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Beyonce, Grammy Awards, iggy azalea, Meghan Trainor, sam smith, sia, Taylor Swift", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf12c\"", "article_summary": "Then there\u2019s Song of the Year (nominees TBA), which is primarily a songwriting award.\nFor that category, \u201cDrunk In Love\u201d clearly deserves a nomination, especially considering that Iggy Azalea\u2019s \u201cFancy\u201d and Meghan Trainor\u2019s \u201cAll About That Bass\u201d got nods instead.\nAzalea\u2019s nod for Best New Artist, which, if she\u2019s lucky, she won\u2019t win, is a much better fit.\nA quick recap of the crucial all-genre categories: Album of the Year recognizes full albums\u2014they do still exist!\u2014across all genres.\nCharli XCX) is a fun song, but there\u2019s not a lot of there there."}
