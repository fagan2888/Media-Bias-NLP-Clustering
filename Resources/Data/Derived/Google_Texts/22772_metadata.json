Now, Democrats in California have struck a new budget deal that will cover the health care of hundreds of thousands of illegal alien children in California, costing $130 million per year.\n\nSouthern California Public Radio reports that the deal, forged by State Senator Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens), expands the state\u2019s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal. Lara argues that the deal will save the state money by encouraging illegal aliens to use regular medical services instead of hospital emergency rooms, and will transform the lives of the \u201cundocumented.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCritics argue the new bill creates an incentive for more illegal immigration. Under California\u2019s Proposition 187, which was passed in 1994 but later struck down, illegal aliens were ineligible for public services in the state. Lara is also proposing separate legislation that would seek a federal waiver to allow illegal aliens to purchase health care through Obamacare.\n\nIn 2009, advocates of Obamacare promised that the legislation would not cover illegal immigrants\u2013a promise that critics doubted. Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC) infamously shouted \u201cYou lie!\u201d when President Obama repeated the pledge in front of a special joint session of Congress that fall. Wilson regretted the outburst, but subsequent events have proved him correct.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats: $130 Million for Health Care for Illegal Alien Kids", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Democrats: $130 Million for Health Care for Illegal Alien Kids", "title": "Democrats: $130 Million for Health Care for Illegal Alien Kids - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Texas-Border-Crisis-Capture-1PNG1.png", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/06/17/democrats-130-million-for-health-care-for-illegal-alien-kids/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrats: $130 Million for Health Care for Illegal Alien Kids", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Texas-Border-Crisis-Capture-1PNG1.png", "title": "Democrats: $130 Million for Health Care for Illegal Alien Kids - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Border Crisis, illegal alien kids, medi-cal, obamacare,Border, Breitbart California, Obamacare,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-06-17T05:45:35-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Border", "tag": "obamacare", "categories": "Breitbart California,Border,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcacef\"", "article_summary": "Now, Democrats in California have struck a new budget deal that will cover the health care of hundreds of thousands of illegal alien children in California, costing $130 million per year.\nLara is also proposing separate legislation that would seek a federal waiver to allow illegal aliens to purchase health care through Obamacare.\nUnder California\u2019s Proposition 187, which was passed in 1994 but later struck down, illegal aliens were ineligible for public services in the state.\nSouthern California Public Radio reports that the deal, forged by State Senator Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens), expands the state\u2019s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROne year ago, thousands of illegal alien children flooded the southern border, creating an acute political crisis for President Barack Obama, and a humanitarian crisis for border states."}
