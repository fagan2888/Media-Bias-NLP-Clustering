After a two year long FBI investigation, the Department of Justice has charged seven of individuals working for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard with a series of crimes surrounding the hacking of the damn, in addition to launching cyber attacks on the U.S. financial system. The hackers were not only attacking U.S. systems, but also gathering intelligence for the Iranian government.\n\nFrom DOJ:\n\nA grand jury in the Southern District of New York indicted seven Iranian individuals who were employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSecTeam (ITSEC) and Mersad Company (MERSAD), that performed work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on computer hacking charges related to their involvement in an extensive campaign of over 176 days of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\n\n\n\nAhmad Fathi, 37; Hamid Firoozi, 34; Amin Shokohi, 25; Sadegh Ahmadzadegan, aka Nitr0jen26, 23; Omid Ghaffarinia, aka PLuS, 25; Sina Keissar, 25; and Nader Saedi, aka Turk Server, 26, launched DDoS attacks against 46 victims, primarily in the U.S financial sector, between late 2011 and mid-2013. The attacks disabled victim bank websites, prevented customers from accessing their accounts online and collectively cost the victims tens of millions of dollars in remediation costs as they worked to neutralize and mitigate the attacks on their servers. In addition, Firoozi is charged with obtaining unauthorized access into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems of the Bowman Dam, located in Rye, New York, in August and September of 2013.\n\n\u201cIn unsealing this indictment, the Department of Justice is sending a powerful message: that we will not allow any individual, group, or nation to sabotage American financial institutions or undermine the integrity of fair competition in the operation of the free market,\u201d Attorney General Lynch Loretta Lynch released in a statement Thursday. \u201cThrough the work of our National Security Division, the FBI, and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices around the country, we will continue to pursue national security cyber threats through the use of all available tools, including public criminal charges. And as today\u2019s unsealing makes clear, individuals who engage in computer hacking will be exposed for their criminal conduct and sought for apprehension and prosecution in an American court of law.\u201d\n\nMore info on the damn hacking:\n\nBetween Aug. 28, 2013, and Sept. 18, 2013, Firoozi repeatedly obtained unauthorized access to the SCADA systems of the Bowman Dam, and is charged with one substantive count of obtaining and aiding and abetting computer hacking. This unauthorized access allowed him to repeatedly obtain information regarding the status and operation of the dam, including information about the water levels, temperature and status of the sluice gate, which is responsible for controlling water levels and flow rates. Although that access would normally have permitted Firoozi to remotely operate and manipulate the Bowman Dam\u2019s sluice gate, Firoozi did not have that capability because the sluice gate had been manually disconnected for maintenance at the time of the intrusion.\n\n\n\nRemediation for the Bowman Dam intrusion cost over $30,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf convicted, the seven Iranians charged could face a prison sentence of 10 years.\n\nYou can read the entire indictment here.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Friends.\".05/27/2016 9:51:12AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"Friends.\"", "title": "DOJ: Yep, It Was The Iranians Who Hacked That New York Dam in 2013", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/03/24/yep-iran-hacked-a-damn-in-america-n2138465", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/72/2016-03-12T143529Z_1_LYNXNPEC2B0BO_RTROPTP_3_IRAN-EUROPE-ROUHANI.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"Friends.\"", "title": "DOJ: Yep, It Was The Iranians Who Hacked That New York Dam in 2013", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/03/24/yep-iran-hacked-a-damn-in-america-n2138465", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/72/2016-03-12T143529Z_1_LYNXNPEC2B0BO_RTROPTP_3_IRAN-EUROPE-ROUHANI.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "DOJ: Yep, It Was The Iranians Who Hacked That New York Dam in 2013, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Remediation for the Bowman Dam intrusion cost over $30,000.\nBack in 2013, the Bowman Avenue Damn in Rye Brooke, New York was hacked.\nIn addition, Firoozi is charged with obtaining unauthorized access into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems of the Bowman Dam, located in Rye, New York, in August and September of 2013.\nThe hackers were not only attacking U.S. systems, but also gathering intelligence for the Iranian government.\nIf convicted, the seven Iranians charged could face a prison sentence of 10 years."}
