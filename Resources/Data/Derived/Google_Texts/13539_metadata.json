(Photo: LEE CELANO/THE ADVERTISER)Buy Photo\n\nAs promised, Gov. John Bel Edwards is moving on his plan to expand Medicaid to 375,000 state residents.\n\nEdwards was in Lafayette on Wednesday to address the roll-out of the expansion alongside Dr. Rebekah Gee, Secretary of the Department of Health and local officials.\n\n\u201cThis is what is going to happen for the start of Louisiana; we have about 375,000 people today who are caught,\" Edwards said inside the Southwest Louisiana Health Services Center. \u201cThey don\u2019t have access to Medicaid currently, nor do they have access to health insurance through any other means. We are going to make this Medicaid expansion available to them and provide them heath care coverage that we are already paying for here in Louisiana.\u201d\n\nDuring his second term, former Gov. Bobby Jindal opposed Louisiana\u2019s participation in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which provides for Medicaid expansion for states. Many critics called it a political move against President Barack Obama.\n\nREAD MORE: Medicaid expansion could lessen, not stop cuts, health dept. says\n\nIt\u2019s a service Louisiana residents have been paying into but to which they have been denied access, Edwards said. The expansion will save the state $184 million that will be returned to the general fund, he said.\n\n\u201cI want you to understand the population of the people we are talking about. Seventy percent of the targeted population of this 375,000 are full-time workers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey work in construction; they work in retail; they work in food service \u2014 you name it. But they are without health insurance.\u201d\n\nThose eligible must have an individual household income of $16,395 per year or an annual household income for a family of four at $33,534.\n\nEnrollment for Medicaid begins June 1. Coverage will be available by July, said T. Bradley Keith, of assisting consulting firm Gulf South Strategies and Solutions. Applicants can enroll online or visit the 22 facilities in eight Acadiana parishes assisting with Medicaid applications.\n\nOUR VIEW: For now, Medicaid expansion sensible\n\n\"Before Thursday\u2019s press conference, the governor and other officials met with a handful of local residents in need of Medicaid assistance. One mother said her 33-year-old incarcerated son requires health care services currently not provided by insurance. Edwards noted that the federal health care expansion would also provide behavioral health services that would reach into the state's criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cIll people are not criminals,\u201d Edwards said.\n\nFor the next few weeks, Edwards and his administration will be traveling the state to inform residents about the application process, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve had in this state prior to this time are patches of care,\u201d Gee said. \u201cWe are now going to have a quilt of care that covers the entire state. Just in Lafayette alone, you have over 20,000 people who have no insurance.\u201d\n\nThe learn more about Medicaid assistance and apply online, visit www.healthy.la.gov.
