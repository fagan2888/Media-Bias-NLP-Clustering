The OIM further recommends that this revised policy prohibit the use of strikes to force persons being place under arrest to spit out potential contraband,\u201d the report reads.\n\nSEE ALSO: \u2018Democracy Spring\u2019: Thousands to participate in \u2018largest civil disobedience action of the century\u2019\n\nThe suggestion comes on the heels of a high-profile incident in 2014 in which an officer was caught on camera repeatedly punching a suspect who had been allegedly stuffing a heroin-filled sweat sock into his mouth.\n\nCmdr. Matt Murray, the department\u2019s chief of staff, told the Denver Post at the time that officers had \u201cno choice\u201d other than to strike the man in hopes of forcing him to spit out the sock. Absent any explicit rules on what to do when an individual attempts to swallow contraband, however, the watchdog said this week that Denver cops should follow in the footsteps of the Seattle Police Department and adopt specific guidelines for officers who become involved in such situations.\n\nThe watchdog verbally recommended policy revision in December 2015, then \u201cspecifically recommended that the DPD prohibit the use of strikes to force persons to spit out potential contraband\u201d in a January 2016 letter to the chief of police.\n\nSEE ALSO: Hillary Clinton\u2019s email archive made searchable by WikiLeaks\n\n\u201cThe Policy\u2019s only discussion of this subject is its short notation that officers may not use Tasers to prevent arrestees form swallowing contraband. Similarly, the DPD training academy does not currently provide any specific training addressing the removal of potential contraband from a suspect\u2019s mouth and, if so, what types of force should be used,\u201d Independent Monitor Nicholas E. Mitchell wrote the police chief earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI believe that this gap in the DPD\u2019s current policy and training leaves officers in the unenviable position of having to make field determinations about whether to attempt to remove potential contraband from arrestees\u2019 mouths, quickly and under tense circumstances, without formal direction from the DPD. This creates various risks, including risks to citizen and officer safety, the possibility of citizen complaints and potential liability for the City,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt also creates the risk that officers\u2019 uses of force in these situations may be inconsistent with the overall goals of the Use of Force Policy, and with community expectations about the amount of force that should be used to protect a person from the risks of swallowing contraband, and to recover potential evidence.\u201d\n\nAt least 2,037 altercations occurred between 2013 and 2015 in which one or more DPD officer used force on a suspect, the OIM report reads.\n\n\u201cRelying on brute force should never occur,\u201d Lisa Calderon, co-chair of the Denver Colorado Latino Forum, told the city\u2019s KDVR News this week.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t direct officers, when they are left to make stuff up on the scene, then it becomes justified because there\u2019s a gap in the policy? That\u2019s a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cThe community should know what to expect and so should police officers.\u201d\n\nSonny Jackson, a spokesman for the DPD, told KDVR that the network is in the process of implementing a new Use of Force policy that addresses the watchdog\u2019s concern.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached out to other agencies throughout the country, medical professionals, and we\u2019re in the midst of drafting a policy in that area,\u201d he told the television station. \u201cIt\u2019s very close \u2014 not so close I can speak on it yet, but close in that area.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Denver Police Department's official watchdog this week once again urged law enforcement officials not to punch suspects who are believed to be swallowing drugs.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Denver Police Department\u2019s official watchdog this week once again urged law enforcement officials not to punch suspects who are believed to be swallowing drugs.", "title": "Denver cops advised not to punch drug-swallowing suspects", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/16/denver-cops-advised-not-punch-drug-swallowing-susp/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/02/denver_shootings-motorcycle_clubs.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/02/denver_shootings-motorcycle_clubs.jpeg", "description": "The Denver Police Department's official watchdog this week once again urged law enforcement officials not to punch suspects who are believed to be swallowing drugs.", "card": "summary", "title": "Denver cops advised not to punch drug-swallowing suspects"}, "Author": "Andrew Blake", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Denver Police Department"}, "article_summary": "The Denver Police Department\u2019s official watchdog this week once again urged law enforcement officials not to punch suspects who are believed to be swallowing drugs.\n\u201cRelying on brute force should never occur,\u201d Lisa Calderon, co-chair of the Denver Colorado Latino Forum, told the city\u2019s KDVR News this week.\nThe OIM further recommends that this revised policy prohibit the use of strikes to force persons being place under arrest to spit out potential contraband,\u201d the report reads.\n\u201cThe OIM recommends that the DPD revise its Use of Force Policy to provide specific guidance on what types of force are permitted, and prohibited, to remove potential contraband from the mouths of persons being placed under arrest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very close \u2014 not so close I can speak on it yet, but close in that area.\u201d"}
