A union spokesman said the USW expanded a strike that started at a couple of refineries in Texas and California, because the industry refused to \u201cmeaningfully address\u201d safety issues through good-faith bargaining. But the real issue is who pays the Obamacare \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d on \u201cgold-plated\u201d health plans.\n\nBreitbart News, in \u201cCal Fruits and Crops Rotting at West Coast Ports In Union Fight,\u201d chronicled how the labor slowdown at the 29 West Coast ports between employers represented by the Pacific Maritime Association and members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, whose members command average wages and benefits of about $1,200 a day, was causing $2 billion a day in economic damage to the U.S. economy and letting about one third of West Coast agricultural exports rot.\n\nThe labor dispute was settled with the ILWU signing a five year contract that included maintenance of nearly no-cost health coverage, an $11,000 increase in maximum pension benefit to $91,000 a year, and a $1-per-hour wage increase over each of the five years. Perhaps the most egregious element of the new contract is that despite fighting for the rest of America to be forced into Obamacare, ILWU members negotiated that employers will have to pay the approximately $11,000 Obamacare \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d on the ILWU\u2019s $40,000 a year \u201cgold-plated\u201d health insurance plan.\n\nThe USW appears to be timing its shut-down to leverage the built up port turmoil that was expected to take up to two months and tons of overtime to clear. The USW struck 15 plants, covering about 6,550 union members, on February 1 when it rejected a new three-year contract negotiated with employers represented by Shell Oil Co.\n\nBP spokesman Scott Dean told the Chicago Post-Tribune that USW employees are among the highest paid hourly workers in the midwest. \u201cThe average BP USW employee earns more than $82,000 a year in base salary. This does not include overtime, bonuses, company retirement contributions or other benefits, which on average adds well in excess of $20,000 to the total annual compensation package for the average BP USW employee.\u201d\n\nWorker duties at the highly automated plants are to minimize process interruptions by 1) anticipate machinery malfunctions and develop contingency plans; 2) conduct process control; and 3) ensure smooth refinery operations through efficient use of equipment.\n\nJim Savage, leader of United Steelworkers Local 10-1 at an oil refinery in south Philadelphia, told the Washington Post: \u201cWe picked a fight with the wealthiest, most powerful people in the history of the world. So we\u2019re either very courageous, or the stupidest people walking.\u201d\n\nThe union said it expanded a strike that started February 1 at six refineries, including the Tesoro California plants in Carson, Benicia and Martinez, because the industry refused to \u201cmeaningfully address\u201d safety issues through \u201cgood-faith bargaining.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafety issues\u201d is usually union code for increasing staff levels and eliminating non-union contractors that do daily maintenance work. But the USW refinery workers, like ILWU dock workers, are also part of the 26 million American workers in multi-employer health plans who are subject to the Obamacare \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d on \u201cgold-plated\u201d health insurance plans.\n\nIt is difficult to project how long it will take before the strike will start restricting fuel supplies, but prices are already moving up. As companies begin to start hoarding fuel stocks, the 30,000 USW refinery workers will start causing billions of dollars a day in economic damage to the U.S. economy\u2013and perishable crops will again rot.", "article_metadata": {"description": "West Coast Dock Strike Settles Just in Time for Refinery Strike", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "West Coast Dock Strike Settles Just in Time for Refinery Strike", "title": "West Coast Dock Strike Settles Just in Time for Refinery Strike", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/California-Oil-Refinery-Paul-Sakuma-Associated-Press.jpg", "height": 720}, "updated_time": "2015-02-22T11:52:24-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/22/west-coast-dock-strike-settles-just-in-time-for-refinery-strike/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "West Coast Dock Strike Settles Just in Time for Refinery Strike", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/California-Oil-Refinery-Paul-Sakuma-Associated-Press.jpg", "title": "West Coast Dock Strike Settles Just in Time for Refinery Strike", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "dock strike, economy, labor disputes, oil refinery, ports, refineries, Unions,Big Government, Breitbart California, Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-02-22T11:20:44-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-02-22T11:52:24-07:00", "tag": "Unions", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart Texas,Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "As companies begin to start hoarding fuel stocks, the 30,000 USW refinery workers will start causing billions of dollars a day in economic damage to the U.S. economy\u2013and perishable crops will again rot.\nBut the USW refinery workers, like ILWU dock workers, are also part of the 26 million American workers in multi-employer health plans who are subject to the Obamacare \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d on \u201cgold-plated\u201d health insurance plans.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe USW represents workers at 65 refineries that produce about 64 percent of US petroleum-based fuel production.\nIt is difficult to project how long it will take before the strike will start restricting fuel supplies, but prices are already moving up.\nBut the real issue is who pays the Obamacare \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d on \u201cgold-plated\u201d health plans."}
