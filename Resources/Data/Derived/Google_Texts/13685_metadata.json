It was during one of the early evenings, my homework done, before I had rushed back to playing Nintendo, that I exclaimed about the wonders of \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d that the Huxtables were America\u2019s greatest family, how everyone should have a dad like Bill Cosby.\n\nMy mother, having just thrown the dog a bit of bread and pulling up the sleeve of her winter robe to keep it from catching fire on the oven, poured her tea and threw some verbal darts. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to look at the TV to find a role model or father figure. He is here, in this house, right now.\u201d\n\nI remembered that moment the other day when I saw the news that Cosby had admitted in a previously sealed deposition to drugging women in order to rape them. In all probability Cosby is a serial sex offender. Thus, the public scold of the black ghetto underclass may in fact be guilty of far worst \u201ccrimes\u201d than wearing sagging pants or giving their children names that reflect an unfortunate deficit in social and economic capital.\n\nAs Salon\u2019s own Brittney Cooper explained, much of the anger at Bill Cosby is rooted in how he betrayed the special trust that was placed in him by Black America. His most noteworthy enterprise, \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d was a shining exemplar of upward mobility, dignity, and a functioning black family. Now Cosby\u2019s legacy has been called into question.\n\nAmericans on both sides of the color line are upset by Cosby\u2019s behavior not exclusively because of the horrific nature of his crimes, but also because his failings have robbed many of them of an innocent and positive part of their youth. Being disabused of childhood nostalgia is one of the most painful parts of being (and becoming) an adult. But perhaps the focus now should be on the source of that nostalgia itself, and how the politics and values of \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d which were so attractive to so many and for such a long time, are based on a distorted and inaccurate presentation of the black community, one that has enabled a pernicious type of right-wing \u201ccolorblind\u201d racism to flourish.\n\nTelevision offers a distorted image of reality. It\u2014and other types of mass media\u2014are the primary means through which unreal and false representations of human social relationships are learned by the public. The family drama and situation comedy both provide excellent examples of this phenomenon.\n\n\u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d followed the day-to-day struggles and experiences of a rich black New York family called the Huxtables. The father, played by Cosby, was a successful obstetrician, and his wife, Claire, was a partner in a law firm. They had one son and four daughters. They hail from a long line of successful African-Americans who were graduates of historically black colleges. The show was a response to a white popular imagination that largely saw black and brown Americans as poor, as members of the underclass, as criminal, or beaten down by racism \u2014 and as such lacking agency, freedom, or upward mobility.\n\nIn many ways \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d was the anti-\u201cMoynihan Report\u201d\u2014a much misunderstood and misrepresented exploration of \u201cblack ghetto poverty\u201d and \u201cthe breakdown of the black family\u201d written in the 1960s by the Labor Department. \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d was also a rebuttal to \u201970s TV producer Norman Lear\u2019s popular shows \u2014 \u201cGood Times,\u201d \u201cSanford and Son,\u201d and \u201cThe Jeffersons\u201d \u2014 where the humanity and travails of black folks living in poverty (and escaping such conditions) were the dominant themes.\n\nPopular culture is inherently political and ideological. While the depiction of a rich and \u201cfunctioning\u201d black family was superficially transgressive, \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d channeled a particular understanding of race, capitalism, \u201csuccess,\u201d and \u201cmiddle class\u201d identity that more often than not reinforced dominant American cultural norms and rules basically in line with the the Horatio Alger myth; it offered to viewers a harmless type of \u201cdiversity,\u201d where blackness and the \u201cBlack experience\u201d were massaged down into a throwaway mention of the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., or the struggle to end Apartheid, or simple guest appearances for accomplished black musicians, artists, and actors.\n\nFor most of its 8 seasons, \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d existed inside a bubble that was outside of the day-to-day lived experiences of the vast majority of black Americans. The events in bubble were white fantasies of black folks\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d was set during the 1980s and early to mid 1990s in New York City. This was a tumultuous time of protest activity, anti-black and brown police harassment, brutality and killings, tensions between African-Americans and Koreans, anxieties about black \u201csuper predators,\u201d \u201cwilding,\u201d the Central Park Five, the Crown Heights riots, and the racist murders and assaults on black youth by white racists in the neighborhood of Howard Beach.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Cosby, Americans mourn the loss of an innocent part of their youths.
