The competing bills fit roughly into three different categories: 1) systems preventing deranged people from acquiring guns; 2) mental health treatments for deranged people in prisons and in public programs like Medicaid, and, finally, a wasteful, shotgun approach: 3) expanding mental health parity mandates \u2014 already required under the Affordable Care Act and earlier laws. Prior to Obamacare, President Bush and President Clinton both signed bills strengthening mental health parity.\n\nMental health parity mandates require health plans cover mental health treatments \u2014 such as psychiatric hospital stays and counseling sessions \u2014 at identical dollar limits to physical health treatments. Thus, if your health plan provides unlimited care for cancer, heart attack, stroke or any other physical ailments, your plan must provide unlimited care for psychiatric conditions. In years past, many health plans limited psychotherapy to only five or 10 outpatient sessions per year.\n\nRecent episodes of mass violence have raised awareness of severe mental illness. The perpetrators of these horrendous crimes were undoubtedly suffering from significant mental health problems. But it\u2019s doubtful that additional health plan mandates would have caused them to receive the behavioral intervention they so desperately needed.\n\nIt is relatively difficult for family members (or law enforcement) to force individuals suffering from severe mental illness to accept treatments they don\u2019t want. Until the 1960s, most civil commitments were involuntary. People in need of psychiatric care were institutionalized \u2014 usually against their will. But rather than the old standard where involuntary civil commitment mostly involved family members\u2019 assertions of medical need, involuntary commitment, although it still varies state by state, now requires proof the patient is a danger to self or others.\n\nFurthermore, the length of time patients can be involuntarily committed for evaluation is only about 72 hours. That\u2019s such a narrow window that it\u2019s unclear how mental health parity mandates could deter deranged individuals contemplating violence.\n\nActuaries are beginning to understand how different medical conditions warrant different levels of cost-sharing in order to achieve desirable outcomes at reasonable costs. As we\u2019ve written before at the NCPA, a major problem with generous mental health parity mandates is that mental conditions are subjective. In the absence of objective standards \u2014 like blood tests that can definitely identify mental illness and measure treatment success \u2014 insurers have to rely upon patients\u2019 subjective descriptions of their feelings and their therapists\u2019 subjective progress reports. It\u2019s probably safe to assume that psychotherapists believe even mentally healthy people could benefit from periodic counseling. Although this view is likely their honest opinion, it is also consistent with counselors\u2019 desire to get paid. This moral hazard and the ambiguity of treatment progress increases mental health treatment costs.\n\nNot all mental health treatments are in response to a mental disorder. Consider this: a study in an economic journal found that more than one-third (38 percent) of mental health patients did not have a mental health disorder. Some patients viewed sessions with their therapist like a therapeutic massage for their emotions: pleasant but possibly not something they would consider worthwhile if required to pay out of pocket.\n\nAs former Atlantic columnist Megan McArdle has pointed out, the number of people with severe mental illness is rather small compared to those who are merely unhappy with their life. A generous mental health mandate would mostly provide costly \u2014 medically unnecessary \u2014 gripe sessions for the moderately unhappy. Discontented people could dump on their therapist all their trivial complains about unfulfilling jobs, inattentive spouses and life opportunities missed \u2014 all paid for by other peoples\u2019 money.\n\nMental health mandates also open the door to fraud. Texas and Florida suffered a series of fraud accusations around 1990, when patients with questionable mental health needs were admitted to for-profit, psychiatric hospitals. Patients\u2019 health plans were then systematically looted; only to be discharged the day their mental health benefits ran out. One company was accused of charging $1,100 (per person) for recurring three-hour \u201cgroup\u201d therapy sessions. It was also accused of marking up nonprescription drugs 30,000 percent and billing for services never provided. Treatment plans (and diagnosis) were often adjusted to match insurance coverage limits. Many of the shady providers preyed on adolescents whose parents had good health coverage. Office-based counselors would convince parents their teens\u2019 angst was depression that could lead to suicide. The teens were then admitted to affiliated psychiatric hospitals, where their mental health benefits were maxed out over the course of a week or two. The teens were miraculously \u201ccured\u201d and discharged the day their insurance would no longer pay.\n\nAs a society, we must discuss the best methods for preventing future violence committed by people with severe mental illness. There are no easy answers when obstinate, delusional patients resist seeking treatment. Although their conditions warrant care, it\u2019s likely mental health parity mandates will do more to over-treat the affluent than help those truly in need. Let\u2019s not pretend this over-priced Band-Aid would prevent mass shootings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Policies that aim to prevent mass violence have found broad bipartisan support in Congress. .05/26/2016 18:29:19PM EST.", "author": "Devon Herrick", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Policies that aim to prevent mass violence have found broad bipartisan support in Congress.", "title": "- Congress\u2019 Mental Health Mandate Debate is D\u00e9j\u00e0 Voodoo Economics All Over Again", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/devonherrick/2015/08/07/congress-mental-health-mandate-debate-is-d%c3%a9j%c3%a0-voodoo-economics-all-over-again-n2036153", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/51/cffceab3-ff46-49fb-bfcc-317c0457ec37.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Policies that aim to prevent mass violence have found broad bipartisan support in Congress.", "title": "- Congress\u2019 Mental Health Mandate Debate is D\u00e9j\u00e0 Voodoo Economics All Over Again", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/devonherrick/2015/08/07/congress-mental-health-mandate-debate-is-d%c3%a9j%c3%a0-voodoo-economics-all-over-again-n2036153", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/51/cffceab3-ff46-49fb-bfcc-317c0457ec37.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Congress\u2019 Mental Health Mandate Debate is D\u00e9j\u00e0 Voodoo Economics All Over Again, Devon Herrick, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Mental health parity mandates require health plans cover mental health treatments \u2014 such as psychiatric hospital stays and counseling sessions \u2014 at identical dollar limits to physical health treatments.\nConsider this: a study in an economic journal found that more than one-third (38 percent) of mental health patients did not have a mental health disorder.\nPatients\u2019 health plans were then systematically looted; only to be discharged the day their mental health benefits ran out.\nAs we\u2019ve written before at the NCPA, a major problem with generous mental health parity mandates is that mental conditions are subjective.\nThat\u2019s such a narrow window that it\u2019s unclear how mental health parity mandates could deter deranged individuals contemplating violence."}
