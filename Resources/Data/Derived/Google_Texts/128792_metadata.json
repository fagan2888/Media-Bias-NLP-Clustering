John Hickenlooper last year stunned Colorado with his death-penalty decision and then apply it to the firestorm this week with the governor\u2019s comments to the sheriffs association over gun measures.\n\n\u201cI think that Hickenlooper\u2019s gift is to try to find that sweet spot in between two polar positions, but I\u2019m not convinced that this was a decision that lent itself to that approach,\u201d Sondermann said. \u201cI think he runs the risk of seeming too cute by half and of really leaving both sides feeling unfulfilled.\u201d\n\nWow.\n\nSondermann recently announced a major life decision: He sold his ownership interest in SE2 to his long-time business partners, Eric Anderson and Susan Morrisey. (My first question: Will we still get nifty Christmas swag from the consulting/communications/policy firm?)\n\nHe\u2019ll still be in the limelight as he plans to develop his role as political analyst, commentator, writer and speaker.\n\nWhen I worked at the late, great Rocky Mountain News, Sondermann was incredibly patient. \u201cLynn, again, it\u2019s Sondermann with two \u2018n\u2019s.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Sondermann became the story when U.S. Rep. Marilyn Musgrave\u2019s campaign wouldn\u2019t appear before the Rocky/CBS/KBDI debate panel because Sondermann was on it and he supposedly was some sort of known radical liberal.\n\nYes, he had once worked for Gov. Dick Lamm, but Sondermann fought the Democratic establishment in 1995 when he worked on Denver City Councilwoman Mary DeGroot\u2019s mayoral campaign. She stunned Mayor Wellington Webb by winning top line in the first vote \u2014 most Webb supporters thought there would be no need for a runoff \u2014 but lost in the runoff.\n\nMusgrave\u2019s demand was universally panned because Sondermann was unaffiliated by then and anyone familiar with his analysis on TV or in print knew he equally skewered both sides. (Musgrave lost, by the way.)\n\nAt the GOP\u2019s Political Scandals Halloween party in 2009, he came dressed as a hiker, complete with maps of the Appalachian Trail stuffed in his pockets while his wife Tracy wore a flamenco dancer\u2019s outfit. What? You\u2019ve already forgotten about South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford?\n\nSondermann wasn\u2019t always right, as Pat Waak, the former Democratic Party chairwoman, noted. Her chairwomanship was over by 2012, but she recalls Sondermann saying at some event that Mitt Romney was going to carry Colorado. She explained all the reasons she thought he was wrong. \u201cHe looked at me in disbelief,\u201d she recalled.\n\nSondermann is a regular on the weekly news program Colorado Inside Out. Here\u2019s what some fellow panelists and other politicos had to say about him:\n\nDominic Dezutti, producer and host of Colorado Inside Out: \u201cOn one of our live shows many years ago, I was in charge of the graphics and under his name, we meant to put \u2018Political Consultant\u2019 but for most of the hour, I didn\u2019t notice an embarrassing typo. We had identified him as a \u2018Political Conslutant.'\u201d\n\nDan Haley, former Denver Post editorial page editor: \u201cSondermann has been a trusted, Tim Russert-like political analyst because he\u2019s a straight-shooter and spears sacred cows on both sides of the aisle. He\u2019s a throwback of sorts too because he does it such a gentlemanly manner.\u201d\n\nDave Kopel, with the Independence Institute: \u201cEric is the most extremely moderate person in the state of Colorado.\u201d\n\nPat Waak, former Democratic party chair: \u201cThere were a lot of things I didn\u2019t agree with him on, but I did believe that he was sincere and honest. That is hard to say about people in the political world. We speak so often of authenticity. Well, Eric Sondermann is an authentic person. He believes deeply in so many things, especially education.\u201d\n\nDick Wadhams, former Republican Party chair: \u201cAfter I initially decided to seek a third term as state chairman, I immediately started having doubts. While I wanted to vindicate my tenure by being re-elected \u2026 I knew I really didn\u2019t want to spend another two years presiding over a fractured nomination process. So while watching Colorado Inside Out one Friday evening when they were discussing my decision to run again, I heard my friend Eric say something to the effect that he had no idea why I wanted to run again, that it was a waste of my time and energy because the job of state chairman is so limited in its ability to be effective given the political and financial restraints on the position and the state party. I thought to myself, Eric is absolutely right, and I announced the following Monday I would not run after all. Beyond that, Eric is a terribly insightful analyst.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Sondermann\u2019s announcement:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado Inside Out,Dave Kopel,Dick Wadhams,Dominic Dezutti,Eric Anderson,Eric Sondermann,John Hickenlooper,Marilyn Musgrave,Pat Waak,SE2,Susan Morrisey,Wellington Webb", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Eric Sondermann, known for his deft observations on Gov.
