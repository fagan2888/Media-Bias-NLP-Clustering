Namely, they assumed that the subsidies were available on the federal exchanges and went so far as to argue that the entire statute could not function as written without the subsidies. That\u2019s a far cry from their argument now that the statute makes crystal clear that Congress intended to deny subsidies on the federal exchanges.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nI am not a fan of the \u201cgotcha\u201d flavor that some aspects of this case have taken on, but the challengers\u2019 2012 statements are relevant as a legal matter because what the government has to prove to win\u2014as a matter of black-letter law under the Chevron doctrine\u2014is that the statute is ambiguous. ( Chevron says that federal courts defer to the relevant agency\u2019s reading of the statute when a federal statute is unclear\u2014here, that agency is the IRS.)\n\nThe challengers have spent more than a year arguing that no reasonable reader of text could construe the statute in any way other than denying federal subsidies to insurance purchasers on exchanges operated by the federal government. But what about their statements from 2012\u2014statements then echoed by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito in their joint dissent to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the constituitional challenge, NFIB v. Sebelius? Here are a few; judge for yourself.\n\nThe 2012 briefs filed on behalf of the same plaintiff, David Klemencic (among others), by the same counsel as the current challenge, made the case that it is nonsense to read the statute as not offering the federal-exchange subsidies. Indeed, the plaintiffs went so far as to say the entire Affordable Care Act should have been struck down without the subsidies\u2014because the act would not be able to function as written without them.\n\nFrom the brief:\n\nThe Federal Government only subsidizes coverage purchased within an exchange, thus giving insurance companies a reason to sell there despite the distinct regulatory burdens imposed on plans offered through the exchanges. The exchanges cannot be severed from the provisions already addressed. Without the subsidies driving demand within the exchanges, insurance companies would have absolutely no reason to offer their products through exchanges, where they are subject to far greater restrictions. Premised on the mandate, the insurance regulations, and the subsidies, the insurance exchanges cannot operate as intended by Congress absent those provisions. (p. 51, emphasis added).\n\nFrom their reply brief:\n\nIndeed, the \u201ccritical feature\u201d of those exchanges was the \u201cgreater standardization of health insurance policies\u201d created by the effective end to individual underwriting. Id. Without that standardization, Congress\u2019 goals in creating the exchanges \u201cwould be significantly frustrated.\u201d Id. 46. Moreover, the federal subsidies are the incentive to participate in the exchanges, and without those subsidies, there will be no mechanism to sustain the exchanges. (p. 20, emphasis added)\n\nAnd in fact, this comports with precisely how Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito described the statute in their 2012 joint dissent\u2014as nonsense without the subsidies:\n\nIn the absence of federal subsidies to purchasers, insur\u00adance companies will have little incentive to sell insurance on the exchanges. Under the ACA\u2019s scheme, few, if any, individuals would want to buy individual insurance poli\u00adcies outside of an exchange, because federal subsidies would be unavailable outside of an exchange. Difficulty in attracting individuals outside of the exchange would in turn motivate insurers to enter exchanges, despite the exchanges\u2019 onerous regulations. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a718031 . That system of incentives collapses if the federal subsidies are invalidated. Without the federal subsidies, individuals would lose the main incentive to purchase insurance inside the exchanges, and some insurers may be unwilling to offer insurance inside of exchanges. With fewer buyers and even fewer sellers, the exchanges would not operate as Congress intended and may not operate at all. (p. 60, emphasis added)\n\nThese arguments, it is worth noting, are textual, structural and contextualarguments\u2014arguments about what the statute means, drawing from how the act\u2019s different textual provisions fit with one another and are read in light of one another, in the entire statutory scheme. These are not extratextual or legislative history arguments. Rather, they are precisely the kinds of arguments commonly made by textualists, and accepted by the joint dissent in 2012, but which the challengers are now saying is an inappropriate method of interpretation in their effort to construe four words of a 900- page law in a vacuum.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Just two years ago, they described Obamacare in a way they now insist it can\u2019t be read.", "title": "Another Hole in the Halbig Verdict", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/how-the-halbig-plaintiffs-changed-their-mind-109897.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/08/10/ap573592516776.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Opinion,Supreme Court,Healthcare,Affordable Care Act,In The Arena", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Just two years ago, they described Obamacare in a way they now insist it can\u2019t be read.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "( Chevron says that federal courts defer to the relevant agency\u2019s reading of the statute when a federal statute is unclear\u2014here, that agency is the IRS.)\nThat system of incentives collapses if the federal subsidies are invalidated.\nPremised on the mandate, the insurance regulations, and the subsidies, the insurance exchanges cannot operate as intended by Congress absent those provisions.\nMoreover, the federal subsidies are the incentive to participate in the exchanges, and without those subsidies, there will be no mechanism to sustain the exchanges.\nThat\u2019s a far cry from their argument now that the statute makes crystal clear that Congress intended to deny subsidies on the federal exchanges."}
