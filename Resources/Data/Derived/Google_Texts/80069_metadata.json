Emergency loans are slow to get awarded, so the economy is at a standstill.\u201d\n\nEnriquez said the next typhoon season is right around the corner, which makes the residents \u201cvery nervous given the temporary shelters that they have.\u201d\n\nSchool started in June, he said, but many of them never opened.\n\n\u201cThere have been other major emergencies around the world that have drawn the attention away from the Philippines,\u201d Enriquez said. \u201cMuch like Haiti, the pain and suffering continue.\u201d\n\nThe first disaster struck the island nation nearly nine months ago, on Oct. 15, when a 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck the Philippines and killed nearly 1,000 people.\n\nWhile cleanup from that disaster was ongoing, Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines with heavy rainfall and sustained winds of around 200 mph on Nov. 6. By last count, the typhoon had resulted in more than 3,600 deaths.\n\nEnriquez, 59, gets back to the Philippines on a fairly regular basis in his job representing the Topeka-based Ad Veritas construction company, which he owns.\n\nThough he left the Philippines this past fall about two weeks before Typhoon Haiyan made landfall, Enriquez was in the country when the Oct. 15 earthquake struck, though he said he didn\u2019t feel anything as its epicenter was about 350 miles south of Manila, where he was staying.\n\nBack in the United States, and concerned for his home country, Enriquez got in touch with Lamdagan to be his \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in the Philippines and identify the most pressing needs in the wake of the disasters.\n\nLamdagan told Enriquez the \u201cbiggest needs\u201d were for temporary restroom and shower facilities, as well as personal hygiene products such as soap, deodorant, towels and wash cloths.\n\nOther relief agencies were bringing in food and water as roads open up, but little had been done in the way of sanitation, Enriquez said.\n\nAs a result, Enriquez said, a large number of people were at risk for contracting cholera.\n\nEnriquez said this past fall that people couldn\u2019t afford to wait on the Phillippine government to help remedy the situation as the Philippine government was \u201cbroke\u201d and had \u201cno money for emergency assistance. They don\u2019t have anything like FEMA. So they\u2019re depending on international support and private donations.\u201d\n\nEnriquez said his goal was to send local donations to the Philippines, where Lamdagan would use it to buy wood and other supplies for the temporary restroom and shower facilities.\n\nEnriquez said 100 percent of local donations went to construction costs, with none of the funds going to administrative fees.\n\nAll labor on the projects was to be donated by Lamdagan\u2019s company, Enriquez said.\n\n\u201cThese sanitation stations will be maintained by the municipalities that accepted them as gifts from Kansas residents,\u201d Enriquez said. \u201cThe first one was built on a school property. The project suffered from weather delays and delays due to other construction projects that took the personnel away from this job. I was back in Manila in March because Ray and I were working on a roofing project at the international airport. We had to pull his crew to work on that project.\u201d\n\nBut now, the first sanitation station is up and running. Details are still being negotiated for the second station, which is being planned for an area where the typhoon hit, Enriquez said.\n\n\u201cThis whole project ranks as one of the highest rewarding projects in my whole life,\u201d Enriquez said. \u201cWhat makes me prouder is that this project came to being because of my fellow Kansans. Friends and strangers came to help me with this simple idea of providing privacy to thousands of victims 10,000 miles away, knowing that there is no chance of a payback from the poorest of the poor.\n\n\u201cThese donors gave us money freely without questions or doubts. This is what makes me proud to be a Kansan.\u201d\n\nEnriquez is well-known in Topeka for his work with various organizations and businesses, including the YMCA, Washburn University, WIBW-TV and KSNT-TV.\n\nHe started his Ad Veritas construction business, which does much of its work in the Philippines and other Asian Pacific nations, in 2002.\n\nDonations are still being accepted for additional sanitation stations and can be sent to Philippines Relief Fund, Educational Credit Union, 2808 S.W.
