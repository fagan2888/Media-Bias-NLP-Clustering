ST. LOUIS COUNTY, MO (KTVI) - Republican Presidential candidate Ted Cruz appeared at a rally with supporters in West County Saturday.

Cruz told about 3,000 supporters at Parkway West High School that he was the only republican who could beat Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Cruz said the race for the republican nomination has boiled down to two candidates, him and front runner Donald Trump.

Cruz talked to reporters before the rally.

He condemned the violent protests last night at Trumps rally in Chicago that forced Trump to shut down the event.

He called it intimidation to stifle free speech.

He later told supporters that he's the one to create new jobs, end Obamacare, appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court, and rebuild the military.

During his remarks he took shots at both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump saying

"I can almost see Hillary tossing and turning at night in her jail cell"

Cruz said he could feel the momentum growing in Missouri for his campaign and predicted that he would win the Republic nomination for president.
