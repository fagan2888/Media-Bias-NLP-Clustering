The most recent Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found 46 percent of Americans had an unfavorable opinion of the law, compared with 40 percent who viewed it favorably. This has left the law a weapon of choice for Republicans in Congress, particularly in an election year in which Speaker Paul A. Ryan is seeking to set the policy agenda.\n\n\u201cA lot of what members on my side of the aisle predicted has come to pass,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, citing increased premiums, higher deductibles and confusion among employers as to what constitutes full-time work. \u201cA lot of the issues that directly affect people\u2019s pocket books have turned out to be negative. I continue to believe, however, that our party must have a plan for replacing and fixing Obamacare and not just repealing it.\u201d\n\nRepublicans concede that if they win the White House, simply repealing the law will no longer be sufficient. Republicans in Congress have yet to offer a comprehensive replacement for the law. Instead, much of their focus, beyond the health care law, has been on attacking Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cWe were elected on a pledge to try and repeal Obamacare,\u201d said Representative David Jolly, Republican of Florida. \u201cIf we are unsuccessful in a veto override, I think we should turn our attention to other matters like national security. But if we get a Republican in the White House, then we need to turn to solutions. The focus can\u2019t be just on repealing Obamacare. It has to be, \u2018What is our health care plan?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublicans say that the health law remains potent for them in part because some of its flaws, like rising premium costs, have only begun to be revealed, even as many of its more popular provisions were quickly clear.\n\n\u201cEven though the law was passed many years ago, the rollout is much more recent, and some components haven\u2019t even been implemented,\u201d said Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York. \u201cFor a few years the debate over Obamacare was one about how it was going to impact individuals, families and businesses in the future. And when it actually started, the debate shifted and people had their own personal stories to tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say constituents have been very upset with the failure of the New York co-op,\u201d he said, referring to the Health Republic Insurance of New York.\n\nBut for Republicans to succeed in dismantling the law, they need to maintain control of the Senate, as well as win the White House. Their majority in the Senate enabled them to pass the repeal measure through a budget procedure called reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority vote and avoids a filibuster, which would require 60 votes.\n\nWhile the House at first struggled to make that process work, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, used his parliamentary skills to make it work and also attack Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cThe Senate was never able to muster the votes required to send the legislation to the president\u2019s desk,\u201d Mr. Zeldin said. \u201cSo this moment in time is unique compared to the past history.\u201d\n\nAlthough Republicans will almost certainly fail in this latest bid, the issue is all but certain to animate the race for the White House and in Senate and House contests.\n\n\u201cI can assure you this is not the end,\u201d Mr. Hoagland said. \u201cWe will continue to have the discussion about health care, its costs and how to it to the American public at the least cost with the best care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160106180510, "twitter": {"description": "The House voted for the 62nd time to repeal
