You don\u2019t survive as a society if you encourage and thrive on envy or jealousy.\u201d\n\nHis statement sparked near-immediate criticism, and Democrats called for those who benefited from Mr. Langone\u2019s political donations \u2014 like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo \u2014 to return the money.\n\nMr. Langone later apologized.\n\n\u201cMy remarks were intended to discourage pitting one group against another group in a society,\u201d he said, the New York Daily News reported. \u201cIf my choice of words was inappropriate \u2014 and they well may have been that \u2014 I extend my profound apologies to anyone and everyone who I may have offended.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ken Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot who has a reported net worth of billions, said he didn't mean any harm when he likened the treatment of the wealthy in America to the tone of Adolf Hitler's rhetoric during Nazi Germany.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ken Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot who has a reported net worth of billions, said he didn\u2019t mean any harm when he likened the treatment of the wealthy in America to the tone of Adolf Hitler\u2019s rhetoric during Nazi Germany.", "title": "Home Depot co-founder says sorry \u2014 U.S. is not like Nazi Germany", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/19/home-depot-co-founder-says-sorry-us-not-nazi-germa/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/19/ap060613038318.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/19/ap060613038318.jpg", "description": "Ken Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot who has a reported net worth of billions, said he didn't mean any harm when he likened the treatment of the wealthy in America to the tone of Adolf Hitler's r", "card": "summary", "title": "Home Depot co-founder says sorry \u2014 U.S. is not like Nazi Germany"}, "Author": "Cheryl K.
