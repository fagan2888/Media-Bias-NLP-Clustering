To share hope and tell people no matter where they are in their life, they are loved. They are never alone and have a purpose.\u201d\n\nBe sure to check out the band on Facebook at www.facebook.com/TheWorshiperOfficial, on Instagram @theworshiperband and on their website at www.reverbnation.com/theworshiperband .\n\nNathan Ham can be reached at 336-846-7164 or followed on Twitter @NathanHam87\n\nCourtesy photo \u2013 The Worshiper, made up of Nathaniel Steelman, Wesley Moore (front row) Josh Reavis and Dalton Miller (back row) are working on their first studio EP that will be released this summer. http://jeffersonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/web1_Band-photo.jpgCourtesy photo \u2013 The Worshiper, made up of Nathaniel Steelman, Wesley Moore (front row) Josh Reavis and Dalton Miller (back row) are working on their first studio EP that will be released this summer.
