The University of Maryland\u2019s (UMD) School of Public Health\u2019s Center for Health Equity, with the Cigna Foundation, will announce the Health Advocates In-Reach and Research (HAIR) program at 11 a.m. at Christopher\u2019s Grooming Lounge, 705 H Street NE, followed by a demonstration of how the program works. The goal is to use barbershops and hair salons as gateways to better health for African-Americans, who have the highest rate of new cases of colorectal cancer and are the most likely to die from this disease compared to all other racial groups in the U.S. Washington, D.C. has the highest rate of colorectal cancer deaths in the country, according to a 2011 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMedia who would like to attend today\u2019s event are invited to call Brittany Horowitz this morning at 646.229.0213.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased to be a part of the HAIR initiative, partnering with the University of Maryland's Center for Health Equity,\u201d said Christopher Bradley, owner-operator of Christopher\u2019s Grooming Lounge. \u201cI am even more excited that my staff has the opportunity to add such important value to the lives of our customers. Discussing health issues can always be a sensitive subject, so it is a great idea to be able to receive life-saving health information from our technicians. It just makes sense because the community trusts us.\u201d\n\nStephen B. Thomas, professor of Health Services Administration in the UMD School of Public Health and founding director of the school\u2019s Maryland Center for Health Equity (M-CHE), will introduce the HAIR program, funded in part by a $200,000 grant from the Cigna Foundation with added support from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. Through HAIR, barbers and beauticians are trained in how to educate their clientele about colorectal cancer and the importance of getting preventive screenings starting at age 45. The program also includes a team of medical professionals from Capital Digestive Care, LLC, the largest gastroenterology group practice in the Mid-Atlantic states, which will provide medical consultations and colonoscopy screenings to people reached through the HAIR network.\n\nOver the past decade, Dr. Thomas has conducted public health research on mobilizing and transforming African-American barbershops and beauty salons into venues for health promotion, disease prevention and delivery of clinical care in communities at risk for chronic disease. In November, Dr. Thomas announced the first phase of the grant in Prince George County, Maryland. Funding from the Cigna Foundation allowed M-CHE to expand the program in Maryland and now Washington.\n\n\u201cWhile the Affordable Care Act identified colorectal cancer screening among the preventive services covered at no cost to patients, many people are not having these screenings. This partnership with the Cigna Foundation is recognition that business as usual is not working, and now is the time to invest in new and innovative methods for reaching racial and ethnic minority populations,\u201d Dr. Thomas said.\n\nIndividuals age 50 and older are most at risk for colorectal cancer, although screening for African-Americans is recommended at age 45. The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 135,000 people will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer this year. In Washington, D.C., the death rate due to colorectal cancer is particularly high among the city\u2019s African-American population.\n\n\u201cFamily health history, personal history and race are among the common risk factors for colorectal cancer,\u201d said Dr. Mary A. Garza, M-CHE associate director and principal investigator for the project. \u201cA unique component of the project will be the family health histories that M-CHE will train counselors to conduct onsite with clients.\u201d\n\nOther health experts who will be in attendance today at Christopher\u2019s Grooming Lounge to discuss the barbershop program include Dr. Arnold Levy, president and CEO, Capital Digestive Care; Julia Huggins, Cigna\u2019s president for the Mid-Atlantic region; Dr. Christina Stasiuk, Cigna\u2019s national medical director for health disparities, and Dr. Frank Brown, Cigna's senior medical director for the Virginia-Washington, D.C.-Baltimore area.\n\n\u201cThe Cigna Foundation works to nourish culturally sensitive projects that are incubators for innovation,\u201d Huggins said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to support this initiative, which will make a difference in improving health here in Washington.\u201d\n\nThe HAIR project is funded as a part of the Cigna Foundation\u2019s World of Difference grants. The Cigna Foundation established the World of Difference grants to tackle health equity challenges by helping people overcome barriers to their health and well-being.\n\nAbout the University of Maryland Center for Health Equity\n\nThe University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Health Equity (M-CHE) is a university-wide research initiative, established in September 2010, and based in the university\u2019s School of Public Health.
