Here in Florida, the Republican legislature had spurned federal funds to expand Medicaid. It banned ACA \u201cnavigators\u201d from state health department offices where they might do the most good helping people find the best deal for themselves. It refused to set up a state insurance exchange, leaving it instead to the feds to run it without local help. It stripped the Florida\u2019s insurance commissioner\u2019s power to review, negotiate or reject rates set by insurance companies doing business in the state.\n\nOpening day arrived, and despite all the efforts of our elected leaders to protect us from the socialistic ravages of Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation, people were so hungry for coverage that they overwhelmed the system. Frustrating difficulties continue to bedevil would-be applicants a week after the launch. If the public weren\u2019t so dedicated to the cause of harming itself by seeking affordable health insurance, things might have gone off without a hitch.\n\nOpponents of the ACA have been saying that the rollout \u2014 and therefore the entire legislation and the progressive philosophy that gave birth to it \u2014 is fundamentally flawed. Never mind that it is a victim of its own popularity.\n\nIf the public had bought the line that individuals and families were better off under the Republican alternative, which was to rush to an emergency room when they finally got sick enough, the stampede for coverage never would have materialized. Then, opponents could have claimed it was a nanny-state program nobody wanted, just as they contended.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Obamacare, ACA, Affordable Healthcare Act, Florida, Legislature, Obama, health insurance, health insurance exchanges, Medicaid, navigators, Republican, Chan Lowe", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "description": "On October 1 -launch day - Obamacare detractors trotted out their expected criticism.\u00a0 Here in Florida, the Republican legislature had spurned federal funds to expand Medicaid.
