But, the ever-evolving and instant medium also presents pitfalls and problems that may cause more trouble than they are worth.\n\nAnd, some experts say, the anti-social messaging may even be ruining the young political operatives responsible for the social media bloom.\n\nIn late July, the Maine Republican Party made a point of the \u201ctweets\u201d \u2014 the up to 140 character messages used on Twitter \u2014 of a 20-year-old campaign volunteer for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mike Michaud. Some of the tweets sent by the volunteer \u2014 before he was brought on to volunteer on the campaign \u2014 included crude, sexist and vulgar messages.\n\nIn a press release sent July 26, Jason Savage, the executive director of the Maine Republican Party, made hay of the tweets by expressing outrage that Michaud did not \u201cfire\u201d the offending volunteer.\n\n\u201cI think it speaks to the arrogance of the Michaud campaign which, like most Democratic politicians, think they can get away with anything after 40 years of near one-party rule in Maine,\u201d Savage said in a prepared statement.\n\nMichaud\u2019s campaign did suspend the volunteer, and campaign manager Matt McTighe issued a statement denouncing the tweets and promising to offer increased training for volunteers to ensure they conduct themselves in an appropriate manner.\n\nThe dustup wasn\u2019t the first between Republicans and Democrats over something posted on Twitter.\n\nIn October 2013, Democrats said two tweets by a reporter for The Maine Wire, a news website of the conservative-backed Maine Heritage Policy Center, went over the line.\n\nAnd, Maine\u2019s GOP Party Chairman Rick Bennett discounted the tweets as \u201ctrash talk.\u201d\n\nThe pair of tweets, by reporter and editor Steve Robinson, suggested Brian Jordan, a videographer hired by the Democrats to follow and record Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s public appearances, may be prohibited from going into public schools in Maine.\n\n\u201cI hear @ChairmanGrant\u2019s creepy tracker guy is also tailing Eliot Cutler now,\u201d Robinson posted on Twitter, along with a photo of Jordan.\n\nChairmanGrant is Maine Democratic Party Chairman Ben Grant\u2019s Twitter account name and using an @ sign before an account name means the tweet would have been presented directly to Grant, as well as anyone else who follows Robinson on Twitter, or who subscribes to the \u201c#mepolitics\u201d hashtag.\n\nLater the same day, Robinson, or someone apparently using his Twitter account, targeted Jordan again, this time using a different photograph of the videographer.\n\n\u201cGood way to avoid @ChairmanGrant\u2019s tracker? Go to a school. I hear he\u2019s not allowed within 1,000\u2019,\u201d the tweet read.\n\nGrant declined to go into details at the time but said the party would consider all its options. Both Robinson and his employer also declined comment when the Bangor Daily News asked about the message.\n\nBut the GOP\u2019s Bennett told the newspaper that he and Grant had discussed social media and the use of it in campaigns, and he distanced himself and the Maine GOP from Robinson\u2019s tweets.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think those kinds of comments are appropriate,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI think [Robinson] was doing a bit of trash talking. \u2026 I think in general, we need to elevate the level of discourse in politics.\u201d\n\nThen, in February 2014, Bennett found himself apologizing for a Facebook post made by a Republican intern attacking Sandra Fluke, a Democratic congressional candidate from California and a former Georgetown University law student.\n\nFluke gained national attention for her advocacy to include contraception among the health services covered under the Affordable Care Act. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh was widely castigated for calling Fluke \u201ca slut\u201d on air.\n\nAnd a Maine GOP Facebook post, which has since been removed, criticized Fluke for being too poor to afford birth control but having enough money to pay the filing fee to run for Congress. One GOP supporter commented on the post, labeling Fluke a \u201cwhore.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Chairman of the Maine Republican Party, I apologize for this offensive material and assure you that it was not sanctioned by me or the leadership of the Maine Republican Party,\u201d Bennett said in a prepared statement posted on the Maine GOP\u2019s website. \u201cWe took swift action to correct the situation as soon as we became aware of it. The administrative privileges of the individual who created this offensive post have been removed, and we have tightened controls on the posting of material on our Facebook page.\u201d\n\nSparring and sniggering\n\nBut since February, there really hasn\u2019t been any kind of social media ceasefire between the operatives as both Republicans and Democrats have taken to Twitter and Facebook to promote \u2014 and demote \u2014 candidates.\n\nOne recent Facebook post by David Sorensen, the spokesman for the Maine Republican Party, featured a smiling Sorensen standing with his arm around Michaud at what appears to be a campaign event. Sorensen captioned the photo, \u201cHe had no idea\u201d and then shared it on his Facebook page.\n\nSorensen said he meant for the post to be a \u201cmoment of levity.\u201d He said it wasn\u2019t meant to poke fun at Michaud for not knowing who Sorensen was.\n\n\u201cI saw some humor in the fact that here I am doing research for the opposition party and you know, if he only knew what I did for my day job,\u201d Sorensen said.\n\nSorensen earlier this month shared by email a photo of Sen. Stan Gerzofsky, a Brunswick Democrat, posted on his Facebook page.\n\nGerzofsky, who is seeking re-election, is holding a blue and white,\u201dWelcome to Maine, The Way Life Should Be\u201d sign and sitting in a boat. But in his message, Sorensen suggests Gerzofsky is confessing to stealing the sign from the highway. As it turns out, the sign is a scaled-down replica of the signs that greet motorists at most of the state\u2019s highway border crossings \u2014 and was not stolen.\n\nAlso on Facebook in July, Maine Democratic Party operative Chuck Quintero, who has served as the chief of staff to Maine Senate President Justin Alfond, posted a photo of LePage during a press event the governor held on a new safety campaign against distracted driving.\n\nQuintero, who has done \u201cadvance work\u201d for politicians and candidates in the past in Maine and New Jersey, noted LePage\u2019s staff and handlers failed to notice the word \u201cwreck\u201d in red would be prominent in the background behind the governor as he stood at a podium speaking.\n\nThe word is part of a new message painted on trucks meant to warn against the danger of distracted driving. The full message reads: \u201cOne text or call could WRECK it all.\u201d\n\nA photo that appeared on MPBN\u2019s news website shows LePage standing at the podium, along with a lineup of Maine Department of Transportation officials and Maine State Police in front of a truck, including the full message of the safety campaign. But, the image shared by Quintero was cropped so that just LePage standing at the podium in front of the word \u201cWRECK\u201d appears.\n\n\u201cEeek. Some staffer is in big trouble for letting the Governor stand right in front of a sign with big red letters saying WRECK at his own event,\u201d Quintero\u2019s wife, Jodi Quintero, who also works as the spokesperson for the Democratic Speaker of the House, said in a comment on Facebook with the original photo.\n\nIn response, Chuck Quintero suggested LePage\u2019s staff staged him in front of the photo on purpose, posting \u201cI think they are probably fed up as the rest of us and this is their way of sticking it to him.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Chuck Quintero shared the photo again, this time cropped to include only LePage and the word \u201cWRECK\u201d in the background. His tweet read: \u201cPolitical Advance 101: Don\u2019t put your guy in front of a giant sign that says Wreck.\u201d\n\nOthers shared the photo on their Facebook pages or on Twitter, some suggesting they wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the image pop up in a television ad attacking LePage later this fall.\n\nBut some political consultants seriously question if the focus on social media is ruining what would otherwise be good campaign operatives.\n\nSocial or anti-social?\n\n\u201cSocial media has become the hot commodity for campaigns and, like the snake oil salesman of the past, people are saying it will cure every political ill,\u201d Mark Harris, a co-founder and partner of Cold Spark Media said in a recent column published by Campaigns & Elections. \u201cBut in the rush to rightfully develop a strong social media presence, too many young campaign operatives have lost sight of what actually moves persuadable voters.\u201d\n\nHarris goes on to point out that the most dependable voters, usually older and not always dissuaded or distracted by social media, are seldom influenced by a Facebook post, let alone a tweet.\n\n\u201cMany voters, especially older voters who are your most reliable voting demographic, don\u2019t use it. Some have no idea what Twitter is,\u201d Harris said.\n\nIn Maine, Sorensen said most political operatives focus on Facebook rather than Twitter because they believe they are reaching a bigger audience of potential voters that way. He said the efforts on Twitter are mainly aimed at the media and other political operatives.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think we are moving voters, we think we are moving the press,\u201d Sorensen said about campaign use of Twitter.\n\nBut older voters, in rural and less connected regions of the state could care less about Facebook, said Richard Begin, 65, a political volunteer in Bethel who usually gives his time to Republican candidates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t use it,\u201d Begin said of Facebook. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know many people who think it matters much. People who are really going to go out and vote in Maine see no value in it.\u201d\n\nAnd increasingly the tone and content of tweets, especially from those shielding their identities by setting up accounts under aliases or names meant to parody real people, is negative and insulting.\n\nSome of those using social media anonymously, especially on Twitter, have defended their right to anonymous free speech and liken themselves to the anonymous writers of historical documents \u2014 including the Federalist Papers linked to the American Revolution.\n\nAmy Fried, a political science professor at the University of Maine and frequent left-leaning blogger for the Bangor Daily News, said that assumption is a huge stretch of what\u2019s really going on. Fried has found herself the subject of anonymous hate speech on Twitter and has consistently refuted those who attack her with sexist and racist insults.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Twitter sock puppets are a far cry from the thoughtful anonymous writers during the American founding,\u201d Fried said in an email message to the Sun Journal. \u201cNot giving their names gives them a perch from which to lob uncivil comments, to present themselves as multiple individuals, and to avoid accountability for themselves and the parties and candidates for whom they may speak.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no easy way to calculate whether conservatives or liberals employ more \u201csock puppet\u201d accounts, several \u2014 including Fried \u2014 said they believe the anonymous and negative attacks are largely being made by conservatives.\n\n\u201cAlthough their ideologies vary, most surreptitious tweeters commenting on Maine politics tend to tout Republican viewpoints,\u201d Fried said.\n\nBeyond the dueling press releases from the party operatives and the outrage expressed by some of those anonymous accounts on social media, only one daily newspaper \u2014 the Portland Press Herald \u2014 covered the vulgar missives of Michaud\u2019s unpaid campaign volunteer back in July, and that coverage was in an online blog post only.\n\nA handful of radio outlets, including MPBN, also reported on the volunteer\u2019s tweets and campaign reactions to them, or discussed them as part of talk show banter.\n\nOverall, the Maine media largely ignored the demands by Republican operatives that the tweets were a scandal in the making or indicative of how Michaud would operate as governor.\n\nThat underwhelming reaction by the Maine press was probably appropriate, according to Mark Brewer, another political science professor at the University of Maine.\n\nBrewer said it was highly questionable how much control any campaign has over, or should expect to have over, the social media accounts of unpaid volunteers.\n\n\u201cThere are more outlets for people to express themselves, therefore there is more opportunity for other people to see how they are expressing themselves,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cYou can never completely control that.\u201d\n\nBrewer said campaigns would be wise to institute stringent social media policies, including some types of \u201cpre-screening\u201d or \u201cpre-clearance\u201d rules for all people affiliated with a campaign, as a way of managing the risk of a rogue operator sending out a scandalous tweet or Facebook post.\n\nIn the case of the Michaud volunteer, a more vigorous vetting process would have discovered the offensive tweets that had already been sent and may have allowed the campaign to not sign the volunteer on in the first place, Brewer said.\n\nOverall, the incident was more like a bottle rocket that goes up but doesn\u2019t explode, instead fizzling off into the darkness.\n\n\u201cThis was really a nonplayer in the campaign,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cI think [any impact on the campaign] is probably already gone, but that being said, it is something to watch for.\u201d\n\nBrewer predicts in the coming election cycle some campaign, maybe not in Maine, but some big campaign someplace is going to fall victim to an inappropriate social media posting.\n\n\u201cSomebody from some campaign will say something really offensive on social media, and they will pay a price for it,\u201d Brewer said.\n\nSocial media is growing in importance for younger voters, and it has become the primary way they consume information, political or otherwise, Brewer said.\n\n\u201cWe can safely say that social media does matter and that it matters far beyond the kind of political class or the chattering class,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cIt matters far beyond just that group and those people who are intense consumers of political information.\u201d\n\nHe also said that, as a tool for campaigns to reach the youngest voters, it is unsurpassed.\n\n\u201cYou can use social media to communicate with volunteers and to mobilize support within the electorate,\u201d Brewer said. The first big-name candidate to do it was in 2008 when President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign mobilized large numbers of young voters.\n\n\u201cIf you want to get with young people, people under 30, social media is the best tool that a campaign has to do that,\u201d Brewer said.\n\nCORRECTION:\n\nA previous version of this story incorrectly reported that David Sorensen, the communications director for the Maine Republican Party, posted a photo of himself and Mike Michaud on Michaud\u2019s campaign Facebook page. Sorensen shared the photo on his own Facebook page.
