Plans for that merger are expected to be firmed up early next year.\n\nIn another example, national health-insurance giant Kaiser Permanente announced earlier this month that it has agreed to acquire Group Health Cooperative, the Seattle-based insurer that covers about 113,000 people in Eastern Washington. That acquisition, assuming it clears regulatory and other hurdles, is expected to take a year to complete.\n\nDespite the myriad of changes, Elaine Couture, CEO of Providence Health Care, says, \u201cFor us, 2016 looks very, very promising.\u201d\n\nShe says, \u201cNet revenue is pretty flat, but our volumes are up,\u201d including admissions and surgeries, by about 6.4 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively. Also, care for which Providence isn\u2019t compensated is down, due to more people now being insured, thanks to health care reform, she says.\n\nOverall, Providence Health Care continues to focus more on health care accessibility and affordability\u2014and less on acute care\u2014than in the past, Couture says.\n\nShe says the performance of its Providence Medical Park multispecialty center in Spokane Valley, which it opened in April 2014 and has enhanced with additional services since then, \u201cis exceeding our expectations in terms of our business plan, so we\u2019re very pleased with it.\u201d\n\nCouture says she\u2019s excited about the looming merger with St. Joseph Health, which she expects to have little impact here, other than the additional resources that will become available through joining with a larger, but philosophically similar network.\n\nMaurine Cate, CEO of Deaconess Hospital and chief strategy officer for the Spokane-based Rockwood Health System, says, \u201cI think volume is going to continue to grow, not hugely. I think there\u2019s a lot of social factors that are contributing to that as well as health issues.\u201d\n\nShe says, \u201cI think what we\u2019re going to see next year is more integration in physical and behavioral health in bringing in all community resources, not just traditional providers,\u201d to address perceived gaps in health care access, particularly involving mental health.\n\nRockwood Health System is nearing completion of a new $10.2 million Deaconess Hospital North freestanding emergency department, on a 6-acre site at 8202 N. Division, and Cate says she is excited about the enhanced services that facility will enable Rockwood to provide on Spokane\u2019s North Side.\n\nNancy Vorhees, chief operating officer at Spokane-based Inland Northwest Health Services, which now employs more than 1,100 people and provides a range of health care-related services, says, \u201c2015 was a good year for INHS, so as we look at 2016, we\u2019re really looking at much the same. We anticipate next year is going to remain fairly consistent.\u201d\n\nShe says she foresees continued provider collaboration aimed at improving access and convenience for patients, such as INHS\u2019 joint participation with other providers and entities here in the areas of occupational medicine and physical fitness.\n\nTom Messick, vice president and general manager of big health insurer Premera Blue Cross\u2019 Spokane office and claims operations here, among other regional responsibilities, is optimistic about the coming year.\n\n\u201cIn general, we\u2019re up. We\u2019re at the highest membership that we\u2019ve ever been, and we\u2019re seeing significant growth in employer segments small and midmarket-size employers especially.\u201d\n\nPremera currently employs more than 700 people here.\n\n\u201cWith market growth and our increase in revenue, we feel confident for the coming year,\u201d Messick says.\n\nSteve Duvoisin, CEO for several companies here that operate under the Inland Imaging umbrella, says, \u201cI see continued growth in that organization over the coming years, mainly because of the consolidation in health care.\u201d\n\nIn the current health care environment, he says, \u201cThere is an increasing role for imaging and a deeper integration with the rest of the health care system.\u201d\n\nHowever, that growth probably will be muted. Through its imaging centers, Inland Imaging currently sees about 280,000 to 300,000 patients a year, and he anticipates that volume growing about 1 percent a year for the foreseeable future.\n\nThat\u2019s due, he says, to two conflicting forces\u2014one involving the cost-cutting push to not overutilizes health care services, which could reduce imaging volume, and the other involving the maxim that \u201cas we get older, we appropriately need more imaging services.\u201d\n\nDuvoisin says, \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to figure out how to be more productive. We don\u2019t see layoffs in our future. We look at being able to do more work with the same amount of staff.\u201d\n\n\u2014Kim Crompton", "article_metadata": {"robots": "noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Overall, Providence Health Care continues to focus more on health care accessibility and affordability\u2014and less on acute care\u2014than in the past, Couture says.\nAlso, care for which Providence isn\u2019t compensated is down, due to more people now being insured, thanks to health care reform, she says.\nIn one example of how the sector remains in a state of constant change, Providence Health & Services, which includes Spokane-based Providence Health Care, the Inland Northwest\u2019s large provider network, is preparing to merge with a larger network.\nMaurine Cate, CEO of Deaconess Hospital and chief strategy officer for the Spokane-based Rockwood Health System, says, \u201cI think volume is going to continue to grow, not hugely.\nThrough its imaging centers, Inland Imaging currently sees about 280,000 to 300,000 patients a year, and he anticipates that volume growing about 1 percent a year for the foreseeable future."}
