The initiative aims to increase diversity in the health care workforce by supporting promising future health professionals as they pursue their education. This is part of United Health Foundation\u2019s ongoing commitment to build a more diverse health workforce.\n\nSince 2007, United Health Foundation has awarded more than 1,400 scholarships totaling $9.3 million to support diverse students pursing health careers, with 240 scholarships awarded in California.\n\n\u201cUnited Health Foundation is honored to support these outstanding students as they prepare to bring their expertise and enthusiasm to our health care system,\u201d said Kate Rubin, president of United Health Foundation.\n\nUnited Health Foundation announced the 2014-15 scholarships at its sixth annual Diverse Scholars Forum. This year\u2019s forum is the largest yet, bringing more than 100 scholarship recipients to Washington, D.C., from July 23 to 26, to celebrate the scholars\u2019 accomplishments and inspire them to work toward strengthening the nation's health care system. This year\u2019s forum provides the scholars with opportunities to hear from members of Congress and leaders in a variety of health fields and to network with and learn from one another.\n\n\u201cThe United Health Foundation scholarship will help me pursue a career in pediatric nursing,\u201d Mann said. \u201cI enjoy working with kids and would like to make a difference in their lives by assisting them medically and treating their illnesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to help children and help reduce childhood obesity and diabetes,\u201d Zurita said. \u201cThe United Health Foundation scholarship will help me pursue my goal to attend medical school and become a pediatrician.\u201d\n\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) predicts that the United States will experience a severe shortage of physicians, nurses and other medical care providers over the next two decades. According to AAMC, the country will need 124,000 more physicians, 157,000 more pharmacists and 1 million more nurses to meet growing demand for health services, in part because of expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFor more information about the Diverse Scholars Initiative, visit unitedhealthfoundation.org/initiatives and click on \u201cDiverse Scholars.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Submitted by the United Health Foundation", "article_metadata": {"content_section": "news", "description": "News: Two O.C. students receive health care scholarships | health, united, foundation, diverse, care, scholars, scholarships, initiative, help, students", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Jovy Mann of Costa Mesa and Tomas Zurita of Irvine were awarded scholarships from United Health Foundation\u2019s Diverse Scholars Initiative to pursue careers in primary health care.", "title": "Two O.C. students receive health care scholarships", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/health-630751-united-foundation.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/n9uy5a-b88156589z.120140805164606000ghs422gj.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/n9uy5a-b88156589z.120140805164606000ghs422gj.10.jpg"}, "title": "Two O.C. students receive health care scholarships", "description": "Jovy Mann of Costa Mesa and Tomas Zurita of Irvine were awarded scholarships from United Health Foundation\u2019s Diverse Scholars Initiative to pursue careers in primary health care.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ocregister"}, "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/n9uy5a-b88156589z.120140805164606000ghs422gj.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "Keywords": "health, united, foundation, diverse, care, scholars, scholarships, initiative, help, students", "publication_date": "2014-08-05", "access-type": "free", "section": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Two O.C. students receive health care scholarships"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1525\"", "article_summary": "\u201cUnited Health Foundation is honored to support these outstanding students as they prepare to bring their expertise and enthusiasm to our health care system,\u201d said Kate Rubin, president of United Health Foundation.\nSince 2007, United Health Foundation has awarded more than 1,400 scholarships totaling $9.3 million to support diverse students pursing health careers, with 240 scholarships awarded in California.\nThis is part of United Health Foundation\u2019s ongoing commitment to build a more diverse health workforce.\nJovy Mann of Costa Mesa and Tomas Zurita of Irvine were awarded scholarships from United Health Foundation\u2019s Diverse Scholars Initiative to pursue careers in primary health care.\nFor more information about the Diverse Scholars Initiative, visit unitedhealthfoundation.org/initiatives and click on \u201cDiverse Scholars.\u201d\u2013 Submitted by the United Health Foundation"}
