The fall of Tikrit was part of the IS onslaught that stunned Iraqi security forces and the military, which melted away as the militants advanced and captured key cities and towns in the country\u2019s north and west.\n\nLater, the Islamic State group posted graphic images online that appeared to show its gunmen massacring scores of the soldiers after loading the captives onto flatbed trucks and then forcing them to lay face-down in a shallow ditch, their arms tied behind their backs.\n\nOther videos showed masked gunmen bringing the soldiers to a bloodstained concrete river waterfront inside the presidential palaces complex in Tikrit, shooting them in the head and throwing them into the Tigris River.\n\nAfter weeks of bitter clashes, Iraqi forces and allied Shiite militias, succeeded in retaking Tikrit from the Islamic State. Their victory was helped by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes, which were not initially part of the operation.\n\nAmin told The Associated Press that at least 12 bodies were exhumed on Monday. Lab tests will be carried out to match them with DNA samples that have already been taken from families of around 85 percent of the victims.\n\nIraqi state TV showed forensic teams digging in an open area, helped by bulldozers as family members stood nearby. The bodies were tagged with yellow tags while weeping soldiers and relatives lit candles and laid flowers alongside the covered remains. One clip showed unearthed skeletal remains still wearing combat boots.\n\n\u201cThe work is continuing and we expect to discover more mass graves in different areas,\u201d Amin said. \u201cWe expect huge number of bodies to be unearthed.\u201d\n\nDuring their blitz last year, the IS extremists also carried out other mass killings in other areas. One of those massacres was outside the country\u2019s second-largest city of Mosul where they forced some 600 Shiite inmates captured from Badoosh prison to kneel along the edge of a nearby ravine and shot them with automatic weapons. The prisoners had been serving sentences for a range of crimes, from murder and assault to nonviolent offenses.\n\nAnd in Anbar province, the militants shot dead dozens of pro-government Sunni tribal fighters in public areas after capturing their towns.\n\nThe Islamic State\u2019s onslaught plunged Iraq into its worst crisis since the 2011 U.S. troop withdrawal from the country. The militants have also targeted Iraq\u2019s indigenous religious minorities, including Christians and followers of the ancient Yazidi faith, forcing tens of thousands from their homes.\n\nSince then, the IS has carved out a self-styled caliphate in the large area straddling the Iraqi-Syrian border that it now controls.\n\nIn early August, the United States launched airstrikes on the militant group in Iraq, in an effort to help Iraqi forces fight back against the growing threat by the IS militants, who still hold the northern Iraqi province of Ninevah and most of the western province of Anbar, in addition to small areas north of Baghdad in their hands, along with a large swath of land in neighboring Syria.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iraqi forensic teams in the newly liberated city of Tikrit have started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain some of the hundreds of soldiers killed by Islamic State militants last year, a government spokesman said Tuesday.", "Author": "Sinan Salaheddin", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Iraqi forensic teams in the newly liberated city of Tikrit have started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain some of the hundreds of soldiers killed by Islamic State militants last year, a government spokesman said Tuesday.", "title": "Iraqi teams start exhuming mass grave of soldiers in Tikrit", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/7/iraqi-teams-start-exhuming-mass-grave-soldiers-tik/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/06/The_Week_In_Mideast_Photos_.JPEG-04034.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/06/The_Week_In_Mideast_Photos_.JPEG-04034.jpg", "title": "Iraqi teams start exhuming mass grave of soldiers in Tikrit", "description": "Iraqi forensic teams in the newly liberated city of Tikrit have started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain some of the hundreds of soldiers killed by Islamic State militants last yea", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Iraq, Kamil Amin, Baghdad, Tikrit"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd0b\"", "article_summary": "Iraqi state TV showed forensic teams digging in an open area, helped by bulldozers as family members stood nearby.\nAfter weeks of bitter clashes, Iraqi forces and allied Shiite militias, succeeded in retaking Tikrit from the Islamic State.\nBAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Iraqi forensic teams in the newly liberated city of Tikrit have started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain some of the hundreds of soldiers killed by Islamic State militants last year, a government spokesman said Tuesday.\nThe bodies were tagged with yellow tags while weeping soldiers and relatives lit candles and laid flowers alongside the covered remains.\nAnd in Anbar province, the militants shot dead dozens of pro-government Sunni tribal fighters in public areas after capturing their towns."}
