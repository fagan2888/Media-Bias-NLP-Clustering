Charlotte's life probably won't be uneventful. (The New York Post already labeled her \"another liberal crybaby\" on its tasteless front page Sunday.)\n\nBut neither will it be disadvantaged. Her dad is an investment banker and her mom pulled in a reported $600,000 annually from NBC News, where she was a special correspondent for the past three years. Quality child care won't break this couple.\n\nBut Chelsea could make it her signature platform at the non-profit Clinton Foundation, which counts \"empowering women and girls\" among its noteworthy missions.\n\nAccording to the 12-year-old foundation's website: \"Our programs empower women and girls by expanding access to education, increasing economic opportunity, and providing critical health care to young mothers and their newborns. Our goal is to lift millions of women out of poverty \u2014 and with them, their families and entire communities.\"\n\nAffordable child care would be a great place to start. Currently, the Census reports that 12.5 million children 5 and younger are enrolled in child care. In 35 states and Washington, D.C., a year of center-based infant care costs more than a year of in-state tuition plus fees at a four-year public university, according to a 2012 report from the National Association of Child Care Resource & Referral Agencies.\n\nA recent report from Child Care Aware of America found that sending two children to full-time day care accounts for the biggest single household expense in the Northeast, Midwest and South. (The West escaped the list by having such exorbitant housing costs.) Full-time child care costs more than the annual median rent in every single state, according to the report.\n\nThe poorest of poor families receive a tiny bit of government assistance, but not much. Only 1 out of 6 children eligible for federal child care assistance actually received it in 2012, according to the National Association of Child Care Resource & Referral Agencies.\n\nWhich isn't all that surprising, given how severely The Child Care and Development Block Grant, the primary source of government-assisted child care subsidies, is underfunded. A recent analysis of the program found that total spending on child care assistance fell by $1.2 billion in 2012 to its lowest level since 2002.\n\nAnd the vast majority of families, of course, receive no assistance to offset the costs of child care.\n\nChelsea could use her new status as a mother \u2014 and lifelong status as a Clinton \u2014 to agitate for change. Remember when Bill Clinton said he thanks God for his high taxes?\n\n\"Hillary and I and some of our friends in this audience who live in New York probably pay the highest aggregate tax rates in America,\" he told a crowd at Georgetown University in May. \"And I thank God every April 15 that I'm able to do it.\"\n\nThis is Chelsea's in.\n\nShe could say, \"And I thank God some of my dad's \u2014 and my \u2014 tax dollars are being used to make child care safer, healthier and more affordable for the 12.5 million children in this country who utilize it.\"\n\nShe could gather a group of her young mom friends, throw in a few Washington insiders, add a lawmaker or two, and engage them on this national challenge. She could quote the 2013 Child Care Aware report, which says, \"Ensuring this care is high-quality, affordable and available for families is crucial to our nation's ability to produce and sustain an economically viable, competitively positioned workplace. The consequences of the lack of affordable, quality child care are often overlooked, the dots are rarely connected. This does not mean the problems they produce are not real and severe.\"\n\nCheers would fill the auditorium. Bill and Hillary would beam with pride from the sidelines. Charlotte would look on adoringly from the arms of her supportive, loving father.\n\nAnd the rest of us could take comfort in knowing that someday we won't need the salaries of an investment banker and a six-figure special correspondent to afford day care.\n\nhstevens@tribune.com\n\nTwitter @heidistevens13", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Hoping motherhood can inspire Chelsea to push for affordable child care", "date": "2014-09-29", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "For the love of baby Charlotte, can we please do something about the cost of day care now?", "title": "Hoping motherhood can inspire Chelsea to push for affordable child care", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-clinton-baby-inspire-federal-child-care-balanci-20140929-column.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54299602/turbine/ct-clinton-baby-inspire-federal-child-care-balanci-20140929", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp02.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/81536695", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "Chelsea Clinton push for cheap day care, Clinton Foundation affordable day care", "news_keywords": "Chelsea Clinton push for cheap day care, Clinton Foundation affordable day care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "The new mom should use her platform to agitate for more affordable child case in the United States"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd133a\"", "article_summary": "Which isn't all that surprising, given how severely The Child Care and Development Block Grant, the primary source of government-assisted child care subsidies, is underfunded.\nOnly 1 out of 6 children eligible for federal child care assistance actually received it in 2012, according to the National Association of Child Care Resource & Referral Agencies.\nThe consequences of the lack of affordable, quality child care are often overlooked, the dots are rarely connected.\nQuality child care won't break this couple.\nAffordable child care would be a great place to start."}
