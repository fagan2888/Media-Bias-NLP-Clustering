KPMG Buys Trade Management Practice from EntryPoint Consulting

Other recent advisory deals including the firm's purchase of a unit of Axia Consulting and CohnReznick's deal for Watkins Meegan

Advisory firm KPMG has acquired the global trade management practice of EntryPoint Consulting for an undisclosed amount.

The business unit provides global trade services technology and business consulting. EntryPoint, headquartered in Independence, Ohio, provides trade-related software and services.

KPMG says the deal helps it provide services to manage global import and export control risks. The EntryPoint global trade business will join KPMG's trade and customs practice, so regulatory and technology consulting will be offered under one umbrella.

Other recent advisory deals include CohnReznick LLP's combination with Watkins Meegan LLC in September, and KPMG's August purchase of Axia Consulting's workday consulting practice.
