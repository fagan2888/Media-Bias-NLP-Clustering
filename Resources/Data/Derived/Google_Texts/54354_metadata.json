The decision would save the organization an estimated $300,000 annually.\n\n\u201cTo have that extra $300,000 to reallocate to our other rural clinics can make the difference between having someone on-call or not having someone on-call throughout our region,\u201d SEARHC COO Dan Neumeister said in an August 2013 interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nBut after the announcement of the planned closure, more than $100,000 was raised to keep the clinic open for an additional six months, allowing community members like Glory Hole executive director Mariya Lovishchuk the time to figure out the next steps.\n\nNow, with barely a month before Front Street Clinic\u2019s ties with SEARHC are severed, the board for the soon-to-be Front Street Health Center have it all figured out \u2014 though they are still seeking donations to keep the clinic from accruing a deficit in the coming months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a transitional period,\u201d Lovishchuk said. \u201cA hard and stressful period, waiting for grant funds to come through.\u201d\n\nLovishchuk spearheaded the effort to save the clinic from closing its doors and brought together a surprising group of allies to form the board for the Front Street Health Center.\n\n\u201cWe have agencies on the board rather than individuals,\u201d Lovishchuk said. \u201cAgencies as board members bring in resources.\u201d\n\nRepresented on the board along with Lovishchuk are: Front Street Clinic nurse practitioner Janna Brewster, behavioral health clinician Mary Fitzgerald and dentist Ed Linsell; Jeannette Lacey Dunn of Bartlett Regional Hospital; Sarah Hargrave of the Juneau Public Health Center and Kelly Pajinag with Catholic Community Service.\n\nNeumeister said in a Saturday interview it was a very positive transition working with the Homeless Coalition and commended them on organizing into an independent clinic in such short time and \u201creally without any complications or stoppage of care for this pretty vulnerable group.\u201d\n\nCheaper than an ER visit\n\nWithout a clinic serving Juneau\u2019s most vulnerable population, the only other option for Front Street patients is Bartlett\u2019s Emergency Room. Visits to the emergency room for conditions that could be treated at a non-emergency facility put strain on the ER and aren\u2019t cost-effective, according to Bartlett\u2019s Lacey Dunn.\n\nShe provided a rundown of costs for ER visits at BRH, with lower fees around $186 for being seen by a nurse and an additional $103 if seen by a doctor. That doesn\u2019t include costs for procedures, supplies or medications. At the highest level, costs are easily in the thousands without accounting for those additional variable costs. An ambulance ride to the hospital can cost about $600 more.\n\nLacey Dunn called ER visits for all health care needs inappropriate and said there are missing components. If an ER doctor hands a homeless patient a prescription, the patient would be unlikely to be able to fill that prescription.\n\nAnd ER visits only treat the most immediate issues.\n\nLeCount came to Juneau in April 2013, couch surfing with her niece after coming up from Reno, where she was also without a home.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t know which way to turn\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen I got here I was extremely sick, bronchitis and I don\u2019t know what else,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was so sick, just to walk the three blocks from my niece\u2019s house to this clinic, I couldn\u2019t breathe. The first time I saw Janna, she put me on a nebulizer and gave me several inhalers and antibiotics.\u201d\n\nThat was the start, but LeCount visits the clinic every week or two, she said \u2014 more if she finds herself in a place where she needs additional support. She\u2019s received not only medical care, but also mental health and dental care at Front Street Clinic, and she said she has Front Street Clinic to thank for the progress she has made.\n\nLeCount currently lives in transitional housing at St. Vincent de Paul and keeps busy providing care to children also staying there. She also helps out at the Polaris House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m able to give back,\u201d LeCount said. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything I can to help anybody, because I had been in that spot, I didn\u2019t know which way to turn or who to turn to.\u201d\n\nLeCount attributes her health and improved state to the integrated care provided at Front Street Clinic, the ability to treat not just acute issues, but deeper physical and mental ones.\n\n\u201cI have PTSD, severe anxiety and depression. (Front Street Clinic) is helping me to deal with those issues,\u201d LeCount said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with them instead of just stuffing them and pretending they don\u2019t exist. Without (clinician Mary Fitzgerald), I would still be very angry. ... Now I\u2019m learning to cope instead of \u2014 I don\u2019t have to self-medicate anymore. I did before. I self-medicated with anything, everything \u2014 I don\u2019t have to do that anymore.\u201d\n\nLeCount said if she was having a bad time, she could show up at the clinic and Brewster or Fitzgerald would find time for her.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been a Godsend, they both have, I don\u2019t know what other way to put it,\u201d she said.\n\nFront Street Clinic\u2019s Brewster said it\u2019s nice to have a mental health provider available when people are in crisis, or to have a dentist available. The philosophy at the Front Street Clinic is that treating the root of the problems will help get clients to a place where they can better take care of themselves.\n\n\u2018The sickest of sick\u2019\n\nThe clinic ceased to provide dental service in October, but Linsell will resume dental care starting in May. Meanwhile, SEARHC has been taking dental emergencies.\n\n\u201cWe replace missing teeth, we replace a smile,\u201d Linsell said. \u201cThey start feeling better about themselves. With increased mental and medical health, they\u2019re ready to step out into the sunshine.\u201d\n\nFitzgerald said she\u2019s seen it as well, people come in and get dental work done and have new confidence.\n\n\u201cThe integrated health model is a very successful model,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we work well together as a team.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a small team for the number of clients served and the number of patient encounters.\n\nThe three providers, Brewster, Fitzgerald and Linsell, plus one case manager, two nurses, one administrative staff member, a dental assistant and hygienist served about 300 clients during 2,300 visits in 2013, Brewster said.\n\n\u201cWe see the sickest of sick,\u201d she said. \u201cNot ICU, but diabetics, hypertensives, seizures, alcohol and drugs, really serious mental health issues and it can sometimes take weeks to get teeth restored.\u201d\n\nStarting small, then expanding\n\nWhile the staff and community were devastated when the news hit that SEARHC would be closing down Front Street Clinic, the board that formed to keep the clinic open is optimistic about the independent clinic they\u2019ll be unveiling.\n\n\u201cI commend the staff, who have been very dedicated and have been really great and have had a great attitude,\u201d Neumeister said, adding that most, if not all, will stay with the clinic.\n\nThe staff and integrated health philosophy will continue to serve Juneau\u2019s homeless population, as well as expand services to other medically underserved populations, starting first with those who fall in the gap between Medicaid and Affordable Care Act coverage.\n\nThe board is almost certain they\u2019ll receive a Health Resources and Services Administration grant that will fund the treatment of the homeless population, and they will welcome low-income individuals who can pay on a sliding scale.\n\n\u201cThe clinic is to be run really efficiently, with little duplication of services,\u201d the Glory Hole\u2019s Lovishchuk said, adding they will save money because they don\u2019t need their own diagnostics. The clinic is budgeted to run on a mere $40,000 a month.\n\nWhen the transition is complete on May 1 and the clinic opens its doors as Front Street Health Clinic, they plan to start small \u2014 continuing service to current clients and adding others with the most need \u2014 but with high hopes to provide a comprehensive medical home for people who wouldn\u2019t have it, Bartlett\u2019s Hargrave said.\n\n\u201cWe could eventually open up to people who make three to four times that (poverty level income),\u201d Linsell said.\n\n\u201cThe services offered by this clinic I would recommend to anyone,\u201d LeCount said. \u201cThey really will do anything in their power to help you get on your feet \u2014 give you a pair of socks or a hug, you know.\u201d\n\nFor LeCount, the Front Street Clinic has given her faith in a generous community, and for the Front Street Clinic, the outpouring of support from residents in the way of monetary donations has done the same.\n\nFunds are still needed to allow the clinic to continue providing the services that clients like LeCount rely on. Donations may be made through the Juneau Community Foundation for the Front Street Clinic. A fundraiser also will be held at 5 p.m. on May 16 at the Rockwell Ballroom, featuring a cocktail hour, dinner, dessert auction and a film to fit the theme.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great illustration of community coming together to meet an important need,\u201d Lacey Dunn said. \u201cThe top priority is keeping services available. It was a true call to help to the community and the community did answer and continues to answer. It\u2019s been a beautiful experience.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: Corrected to reflect Sarah Hargrave's position with the Juneau Public Health Center, part of the Alaska Division of Public Health.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, Local, MELISSA GRIFFITHS, Dan Neumeister, Hazel LeCount, Janna, Janna Brewster, Jeannette Lacey Dunn, Kelly Pajinag, Lacey Dunn, Mariya Lovishchuk, Mary Fitzgerald, Sarah Hargrave, Kake, Empire, juneauempire, juneauempire.com, Outdoors, Weather, All access, e-edition, iPad, Sports, Real Estate, Jobs, Cars, Homes, Art, Arts & Culture, Neighbors", "og": {"site_name": "Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper", "description": "\"I went from sleeping on sidewalks to not smoking, not drinking, not using,\" said Front Street Clinic patient Hazel LeCount. \"I'm a person of standing in the community because of Janna and Mary and what they've done for me.", "title": "Fresh start for Front Street Clinic", "url": "http://juneauempire.com/local/2014-03-23/fresh-start-front-street-clinic", "image": "http://juneauempire.com/sites/default/files/13192797.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Find the latest news, crime, weather, business and community information from juneauempire.com and the Juneau Empire."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1452\"", "article_summary": "Lacey Dunn called ER visits for all health care needs inappropriate and said there are missing components.\n\u201cI went from sleeping on sidewalks to not smoking, not drinking, not using,\u201d said Front Street Clinic patient Hazel LeCount.\nDonations may be made through the Juneau Community Foundation for the Front Street Clinic.\nAnd ER visits only treat the most immediate issues.\nShe provided a rundown of costs for ER visits at BRH, with lower fees around $186 for being seen by a nurse and an additional $103 if seen by a doctor."}
