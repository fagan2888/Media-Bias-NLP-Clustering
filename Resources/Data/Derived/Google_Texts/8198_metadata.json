Photo: Justin McManus\n\nHannah Robert was eight months into a healthy pregnancy when a four-wheel-drive collided with her car on Boxing Day in 2009, fatally for her baby. She recalls the resulting stillborn caesarean delivery of her daughter, later named Zainab. And the accident, on Warrigal Road, Oakleigh, was the day she felt her life stopped too.\n\nA day earlier, north of Sydney, and a Christmas Day, Brodie Donegan was also eight months pregnant when a driver swerved off the road and hit her while she was walking, killing her unborn daughter, Zoe.\n\nTo call the loss of our daughter a 'serious injury' or 'grievous bodily harm' feels like it trivialises it.\n\nWhen the driver was sentenced, Donegan says she felt a strange feeling sweep across her, a feeling that in the legal system, her daughter had never existed. \"When I was sitting in court, listening to the charges read out, there were only charges against me, no charges against my daughter,\" she recalls. \"She was very much alive to us, and holding her after the accident, we also considered her separate to us, so it was difficult for us to reconcile that she wasn't deserving of her own charge.\"\n\nTogether with her partner and their local MP, Chris Spence, she worked on what has become a controversial foetal rights bill known as \"Zoe's Law\", to try to get the loss of their baby recognised under the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bill, passed in the lower house of the New South Wales Parliament last year, proposes changes to amend the law so that a foetus of 20 weeks or weighing more than 400 grams will be treated as a living person. For the first time, it recognises a crime of grievous bodily harm against an unborn child.\n\nBoth Robert and Donegan agree that current laws in their respective states, which define their loss as an \"injury\", fail to deal with the depth of despair in grieving for a child. But the two women also hold different views on how the laws should be changed, primarily because of the theoretical implications of them.\n\nDonegan believes Zoe's Law will help the legal system better find justice for the loss of pregnancy due to a criminal act. \"There needs to be consistency and recognition to acknowledge the significant loss other than just my injuries,\" she says.\n\nBut Robert believes the bill is not the answer, and fears it has the potential to make mothers invisible. A legal academic at La Trobe University, Robert is concerned that if a foetus is legally defined as a person, the mother's consent for any resulting legal action could be irrelevant.\n\nDespite many children thriving when born at the same stage \u2013 or even earlier \u2013 of gestation that Zainab had reached, Robert believes birth should remain the threshold for legal acknowledgement of a person.\n\n\"The law's concern is, 'OK, was the baby inside or outside?' And I think that's a really appropriate line, a good distinction to make. Birth is such a critical moment, and before then, they are kind of under the mother's protection, so it makes sense that if the law is going recognise and protect that foetus it should be through the mother's legal person.\"\n\nIt is the unintended implications of Zoe's Law that worry the law lecturer, and others in her field. The NSW Bar Association believes the adoption of a definition of a foetus as a living person could be used in other criminal cases, such as manslaughter and murder. Once legislation treating an unborn child as a living person is enacted, it would \"very likely lead to further changes to that law\", the group warns. \"Adoption of the principle in this bill would have obvious implications for late-term abortions, notwithstanding the explicit limitation in the bill relating to medical procedures\".\n\nRobert warns that while Zoe's Law is drafted to create exceptions for anything done to the foetus by the mother with her consent or by a medical professional, she believes human rights claims will still be bought up on behalf of the foetus. \"If you look at other jurisdictions where foetal personhood laws have been introduced, such as Texas, Utah or Poland, what you see is that they not only help undermine the availability of safe abortion, but they also contribute to additional criminal charges for pregnant women, for example, for supplying drugs to their foetus via the umbilical cord,\" she says. Women's groups also fear the bill, an amendment to the Crimes Act, could restrict women's access to late-term abortions and possibly criminalise them.\n\n\"A woman's right to make decisions about her body is a fundamental tenant of her human rights,\" the chairwoman of the Women's Electoral Lobby, Melanie Fernandez, says. \"Granting a foetus rights that could infringe on the mother's is hugely problematic.\"\n\nShe says the bill was first introduced by the Reverend Fred Nile, and is supported by the Attorney-General and former president of NSW Right to Life, Greg Smith.\n\n\"The debate on Zoe's Law comes in a context of a broader attack by conservatives around the country to roll back women's reproductive rights,\" Fernandez says. She believes moves to change abortion laws in Victoria will also undermine women's access to safe abortions.\n\nBoth Fernandez and Robert argue that international precedent laws such as Zoe's Law can create conflict between the rights of the foetus and the rights of the mother. \"This is what we have seen happen in the United States, in which pregnant women have been criminalised for engaging in certain behaviours, such as drinking, or risky sport activities that have been deemed to be acting contrary to the interests of the 'person' they are carrying,\" Fernandez says.\n\nRobert thinks harm to the unborn foetus could ultimately mean that violence towards the mother might go unrecognised. She points to the first prosecution under the Prenatal Protection Act in Texas, in which a man called Gerado Flores was charged with two counts of murder after he assaulted his girlfriend and she miscarried twin foetuses at four months. Although his girlfriend suffered bruising on her arms, face and abdomen, Flores was never charged with causing harm to her, only with the murder of the foetuses she carried.\n\nConcerns like these distress Donegan, who is pro-choice and whose sole aim is the recognition of unborn children lost in the same circumstances as her Zoe, as the result of a criminal act.\n\nBut she welcomes the debate that the bill, which goes before the NSW upper house this year, has created. \"I think it is a subject that people don't really like to talk about, and it is also an area of law that everyone sort of feels uncomfortable with, so I think the conversation in this case is almost as important as the bill itself.\"\n\nRobert agrees debate is good. \"For me there is no urgency in changing the laws,\" she says. \"I think it is more important that we have the debate and clarify how much change is needed before rushing in to legislate.\"\n\nAt the time of the accident, Robert remembers trying to focus on her own grief, rather than on the law. She avoided questions from reporters about if and how laws should be changed to better recognise what had happened to her and Zainab.\n\n\"We'd made a conscious decision as a family in the first few days post-accident to focus on our recovery and remembering our daughter, rather than on the criminal processes.\"\n\nEventually, almost a year after she lost Zainab, the driver who caused the crash was sentenced to three years and five months' jail. He pleaded guilty to five counts of dangerous driving causing serious injury (to Robert) and one count of failing to stop after an accident.\n\nRobert went to court for the hearing and remembers feeling \"odd\" about her loss being characterised as an injury, but also did not expect the proceedings to help with her own healing.\n\n\"From legal practice, it was clear to me that if you expected legal proceedings to provide you with some kind of emotional resolution, you could be waiting forever. And the more I grieved and read about other people's grief, I realised that I don't believe in this idea of 'closure'. There is a point where the grief is no longer the biggest thing in your life, and when it becomes more integrated with everything else, but there is no end point. You never stop being a parent, but that raw keening for your child appears less frequently.\n\n\"Particularly, as a victim of crime, you have very little control over the legal process, so I focused my efforts on the small area where I could have input, into my victim impact statement, and making my daughter visible in that process.\"\n\nIn her statement, which Robert chose to read aloud in the County Court during the driver's plea hearing in 2010, she spoke of how she was eight months into a smooth pregnancy, one she desperately wanted after nine months of unsuccessful fertility treatment. She wrote about being taken to a different hospital to her partner and stepdaughters after the crash, about how she was alone when doctors failed to find Zainab's heartbeat. She remembered that her daughter was 2500 grams and 48 centimetres long, the same length she was when she was born.\n\n\"She had dark curly hair, and skin softer than rose petals. She looked calm but with a slightly worried brow,\" she said. Robert also talked about the 36 photographs taken of her daughter by a midwife at the birth: \"This is all we will ever get.\"\n\nEvery now and again Robert will look through these photos to study her daughter's face when she feels as if the memory is fading. She is still taken aback by images of herself in the pictures, her own dark blonde hair soaked red with blood.\n\nThe judge in the courtroom, Meryl Sexton, wept as she listened to the statement.\n\nFour years after the crash, Robert has decided she is ready to talk about what happened and about the law's relationship with foetus and mother while they share one body. As a legal academic, she believes there is no real functional gap in the law. But she does think language is significant.\n\n\"To call the loss of our daughter a 'serious injury' (in Victoria) or 'grievous bodily harm' (in NSW) feels like it trivialises it,\" she says. \"Grief for a child is very different to the recovery from a physical injury. Ideally, I'd like to see a separate charge for termination of a woman's pregnancy without a woman's consent.\n\n\"At the moment, I don't think that Victoria has got something that adequately addresses the particular harm that we experience.\"\n\nShe believes Zoe's Law was never about harm going unpunished. \"Both in NSW and Victoria, serious jail time is already possible for someone whose violent and or reckless act causes a foetal death.\n\n\"Rather, it is about changing the way the law defines that harm to acknowledge grieving families. So it's really about grief, and legislating around grief. How law functions is important, but we're not robots. And sometimes the way things are phrased is just as important to people as how the law functions. Law has an enormous power to define and acknowledge harms. The difficulty is, however, that everyone grieves differently. And if we are going to tinker with the language the law uses, we need to ensure that those changes don't undermine the effective functioning of the law.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Victoria", "application-name": "The Age", "og": {"site_name": "The Age", "description": "The demands of the law often collide with the pain of personal loss, and it's then that something has to give, as Daniella Miletic reports.", "title": "Zoe's legacy", "url": "http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/zoes-legacy-20140118-311wi.html", "image": "http://www.theage.com.au/content/dam/images/3/1/1/x/h/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.311wi.png/1390056762923.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.theage.com.au/content/dam/images/3/1/1/x/h/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.311wi.png/1390056762923.jpg"}, "title": "Zoe's legacy", "description": "The demands of the law often collide with the pain of personal loss, and it's then that something has to give, as Daniella Miletic reports.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theage"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Age", "fb": {"app_id": 230318243699378}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theage.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The demands of the law often collide with the pain of personal loss, and it's then that something has to give, as Daniella Miletic reports."}, "article_summary": "It is the unintended implications of Zoe's Law that worry the law lecturer, and others in her field.\nDonegan believes Zoe's Law will help the legal system better find justice for the loss of pregnancy due to a criminal act.\nShe believes Zoe's Law was never about harm going unpunished.\n\"The debate on Zoe's Law comes in a context of a broader attack by conservatives around the country to roll back women's reproductive rights,\" Fernandez says.\nBut Robert believes the bill is not the answer, and fears it has the potential to make mothers invisible."}
