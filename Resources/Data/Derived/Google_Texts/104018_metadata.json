It was pretty uneventful. News wasn\u2019t made, important questions went unanswered, and there just wasn\u2019t a lot of value for most viewers to gain from it.\n\nAs someone who has a deeper interest in politics and the media than most people, however, I did find one moment of it to be fairly interesting. It came when O\u2019Reilly asked the president, \u201cDo you think I (not Fox News) am being unfair to you?\u201d\n\nThe president predictably answered yes. When he was asked to elaborate on why he didn\u2019t believe O\u2019Reilly was covering him fairly, he began listing the previous topics that O\u2019Reilly had asked him in the interview: Obamacare, the IRS scandal, and Benghazi.\n\nI found this pretty telling in an interview that otherwise didn\u2019t tell us a whole lot. You see, it didn\u2019t seem to be the specific questions that Obama felt were unjust. In fact, I\u2019ve hardly seen any reactive criticism of the questions that were asked, even from from the liberal left. No, it was the issues themselves (and the insistence of O\u2019Reilly to ask questions about those issues) that seemed to be what the president was categorizing as \u201cunfair.\u201d\n\nNow, I certainly understand why President Obama would prefer not to discuss such topics ever again. They make him look bad. But are those topics unfair to bring up with the president? I think any fair-minded person (pun not intended) would answer no to that question.\n\nEven the New York Times (a paper generally very favorable to President Obama), in a piece written by Peter Baker on the interview, classified the topics O\u2019Reilly referenced as \u201cthe most controversial moments of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency.\u201d\n\nIt sure seems to me that it would be nothing short of media malpractice not to ask a president about the most controversial moments of his presidency when given the opportunity \u2013 especially when no one has been held accountable for those moments, and several legitimate questions about each of them have never been answered. In many cases, they haven\u2019t even been asked \u2013 not by journalists who aren\u2019t employed by Fox News, anyway.\n\nTo me, that\u2019s perhaps the most remarkable part of all of these scandals. Because the mainstream media has never given them the attention they truly deserve, the conservative media\u2019s pursuit of answers and accountability comes across like a cheap shot \u2013 a below-the-belt strike that President Obama deems to be unfair.\n\nAn interesting question for someone in the media to one day ask President Obama would be whether or not he felt the media coverage of political controversies during the Bush era was fair. I wonder what he\u2019d say about the 60 front-page New York Times stories on Abu Ghraib, the media-obsession over Plamegate, and the intense scrutiny of the dismissal of U.S. attorneys. None of those controversies ever rose to the level of significance that the aforementioned Obama controversies do.\n\nNo one died at Abu Ghraib, unlike in Benghazi, and blame for the incident wasn\u2019t placed on some fabricated story and scapegoat. Millions of Americans weren\u2019t affected by Plamegate like they were by the lies told about the Affordable Care Act. The legal dismissal of 7 U.S. attorneys isn\u2019t anywhere in the ballpark of hundreds of conservative groups being targeted with extra scrutiny, harassment, and stall tactics by the IRS.\n\nThe mainstream media was clearly very proud of their aggressive coverage of Bush\u2019s controversies. But when the stakes are much higher with a Democratic president, Fox News\u2019 pursuit of answers is deemed by the president and also much of the media as being unfair. Isn\u2019t that interesting?\n\nAnd let\u2019s be frank about one more thing: If George W. Bush skirted around answering questions on controversial topics the way President Obama did with Bill O\u2019Reilly last Sunday, there would have been an absolute uproar from every corner of the national media. And if Bush had responded to such questioning with answers like, \u201cI try not to focus on the fumbles, but on the next play \u201d few in the media would have found that at all acceptable.\n\nThere absolutely is unfairness surrounding stories like Obamacare, the IRS scandal, and Benghazi, but it doesn\u2019t come from the idea that the conservative media is too fevered in their pursuit of answers. It\u2019s comes from the fact that the rest of the media is largely disinterested in going after the truth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I largely agree with Bernie Goldberg's assessment of Bill O'Reilly's interview with President Obama on Superbowl Sunday.
