A final version of the report will be circulated publicly and presented to the U.N. Human Rights Council. The report will include recommendations to Canada, indigenous governing bodies and, possibly, other interested parties on how to address issues of ongoing concern to Indigenous Peoples.\n\nRELATED: Anaya Bringing UN Human Rights Investigation to Canada\n\nAnaya\u2019s visit was being planned earlier this year as revelations about past and continuing violations against Indigenous Peoples in Canada came to light. Stories recently re-emerged about Canadian health officials using experimental vaccines on indigenous children in the 1940s rather than address the conditions of poverty that led to their illnesses.\n\nRELATED: \u2018Not Even Human\u2019 How Canadian Govt. Abused Aboriginal Children in TB Experiments\n\nThe recent death of Bella Laboucan-McLean, the 25-year-old sister of Lubicon Cree activist and Greenpeace environmental advocate Melina Laboucan-Massimo, has prompted provincial prime ministers to call for a national inquiry into the ongoing issue of missing and murdered aboriginal women, of which there are hundreds of unsolved cases across Canada. Laboucan-McLean was the third unexplained death of an indigenous woman in Toronto in recent months.\n\nRELATED: Mysterious, Tragic Death Aboriginal Activist\u2019s Sister Renews Calls for National Inquiry\n\nHarper\u2019s prorogation of the Canadian Parliament comes as his Conservative government is mired in a Senate spending scandal that has simmered through the summer and is continuing into fall, according to Post Media. The scandal involves Conservative Senator Pamela Wallin\u2014a close friend of Harper\u2019s\u2014who is required to repay $100,600 in improper travel bills. Wallin has already repaid $38,369 to the Senate. If she doesn\u2019t pay the rest by September 22, the Senate would take 20 percent of her $135,200 annual salary until her bill is paid, which could take four years, according to the report.\n\nCanada\u2019s Governor General David Johnson granted Harper\u2019s request for prorogation\u2014which is a fancy word for discontinuing a session of Parliament, but not dissolving it. According to the online Eytmology Dictionary, prorogue is an early-15th-century word meaning \"to prolong, extend,\" from a 14th-century Old French word \u201cproroger\u201d or \u201cproroguer,\u201d which comes from the Latin prorogare, literally \"to ask publicly.\"\n\nBy granting Harper\u2019s request, Johnston officially killed any government legislation that hadn\u2019t made its way out of the House of Commons, and gave the Conservative government more time to chart its course toward the next election, PostMedia reported. This is the fourth time that Harper has prorogued Parliament prorogued since becoming prime minister in 2006.\n\nTwo-thirds of Canadians disapprove of Harper\u2019s plan to prorogue Parliament, according to a Hill Times Online Forum Research poll.\n\n\u201cWhen correctly used, as it is being this time, prorogation is a perfectly legitimate Parliamentary maneuver, but the Prime Minister has poisoned the chalice with his past misapplications of this tactic, and the public now has no patience with it,\u201d Forum Research president Lorne Bozinoff said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s decision to prorogue\u2014or discontinue\u2014Parliament\u2019s current session has forced James Anaya, the United Nations SpecU.N.
