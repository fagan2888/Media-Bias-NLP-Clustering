Colorado Springs police were called.\n\nThe dead man had long shaggy, graying hair. He had been stabbed several times.\n\nThe amount of bleeding at the location where he was found suggested it was the same spot where he had been attacked, just south of Cimmaron Bridge.\n\nA perimeter was set up. The El Paso County coroner\u2019s office was called and the crime scene was searched.\n\nThe bearded dead man was a well-known transient, whose campsite was about three-quarters of a mile away.\n\nJohn Vincent Knudsen was described by family as somewhat of a gypsy.\n\nAfter his birth in Fort Ord, Calif., in 1956 Knudsen traveled through Europe and the United States as his father was frequently transferred to new U.S. Army assignments.\n\n\u201cThese years of traveling, seeing new places, meeting new people and experiencing new things continued to influence John throughout the remainder of his life,\u201d family members would write in an obituary.\n\nHe had gone throughout the country as a long-haul driver.
