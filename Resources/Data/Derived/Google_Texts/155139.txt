Blackstone Buys Arlington-Backed Engine Parts Manufacturer MB Aerospace

PE-backed Imaginetics bought Azmark, Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway acquired Precision Castparts and Kaman purchased Timken Alcor

The Blackstone Group LP (NYSE: BX) is acquiring aerospace engine maker MB Aerospace from Arlington Capital Partners.

MB Aerospace manufactures parts that are used to build airplane engines for clients that include Pratt & Whitney, General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) and Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA). MB Aerospace CEO Craig Gallagher, who will continue to lead the Motherwell, Scotland-based company, says MB Aerospace will use Blackstone’s investment to grow organically and via acquisition. Arlington acquired MB Aerospace in 2013 and in that same year the target purchased Delta Industries.

A need to upgrade airplane fleets has been attracting buyer interest in the aerospace sector. Some recent deals include Kidd & Co. and Centerfield Capital Partners-backed Imaginetics LLC buying Azmark Aerosystems LLC; Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A) adding Precision Castparts Corp.; and Kaman Corp. (NYSE: KAMN) purchasing Timken Alcor Aerospace Technologies Inc.

Moelis and Co. (NYSE: MC) and Kirkland & Ellis LLP are advising Arlington. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP is representing Blackstone.
