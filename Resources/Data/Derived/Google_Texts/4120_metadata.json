If there\u2019s ever going to be a genuine, durable peace in the world, we have to overcome this tendency. And we atheists have to realize that we\u2019re subject to the same pull of tribalism as are religious believers.\n\nYes, religion has been a source of conflict for millennia\u2014but religion is just an especially organized form of tribalism. Human beings come by it honestly. As social psychologist Jonathan Haidt observed in his book \u201cThe Righteous Mind,\u201d \u201cour ancestors faced the adaptive challenge of forming and maintaining coalitions that could fend off challenges and attacks from rival groups\u201d for eons. It may even be in our DNA.\n\nNew Atheists like Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and Bill Maher \u2014 with their legions of followers, numbering in the millions just on Twitter \u2014 continue to employ the Us vs. Them rhetoric of tribalism. But what these New Atheists fail to realize is that even if their criticisms of religion are correct, pointing them out does nothing to combat tribalism\u2014in fact, it only strengthens it. Their faith in the power of rationality, which is effective but not perfect, blinds them to the larger problem.\n\nThis isn\u2019t surprising, because science has convincingly shown that individuals don\u2019t really reason well on their own\u2014our rationality is unreliable because of the pervasiveness of motivated reasoning. This suggests that the only cure for our cognitive biases is other people. The problem is that we\u2019re more receptive to alternatives only when challenged by members of our own tribe. Atheists as well as religious believers are relatively immune to attacks from those \u201cother\u201d people.\n\nSo what are we to do? Ironically, we have to expand our notion of what our tribe is\u2014with the ultimate goal of expanding that notion so wide that the tribal concept vanishes altogether. We have to bring people together who will challenge each other\u2019s positions while also being bound by having something in common, a common purpose or a set of common values.\n\nMy fellow atheist blogger at Patheos, Adam Lee, recently noted that \u201catheist groups, especially atheist student groups, are increasingly joining forces with other social change movements and emphasizing how their goals and ours intersect\u201d in order to combat social conservatives who use religion as justification for inequality. That\u2019s a great start, and Lee is correct\u2014 that kind of cohesion makes us stronger.\n\nLee goes on to say that \u201cwhen we look outward, beyond the borders of the atheist community, the same principle holds: The way to win political battles is by finding and making common cause with allies.\u201d Lee says that atheists\u2019 natural allies are in the progressive movement, most prominently LGBT rights groups and feminists, because they have most often been the targets of religious harassment and oppression.\n\nBut I\u2019d like to encourage my fellow atheists to push the circle of our tribe out a little bit further than that. Combining the forces of secularism with the progressive religious movements of the various Abrahamic religions, for example, can achieve even more than we can by ourselves. Forget about disabusing believers of their core convictions with the \u201cuniversal acid\u201d of rationality\u2014the best way to fight for social justice and pluralism is to ally ourselves with those who share the same values, regardless of their metaphysical beliefs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prominent atheists like Bill Maher and Richard Dawkins judge people of faith.
