But twin decisions from the Supreme Court Thursday and Friday dealt landmark triumphs not only for the White House but for the Democratic coalition as a whole.\n\nOn Thursday, the Supreme Court issued 6-3 ruling upholding subsidies for Americans purchasing insurance through the federal health exchange. The ruling \u2014 an unequivocal win for the administration \u2014 not only shielded more than six million Americans from effectively losing their insurance coverage, but it signaled the likely end of legal assaults on the bill both derided and praised under the moniker \"Obamacare.\"\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Obama: ACA Is 'Here to Stay' 1:48 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nClearly viewing the ruling as the long-sought end to legal limbo for the health care bill, Obama claimed vindication, saying in a Rose Garden statement that \"the Affordable Care Act is here to stay.\"\n\nRelated: Obama: My Health Care Law Is 'Here to Stay'\n\n\"Five years in, this is no longer about a law. This is not about the Affordable Care Act as legislation, or Obamacare as a political football. This is health care in America,\" he declared.\n\nIn what is seen as a big victory for civil rights advocates and the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday also rejected an attempt to narrow the scope of the Fair Housing Act, one of the nation's most important civil rights laws.\n\nAnd on Friday, Obama again responded to another ruling from the high court \u2014 this time a landmark decision that enshrined the constitutionality of the right to same-sex marriage.\n\n\"Today, we can say in no uncertain terms that we've made our union a little more perfect,\" Obama said, his voice thick with emotion even as he forcefully noted his administration's previous efforts to pave the way for marriage rights by ceasing its legal backing of the Defense of Marriage Act and ending the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy for members of the military.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed 'Love Is Love,' Obama Says After High Court Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage 1:31 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision capped a breathtakingly rapid change in American public opinion on acceptance of same sex marriage, largely during Obama's tenure.\n\nIn October of 2009, just 41 percent of Americans favored allowing gays and lesbians to marry, while 62 percent opposed such a move, according to polling from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal. Now, nearly six-in-ten back the right to marry, with just 33 percent opposed.\n\nThe president himself was among those who reversed his position on the issue, affirming personal support for gay marriage only in May 2012.\n\nRelated: 'Historic Victory': Reactions to Supreme Court's Gay Marriage Ruling Pour In\n\nDespite the cheering of same-sex marriage advocates still echoing outside the court on Friday, Obama's week ended not with a victory lap but with a return to the thorny issue of race relations.\n\nEulogizing Rev. Clementa Pinckney, one of the nine African-American church attendees killed in the Charleston shooting, Obama squarely addressed not only violent racism in America but the subtle and insidious aspects of prejudice that restrain real equality.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Obama Leads Church in Singing of 'Amazing Grace' 2:37 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\n\"Maybe we now realize the way racial bias can infect us even when we don't realize it, so that we're guarding against not just racial slurs, but we're also guarding against the subtle impulse to call Johnny back for a job interview but not Jamal,\" he said.\n\nStill, Zelizer notes that, while Obama's address in Charleston offered soaring rhetoric, the circumstances of his appearance at Pinckney's funeral showed just how deep the nation's wounds remain when it comes to racial inequality.\n\n\"His speech [Friday,] a deeply moving speech, also reflected the limits of what he's been able to accomplish,\" he said. \"On the issue of racial relations, the progress has been pretty slow.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president won a series of huge victories that not only will boost him in the short term, but help cement his legacy as a driver of broader change.", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "The president won a series of huge victories that not only will boost him in the short term, but help cement his legacy as a driver of broader change.", "title": "For Obama \u2014 and America \u2014 a Week for the History Books", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/obama-america-week-history-books-n382841", "image": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_26/1096811/150627-president-obama-flag-speech-yh-1039a_284b19ec6a11f8dfe8da25f3d99935e5.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "The president won a series of huge victories that not only will boost him in the short term, but help cement his legacy as a driver of broader change.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_26/1096811/150627-president-obama-flag-speech-yh-1039a_284b19ec6a11f8dfe8da25f3d99935e5.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "For Obama \u2014 and America \u2014 a Week for the History Books - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-27", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/obama-america-week-history-books-n382841", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Politics,White House,White House,U.S. news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd6f9\"", "article_summary": "Related: Obama: My Health Care Law Is 'Here to Stay'\"Five years in, this is no longer about a law.\nThis is health care in America,\" he declared.\nMany expected the Supreme Court to gut his signature health care law.\nOn Thursday, the Supreme Court issued 6-3 ruling upholding subsidies for Americans purchasing insurance through the federal health exchange.\nThe Supreme Court ruled Obama's way in three landmark cases."}
