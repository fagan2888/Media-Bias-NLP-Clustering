Donald Trump unveiled his tax policy, and it turns out he wants to build a huge wall around rich people's inheritances. And reporters couldn't tell if President Obama clinked glasses with Vladimir Putin at the U.N., but Obama looked no worse for the wear after the shirtless fistfight we assume occurred backstage. This is HUFFPOST HILL for Monday, September 28th, 2015:\n\nKEVIN MCCARTHY'S SPEAKER PITCH: YOU + ME = LATE NIGHTS ON THE FLOOR - He made it official today via email to members: \"You all know me. We\u2019ve spent late nights on the House Floor together. I\u2019ve visited your districts and met your families and constituents. More importantly, I have gotten to know your ideas, your goals, and your vision for our conference and our country.\"\n\nWHO ELSE WANTS THIS AWFUL JOB? Laura Barron-Lopez: \"So far, only one other member has announced a run for the post. Over the weekend, Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), a member of the conservative faction, said he would run for speaker. Webster could make it more difficult for McCarthy to garner the 218 needed to win the spot if he woos the House Freedom Caucus. Members of the conservative caucus said on Sunday that they will hold one-on-one meetings with people running for speaker and other leadership posts that could become open during the shuffle.\" [HuffPost]\n\nHillary Clinton said something mean about the Pumpkin Spice Latte.\n\nPAUL RYAN THINKS THE PRICE IS RIGHT - Jake Sherman: \"House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan is throwing his weight behind Rep. Tom Price for majority leader, a significant boost for the Georgia Republican, and a blow to Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) and others who are vying for the spot. Price is quickly gathering a good deal of conservative support for his bid for the No. 2 House GOP leadership slot. Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) also endorsed Price Monday. 'Tom Price is a committed conservative and a good friend,' Ryan said in a statement.\" [Politico]\n\nCARLY FIORINA AGREES WITH TORTURING SOME FOLKS - Michael Isikoff: \"Positioning herself as a steely advocate of aggressive counterterrorism programs, Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina offered a vigorous defense of CIA waterboarding as a tactic that helped 'keep our nation safe' in the aftermath of 9/11. 'I believe that all of the evidence is very clear -- that waterboarding was used in a very small handful of cases [and] was supervised by medical personnel in every one of those cases,' Fiorina told Yahoo News. 'And I also believe that waterboarding was used when there was no other way to get information that was necessary.' A Senate report last year portrayed waterboarding as 'near drownings' that were tantamount to torture and concluded that the agency\u2019s often brutal interrogations produced little actionable intelligence.\" [Yahoo]\n\nDELANEY DOWNER - Robert Macdonald is the mayor of Lewiston, Maine, and he wants everyone to know who's on welfare and where they live. In a column for a local paper last week, the mayor of Maine's second-largest city proposed an online registry of welfare recipients. He said he would submit legislation to the Maine State Legislature 'asking that a website be created containing the names, addresses, length of time on assistance and the benefits being collected by every individual on the dole.\" [HuffPost]\n\nDoes somebody keep forwarding you this newsletter?

Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly, Obama described Assad as a tyrant and as the chief culprit behind the four-year civil war in which at least 200,000 people have died and millions have been driven from their homes internally or abroad as refugees. 'The United States is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the conflict,' Obama said at the annual gathering of world leaders. 'But we must recognize that there cannot be, after so much bloodshed, so much carnage, a return to the pre-war status quo.' In voicing a willingness to deal with Iran and Russia, both staunch backers of Assad, Obama was openly acknowledging their influence in Syria and swallowing a somewhat bitter pill for the United States.\" [Reuters]\n\nFrom the pool report: Obama and Putin shook hands. But there is some debate in the pool whether the two clinked wine glasses, as our view was briefly blocked. Following Mr. Obama's toast, which ended with the remark, '...and may we never abandon the pursuit of peace,' the two did not clink glasses, although Mr. Obama did clink glasses with several other table mates.\"\n\nBIDEN WEIGHING EXCITING OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK INTO MICROPHONE - Vice President Joe Biden, who is not actually running for president, is welcome at the first Democratic debate on CNN, the network says. Jose A. DelReal: \"The news organization's apparent message to Biden: despite the fact that he remains publicly uncommitted to launching a 2016 presidential run, it will keep a spot open for him.\" [WashPost]\n\nREVOLVING DOOR SPINARAMA - Megan Wilson: \"Matt Kellogg, a lobbyist for an oil and gas industry group, is heading to work for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Monday.

The comments came at an event Monday at Trump Tower, where Mr. Trump unveiled aplan that would eliminate income taxes for millions of lower-income households and cut the tax rate on businesses.\" Wow, how did he come up with 6 percent growth?
