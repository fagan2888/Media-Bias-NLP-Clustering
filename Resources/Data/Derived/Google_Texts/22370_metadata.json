Such threats are constitutionally unprotected, and should indeed be punished. But the ban on intentionally causing \u201cserious emotional distress\u201d to a minor is far broader, and runs afoul of the First Amendment.\n\nAn example of the kind of conduct this law might cover is a 17-year-old girl who learns that her 17-year-old boyfriend was cheating on her, and harshly condemns him in Facebook posts, hoping that her friends will socially ostracize him.\n\nAnother example of a potential new cyberbullying criminal is a newspaper columnist or blogger who excoriates an underage criminal \u2014 or cheating high school athlete \u2014 several times, hoping that the criminal or cheater will feel ashamed and publicly condemned. Or consider a high school student who repeatedly e-mails friends, teachers or parents about another student\u2019s bullying or racist epithets or cheating, hoping and expecting that someone will admonish the student and shame him into changing his ways or at least admitting his guilt.\n\nThe bill defines social media as \u201cany electronic medium\u201d that lets people share user-generated content, expressly including e-mail and blogs, and by implication also covering Facebook, Twitter and the like.\n\nSo, each of these people would end up being a criminal under the proposed bill, so long as the person is found to have intentionally created serious emotional distress.\n\nBut what constitutes \u201cserious emotional distress\u201d is ill-defined and wide open to arbitrary enforcement. For instance, the bill specifically states that a victim of cyberbullying \u201cneed not receive professional treatment or counseling as proof that the victim suffered serious emotional distress.\u201d\n\nThat is hardly the kind of clarity we should expect from a criminal statute.\n\nAnd beyond this, some speech is constitutionally protected even if it is intended to cause \u201cserious emotional distress.\u201d Each of the above examples may be seen by a prosecutor, judge or jury as likely to cause \u201cserious emotional distress,\u201d and thus be criminal conduct under this bill. Yet the First Amendment protects the speech in those examples.\n\nWe realize that people are worried about teenagers taunting one another online. In a few situations, such taunting has contributed to teenagers\u2019 suicide. But we\u2019re not sure there\u2019s any way of clearly defining which distressing speech about minors should be criminal and which shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 any more than there\u2019s a way of clearly defining, for instance, which emotionally cruel romantic breakups (a form of cruelty that has at times also led to suicide) should be criminal.\n\nAnd, in any event, this statute surely doesn\u2019t offer any such distinction. It isn\u2019t limited to speech to a person (as traditional telephone harassment statutes have done, for instance) but also covers speech about a person. It covers any online communications that intentionally inflict serious emotional distress, however commonplace and justifiable they might be. It even covers speech on publicly significant topics, such as crime or cheating by juveniles, as well as speech about people\u2019s daily lives (such as romantic breakups).\n\nWe hope the Colorado Senate recognizes the significant constitutional problems with this bill and acts appropriately.\n\nEugene Volokh teaches free speech law at UCLA School of Law.
