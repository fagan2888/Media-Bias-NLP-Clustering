And youth unemployment dropped only slightly, according to the youth-focused organization Generation Opportunity, down to 11.2 percent from 11.8 percent in August.\n\n\u201cAnother month of more of the same, where young people are really struggling in an economy that still hasn\u2019t recovered, that hasn\u2019t offered any economic prosperity or opportunity to my generation,\u201d Evan Feinberg, president of Generation Opportunity, told Red Alert Politics.\n\nFeinberg pointed to concern about upcoming implementation of Obamacare as part of the reason for the weak September numbers.\n\n\u201cThis report does not reflect the government shutdown, but it does reflect the uncertainty surrounding Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not just the uncertainty surrounding Obamacare, but the actual influence of the law\u2019s provisions that are putting mandates and taxes and requirements on small businesses that are preventing them from hiring young workers.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s own data, not included in the BLS report, indicates that the employment situation over the first couple weeks of October is also not good.\n\n\u201cWeekly employment indicators not in today\u2019s report suggest that the labor market situation deteriorated in early October, coinciding with the shutdown and the threat of a possible default,\u201d the White House website outlines.\n\nThe first couple weeks of October also coincide with the embarrassingly flawed rollout of Obamacare.\n\nFeinberg told Red Alert that the full implementation of Obamacare over the next few months will continue to make things difficult for young Americans. And the tough employment situation created by a lack of jobs could also contribute to an eventual failure of the Obamacare system as a whole \u2014 a system that relies heavily on young, healthy people signing up for coverage through state or federal exchanges.\n\n\u201cThis healthcare law is in big trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just the fact that people can\u2019t enroll if they want to, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t want to enroll.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "As the implementation of Obamacare loomed on the horizon, youth unemployment remained at more than 11 percent in the month of September, showing the first signs that uncertainty about President Barack Obama's healthcare law was going to hurt young Americans.", "title": "Sept. youth unemployment numbers show first signs of Obamacare...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/02/tdionisopoulos_avatar-400x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/10/22/sept-youth-unemployment-numbers-show-first-signs-of-obamacare-hurting-young-americans/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "youth-unemployment", "published_time": "2013-10-22T12:36:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-22T12:47:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b69\"", "article_summary": "Feinberg pointed to concern about upcoming implementation of Obamacare as part of the reason for the weak September numbers.\nFeinberg told Red Alert that the full implementation of Obamacare over the next few months will continue to make things difficult for young Americans.\n\u201cThis report does not reflect the government shutdown, but it does reflect the uncertainty surrounding Obamacare,\u201d he said.\nAnd youth unemployment dropped only slightly, according to the youth-focused organization Generation Opportunity, down to 11.2 percent from 11.8 percent in August.\nAs the implementation of Obamacare loomed on the horizon, youth unemployment remained at more than 11 percent in the month of September, showing the first signs that uncertainty about President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law was going to hurt young Americans."}
