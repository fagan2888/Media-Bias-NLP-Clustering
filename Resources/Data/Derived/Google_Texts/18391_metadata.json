As the head of the lobbying group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, she was the voice of the industry as it grappled with Obamacare. Now she leads EmblemHealth, which insures 3.2 million people as the parent company of Group Health Inc., better known as GHI, and HIP Health Plan of New York, known as HIP.\n\nAs EmblemHealth\u2019s president and chief executive, Ms. Ignagni, 61, is returning to her labor roots. From 1982 to 1993, she was director of the AFL-CIO\u2019s Department of Employee Benefits. EmblemHealth provides health coverage for about 95% of city employees, retirees and their families.\n\nHer first challenge is to address the insurer\u2019s red ink: HIP and GHI reported combined net losses of $40 million in the first quarter, following a drop of $494 million in 2014 on $7 billion in revenue. In sharp contrast, HIP and GHI were profitable from 2010 to 2013, with combined net income averaging $152 million.\n\nLet's tackle this one first. Is Emblem going to convert to a for-profit insurer?\n\nNo. Our board has made a very clear decision [that] we are, and will be, a nonprofit plan. We have a wonderful tradition to build on. I\u2019m very comfortable with the decision they made.\n\nYou spent 22 years lobbying at AHIP and shocked Washington and the insurance industry by leaving. Why did you ditch the policy arena for the operational side of health insurance?\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last three or four years working intensely on the operational issues of implementing the Affordable Care Act. Meeting the best and brightest leaders of health plans allowed me to work under the hood, so to speak. I still enjoy broad policy issues. But to have the opportunity to shift gears and make the promise of affordable coverage a reality is very exciting.\n\nAny trepidation about that decision?\n\nThis will sound insincere, but I was focused on the upside and opportunity. Emblem has this mission of affordable coverage\u2014city workers, unions, Medicaid, special populations\u2014that\u2019s our tradition. I feel like the luckiest person in the world being offered this job.\n\nIt's no secret that EmblemHealth is unprofitable. This is your first job running an insurer. Do you feel equipped to turn this ship around?\n\nPLAY/LIST BRONX IS UP, BATTERY\u2019S DOWN:\n\n\"I moved to the city at the end of July. I\u2019ve been traveling to neighborhoods and learning the subway, minimizing the potential for getting lost in the city, which is high for a newbie.\u201d\n\nFIRST STOPS:\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art, the Met and La Traviata, performed by the Metropolitan Opera outdoors at Lincoln Center Plaza.\n\nDINING:\n\n\u201cWhat I find really interesting in New York is the number of family-owned restaurants\u2014Greek, Chinese, Spanish. I really enjoy them. Going to one of the wonderful fancy restaurants in the city: That\u2019s not relaxing to me.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn day one, I confronted those issues with our employees. I laid out our challenges and opportunities. We have a very clear strategy on the administrative side to address issues in ways other plans address those issues.\n\nThat sounds like layoffs and restructuring.\n\nEvery plan looks to make sure it is always right-sizing its workforce. Emblem was doing that before I walked in the door, for administrative efficiencies. We\u2019re looking at our corporate management structure and how to support our mission.\n\nInsurers are consolidating. How can an independent nonprofit be successful as the top five health insurers morph into three?\n\nThe answer revolves around the people who work at Emblem. I\u2019ve been so impressed by the training and commitment of the 4,000 workers at Emblem and another 2,500 at Advantage Care Physicians. We\u2019re a significant employer in the region.\n\nBut how will you differentiate EmblemHealth?\n\nPaying for quality and value has to be real. We have an incentive structure for hospitals and clinicians. And having Advantage Care Physicians, an embedded physicians\u2019 practice, mobilizes the mission. I\u2019m very enthusiastic about discussions with hospitals to engage in new contracts with quality and performance standards. We can move to a very different set of offerings in the market to tell our story to everyone. For example, we can provide a tristate strategy for employers.\n\nHow will your background working in heated national politics play in New York?\n\nI\u2019ll leave it to others to judge how my background fits in with this company. I have significant experience in working with various stakeholders and building consensus. I will be very involved with policy in the city, Albany and Washington.\n\nWho are your lobbying targets?\n\nThere is a very strong concern\u2014not only among health plans\u2014about hospital consolidation. When a system purchases a community hospital, that increases costs. It is a broad issue for employers and individual purchasers. I was stunned on my arrival to find out one of the hospitals we contract with was being purchased by a system. Our costs will rise 60%. That\u2019s a tangible example of how consolidation affects the market. It is a serious policy issue.\n\nAnd that is your growth strategy?\n\nOur plan is to achieve this promise of affordability. How do you work with physicians on paying for value? Picking your partners is a start. We will look at how to structure benefits. We have an embedded medical home through Advantage Care. The city, labor and employers know the value of that. Emblem is the East Coast version of Kaiser Permanente. We have an opportunity to add value. We need to tell that story.\n\nWill EmblemHealth continue operating in all its current market segments?\n\nWe will stay in the individual and small-group markets. In the commercial market, we will continue offering affordable, effective coverage. That\u2019s what we are known for. That\u2019s what people expect. That\u2019s what we will deliver.\n\nSign Up for Health Pulse Brought to you by Crain's New York Business, Health Pulse is a subscription-only website focused on the business of health care.
