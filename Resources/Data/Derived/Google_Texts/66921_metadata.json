We have never before seen the kind of campaign we are seeing this year within the Republican Party. All their chickens are coming home to roost. The worst excesses and policies of those running as Tea Party candidates in the past few years are combined in the two leading candidates, Donald Trump and Canadian born Rafael 'Ted' Cruz.\n\nTrump and Cruz are espousing policies and positions appealing to the worst instincts in our nation in an effort to heighten people's fears over terrorism and the economy. They are playing to existing racism and the intolerance of the religious right in America. They think nothing of lying to excite a crowd or gain a vote.\n\nTrump is speaking to the least educated in the nation. Cruz is speaking to them and evangelical voters consciously displaying a total lack of respect for our founding fathers who understood what they were doing when they opted for a clear separation of church and state. They understood people came to America to escape religious persecution and to be allowed to practice religion, or not practice it, as they saw fit and not have government pass laws favoring the beliefs of one religion over another.\n\nThe founding fathers, all white men, did leave things out of our constitution and some were added with the Bill of Rights. We just celebrated the 224th Anniversary of its ratification. Because some were and represented slave owners it wasn't until the civil war was fought that between 1865 and 1870 the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments were passed giving African Americans their rights. It wasn't until 1920 with the ratification of the nineteenth amendment women got the right to vote. We have yet to pass the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to fully include women in the constitution. But change does come, even if much too slowly, because the majority of American people are decent and with the right leadership eventually overcome their fears and biases to do the right thing.\n\nTrump and Cruz campaign on the premise they can turn back the progress we have made and it could happen. They could appoint arch-conservative Supreme Court Justices and reverse decisions including Roe v. Wade legalizing abortion, Obergefell v. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage, and a host of others like The National Federation of Independent Business et. al. v Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services et. al. declaring the Affordable Care Act constitutional.\n\nTrump has called for building a wall to keep out Mexicans and for deporting eleven million undocumented immigrants, most who came here to make a better life for themselves and their families. He would close our borders to Muslims, supports registering those here now and sending government informants into mosques. His recent vulgar attack against Clinton was considered obscene enough that many media outlets bleeped it out. He sounds like he is adopting fascism and the views of Mussolini. Ted Cruz, the current reincarnation of Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-WI) who conducted the witch-hunt for communists and homosexuals in government, said he will reverse laws on same-sex marriage; approves building the wall to keep out Mexicans and opposes any pathway to citizenship for the eleven million immigrants here now. He refuses to call Trump to task for any vulgarity or race baiting and opposes equal pay for equal work for women. He opposes any controls on the sale of guns including assault weapons. He regrets his vote for Chief Justice John Roberts because he voted that the Affordable Care Act was constitutional allowing millions of Americans to get healthcare. He supported shutting down the entire government because of a small allocation for Planned Parenthood which works to protect women's health.\n\nThese are the two men leading in all polls for the Republican nomination. None of the other men running, with the exception of Jeb Bush and only because he is in a personal feud with Trump, is saying anything against the policies or positions they support. As an American who cares about the rights of people and the future of our nation, I believe it is imperative the positions and irrational bluster of Trump and Cruz be defeated so soundly they are seen to be fully repudiated.\n\nThe only person running with the qualifications to be President; the person with the experience, knowledge and intelligence to lead our nation and the world; the person whose election would make real the goal of our constitution to form 'a more perfect union' is Hillary Rodham Clinton. When the dust settles and the nominees of both Parties are chosen; Democrats, Independents and even moderate Republicans will understand what is at stake in this election. They will support Hillary Rodham Clinton because she is best able to lead us into a better future.\n\nFollow Peter D.
