Beyond the political controversy over the new health law, people are asking a more practical question: How much does it cost to join?\n\n\n\nOne way to find the answer to that question is to use a subsidy calculator, built by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit foundation that focuses on healthcare issues.\n\nThe calculator is designed to illustrate if you qualify for financial assistance in buying health insurance under Obamacare, and if so, approximately what it costs. Using the tool is fairly straightforward -- you don't have to know a lot of arcane details. Just enter your state of residence, income, and a few details about dependents, and the tool instantly spits out your results.\n\nIn my case, for example, I have employer-provided healthcare, so I was not eligible to enter the exchange. But when I changed my details to suggest I didn't have employer healthcare, I was able to see a wealth of information about what I'd need to pay and what the government's tax credit would be.\n\nThe results aren't 100 percent accurate and the data for some states appears to be more valid than others, but the tool improves as states release additional details about their implementations of Obamacare. It takes only a few moments to complete, so it's worth your time if you're confused about how you fit into the new program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This calculator can give you a good estimate of the cost of buying insurance under the Affordable Care Act", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/calculate-how-much-obamacare-will-cost-you/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/09/25/b3909314-3598-11e3-8ce8-047d7b15b92e/thumbnail/1200x630/1e898866e31826ab10f8a68db838d9ff/EN_0925_Dahler.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "This calculator can give you a good estimate of the cost of buying insurance under the Affordable Care Act", "title": "Calculate how much Obamacare will cost you"}, "twitter": {"description": "This calculator can give you a good estimate of the cost of buying insurance under the Affordable Care Act", "title": "Calculate how much Obamacare will cost you", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/calculate-how-much-obamacare-will-cost-you/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/calculate-how-much-obamacare-will-cost-you/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/calculate-how-much-obamacare-will-cost-you/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "creator": "@http://twitter.com/davejoh", "site": "@CBSNews", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/09/25/b3909314-3598-11e3-8ce8-047d7b15b92e/thumbnail/1200x630/1e898866e31826ab10f8a68db838d9ff/EN_0925_Dahler.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/calculate-how-much-obamacare-will-cost-you/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/calculate-how-much-obamacare-will-cost-you/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSMoneyWatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbada\"", "article_summary": "(MoneyWatch) The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, kicked into high gear last week when the health care exchanges opened for business.\nBeyond the political controversy over the new health law, people are asking a more practical question: How much does it cost to join?\nThe calculator is designed to illustrate if you qualify for financial assistance in buying health insurance under Obamacare, and if so, approximately what it costs.\nJust enter your state of residence, income, and a few details about dependents, and the tool instantly spits out your results.\nThe results aren't 100 percent accurate and the data for some states appears to be more valid than others, but the tool improves as states release additional details about their implementations of Obamacare."}
