J. DAVID/Getty Images.\n\n4460475\n\nFriday would have been Ronald Reagan\u2019s 104th birthday.\n\nUtah Republican Sen. Mike Lee likes to remind audiences that the 2016 presidential election will be as far removed from Reagan winning the presidency as D-Day was from 1980.\n\nSo why are Republicans running in 2016 still quoting Reagan? One liberal writer ridiculed conservative veneration of the 40th president as \u201cReagan\u2019s pagan cult\u201d (though he admittedly found a particularly creepy example).\n\nGiven that Democrats often kept portraits of John F. Kennedy and even Franklin D. Roosevelt in their homes well into this writer\u2019s lifetime, the mockery seems a bit misplaced. But there\u2019s a simple explanation.\n\nReagan had a combination of political skills, electoral success, conservative principles and policy accomplishments that Republicans have been struggling to replicate ever since.\n\nHe is also arguably the last figure widely admired on the right who had considerable appeal beyond Republicans and conservatives. There\u2019s a reason we talked about \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d and not \u201cRomney Democrats.\u201d\n\nSure, you can find conservatives who served in Congress who never voted for a tax increase or an unbalanced budget. (Reagan\u2019s critics love to remind us he presided over both.) Richard Nixon\u2019s percentage of the popular vote in his reelection bid was a little higher. Some of Reagan\u2019s policies, like his amnesty for illegal immigrants, didn\u2019t work.\n\nThe Reagan administration had its scandals, failures and disappointments like any other.\n\nBut the two biggest problems Reagan was elected to solve \u2014 tensions with an ascendant Soviet Union and stagflation \u2014 ceased to exist by the time he left office. Not long afterward, so did the Soviet Union itself.\n\nIn their place was American victory in the Cold War and a pretty substantial economic boom that, with one brief interruption, continued long after he retired and was good for average American incomes.\n\nYou can quibble with how much credit Reagan deserved, though today\u2019s weak growth and conflict with a much weaker Russia show these results weren\u2019t inevitable. Not even Barack Obama has tried to go back to pre-Reagan tax rates.\n\nMore importantly, conservatives and the country gave Reagan credit. Most of the bad things, from a conservative or libertarian perspective, associated with the 1980s, would have happened without Reagan. Not necessarily most of the good things.\n\nWhat has any subsequent Republican done to match this record?\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush provided a steady hand during some turbulent times globally. Newt Gingrich was instrumental in building Republican congressional majorities that reformed welfare and built (but then squandered) budget surpluses. George W. Bush rallied (but then divided) the country after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nEven welfare reform, the investment tax cuts that helped spur the 1990s Internet boom and the budget surpluses are bipartisan achievements that have to be shared with Bill Clinton.\n\nLet\u2019s not even get started on Dennis Hastert and John Boehner. Reagan was the last national Republican leader who can say he did things as consequential for conservatives as Obamacare was for liberals, much less the New Deal and Great Society.\n\nThen there is the current Republican presidential field. They are mostly sticking with Bob Dole\u2019s unfortunately phrased promise, \u201cI\u2019m willing to be another Ronald Reagan if that\u2019s what you want me to be.\u201d\n\nMany of them have pieces, but none have the whole Reagan package.\n\nCould you imagine Scott Walker delivering a speech like the one Reagan gave after the Challenger disaster? Jeb Bush bringing tears to the eyes of GOP convention delegates, as Reagan was doing even in defeat in 1976? Rick Perry or Sarah Palin winning millions of Democratic votes? Ted Cruz carrying California, New York and Massachusetts?\n\nWalker or Chris Christie could fire the air traffic controllers. Cruz or Ben Carson could sign into law a supply-side tax cut, though a Bush might call it \u201cvoodoo economics,\u201d depending on the Bush.\n\nSince Reagan, a movement conservative hasn\u2019t even been able to win the Republican nomination, much less get elected president. His would-be successors have allowed much of what he did to erode (the top statutory income tax rate is nearly 12 points higher) and have barely touched the things he left undone: entitlement reform, debt control, promoting functioning markets in health care.\n\nJust like James Blaine was still waving the bloody shirt more than a decade after Abraham Lincoln\u2019s death, Republicans will run as Reagan-like equivalents of Elvis impersonators until they can more closely approximate a Reagan-like legacy.\n\nW.
