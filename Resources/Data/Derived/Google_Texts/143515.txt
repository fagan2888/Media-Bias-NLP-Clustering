"This law is working, and it's going to keep doing it," President Obama said this morning during his press conference celebrating the Supreme Court's decision to spare the Affordable Care Act from partial annihilation. As much as Republicans might protest otherwise, the comment was pretty much a straightforward factual statement, at least if you judge health reform against its primary goal of reducing the uninsured rate.

One of the amazing bits about Obamacare is just how well it seems to be succeeding in parts of the country that have rejected its core pieces. Remember that the last time the court passed judgment on the ACA, it ruled that states had the right to turn down its Medicaid expansion. Since then, 21 states have abstained from the giant wad of federal cash being offered to them in order to cover more of their low-income population. And yet, the uninsured rate is still down by about one-third in the opt-out states, as shown in this chart from the Urban Institute that Paul Krugman has been linking to. That's not quite as dramatic as the nearly 50 percent drop seen in states that embraced the Medicaid expansion, but it's impressive nonetheless.
