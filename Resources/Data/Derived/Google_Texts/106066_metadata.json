And cancer treatments, in particular, are expected to be targeted, according to a report from Moody\u2019s Investor Service.\n\nThe changes reflect ongoing efforts insurers are making to diversify and cut costs in response to the Affordable Care Act, which is now prompting a flurry of merger talks. Earlier this month, for instance, one big deal was announced as Aetnareed to pay $37 billion to acquire Humana.\n\nFor drug makers, this sort of consolidation only presents challenges, Moody\u2019s analysts say. The strengthening market share among insurers \u201cwill escalate reimbursement pressure over time, which will reduce the use of some pharmaceutical products and depress pricing on others,\u201d they write.\n\nThis is not to say that drug makers will face such pressures immediately, since insurers are more likely to be focused on more pressing short-term goals as integrating systems and benefit plans. But Moody\u2019s sees concern about drug spending accelerating over the next five years as integration issues recede.\n\nYou may recall that many cancer treatments are administered by physicians and other healthcare providers, rather than being dispensed by pharmacies and administered by the patient. Although Moody\u2019s notes that oncologists have considerable latitude in selecting medications.\n\nAnd given the recent spate of new, high-priced cancer treatments, the ratings service believes these drugs are especially juicy targets for insurers, even if any changes to reimbursement policies are largely incremental.\n\n\u201cBy and large, cancer treatment in the U.S. has not been subject to rigorous cost controls by health insurers or by Medicare,\u201d Moody\u2019s writes. \u201cCancer drugs are typically reimbursed under a fee-for-service payment model, but we believe this will begin to slowly change.\u201d\n\nTo make this happen, the ratings service suggests that insurers will likely to increasingly explore a pay-for-performance model. Under this scenario, health care providers are rewarded for meeting specific treatment protocols while insurers link reimbursement to a drug\u2019s value, based on various metrics.\n\nUsing this approach, Moody\u2019s writes that \u201cthe same drug could get reimbursed differently for different tumor types if the clinical data shows different levels of effectiveness.\u201d Among the drugs Moody\u2019s sees as being vulnerable are Merck\u2019s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo.\n\nAnthem is trying another variation. Last year, the insurer began changing how it paid for cancer care and pushed oncologists to adhere to standardized treatment guidelines. The program offered oncologists a $350-a-month payment for each patient who was on one of its recommended regimens\n\nOncology practices, you may recall, buy cancer drugs upfront and generally are reimbursed by Medicare and insurers based on a percentage of the cost of drugs they administer. But of course, this can create an incentive to use more expensive treatments.\n\nAs we recently noted, Anthem reported preliminary findings that found between July and December of last year, 616 practices registered a total of 5,538 patients in the program in the three types of cancer that were initially included \u2013 breast, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nThe program included about 64% of Anthem members with those three cancers. And of those patients who were signed up, 63% of those with breast or lung cancer were given an approved regimen, while the figure was 72% for patients with colon cancer.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "As the nation\u2019s biggest health insurers jockey for supremacy, drug makers should brace for added pressure as doctors encounter stingier reimbursement over the next few years.", "title": "Health Insurer Mergers Will Pressure Pharma Over High-Cost Drugs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2015/07/13/health-insurer-mergers-will-pressure-pharma-over-high-cost-drugs/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-UI084_health_G_20120827115945.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "article.headline": "Health Insurer Mergers Will Pressure Pharma Over High-Cost Drugs", "description": "As the nation\u2019s biggest health insurers jockey for supremacy, drug makers should brace for added pressure as doctors encounter stingier reimbursement over the next few years.", "author": "Ed Silverman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Pharmalot Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Pharmalot", "article.summary": "As the nation\u2019s biggest health insurers jockey for supremacy, drug makers should brace for added pressure as doctors encounter stingier reimbursement over the next few years.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-07-13T16:06:41-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2015/07/13/health-insurer-mergers-will-pressure-pharma-over-high-cost-drugs/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-270B-2187", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "As the nation\u2019s biggest health insurers jockey for supremacy, drug makers should brace for added pressure as doctors encounter stingier reimbursement over the next few years.", "title": "Health Insurer Mergers Will Pressure Pharma Over High-Cost Drugs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2015/07/13/health-insurer-mergers-will-pressure-pharma-over-high-cost-drugs/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-UI084_health_G_20120827115945.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Pharmalot", "article.id": "BL-270B-2187", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-07-13T22:19:46-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff95\"", "article_summary": "And cancer treatments, in particular, are expected to be targeted, according to a report from Moody\u2019s Investor Service.\nYou may recall that many cancer treatments are administered by physicians and other healthcare providers, rather than being dispensed by pharmacies and administered by the patient.\n\u201cBy and large, cancer treatment in the U.S. has not been subject to rigorous cost controls by health insurers or by Medicare,\u201d Moody\u2019s writes.\nUnder this scenario, health care providers are rewarded for meeting specific treatment protocols while insurers link reimbursement to a drug\u2019s value, based on various metrics.\nLast year, the insurer began changing how it paid for cancer care and pushed oncologists to adhere to standardized treatment guidelines."}
