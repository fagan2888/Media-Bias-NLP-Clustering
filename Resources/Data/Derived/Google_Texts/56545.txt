Here are three different Gallup surveys about American attitudes:

1) We seem quite unhappy about the way things are going right now.

2) A large majority of us is pretty happy about our standard of living.

3) We’re pretty positive about the direction of our standard of living.

How to makes sense of all this? Maybe it’s like those polling questions about Congress. Voters always seem more satisfied with their own individual congressional members than with the institution as a whole. So maybe folks see their own lives getting better but think America — Debt! Illegal Immigrants! Obamacare! Inequality! — is turning into a hellscape. (I would also like to see the second and third charts extending further back in time.)

It’s anxiety. Middle-class Americans are worried maybe that something will happen to hurt their personal fortunes or those of their children. Or maybe they think they can ride out the tough times better than their neighbors. I don’t know exactly. But that first chart — particularly the sustained low level of satisfaction — might signal potential for considerable political change.
