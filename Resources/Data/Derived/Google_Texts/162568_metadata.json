Biop will be looking to use the funding for continuing product development and ongoing clinical trails of the company\u2019s prototype device that will take place at Semmelweis University Hospital in Budapest, Hungary and in Rabin Medical Center in Israel.\n\nProduct design should be finalized by the end of the year.\n\nOn average, for cervical cancer screening, a woman might need multiple biopsies and they then need to wait for results \u2013 a stressful process. Biop\u2019s technology reportedly provides a diagnosis in just minutes.\n\nA press release sent out today stated how the technology works:\n\nBiop\u2019s point-of-care technology combines advanced, high-resolution optics with integrated micro and macro cameras and other optical elements. The device is inserted into the vaginal canal until it is in contact with the cervix and projects a full array of coherent and non-coherent lights into the full depth of cervix. The received refractions emitted by the cervical tissue indicate where cancer and pre-cancer cells are located. This data can automatically identify and map suspicious areas, and quantify the cancer\u2019s advancement. The results are automatically uploaded to the cloud and are stored in patients\u2019 electronic health records with big data analytics helping doctors predict which lesions will progress into cancer. Doctors can pinpoint where to perform biopsies by targeting the precise location of suspicious areas.\n\nThe company plans for this to not only be helpful in the Western world but a potential life savior in developing countries because of it\u2019s immediacy with results.\n\nThe cancer diagnostics market is becoming more and more widespread globally. Some of the major players in the global cancer diagnostics market include Agilent Technologies, Inc. (U.S.), Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (U.S.), Illumina, Inc. (Denmark), Becton, Dickinson and Company (U.S.), GE Healthcare (U.K.), QIAGEN N.V. (Netherlands), Abbott Laboratories, Inc. (U.S.), Roche Diagnostics (Switzerland), Siemens Healthcare (Germany), Philips Healthcare (U.K.) and C.R. Bard, Inc. (U.S.).\n\nBiop is currently jumping into a large and hopefully promising area in healthcare.\n\nPhoto: Flickr user Ed Uthman", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Series A financing round of $2.25 million will be used to move forward with the development of its point-of-care diagnostic tools for the accurate detection of epithelium cancers, with a primary focus on cervical cancer.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "The Series A financing round of $2.25 million will be used to move forward with the development of its point-of-care diagnostic tools for the accurate detection of epithelium cancers, with a primary focus on cervical cancer.", "title": "Biop Medical raises $2.25M to advance development of mobile device to detect cervical cancer", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/565238127_e39f93f801_z.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-05T14:32:31-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2016/04/biop-medical-raises-2-25m-advance-development-mobile-device-detect-cervical-cancer/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/565238127_e39f93f801_z.jpg", "description": "The Series A financing round of $2.25 million will be used to move forward with the development of its point-of-care diagnostic tools for the accurate detection of epithelium cancers, with a primary focus on cervical cancer.", "card": "summary", "title": "Biop Medical raises $2.25M to advance development of mobile device to detect cervical cancer - MedCity News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Biop Medical, cervical cancer, Israel, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Israel", "published_time": "2016-04-05T14:27:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-05T14:32:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "On average, for cervical cancer screening, a woman might need multiple biopsies and they then need to wait for results \u2013 a stressful process.\nThe cancer diagnostics market is becoming more and more widespread globally.\nBiop Medical has announced a Series A financing round of $2.25 million, which will be used to move forward with the development of its point-of-care diagnostic tools for the accurate detection of epithelium cancers, with a primary focus on cervical cancer.\nThe received refractions emitted by the cervical tissue indicate where cancer and pre-cancer cells are located.\nThe first application the Israel-based company is working on involves an alternative to biopsies."}
