PUEBLO — A jury has convicted a man in the shooting deaths of two people in southern Colorado in 2012.

The Pueblo Chieftain reported that 43-year-old Daniel Bessey was found guilty Tuesday in the murders of 29-year-old Sarah Beasley and 54-year-old John Salazar in Monte Vista.

Bessey was sentenced to life in prison without parole in addition to 32 years on a burglary charge.

The sentences will be served consecutively.

Prosecutors say Bessey, who had fathered a child with Beasley, went to Salazar’s house before dawn on Feb. 12, 2012, and shot Salazar as he was heading to his job as an elementary school janitor. Bessey then went inside the house and shot Beasley in front of her three sons, who were 8, 6 and 2 at the time.

“Justice has been served,” said Johnny Salazar, the eldest son of John Salazar. “Our father was the rock of our family, and that rock has been taken away.”
