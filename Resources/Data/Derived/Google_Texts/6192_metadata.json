The false claim is based on a Fox News report that mistakenly described representatives of the United Way of Florida and Enroll America as \u201chealth care navigators\u201d as they went door to door in Florida. But neither group received federal funding as part of the administration\u2019s outreach program.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act provided funding to create a network of navigators \u2014 individuals and organizations \u2014 that would educate uninsured citizens about health coverage options in the new insurance marketplace and assist them with enrollment. Navigators can provide information in person at health care facilities or over the phone. In August, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced $67 million in navigator grants to 105 organizations that applied to provide navigator services.\n\nBut navigators have become a target of the health care law\u2019s opponents. Congressional Republicans have raised questions about the training that navigators receive and the potential for fraud and abuse under the system.\n\nFor example, some Republicans, including Sen. John Barrasso, have repeated the claim that individuals working as navigators don\u2019t have to go through criminal background checks. It\u2019s true \u2014 as we\u2019ll explain later \u2014 that there is no federal requirement for navigators to undergo criminal background checks. But a handful of states have made them a requirement. And there are other safeguards in federal statutes aimed at safeguarding against identity theft.\n\nDoor to Door Prohibition\n\n\n\nOn Oct. 1, Fox News correspondent Phil Keating reported that the United Way and Enroll America, in Coral Gables, Fla., had \u201cnavigators going door to door, knocking on the homes of the uninsured \u2026 helping them navigate through the different plans that are available.\u201d That led the House Energy and Commerce Committee \u2014 chaired by Republican Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan \u2014 to post an item on its website claiming \u201cNavigators Go Door-to-Door Less Than Two Weeks After Obamacare Czar Assured Committee They Would Not.\u201d\n\nGary Cohen, director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, appeared at a House hearing on Sept. 19, to address Republican concerns that navigators would be taking their outreach efforts directly to the homes of the uninsured. He said workers would be told not to go door to door to enroll anyone in the exchanges.\n\nRep. Tim Murphy: Will navigators be going door-to-door? Cohen: We will be issuing instructions to navigators that they should not be going door-to-door. Murphy: And so that will be the ruling you\u2019ll have. With two weeks left, they would not be doing it. Cohen: That\u2019s right. Murphy: They\u2019ll remain in other public places? Cohen: They can\u2019t be enrolling anyone now because no one can be enrolling now. So in terms of going door-to-door to solicit people to enroll in coverage, they will be instructed not to do that, and it\u2019s timely because no one can be going door-to-door enrolling anyone because no one can enroll today.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services later issued the \u201cCMS Navigator Grantee Guide.\u201d According to the document, \u201coutreach activities should not include door-to-door activities to help consumers fill out applications or enroll in health coverage.\u201d\n\nThe Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s blog post says the Fox News report \u201cmakes clear, such activity began on day one,\u201d and it includes a video clip labeled \u201cFox News Shows Obamacare Navigators Going Door-to-Door.\u201d But that\u2019s not accurate. Enroll America and the United Way of Florida were not among the eight organizations in Florida that received federal navigator grants.\n\nJustin Nisly, national press secretary for Enroll America, described Enroll America as a national, nonprofit organization focused on educating consumers about their health insurance options under the federal law. The group\u2019s own \u201cGet Covered America\u201d campaign does involve sending staff and volunteers door to door to let uninsured Americans know about the new health insurance marketplace. But it isn\u2019t being funded as part of the government\u2019s navigator grant program.\n\nNisly told us in an interview that the group is \u201cdefinitely not a navigator\u201d and \u201canyone who describes us as such is mistaken.\u201d Nick Duran, Florida state director of Enroll America, made a similar statement in an interview with the Huffington Post. Ted Granger, president of the United Way of Florida, also told us in an email that his group isn\u2019t a navigator for the government.\n\nBrian Cook, spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, confirmed that for us. It is also confirmed by the agency\u2019s list of navigator grant recipients, which does not include either group.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that the organizations in the video are NOT Navigators,\u201d Cook wrote in an email to FactCheck.org. \u201cNeither Enroll America nor United Way are navigators in Florida.\u201d\n\nAnd Granger of the United Way of Florida said his group\u2019s involvement with Enroll America\u2019s awareness campaign was limited to providing \u201cin-kind space\u201d for its kickoff events.\n\nFraught with Fraud?\n\n\n\nSome Republicans are warning about fraud and identity theft issues with navigators. Sen. John Barrasso, for example, warned on Fox Business News that navigators don\u2019t have to go through criminal background checks. He\u2019s right that there is nothing in the federal statutes that requires background checks, but a handful of states have made that requirement. And there are other safeguards in federal statutes aimed at safeguarding against identity theft.\n\nHere\u2019s what Barrasso said on Fox Business News on Oct. 1:\n\nBarrasso, Oct. 1: And through the navigators \u2014 people who are after your own identity. I mean, these so-called navigators hired to help you sign up are individuals that don\u2019t have to go through criminal background checks. They don\u2019t even need the same criteria that Census takers have to meet in terms of security so real opportunity for identity theft because you\u2019re going to have to give people bank account numbers, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers \u2014 all of these sorts of things to try to sign up.\n\nThose concerns and others were raised by Republicans on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in a staff report on Sept. 18 titled, \u201cRisks of Fraud and Misinformation with ObamaCare Outreach Campaign: How Navigator and Assister Program Mismanagement Endangers Consumers.\u201d\n\nAccording to that report, \u201cSome of the training received by Navigators and Assisters will be related to consumer protection and privacy standards, but substantial risks remain. In part, substantial risks remain because the Administration decided not to require background checks and fingerprinting of individuals hired by Navigator and Assister organizations.\u201d\n\nThe same day, the Democratic staff of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce\u201d released a memo that said \u201cthere is no basis for the Republican concerns about the Navigator program.\u201d Specifically, the memo states that navigators \u201chave extensive experience assisting individuals with federal and state benefits\u201d and there are \u201ceffective privacy protections in place.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Barrasso is correct that there is no federal requirement for navigators to undergo criminal background checks.\n\nAn official with the Department of Health and Human Services told FactCheck.org in an email that there is \u201cno statutory requirement for Navigators to complete background checks, although some organizations already conduct background checks and some states have laws that require it of Navigators.\u201d\n\nAmong the states that have laws that will require navigators to undergo criminal background checks: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Ohio.\n\nAn HHS official told us that \u201cNavigators will not be able to access information once it has been submitted to the marketplace. The only way that a navigator would have access to a consumer\u2019s information would be if the consumer chose for the navigator to complete the enrollment process for them, which typically would be done in-person, with the consumer sitting with the navigator.\u201d\n\n\u2014 D\u2019Angelo Gore and Robert Farley", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc667\"", "article_summary": "Republicans wrongly claimed in a blog post that the Obama administration went back on its word not to send federal health care \u201cnavigators\u201d door to door to enroll Americans in the insurance exchanges.\nSen.
