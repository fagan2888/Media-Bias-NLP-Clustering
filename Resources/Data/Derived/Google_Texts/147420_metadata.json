worked for the health department for 16 years, but he\u2019d never seen the Austin City Council inject such a large dose of extra dollars into his budget as it did this year.\n\nThe council added $7.6 million in ongoing and one-time funds for public health and social services, from continuing to promote enrollment in Obamacare to a health initiative in the Rundberg neighborhood.\n\nThe health department\u2019s total budget ended up at $87 million, which is about a 16 percent increase from this past year.\n\nOther city departments that rely on the property and sales-tax-supported general fund saw their budgets grow anywhere from a low of 5 percent for the police department to a high of 12 percent for the library system \u2014 a sign of where the new council\u2019s priorities lie.\n\nJones, the health department director, said the city is \u201cactually looking to make a difference as a result of these investments,\u201d though it\u2019s not going to happen overnight.\n\n+

city wants to reduce the teen pregnancy rate among Hispanics \u2014 61.6 per 1,000 among 15- to 19-year-olds in Travis County, which is nearly double the county\u2019s overall teen pregnancy rate \u2014 and next year\u2019s budget will help expand the department\u2019s Peer to Peer sexual education program.\n\nThe added funding was the product of several key ingredients, from the opening some advocates saw with the new 10-1 council, the groups all pushing for more investment in the name of the same general cause, new data that underscored inequities in Austin, and a growth in the tax base that put more money at the council\u2019s fingertips.\n\n\u201cWe reached the place where the people who live here were able to benefit from that economy,\u201d Mayor Steve Adler said. \u201cThis is how you share that economy.\u201d\n\n+ AUSTIN AMERICAN-STATESMAN Barnetta Emerson, left, adjusts a blood pressure cuff for Teresa Bledsoe in February during a screening at the Austin/Travis County Health ... read more AUSTIN AMERICAN-STATESMAN \u00d7\n\n\u2018Very fortuitous timing\u2019\n\nTwo of the largest adds were $2.5 million for the health department and $1.8 million for social service contracts, which stemmed from a resolution the council approved last December largely crafted by One Voice Central Texas, a coalition of nonprofits.\n\nThe resolution contained a \u201csocial service calculator\u201d meant to close gaps in public health and social service funding by tying dollars for those areas to population growth and the consumer price index.\n\nPer that calculator, this year\u2019s budget should have added $3 million for the health department and $3.7 million for social service contracts meant to help lift people out of poverty \u2014 but that wasn\u2019t in the proposed budget released at the end of July.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of us called in vacations early and came back from the beach a few days ahead of when we had hoped, because we had a pretty big wake-up call at the end of July, early August,\u201d said Tod Marvin, One Voice chair and CEO of Easter Seals Central Texas.\n\nOne Voice met with council members individually, testified at budget hearings, sent newsletter blasts and held a press conference.\n\nOne thing on their side, Marvin said, was recently released information that helped them paint a picture of \u201ctwo Austins,\u201d such as an oft-cited Martin Prosperity Institute report saying Austin is the most economically segregated large metro area in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt was very fortuitous timing, in \u2026 kind of a weird, sick and twisted way, in terms of understanding these really disturbing trends and the full impact of them,\u201d Marvin said.\n\nCouncil Member Delia Garza, who pushed for increased health funding, cited the same report in a written statement.\n\n\u201cI believe that our historical underfunding of health and human services is a factor in that ranking, which is part of what led to the policy adopted last year to take an aggressive approach to closing that funding gap,\u201d she said.\n\nForeseeing opportunity\n\nThe council also allocated about $1 million for contracts for community-based groups to address health disparities, such as maternal and infant health for black and Latina mothers and mental health for immigrant families.\n\nAs an example of the types of initiatives that money could fund, Priscilla Hale, the director of Allgo and an advocate for the funding, said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do outreach to trans women of color, then you want trans women of color actually coming together and creating programs, deciding what it is that they need and then also implementing that.\u201d\n\nThat funding grew out of a council resolution, passed in May and championed by Garza, calling for the city to develop an \u201cequity assessment tool\u201d that would help gauge whether city policies and practices promote inequities and to form a working group to study health disparities.\n\nThat resolution, in turn, has its origins in a report produced by Mama Sana/Vibrant Woman \u2014 a volunteer-driven health initiative that provides free prenatal care to low-income women of color and also has a grassroots advocacy component \u2014 when it saw a key opportunity last year with the advent of a council elected by 10 geographically based districts.\n\nPaula Rojas, a project coordinator with Mama Sana/Vibrant Woman and a licensed midwife, put it like this: \u201cNow that we\u2019re going to have a city government that\u2019s more receptive to these issues, how do we prepare ourselves to come in proactively, not with some critiques but concrete proposals for work we can do?\u201d\n\nListening and asking\n\nTwo items on the budget priorities list drafted by Austin Interfaith \u2014 a coalition of churches, nonprofits, unions and schools \u2014 were funding for the Prime Time free after-school program in more than 20 city schools and funding for \u201cparent support specialists\u201d who are located at schools with concentrations of lower-income students and help families connect with social services.\n\nThe council approved $520,000 for Prime Time and $684,000 for parent support specialists.\n\nKurt Cadena-Mitchell, an Austin Interfaith leader and a member of Wildflower Church, said the coalition develops the budget list from small group conversations about what pressures families face and what the city should prioritize. He estimated at least 3,000 people participated in such conversations.\n\n\u201cThat process of having conversations and listening to stories and asking the right questions, that\u2019s built into the fundamental part of our work,\u201d he said.\n\nAustin Interfaith also started making its priorities known when council members were on the campaign trail last year. At forums for council contenders, Austin Interfaith would ask whether participants supported items like increased funding for Prime Time, parks and a career development program, Cadena-Mitchell said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shannon Jones has worked for the health department for 16 years, but he\u2019d never seen the Austin City Council inject such a large dose of extra dollars into his budget as it did this year.", "author": "By Andra Lim - American-Statesman Staff", "og": {"url": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/why-public-health-social-service-funding-surged-in/nnqDK/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/09/28/dd/4a/rgz-health-disparities-04.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Shannon Jones has worked for the health department for 16 years, but he\u2019d never seen the Austin City Council inject such a large dose of extra dollars into his budget as it did this year.", "title": "Why public health, social service funding surged in Austin budget"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/09/28/1b/81/Slot_3.JPG", "description": "Shannon Jones has worked for the health department for 16 years, but he&rsquo;d never seen the Austin City Council inject such a large dose of extra dollars into his budget as it did this year.", "card": "summary", "title": "Why public health, social service funding surged in Austin budget"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myaas", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/why-public-health-social-service-funding-surged-in/nnqDK/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3079447/news/news/local/why-public-health-social-service-funding-surged-in/nnqDK/", "keywords": "statesman,local news,health,government spending,City of Austin,City Council", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The resolution contained a \u201csocial service calculator\u201d meant to close gaps in public health and social service funding by tying dollars for those areas to population growth and the consumer price index.\nCouncil Member Delia Garza, who pushed for increased health funding, cited the same report in a written statement.\nThe health department\u2019s total budget ended up at $87 million, which is about a 16 percent increase from this past year.\nShannon Jones has worked for the health department for 16 years, but he\u2019d never seen the Austin City Council inject such a large dose of extra dollars into his budget as it did this year.\nJones, the health department director, said the city is \u201cactually looking to make a difference as a result of these investments,\u201d though it\u2019s not going to happen overnight."}
