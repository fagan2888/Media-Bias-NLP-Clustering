Fifty-five pieces from different vendors do not fit together.\"\n\nPanelists also described the cultural and organizational issues in the federal government that can derail large-scale IT deployments. They stressed that the technology aspects of the launch, daunting as they were, were compounded by the too-common failure of federal project managers to communicate effectively with their commercial suppliers or their colleagues in other segments of the department or agency. That could mean ignoring warning signs about glitches in a website, or rebuffing suggestions by the vendor to take an alternative development approach.\n\n\"There's multiple layers of the challenge. Some are architectural, meaning there could have been a different technological approach to providing an integration framework for tying the information together and ensuring that it was going to perform. There is [also] a project-management practice approach,\" Bourgeois said.\n\n\"The project management method that works is in many ways dependent on the scope and the size and the severity and the constraints of the challenge at hand,\" Bourgeois said\n\nForman cautioned not to view the problems with the healthcare site as a perfect microcosm of the federal procurement system, pointing to other shortfalls in the government's work with vendors, including contract administration and the process of managing vendors after the contract has been awarded.\n\nIn that system he said he sees a blighted culture where purchasing decisions are too heavily guided by cost considerations, and program managers are often dogmatic in their demands from vendors.\n\nAs a consequence, suppliers can be compelled to meet an unreasonable time table for deliverables or build systems to the specifications of the agency, even if they realize that modifications to the design would produce a superior product.\n\n\"There's a big focus today in government procurement on lowest price, technically acceptable. It's created a cancer in the government IT industry,\" Forman said. \"We have a very screwed up incentive structure right now in government contracting, and it's not benefiting anybody.\"\n\nKenneth Corbin is a Washington, D.C.-based writer who covers government and regulatory issues for CIO.com.
