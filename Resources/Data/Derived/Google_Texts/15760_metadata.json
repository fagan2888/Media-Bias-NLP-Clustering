Chalk will be provided.\n\nSome examples that could be seen on the wall earlier this week included people wanting to \u201cfall in love\u201d, \u201crun a marathon\u201d and \u201csee my family stress free.\u201d\n\nThe wall was created in 2011 by New Orleans-based artist Candy Chang after she lost \u201ca significant loved one.\u201d According to a news release, \u201cfollowing a significant period of grief and depression she found clarity in her life by contemplating death.\u201d\n\nChang painted the side of an abandoned house in New Orleans with the sentence \u201cBefore I die I want to\u2026\u201d. The next day it was full of responses.\n\nSince then, more than 430 walls have been recreated in 29 languages in more than 64 countries, the release said.\n\nThe display will be open to the public through the spring and possibly into the summer, Brinkerhoff. He hopes it will move to another location in the city in the fall.\n\nTo learn more, visit beforeidie.cc.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA0L25ldy1hcnQtZXhoaWJpdC1pbi1sb3dlci1ncmVlbnZpbGxlLXdpbGwtYXNrLXZpZXdlcnMtdG8tc2hhcmUtdGhlaXItYnVja2V0LWxpc3QuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Julie Fancher", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "A trip to the grocery store could soon make you ponder your mortality.
