There is a reality to this situation that we need to wrap our head around.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s honestly the next chapter in an ongoing crisis,\u201d says Wendy Young, president of @supportKIND.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s coming now:\n\nIn October and November, more than 10,500 children\u2014mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras\u2014crossed the U.S.-Mexico border by themselves, a 106-percent increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nIn addition, more than 12,500 family units (usually a mother with her children) have come that way since Oct. 1, representing a 173-percent increase over the same time last year.\n\nThese numbers are still smaller than the summer of 2014, when more than 10,600 unaccompanied minors crossed the border just in June.\n\nBut the spikes are causing alarm because crossings of the southwest border had declined after Mexico began better enforcing its borders\u2014with help from the U.S.\u2014and the Obama administration pursued a public awareness campaign in Central America discouraging people from migrating.\n\nThe timing is also surprising because peaks in illegal immigration usually occur during the summer, when the weather is more bearable.\n\nThe positive trends have proven temporary impediments to opportunistic smugglers who have found new routes into the U.S. and desperate people willing to risk more for the chance at a better life.\n\n\u201cThis may be the new normal,\u201d said Marc Rosenblum, the deputy director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute. \u201cEverything that was going on in 2014 that caused people to flee is as bad or worse now. Violence in El Salvador is worse, the whole region is amidst a two-year drought, more families are experiencing food insecurity, there\u2019s political turbulence in Guatemala. Those are strong pressures that will cause people to try to get here.\u201d\n\nUnder pressure to respond to the surge more efficiently than last time, the Obama administration is adding at least 1,400 beds for unaccompanied children, opening three shelters this month, including two in Texas, according to The New York Times.\n\nAfter children from Central America are apprehended by the Border Patrol, the Department of Health and Human Services is required to shelter them until it can find a sponsor in the U.S.\u2014usually a parent or other family\u2014for them to stay with.\n\nIn addition, an omnibus government spending bill signed earlier this month contains money for the hiring of 55 immigration judges to handle a backlog of 463,627 pending cases (as of November) in immigration courts nationwide, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nAll Central American children must have their cases heard by an immigration judge.\n\nFamily units get a hearing before a judge too if they pass a \u201ccredible fear\u201d interview with an immigration official pledging to their hope for asylum.\n\nAccording to Rosenblum, half of the cases that began in immigration courts in 2014 are still pending, and two-thirds of cases brought this year are unresolved.\n\n\u201cWe still have such poor capacity to quickly adjudicate claims,\u201d Rosenblum said. \u201cWaits at immigration court remain very long. Very few are deported back, and few cases are resolved quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery few are deported back, and few cases are resolved quickly,\u201d says Marc Rosenblum of @MigrationPolicy.\n\nBorder officials argue that a factor fueling the current surge is a reduction in detention of women and children required by federal court rulings from this year.\n\nThe decisions found that two detention centers in Texas that the Obama administration opened last summer failed to meet the standards of a 1997 settlement agreement for facilities housing children.\n\nWhile the government is appealing, an official with the Department of Homeland Security told The Daily Signal that the administration is taking steps to comply with the order, and that \u201cfamily residential centers are more and more functioning as processing centers for interviews and screenings.\u201d\n\nThough the official could not comment on the nature of the compliance due to the ongoing litigation, Rosenblum and other immigration experts say the government is detaining families for less time, releasing them in three weeks or less to pursue their asylum claims in immigration court.\n\nChris Cabrera, the vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union for Border Patrol agents, told The Daily Signal that immigrants from Central America seem to be responding to the new detention procedures.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s a major reason we\u2019re having the surge because people know we won\u2019t detain them and are going to release them,\u201d said Cabrera, who is a Border Patrol agent stationed in McAllen, Texas.\n\nCabrera said the women and children usually seek out the Border Patrol, rather than hide from them, to ask for asylum protection. He said nearly all of them are claiming they have a credible fear of returning to their home country.\n\nCabrera contends that the extra resources required to process the women and children leave officers without the manpower to secure the border, although the Texas National Guard is still patrolling the Rio Grande Valley in an extension of a mission that began last year.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has also ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to increase its patrols at the border.\n\n\u201cTo say this is the new normal is the wrong answer,\u201d Cabrera said, responding to officials who have referred to the surge this way. \u201cIt\u2019s an admission of defeat that this is what we should accept. I don\u2019t accept it. This should not be the new normal, and we need to secure this area.\u201d\n\nIn a move to bolster immigration enforcement, the Obama administration next year will begin to conduct a series of raids targeting Central American families who have come to the U.S. illegally since the beginning of 2014.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would target adults and children who have already been ordered removed from the U.S. by an immigration judge\u2014meaning they did not qualify for asylum\u2014for deportation. Most of these people likely came here during the 2014 border surge. More than 100,000 families from Central America have arrived in the U.S. since last year.\n\nDavid Inserra, a homeland security expert at The Heritage Foundation, believes the Obama administration\u2019s plan to deport certain Central American families is meant to disrupt the momentum of the latest surge.\n\n\u201cPeople see that a prior wave came to the U.S. illegally, and many of them have not been removed,\u201d Inserra said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think the Obama administration is saying, \u2018Something is off.\u2019 When there is greater enforcement, you are discouraging more people from coming illegally.\u201d\n\nImmigration experts insist that the challenge is deeper than security.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to stop by just catching and deporting people,\u201d Rosenblum said. \u201cThe answer in the long run is to help Central America fix itself.\u201d\n\nSeeking a more enduring solution, Congress and the Obama administration included $750 million in year-end spending to help Central American countries combat poverty, gang violence, trafficking, and government corruption, and to improve border security and social programs.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t take kids on a horrible, dangerous journey unless you feel there\u2019s no choice,\u201d says @MichelleBrane.\n\nMichelle Brane, the director of the Migrant Rights and Justice Program at the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission, called the aid to Central America a \u201cpositive step.\u201d\n\nShe says two-thirds of Central American women with children try to flee internally before trying to come to the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty grueling journey,\u201d Brane said. \u201cA lot of people are saying, \u2018Why would a mother put their child through that?\u2019 Look, I am a mom. You don\u2019t take kids on a horrible, dangerous journey unless you feel there\u2019s no choice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a reprise of the the humanitarian crisis of summer 2014, rising numbers of Central Americans are crossing the Rio Grande Valley into Texas.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In a reprise of the the humanitarian crisis of summer 2014, rising numbers of Central Americans are crossing the Rio Grande Valley into Texas.", "title": "What\u2019s Driving Latest Illegal Immigration Border Surge", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/BorderSurge.png", "updated_time": "2015-12-30T00:41:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RPQbRO"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In a reprise of the the humanitarian crisis of summer 2014, rising numbers of Central Americans are crossing the Rio Grande Valley into Texas.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/BorderSurge.png"}, "title": "What\u2019s Driving Latest Illegal Immigration Border Surge", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-12-29T13:36:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-30T00:41:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Central America, border crisis, deportation raid, Jeh Johnson, Homeland Security, immigration, Rio Grande Valley, National Guard, Greg Abbott, unaccompanied minor"}, "article_summary": "Most of these people likely came here during the 2014 border surge.\nThe timing is also surprising because peaks in illegal immigration usually occur during the summer, when the weather is more bearable.\nThese numbers are still smaller than the summer of 2014, when more than 10,600 unaccompanied minors crossed the border just in June.\nAll Central American children must have their cases heard by an immigration judge.\nGreg Abbott, a Republican, has also ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to increase its patrols at the border."}
