LITTLE ROCK, Ark.- When all the words have been spoken, sometimes silence brings the most light to darkness.

"Very young, its a tragedy," Terry Farley said.

For nearly ten minutes, Jason Adams' Aunt and Uncle joined hundreds of fire fighters Monday night who responded to a call they know would be tough but one they wouldn't miss.

"They expect danger you know, but not that kind of a danger," Terry Farley said.

Terry says his nephew knew his calling early on and carried it out until his final day on the job.

"He was saved by a firefighter and that sparked it in him to carry it forward. That's all he thought about," Terry Farley said.

"He was all about that," Adams' aunt Reina Farley said.

Reina says the support while strong in Arkansas, goes well beyond state lines.

"People from overseas, the UK, Australia send messages, its really awesome to see that love," Reina Farley said.

Reina says Adams' action both on and off duty is something to be admired.

"Be there for each other and care about each other like he did," Reina Farley said.

A strong show of support for a man who even in this moment of darkness continues to spread light.

"Just reach out to your fellow man and help one another, that's what he would have wanted," Terry Farley said.
