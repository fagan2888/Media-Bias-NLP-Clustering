BLACKSBURG, Va. — Adam Smith’s 3-pointer with four seconds left lifted Virginia Tech to a 70-67 overtime victory over Pittsburgh on Tuesday night.

Smith scored 26 points, hitting 9-of-17 from the field and tying a career high with six 3-pointers. Virginia Tech (9-11, 1-6 ACC) snapped a seven-game losing streak and a five-game losing streak to the Panthers.

In overtime, the Panthers (13-8, 3-5 ACC), who lost their third straight, tied the game at 67 on Chris Jones’ putback with 1:08 to play. Virginia Tech called a timeout with 47 seconds left, and Malik Müller missed a lay-up inside with 30 seconds to go. But the rebound went out of bounds off a Pittsburgh player, giving the Hokies another chance.

They held the ball before running a play that freed Smith for a 3-pointer from the top of the key.

Jamel Artis led Pittsburgh with 17 points.
