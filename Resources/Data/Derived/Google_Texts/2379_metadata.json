Following hundreds of hours of planning time and a model from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Association of County and City Health Officials, county officials unveiled a Community Health Improvement Plan on Friday, Dec. 5.\n\nThe plan, part of the county\u2019s RoadMAPP to Health initiative, was presented to about 100 county workers, community and business leaders. It was based on input from Chester County\u2019s RoadMAPP community survey, conducted to identify the health challenges facing the county, as well as input from dozens of organizations.\n\n\u201cAll of us in this room know that Chester County is a great place to live,\u201d Commissioner Kathi Cozzone told the group. But despite the county\u2019s many health accolades, Cozzone said, \u201cWe recognize that we can always make improvements.\u201d\n\nFor several years, Chester County has been named the first- or second-healthiest county in the state by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. County officials said they want to continue that record of excellence for the county\u2019s half-million residents.\n\nCommissioner Terence Farrell, who credited the Health Department\u2019s Ashley Orr for spearheading the RoadMAPP project, said five strategic issues were identified and would continue to be county priorities: cultural competence and health disparities, coordinated behavioral and physical health, awareness of community resources, individual health management and disease prevention, and safe and healthy environments.\n\nOrr explained that improving the county\u2019s health goes well beyond disease prevention. It affects housing, transportation, jobs, parks, and air and water quality. \u201cNot everyone has a safe place to live, work and play,\u201d she said, explaining that the RoadMAPP initiative involves partnerships with non-health organizations, such as the county\u2019s Department of Emergency Services and its Planning Commission.\n\nPaul Huberty, a senior vice president at Chester County Hospital, said the county is already making inroads in reducing birth disparities, especially in the African American community. He credited a dramatic increase in prenatal care to a partnership among the hospital, ChesPenn Health Services, and the Brandywine Health Foundation.\n\nDonna Carlson from the county\u2019s Department of Human Services said more valuable research on improving public health has come through the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). Established by the Affordable Care Act in 2011, PCORI awarded 25 grants nationwide, one of which went to Chester County.\n\nCarlson said research indicates that 68 percent of U.S. residents with serious mental illness \u2013 approximately 10 million people \u2013 also have medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, resulting in death 15 to 25 years earlier than the general population. Researchers are working to determine how to serve that vulnerable population in Chester County most effectively, she said.\n\nJoan Holliday, a Kennett-area community activist, cited the example of Activate Chester County, which consists of collaborative groups across the county representing hospitals, health and recreation organizations, school districts, municipalities, and YMCAs. Their goal is to reduce obesity rates in Chester County.\n\n\u201cActivate Chester County has been around for 10 years, but we needed a boost,\u201d she said, adding that small programs don\u2019t work as well as larger ones. \u201cWe needed a broader approach.\u201d\n\nAmong the assets of a more broad-based program is a clearinghouse for resources, said Barbara Mancill from United Way of Chester County. She said two existing sources of information on health and human services - Refer Web (http://www.referweb.net/chesco/) and United Way\u2019s 2-1-1 phone number \u2013 would mirror each other.\n\nOrr said that process of updating and integrating resources has already begun.\n\n\"Everything is starting to come together,\" said Jeanne Casner, who heads the county\u2019s Health Department. \"This doesn't stop today. This is another beginning \u2026 It\u2019s not going to be a map that lasts five years so we\u2019re going to continually look at it, reassess it, and apply the new data.\u201d\n\nFor more information, visit http://webapps.chesco.org/webapps/health/cha/home.html\n\n(1 votes, average: 5.00 out of 5)\n\nvotes, average:out of 5)\n\nLoading...
