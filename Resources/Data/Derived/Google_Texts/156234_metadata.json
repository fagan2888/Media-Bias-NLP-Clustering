There was the popular end to the pesky $5 inspection stickers for cars and trucks. Some reforms of the state contracting process and pro-gun rights legislation were signed by Gov. Phil Bryant.\n\nBut the biggest news was something that didn\u2019t happen: a tax cut. Leaders of both chambers promised a tax cut, with Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves unveiling a plan that would\u2019ve scrapped the state\u2019s onerous corporate franchise tax and House Speaker Philip Gunn proposing phasing out the state\u2019s income tax by 2030. The two plans were miles apart and a compromise died with little resistance by Gunn in the House. While the GOP has tried to pin the tail on the donkey in an election year, the two chambers failed to come together on tax reform and come up with plan that would\u2019ve satisfied both sides.\n\nThe strong bipartisan support beind \u201cRight to Try\u201d gives terminally ill patients in the state and their doctors the ability to use experimental medication that\u2019s passed one stage of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s decade-long approval process.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an FDA process that\u2019s out there that\u2019s not working to do this,\u201d said Jameson Taylor, vice president for policy at the nonprofit, pro-limited government Mississippi Center for Public Policy. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of a broken federal process. What\u2019s exciting is the states are reaching back and saying \u2018this isn\u2019t working for us and we think there\u2019s a better way for us.\u2019 This is one example of pushing back against a a broken federal process.\u201d\n\nBipartisan support wasn\u2019t entirely the case with the Special Needs bill, which gives parents of children of special needs the funding to seek a private program that serves their child\u2019s needs better. The program also funds books and other educational materials. The state\u2019s pro-public school groups helped defeat the bill in 2014, but couldn\u2019t stop the legislation from making it to Bryant\u2019s desk for signature this year.\n\nThe state\u2019s $5 inspection sticker was the Freddy Krueger of Mississippi politics. No matter how many times the Legislature tried to kill the extremely unpopular program, something always intervened to keep it alive over the past decade. The inspection is rudimentary at best with a test of the horn, turn signals and brake lights. Come July 1, it\u2019ll be history.\n\n\u201cThe vehicle inspection sticker is not an effective or efficient way to collect what is essentially a $5 tax,\u201d Reeves said in a statement.\n\nOne bill signed by the governor that drew little attention was Senate Bill 2093. This legislation would allow both publicly owned utilities, such as Entergy and Mississippi Power, and nonprofit cooperatives the ability to get in the \u201ceconomic development\u201d business, which \u201cincludes, but is not limited to industrial sites\u201d and even providing capital. It would put a great deal of pressure on the Mississippi Public Service Commission, which would have to be extremely diligent to avoid questionable investments for which ratepayers would likely have to pick up the tab. The bill was passed with minimal debate by both chambers.\n\nThe budget is also up slightly over the past fiscal year, climbing to $6.2 billion as the state breached the $1 billion per year barrier on Medicaid spending. With more people eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, it\u2019s something to watch in future budget cycles.\n\nGet regular updates on Mississippi through our Facebook or Twitter accounts", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The Mississippi Legislature passed some good and some not so good bills this session, but failed to pass a tax cut going into an election year.", "title": "Drugs and taxes and stickers: A look at 2015 Mississippi Legislature - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/State-capital-landscape.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-04T11:35:51+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/209889/session-proved-to-be-a-mixed-bag-for-mississippi-legislature/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "published_time": "2015-04-03T04:00:32+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mississippi.watchdog", "section": "Mississippi", "modified_time": "2015-04-04T11:35:51+00:00", "tag": "Mississippi,Mississippi legislature,Politics,Right to Try,special needs bill"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The Mississippi Legislature passed some good and some not so good bills this session, but failed to pass a tax cut going into an election year.", "title": "Drugs and taxes and stickers: A look at 2015 Mississippi Legislature - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/State-capital-landscape.jpg"}, "creator": "@Gulfcoastsage", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "The Mississippi Legislature passed some good and some not so good bills this session, but failed to pass a tax cut going into an election year."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6e7\"", "article_summary": "There were some bills during the annual session that expanded personal liberty \u2014 such as \u201cRight to Try\u201d and the Special Needs bill, which provides tuition and books for parents of children with special needs.\nBy Steve Wilson | Mississippi WatchdogMississippians can breathe a sigh of relief as the Mississippi Legislature closes up shop for the year.\nThe state\u2019s $5 inspection sticker was the Freddy Krueger of Mississippi politics.\nThere was the popular end to the pesky $5 inspection stickers for cars and trucks.\nTate Reeves unveiling a plan that would\u2019ve scrapped the state\u2019s onerous corporate franchise tax and House Speaker Philip Gunn proposing phasing out the state\u2019s income tax by 2030."}
