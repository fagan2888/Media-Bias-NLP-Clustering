The Native American and Indigenous Studies Association has seen its annual meeting attendance grow from 350 people in 2007 to nearly 900 in 2013.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore Native American students are going to college, too. CU has seen its American Indian population grown from 186 total students in the spring of 2000 to 387 in the spring of 2015, according to campus data.\n\nCU recently implemented a graduate certificate in Native American and indigenous studies and will begin offering an undergraduate certificate this fall.\n\nFor now the center is located in the Institute of Behavioral Science building, 1440 15th St., on the Boulder campus. Its first-year budget is listed as $196,804, which is expected to drop to $151,904 in the center's second year, according to budget documents.\n\nThe center is overseen by CU's Graduate School to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and to invite all faculty members and students to get involved.\n\n\"It's important that our center's housed in the Graduate School because most centers are housed in a department or an institute and they have a narrow focus,\" said Andrew Cowell, a faculty member in linguistics, French and Italian who studies indigenous languages. \"The problem when you have a department of native and indigenous studies is people think 'Oh, well, that's the only place we do it,' and then that department is responsible for everything and the rest of us don't worry about it.\"\n\nIt's also likely to help recruit more Native American students to campus, Kelsey said. To that end, CU has also reinstated its native graduation ceremony, native welcome gathering and hosts other relevant events.\n\n\"When we're recruiting students, they know that there's a space for native students on campus and that native knowledge and their presence here as students is not just tolerated but really valued,\" she said.\n\nThe center is also focused on retaining those students, which aligns with Chancellor Phil DiStefano's goal of increasing the campus six-year graduation rate to 80 percent by 2020.\n\nNative American students tend to have lower graduation rates than the general student population at CU. To compare, 46 percent of Native American students who entered CU in 2008 graduated in six years, while 70 percent of all students graduated in six years.\n\n\"Unfortunately native and indigenous students have a higher dropout rate on average,\" Cowell said. \"Anything we can do to get more of them here but also keep them here I think will be hugely beneficial for the whole campus. We're certainly advocating for their interests in terms of the classes they need, the curricular support they need and the tutoring they might need.\"\n\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28303212/cu-boulder-launches-native-american-studies-center", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28303212:view"}, "startDate": "2015-06-14T10:30:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "The University of Colorado is launching a new center focused on Native American and indigenous studies and research.", "title": "CU-Boulder launches Native American studies center", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28303212/cu-boulder-launches-native-american-studies-center", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0612/20150612__15DCACNAw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "modificationDate": "2015-06-14T09:14:52-0600", "endDate": "2025-06-12T15:44:57-0600", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Sarah KutaStaff", "pubDate": "2015-06-12T15:48:29-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-06-14T10:30:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "CU-Boulder launches Native American studies center", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0612/20150612__15DCACNAw~1_300.jpg", "description": "The University of Colorado is launching a new center focused on Native American and indigenous studies and research.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28303212/cu-boulder-launches-native-american-studies-center", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "The University of Colorado is launching a new center focused on Native American and indigenous studies and research.", "title": "CU-Boulder launches Native American studies center"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0612/20150612__15DCACNAw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd940f\"", "article_summary": "The Center for Native American and Indigenous Studies, approved this spring, is a campus-wide network of scholars who study Native American and indigenous culture, language and history.\n( Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer )For more information about the Center for Native American and Indigenous Studies colorado.edu/nativestudies/The University of Colorado is launching a new center focused on Native American and indigenous studies and research.\nWith the center, CU joins the University of New Mexico, University of Montana, University of Texas and other institutions with Native American studies programs.\nThe center is also expected to support Native American and indigenous students who attend CU, as well as promote collaborations between CU and native communities and organizations.\nThe Native American and Indigenous Studies Association has seen its annual meeting attendance grow from 350 people in 2007 to nearly 900 in 2013."}
