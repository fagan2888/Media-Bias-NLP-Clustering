He crashed into a wall at Cedar Street and North Mojave Road.\n\nThe front-seat passenger, 22-year-old Rajan Sroya, was impaled by a wrought-iron fence that the vehicle ran into, police said.\n\nChavez fled on foot but was arrested soon afterward. Sroya was booked in absentia at University Medical Center. A third passenger, 29-year-old Demone Lewis, also was arrested.\n\nSroya died June 27 from his injuries, police said.\n\nPolice investigators said the three men stole the Corolla just after midnight on May 11, then went on to pistol whip a hotel patron and then rob him.\n\nLewis and Chavez are scheduled to appear in court July 28. Both have had previous charges relating to larceny and car theft.\n\nContact reporter Annalise Porter at aporter@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0391.", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/suspect-may-armed-robbery-police-chase-dies", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "ANNALISE PORTER LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Suspect in May armed robbery, police chase dies", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_Rajan_Sroya_07012014.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "Las Vegas police said Tuesday that a man involved in a May police chase died last week.", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/suspect-may-armed-robbery-police-chase-dies", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_Rajan_Sroya_07012014.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_policechase2_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_policechase1_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web1_AERIAL.SOUTHPOINT2-031809_7.jpg"}, "title": "Suspect in May armed robbery, police chase dies", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-01T21:30:00Z", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1892376"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1574934", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1574934", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540820524", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "ANNALISE PORTER LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-section": "Las Vegas", "keywords": "Las Vegas,Crime & Courts, News,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-01T14:30:00-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Las Vegas,Crime & Courts,News", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Las Vegas police said Tuesday that a man involved in a May police chase died last week.", "title": "Suspect in May armed robbery, police chase dies", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/suspect-may-armed-robbery-police-chase-dies", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_Rajan_Sroya_07012014.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "description": "Las Vegas police said Tuesday that a man involved in a May police chase died last week."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd35\"", "article_summary": "Las Vegas police said Tuesday that a suspect in a May police chase died last week.\nSroya died June 27 from his injuries, police said.\nPolice responded to an armed robbery at the South Point about 5 a.m. on May 11 and tried to stop the robbers, driving a white Toyota Corolla, from leaving the hotel.\nThe driver of the Corolla, identified by police as 24-year-old Antonio Chavez, refused to stop, and police chased him.\nThe front-seat passenger, 22-year-old Rajan Sroya, was impaled by a wrought-iron fence that the vehicle ran into, police said."}
