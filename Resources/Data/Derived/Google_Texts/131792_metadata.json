Given that I learned the difference between a teaspoon and a tablespoon only a few months ago (weird batch of brownies, for more than one reason) today, for the very first time, I am now in favor of the metric system, because the equivalent 2.3 grams of salt is something I can wrap my head around. [The Telegraph]\n\n5 minutes, 31 seconds, 22 frames\n\nHave you watched the trailers for \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d? If all the footage in those trailers actually appears in the film, fans have seen just more than 5 minutes, 31 seconds of the movie, or roughly 4 percent should the advertised 2 hour, 16 minute run time hold. [Eleven-ThirtyEight]\n\nFull disclosure: Disney owns Star Wars and also owns ESPN, ESPN owns FiveThirtyEight, FiveThirtyEight pays Walter, I am Walter.\n\n5.7 percent\n\nThe future of polling comes down to one man: Donald Trump. I mean, kind of. The level of support for Trump in live-interview polls \u2014 the kind we\u2019ve relied on for decades \u2014 is averaging 23.4 percent, while the support for Trump in online polls \u2014 arguably the future of the field, provided those who run them can match the accuracy of their landline predecessors \u2014 is at 29.1 percent. That\u2019s a 5.7-point difference, which is a pretty big deal. When we get a chance to see how these different methodologies play out, depending on Trump\u2019s actual degree of support, we could get a good look at the future of polling. [FiveThirtyEight]\n\n16 measures\n\nNumber of abortion and family planning measures John Kasich has signed since becoming governor of Ohio in 2011. Abortions in Ohio have fallen 25 percent during his tenure. While he hasn\u2019t yet bragged about it on the campaign trail, Kasich has one of the most demonstrable anti-abortion records of anyone in the GOP field. [FiveThirtyEight]\n\n10.3 percent\n\nPercentage of U.S. women who used an IUD in 2012, up from 2 percent in 2002. Intra-uterine devices, which prevent pregnancy, are the new focus of a legal campaign against the Affordable Care Act from from anti-abortion groups, which argue that in rare cases IUDs could prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg. [Reuters]\n\n19 percent\n\nEstimated percentage of donors to the 2003 gubernatorial campaign of now-Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, an Indian-American, who were South Asian-Americans. That number declined over the course of Jindal\u2019s subsequent campaigns. In his recently ended national bid for the presidency, Jindal presented a particularly notable case where, after a certain point, minority candidates fail to garner support among fellow minorities. [FiveThirtyEight]\n\n42 percent\n\nPeople might be naming their offspring after Instagram filters. \u201cLudwig\u201d as a name was up 42 percent last year according to BabyCenter, a parenting website, while \u201cJuno\u201d was up 30 percent and \u201cAmaro\u201d was up 26 percent. All right, all of a sudden I understand what that friend with the kid named Lo-fi Jenkins was going for. [Re/code]\n\n51 turtles\n\nA man who attempted to cross the border to Canada with 51 turtles taped to his body pleaded guilty to smuggling charges. Let he among us who hasn\u2019t been there throw the first stone. [Associated Press]\n\n4,200 hours\n\nPhotographer Alan McFadyen spent 4,200 hours \u2014 roughly 175 full days \u2014 over six years trying to get the perfect picture of a kingfisher diving for a fish just as its pointy beak broke the water. Needless to say, he totally nailed it. [Geekologie]\n\n1.8 billion streams\n\nDrake was the most-streamed artist of 2015 on Spotify, according to the company, with 1.8 billion streams. This was a good year for Canadian musicians, as Justin Bieber took the record for the most streams in a single day, with 36 million on Nov. 13.
