Jeb Bush follows in second place, with 13 percent.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina saw their political stock soar following their performances during last Thursday\u2019s debate: Kasich surged to third place, with 12 percent support, and Fiorina received 9 percent.\n\nKasich is staking his candidacy on winning in New Hampshire, which has as history of favoring mainstream conservative and establishment-minded candidates.\n\n\n\nKasich\u2019s political team is run by operatives with deep experience in the state, and his super-PAC is so far drowning out the competition on the airwaves, having spent $4 million on TV ads in July and August alone.\n\n\n\nFiorina was the overwhelming winner of the undercard debate last week, and now she\u2019s reaping a windfall in the polls.

That\u2019s a bump of 9 points for Bush over the same poll from March, and an increase of 7 points for Rubio.\n\nA plurality of New Hampshire Republicans, 27 percent, say Bush is most likely to win the GOP nomination, followed by Trump at 16 percent.
