Kay Hagan told area Democrats Saturday that it will take the \u201clargest get-out-the-vote effort\u201d seen for a North Carolina Senate race to keep her in Washington.\n\nHagan was speaking at the North Carolina 5th Congressional District Democrat\u2019s Convention, held at the Forsyth Technical Community College\u2019s West Campus.\n\nIf Hagan\u2019s team succeeds in getting large numbers of Democratic voters to the polls in November for her race against Rep. Thom Tillis, speaker of the North Carolina House, it could benefit other North Carolina Democrats, as well.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s able to continue getting people (out) with her ideas, it\u2019s good for our democracy,\u201d said Josh Brannon, a Democratic candidate for the 5th district seat. \u201cA lot more Democrats could have bigger opportunities in November.\u201d\n\nBrannon led a field of four candidates in the 5th District Democrat primary May 6, but fell short of the 40 percent of votes threshold needed to avoid a runoff.

Virginia Foxx in the fall.\n\nHagan said she will campaign across the state on weekends between now and November, while still maintaining her responsibilities in Washington, D.C. during the week.
