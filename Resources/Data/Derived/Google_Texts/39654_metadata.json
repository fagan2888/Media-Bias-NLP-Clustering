Builder of the Temple, King when Israel reached its greatest height, author of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, and judge of awesome wisdom, he is admired and lauded.\n\nYet he seems to pale in comparison with his father. In the last few years, several biographies of David have appeared, but none of his successor. David\u2019s Psalms dominate the liturgy; Solomon\u2019s Proverbs remain hidden. Ecclesiastes only pops up briefly for Shabbat Hol Mamoed Sukkot and is then put back in cold storage.\n\nThis week\u2019s Haftarah suggests why:\n\nThe Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as He had promised him; and there was peace between Hiram [Phoenician King of Tyre] and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty. King Solomon imposed forced labor on all Israel; the levy came to 30,000 men. He sent them to Lebanon in shifts of 10,000 a month; they would spend one month in Lebanon and two months at home.\n\nAn entente with an idolater is bad enough; but then Solomon imposes labor on Israelite men in a grim evocation of Egyptian slavery. The great Anglican theologian and philologist Frederic Farrar (1831-1903) suggested\n\nIt was perhaps from his Egyptian father-in-law that Solomon, to his own cost, learnt the secret of forced labour. In their Egyptian bondage the forefathers of Israel had been fatally familiar with the ugly word mas, the labour wrung from them by hard task-masters.\n\nLittle wonder that after Solomon\u2019s death, the people begged for relief from his policies and eventually broke up the kingdom because of them.\n\nThe contemporary Protestant theologian Walter Brueggemann goes farther. Brueggemann argues in The Prophetic Imagination that Solomon created a \u201cRoyal Consciousness\u201d of oppression, imperialism, affluence and hidebound, static religion. (Like most, he also gives David a pass). When the prophets protest against injustice, Brueggemann argues, they are protesting Solomon.\n\nYet is all this fair? The Tanach lists Solomon\u2019s actions after telling us of his wisdom for a reason. \u201cWisdom\u201d, after all, does not mean intelligence so much as it means practical reason \u2013 determining the best plan of action in the face of imperfect information and unpleasant alternatives.\n\nHow, precisely, was the Temple supposed to be built? J.H. Hertz suggests that the Israelites could simply have volunteered objects, as they did with the Mishkan in the desert. One can wonder about Hertz\u2019 realism. The Temple was supposed to be bigger and grander than the Mishkan \u2013 indeed, that was the whole point. And were the contributions in the desert as \u201cvoluntary\u201d as is commonly thought? Everyone was traveling together in a vulnerable position: in the desert, it certainly would have been difficult to reject \u201csuggestions\u201d of contributing to the Mishkan. In the far flung Kingdom of Israel, there were more places to hide.\n\nNor should we be misled by the phrase \u201cforced labor.\u201d Solomon\u2019s path diverged sharply from slavery, which as the social theorist Orlando Patterson has argued, constitutes a form of \u201csocial death\u201d: the slave submits to total domination from the master, and is deprived of identity, the ability to reproduce, or an independent culture. Instead, Solomon\u2019s policy looks more like conscription, in the case of building the Temple, the underlying purpose is just as compelling as national defense (perhaps even more so).\n\nTaxation also serves as a useful analogy. Modern states would simply tax citizens for public works projects. Solomon did not do that here probably because he couldn\u2019t: ancient Israel lacked a modern case economy. Was a temporary one-third levy exorbitant? Ask tax-cutter George W. Bush, who in his 2000 Presidential nomination speech declared 33% a reasonable rate to pay.\n\nOne could argue, of course, that if building the Temple required forced labor, then Solomon shouldn\u2019t have done it. But apart from the fact that it derived from divine command, would Israel really have accepted it? Israel wanted the Temple, and the glory that came with it. It didn\u2019t want to pay for it. Solomon had to figure out how to square those things. No wonder the Tanach calls him wise.\n\nPurists would also condemn Solomon\u2019s treaty with Hiram. Israel\u2019s king could have attacked the pagan ruler, who still held sections of the Land of Israel and tried to entice the Israelites with Baal-worship. Eventually, Hiram\u2019s descendant Jezebel would marry Israel\u2019s King Ahab and persecute Israelites. But Solomon cut a deal and got the lumber and skilled craftsmen he needed, as well as preserving the lives of Israelites who would have died in a religious war of conquest.\n\nSolomon\u2019s policy looks terrible. It feels terrible. But under the circumstances, it might have been the best that could be achieved. He got the Temple built. He kept the nation secure and at peace, and unified. Few would call the man perfect, but in comparison to his father, even his sins look good. Religious conscription is disquieting: sleeping with another man\u2019s wife and then using royal authority to murder him is diabolical. Obviously, we cannot overlook Solomon\u2019s great sin, when in his \u201cold age,\u201d his foreign wives \u201cturned his heart after other gods.\u201d (1 Kings 11:4). But we might easily ascribe this to senility, and in any event, it hardly undermines the rest of the prodigious good the man did.\n\nWhy, then, do popular culture and Jewish tradition seem to put Solomon in the shade? Perhaps it is because Solomon committed sins worse to us than chasing after other gods, namely, boredom and compromise. His triumphs are soporific compared to David\u2019s. David wrote poetry; Solomon gave advice. David conquered Jerusalem; Solomon built the drainage. David killed Goliath; Solomon negotiated treaties. It is easier to overlook, or forgive, the messiness of life when the triumphs are so beautiful. David understood this and milked it. Solomon couldn\u2019t: he had too much work to do.\n\nWe love warriors, singers, movie stars. We detest legislators and bureaucrats. Popular songs commemorate the heroes and the lovers. If there is a song about passing the Affordable Care Act, or fixing the healthcare.gov website, I haven\u2019t seen it. But nearly 20 million people are now covered because of health care reform. When my daughter gets sick, a song is good, but medicine is better.\n\nSolomon\u2019s (literally) prosaic virtues do not imply that the prophets, or even Brueggemann, are totally wrong. Instead, two traditions battle: Wisdom and Prophecy. As an ideal type, Prophecy criticizes, holds power to account, demands the fulfillment of ideals. Wisdom grapples with the world as it is, not as we want it to be; it understands the limits of power and recognizes the need for ambiguity; it rejects redemption. Prophecy calls down the sure and certain word of the Lord; for Wisdom, \u201cit is the glory of God to conceal a matter, and the glory of kings to explore a matter.\u201d (Proverbs 25:2).\n\nAlthough Haftarah\u2019s whole section of Tanach is called Nevi\u2019im, in fact it contains both of these traditions, and Haftarah\u2019s brilliance lies in its capacity to include both. It\u2019s mostly Isaiah and Jeremiah, but lots of Kings and Judges, too. Haftarah must return to prominence precisely because it comprises both Wisdom and Prophecy. We will read and chant Isaiah, and Jeremiah, and Amos, and be inspired. But Solomon should inspire us as well.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nView our privacy policy and terms of service.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/this_weeks_haftorah/item/ambiguities_of_power_haftarat_terumah_1_kings_526_613", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/large-icon-512.png", "site_name": "Jewish Journal", "title": "Ambiguities of Power: Haftarat Terumah, 1 Kings 5:26-6:13 | This Week's Haftorah"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 23102350, "title": "Ambiguities of Power: Haftarat Terumah, 1 Kings 5:26-6:13 | This Week's Haftorah", "url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/this_weeks_haftorah/item/ambiguities_of_power_haftarat_terumah_1_kings_526_613", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/large-icon-512.png", "site": "@jewishjournal", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "1439B350A4269424970C93B18CEAF6FB", "fb": {"app_id": 216180581861512}, "keywords": "Jewish Journal, news, jewish, israel, los angeles, Tribe Media Corp, Hollywood, Israel, jewish, judaism, world, nation", "verify-v1": "5CqSOVc2kyARWwZMAxu3QCpMoZGbB5Nu6xIPWK5MXvQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5f0\"", "article_summary": "King Solomon imposed forced labor on all Israel; the levy came to 30,000 men.\nBuilder of the Temple, King when Israel reached its greatest height, author of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, and judge of awesome wisdom, he is admired and lauded.\nAn entente with an idolater is bad enough; but then Solomon imposes labor on Israelite men in a grim evocation of Egyptian slavery.\nOne could argue, of course, that if building the Temple required forced labor, then Solomon shouldn\u2019t have done it.\nAs an ideal type, Prophecy criticizes, holds power to account, demands the fulfillment of ideals."}
