REUTERS/Larry Downing\n\n4321896\n\nPresident Obama and Vice President Biden announced a new administration initiative to combat rape and sexual assault on college campuses Friday. While the campaign urges public participation, those who decide to sign on will forward their information to a liberal think tank.\n\nThe campaign, dubbed \u201cIt\u2019s On Us,\u201d is being conducted in collaboration with over 200 universities around the country, as well as groups such as the NCAA and even the video game company Electronic Arts. Celebrities are getting in on the act as well, joining Obama and Biden in a video to push the initiative.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on us to stop sexual assault,\u201d opens actor Jon Hamm of \u201cMad Men\u201d fame. \u201cTo get in the way before it happens,\u201d says actress Kerry Washington.\n\nParticipating organizations and companies have vowed to promote the campaign on their websites, social media accounts, and in other areas.\n\nA website for the endeavor, promoted by President Obama in the video, asks visitors to take a pledge to intervene against possible assaults, to \u201cnot to be a bystander to the problem but to be a part of the solution.\u201d Pledgetakers are asked to change their profile pictures on social media outlets to the campaign\u2019s logo and to supply their emails and zip codes to the campaign.\n\nThose who participate will have their information forwarded to the Center for American Progress, a left-wing think tank with significant ties to the Obama administration. This is because the \u201cIt\u2019s On Us\u201d campaign, despite its presidential endorsement, is actually being undertaken by Generation Progress, a student activism arm of CAP.\n\nAccompanying the \u201cIt\u2019s On Us\u201d campaign is a new program by the Department of Justice, which will distribute over $6 million to 18 colleges to facilitate the development of new sexual assault protocols on campus.\n\nSexual assault on campus has garnered much more attention in recent years, with activists arguing that as many as one in four women in college experience sexual assault before leaving (other groups dispute this figure).\n\nIn spring, the Department of Education announced that over 50 colleges and universities around the country, including elite schools such as Harvard, are under investigation for alleged violations of Title IX due to their handling of sexual assault.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan group of senators led by Democrat Claire McCaskill of Missouri recently proposed a bill creating new fines and other penalties for universities that fail to meet obligations under Title IX.\n\nFollow Blake on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
