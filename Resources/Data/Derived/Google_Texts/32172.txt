Payment-card network MasterCard Inc. on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected earnings for its third quarter, though an increase in rebates and incentives dented revenue growth.

The Purchase, N.Y.-based company has recently felt pressure from a strong U.S. dollar, particularly when compared with the euro and the Brazilian real. Recently, the company's revenue growth has been dampened by incentives paid to clients.

For the period ended Sept. 30, the company posted earnings of $977 million, or 86 cents a share, compared with $1.02 billion, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. The results included a $50 million after-tax charge related to the termination of a U.S. employee pension plan.

Excluding that charge, per-share earnings were 91 cents.

Revenue grew 1.6% to $2.53 billion, or 8% excluding currency impacts.

Analysts had projected 87 cents a share in profit and $2.54 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.

Like rival Visa, MasterCard processes electronic payments on its network, but doesn't collect interest or set interest rates.

In the latest quarter, purchase volume grew 12%, on a constant-currency basis, to $852 billion. Processed transactions grew 12% to 12.3 billion, while cross-border volumes grew 16%.

Gross dollar volume grew 13%, in terms of local currency, to $1.2 trillion.
