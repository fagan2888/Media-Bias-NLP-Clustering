Kalispell is clearly who we want our partner to be, whatever that means,\u201d Spring said.\n\nSpring said the hospital has been contacted by other organizations about possible acquisitions in the past.\n\nStevens said Kalispell Regional Healthcare is similarly seeing an increased frequency in organizations expressing interest in acquiring the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe used to get (contacted) four times a year. Now we get it every month,\u201d she said.\n\nLast year there were 95 hospital mergers, consolidations or joint ventures and the year before that there were 98. In 2012, there were 105. In 2009, there were 50.\n\nThe consolidations are a result of the industry\u2019s latest tectonic shift, triggered largely by President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which has changed the economics for health care providers.\n\n\u201cIn theory, integrated care is better care. That\u2019s part of why you\u2019re seeing this most recent wave of mergers,\u201d said Bryce Ward, health care director at the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana.\n\nWard said it makes sense for hospitals to work together more frequently, particularly by sharing information through an independent entity to improve efficiency and delivery.\n\nBut the drawback of a merger is that consumers could end up paying a higher price for care, he added.\n\n\u201cThe big fear, when you have mergers, is that the lack of competition will allow prices to rise. There is evidence that that can occur,\u201d he said.\n\nStevens insisted that a possible merger is not at the forefront of discussions and said the hospital\u2019s board of directors had not made any decisions about any potential changes.\n\nThe two hospitals already share physicians, specialists and a variety of services.\n\nSpring said that the two hospitals already work together well and that it was worth strengthening that partnership for the benefit of both communities.\n\n\u201cWe think what\u2019s best for this market is to have it a valleywide system that allows us to move patients in a coordinated fashion through the system instead of having two or three different hospitals doing that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two organizations have agreed to follow a set of principles that would guide the task force\u2019s efforts.\n\nThey are: support a formal working relationship between the two organizations; preserve each hospital\u2019s unique business model, cultural identity, and community philanthropic support base; facilitate innovative collaboration among physicians, clinical, administrative, and technical staff; promote the sharing of \u201cbest practices;\u201d and implement efficiencies among the hospitals that benefit the overall health care effectiveness, while promoting financial soundness.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Flathead Beacon", "description": "While hospitals across the nation are merging at the highest rate since the 1990s as the health care landscape undergoes a dramatic shift, Kalispell Regional Healthcare and North Valley Hospital...  more", "title": "Kalispell, Whitefish Hospitals Explore Formal Collaboration - Flathead Beacon", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/20141024_KRMC_016.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-21T10:37:32-06:00", "url": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/2015/07/20/kalispell-whitefish-hospitals-explore-formal-collaboration/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/wp-content/themes/flathead-beacon/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FlatheadBeacon", "section": "Front Page", "published_time": "2015-07-20T17:26:58-06:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-21T10:37:32-06:00"}, "google-site-verification": "x7bqQRTLUVbNNQe0HUJ0bnx_EXmr6uOwcIs_ZIT9n9g", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Stevens said Kalispell Regional Healthcare is similarly seeing an increased frequency in organizations expressing interest in acquiring the hospital.\nThe consolidations are a result of the industry\u2019s latest tectonic shift, triggered largely by President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which has changed the economics for health care providers.\nWhile hospitals across the nation are merging at the highest rate since the 1990s as the health care landscape undergoes a dramatic shift, Kalispell Regional Healthcare and North Valley Hospital are considering increased collaboration between the valley\u2019s two largest health care providers.\nThat\u2019s part of why you\u2019re seeing this most recent wave of mergers,\u201d said Bryce Ward, health care director at the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana.\nIn a joint interview on July 20, Velinda Stevens, CEO of Kalispell Regional Healthcare, and Jason Spring, CEO of North Valley Hospital in Whitefish, said the two hospitals are exploring possible opportunities that could support a formal working relationship between the two organizations in the future."}
