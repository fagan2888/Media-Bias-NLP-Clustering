That\u2019s because panthers are killing off livestock such as cattle in large numbers, and ranchers are taking a financial hit.\n\n\n\nCharter Boat Captain Teddy Naftal has been living on the edge of the Picayune Strand State Forest in Naples for a couple years. His property is surrounded by sprawling ranch land and a lot of animals.\n\n\u201cLook there\u2019s a peacock here,\u201d Naftal said while pointing to a bird walking across a pathway on his property. \u201cWe also have bears in and out of the yard daily. I see a lot of bobcats back and forth. I have deer come through once in a while.\u201d\n\nNaftal said he\u2019s used to seeing wildlife. In fact, it\u2019s part of the reason he moved here. Naftal is a hunter. He said he also wanted to move to a property where he could keep a couple animals, mostly for tax purposes, but animals are part of the problem now.\n\n\u201cThere are turkeys here now and then, but mostly cats,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are taking over and they are taking all the animals away from us.\u201d\n\nNaftal\u2019s talking about panthers. More specifically, the endangered Florida Panther.\n\nA couple decades ago, it was on the brink of extinction. In the 90s, there were less than 30 panthers roaming the state. That\u2019s why biologists bred them with Texas Cougars, which are genetically identical to Florida panthers. The breeding worked. Right now, there are about 160 in the wild.\n\nHowever, a lot has changed here in Southwest Florida since the 90s. This area may be a stronghold for the panther, but right outside their refuge, there is heavy development.\n\nKen Warren, a spokesman for U.S Fish and Wildlife, said humans spent years encroaching on panther land and now the booming panther population is creating the opposite problem.\n\n\u201cYou see a lot of issues with panthers being hit by cars,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn some cases panthers encroaching into neighborhoods where people are living and raising their families.\u201d\n\nPanthers are also particularly drawn to areas like Naftal\u2019s property. Panthers can roam relatively safely there and there\u2019s cattle for them to feed on.\n\nNaftal said right now he has three calves and a bull. But, he\u2019s losing new cows all the time.\n\n\u201cEvery calf that they punch out there is gone,\u201d he said \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to save one. Definitely it\u2019s getting worse. I\u2019ve seen it in the last three years. It\u2019s terrible.\u201d\n\nNaftal said his daughter brought in several miniature goats a while back. But, he says they didn\u2019t make it a week before getting picked off by panthers.\n\nNaftal said he has a few donkeys, too. He bought them to protect the calves. And they\u2019ve been trying \u2013 mostly unsuccessfully\u2014 to keep the panthers at bay.\n\n\u201cMy oldest one here, Pedro, he\u2019s the male in the bunch,\u201d he said. \u201cHe comes with scars all the time fighting off the panthers, or the cougars.\u201d\n\nEven though Pedro is a little worse for wear and Naftal\u2019s herd is getting smaller, he said larger cattle ranchers in the area have it much harder.\n\nIn fact, around four years ago commercial and small-scale cattle ranchers started noticing a lot of their calves \u2013 and other livestock-- were missing.\n\nRanchers suspected panthers. So, U.S. Fish and Wildlife paid for Caitlin Jacobs, a graduate student at the University of Florida, to conduct a study. Over two years, Jacobs ear-tagged and monitored 200 cows at two different ranches in the area.\n\nShe said in that time one rancher lost about 5 percent of her calves to panthers. The other lost about point-5 percent.\n\n\u201cThey maybe even thought they were losing more,\u201d Jacobs explained. \u201cAnd they could be because this is a study done just over two years. So obviously factors can change. So, 5.3 percent is really just an estimate of what could potentially happen out there.\u201d\n\nNow, state and federal officials have to figure out a way to make sure panthers don\u2019t end up seriously hurting ranchers in Southwest Florida.\n\nBesides the fact that cattle is big business in Florida, Warren points out ranchlands have also helped panthers rebound.\n\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Commissioner Leisa Priddy owns a cattle ranch in the area. Her ranch was part of Jacobs\u2019 study. She was the rancher that lost 5 percent of her calves. Priddy said dealing with panthers is a tricky situation mostly because of strict federal laws protecting panthers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing whatsoever that we can do to dissuade the panthers from preying on our calves at this point,\u201d she said.\n\nState and federal officials are trying to figure out a way to offset the cost of living around panthers.\n\nState panther biologist Darrell Land said there\u2019s a pilot program in the works that will pay ranchers for maintaining land in panther areas. Land said this would be better than paying ranchers for each animal killed by a panther because most of the time it\u2019s hard to prove.\n\nUltimately, though, both Land and Commissioner Priddy explain any program should be funded by the federal government since all Florida Panther regulations are federal. Land said that could be another hurdle.\n\n\u201cWe are very hopeful that that pilot program will become a more permanent type of program, but unfortunately that may mean that Congress will have to fund the program and right now they don\u2019t play well together,\u201d Land said.\n\nWarren said the goal is to have three viable populations with 240 panthers each before the recovery can be called a success, though they are re-evaluating that criteria. He also says they need to find a way to get the panther population to naturally migrate north, which could help Southwest Florida.\n\nWhile state and federal officials try to work out a plan, Naftal wants more regulations on the panthers. Specifically, he wants his animals protected from these predators.\n\nUntil then, though, Naftal said he\u2019s thinking of moving.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/florida-panther-rebounds-ranchers-face-increasing-cattle-loss", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201408/343474741.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "As The Florida Panther Rebounds, Ranchers Face Increasing Cattle Loss"}, "story_id": 343474692, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Ashley Lopez", "org_id": 399, "dc": {"title": "As The Florida Panther Rebounds, Ranchers Face Increasing Cattle Loss"}, "nid": 7626, "datePublished": "2014-08-27", "keywords": "endangered species, environmental threat, Florida Fish and Wildlife Commissioner, Florida Panther, panther, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, research", "wordCount": 1310, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb792\"", "article_summary": "The endangered Florida Panther is experiencing a slight population rebound.\nThat\u2019s why biologists bred them with Texas Cougars, which are genetically identical to Florida panthers.\nKen Warren, a spokesman for U.S Fish and Wildlife, said humans spent years encroaching on panther land and now the booming panther population is creating the opposite problem.\nMore specifically, the endangered Florida Panther.\nIn fact, around four years ago commercial and small-scale cattle ranchers started noticing a lot of their calves \u2013 and other livestock-- were missing."}
