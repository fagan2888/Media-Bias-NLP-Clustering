Despite a noticeably tamer string of episodes as of late, this week\u2019s offering hits back with a bit more oomph. Here, Key & Peele touch on topics like terrorism and the TSA, sensational talk shows, and dysfunctional criminal gangs.\n\nThe Great\n\nMy favorite sketch from this episode takes place in a trash-strewn backyard, where Eduardo, a newly initiated gang member, has just smashed a beer bottle on his head. \u201cEduardo is loco!\u201d is the phrase that prompts the action for the entire sketch, which shows Carlito (Peele) subsequently trying to reserve the \u201ccrazy\u201d label for himself. He\u2019ll do just about anything to gain the title, too. He throws a trashcan on his head, displays his Tilikum whale underpants, and uses a book to simulate a duck\u2019s beak. As Key\u2019s gang leader puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of loco, okay? That\u2019s more zany or goofy.\u201d This disconnect guides the rest of the vignette. This sketch is equal parts caricature and left-field humor (which Key & Peele handles particularly well), and the result is something that rests comfortably at the nexus of familiar and bizarre.\n\nThe Good\n\nOne of the more memorable bits from this week sarcastically suggests that TSA airport rules aren\u2019t carried out in vain. Set in a cave somewhere in the Middle East, Key plays a terrorist leader who, for the first time, learns about the United States\u2019 airport security measures. It\u2019s a cartoonish depiction, with jihadists taken straight from central casting, and its central humor stems from the idea that the TSA is, in fact, a successful band of \u201canti-terrorist commandos.\u201d The cheeky observational humor works at the expensive of the current state of airport security, mining topics like oddly specific liquid and blade allowances, uniforms, and the observed morale of TSA workers for jokes.\n\nThere\u2019s a political tinge to this week\u2019s opener as well, which shows a heated talk show program \u00e0 la Fox News titled \u201cDramatically Opposed.\u201d In it, two anchors engage in a heated, albeit vague, debate over Obamacare, bailouts, and the economy, all before realizing that they\u2019re both Republicans. Depending on a viewer\u2019s party identification, it could be off-putting, but the inherent comedy of increasingly absurd and sensational news programs is something we\u2019ve all experienced, regardless of our placement on the political spectrum. It\u2019s a clever premise with a pronounced punchline, and I\u2019m a sucker for Key & Peele\u2019s social commentary.\n\nThe Take It Or Leave It\n\nA sketch in which a man returns to his parents\u2019 house to announce his engagement veers off course to become a mostly tedious bit. It starts out interestingly enough, with the introduction of his loser older brother Clive, who still lives in his parents\u2019 home. Clive\u2019s intense jealousy is understandable\u2014his hair is thinning, he has no girlfriend, he is presumably jobless, and his handsome brother is marrying a Price is Right model\u2014but his outward hostility toward the rest of his family is more frustrating than funny. I did enjoy watching Key skirt around his character\u2019s good fortune for the sake of his brother, and liked the levity of a short-lived tender moment in which Clive ponders the best man role.\n\nLastly, I\u2019m still on the fence about the Meegan and Andre bit, which is the same reaction I had when they were introduced in season two. Whereas the first rendition of Meegan and her submissive boyfriend benefitted from an abstract, oddball concept (in which Key\u2019s Andre literally follows Meegan to the end of the earth to return her jacket), this particular sketch is more in line with last season\u2019s update on the \u201ccouple.\u201d In season three, Andre gets jumped for sticking up for Meegan, whose nasally voice and aloof behavior make her a frustrating caricature of the mythically annoying female. Here, it\u2019s the same joke, but somehow Meegan\u2019s inexplicably idiotic behavior and dismissal of movie theater etiquette is made tolerable by the performances. Peele does a killer job portraying Meegan, even exhibiting a careful attention to her walk, and Key\u2019s portrayal of Andre as the straight man boyfriend adds a juxtaposition to the fictional relationship that gives it much needed dimension.\n\nOverall, this episode is a step up from last week\u2019s mostly disjointed affair, but it\u2019s not the best we\u2019ve seen from the show. That said, if this is Key & Peele at its tamest, that\u2019s still pretty darn commendable. I remain optimistic as we move into season four\u2019s second half, and feel certain that the best of Key & Peele is yet to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last night's episode was a step up from last week's mostly disjointed affair, but it's not the best we've seen from the show.", "title": "Key & Peele Review: \"Terrorist Meeting\" - Paste Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "pastemagazine.com", "description": "Last night's episode was a step up from last week's mostly disjointed affair, but it's not the best we've seen from the show.", "title": "Key & Peele Review: \"Terrorist Meeting\"", "url": "https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/12/key-peele-review-terrorist-meeting.html", "image": {"width": 556, "identifier": "https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/k%26p411a.jpg", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/k%26p411a.jpg", "description": "Last night's episode was a step up from last week's mostly disjointed affair, but it's not the best we've seen from the show.", "site": "@pastemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Key & Peele Review: \"Terrorist Meeting\""}, "p": {"domain_verify": "8f36922bc91ba221f10d82c407d8b6a9"}, "fb": {"admins": 1185614656, "app_id": 127550380613969, "pages": 18512903240}, "keywords": ", <i>Key & Peele</i> Review: \"Terrorist Meeting\", Comedy, Reviews, Articles, Paste", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5a94\"", "article_summary": "That said, if this is Key & Peele at its tamest, that\u2019s still pretty darn commendable.\nHere, Key & Peele touch on topics like terrorism and the TSA, sensational talk shows, and dysfunctional criminal gangs.\nI remain optimistic as we move into season four\u2019s second half, and feel certain that the best of Key & Peele is yet to come.\nSet in a cave somewhere in the Middle East, Key plays a terrorist leader who, for the first time, learns about the United States\u2019 airport security measures.\n\u201cEduardo is loco!\u201d is the phrase that prompts the action for the entire sketch, which shows Carlito (Peele) subsequently trying to reserve the \u201ccrazy\u201d label for himself."}
