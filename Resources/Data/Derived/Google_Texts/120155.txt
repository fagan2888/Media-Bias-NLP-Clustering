A Florida Panhandle woman has been arrested three times in six months on charges related to Medicaid fraud.

According to a statement Monday from Attorney General Pam Bondi's office, 31-year-old Megan Sanai of Freeport first was arrested in August for exploitation of a senior citizen.

Sanai was arrested again in December for allegedly withdrawing more than $2,000 from the same victim's account.

Bondi's office says Sanai was arrested a third time Friday at a court hearing related to the previous investigations. Authorities say Sanai faces new charges for allegedly stealing over $11,000 from the Social Security Administration and falsifying vital statistics records.

Sanai is being held without bail. Walton County jail records don't show whether she has an attorney. She faces up to 20 years in prison and $20,000 in fines.
