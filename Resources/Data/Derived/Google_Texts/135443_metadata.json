Photo by John Strickler/The Mercury\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u0097 In the final calculus, the meager legislative results of being a member of Congress were just not worth the sacrifice required to do the job for Jim Gerlach.\n\nUltimately, that was what led the 58-year-old Republican to announce last week that he will not seek re-election to 6th District seat he has held since 2003, Gerlach said during an interview with The Mercury, a sister paper of The Times Herald.\n\n\u0093We\u0092re really not seeing much change in the legislative process down here in Washington and we\u0092re not getting a lot achieved with all the tussle and gridlock, we\u0092re really in kind of a holding pattern,\u0094 Gerlach said.\n\n\u0093Realistically, I don\u0092t see much movement on either side any time soon and I began to wonder whether it was worth not seeing my family, all the traveling and the permanent campaigning, when we\u0092re not really getting a lot done,\u0094 Gerlach said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGerlach, of Chester Springs, said he had been mulling the decision for some time, but resolved to wait until the break over the holidays to talk to his family and give the question his full attention.\n\n\u0093I\u0092ve been thinking about it on-and-off for a few months, but I wanted to wait until I got home for the holidays to concentrate on it without all the hustle and bustle here in Washington,\u0094 Gerlach said.\n\nThe decision made, Gerlach said he has no particular plans for the future, other than a desire to remain involved in public policy in some way, although, he said, not as a Washington lobbyist.\n\nAs a member of the majority on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee \u0097 a seat which Gerlach suspects many of his fellow House members are already maneuvering to obtain \u0097 Gerlach said he learned quickly how much public policy gets decided on the committee that determines how to pay for those public policy initiatives.\n\nBeing appointed to that committee \u0093was a real education,\u0094 said Gerlach, \u0093and I was a little worried at first because I don\u0092t have a tax background.\u0094\n\nBut he\u0092s a quick study and Gerlach said perhaps his biggest regret about not being around after his terms ends in December is the likelihood he won\u0092t be around to participate in a major re-write of the tax code Republicans had hoped to have underway already.\n\n\u0093But that got bogged down in the fall with the (government) shutdown,\u0094 Gerlach said.\n\nGerlach acknowledged polling that shows the shutdown hurt Republicans\u0092 reputation nationally.\n\nBut he also agreed that a Jan. 3 Molly Ball column in The Atlantic made an interesting point \u0097 that House Speaker John Boehner needed to allow the shutdown to play out in order to chasten and rein-in recalcitrant \u0093Tea Party\u0094 Republicans who were making legislative compromise difficult by clinging to uncompromising policy positions.\n\nBoehner \u0093didn\u0092t want a deal that ended the shutdown without resolving the more serious matter of the debt ceiling, and he wanted his unruly caucus to learn a lesson. So he waited,\u0094 Ball wrote.\n\n\u0093Post-shutdown, things changed. The negotiators \u0097 House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray \u0097 actually got together. They worked out a compromise. They hit the deadline. And then both houses of Congress passed it,\u0094 she wrote.\n\n\u0093I have no personal problem with our leadership,\u0094 Gerlach said. \u0093I like Speaker Boehner. I think he has the right agenda, but I recognize they have a diverse caucus that they have to steer.\u0094\n\nBut whether or not the new ability to reach common ground will last is anybody\u0092s guess.\n\n\u0093The jury\u0092s still out. I don\u0092t think we\u0092ll know if its going to last until we get to the debt ceiling, where I think some people may really dig in their heels,\u0094 said Gerlach.\n\nGerlach said he hoped the lessons of the shutdown will be learned by both sides.\n\nBoth the legislative and executive branches should focus on the possible, he said.\n\nHe pointed to President Clinton\u0092s \u0093move to the middle\u0094 when Republicans took over both houses of Congress in the 1990s. \u0093He saw where things were headed and he focused on the things where there was common ground and got some things done.\u0094\n\nNow, \u0093President Obama is still taking a more partisan position, perhaps to see if the Democrats can take back the House and then he will have an easier time, but if that doesn\u0092t happen, will he do what President Clinton did? I hope he does,\u0094 said Gerlach.\n\nThe Republicans also need to step up, he said.\n\n\u0093We have to have a positive agenda, propose solutions for jobs, the economy, education rather than just vote against other people\u0092s initiatives. We can\u0092t just be the party of \u0091no,\u0092\u0094 said Gerlach, conceding that impression has grown among Americans in part because of the more than 40 House votes taken to de-fund the Affordable Care Act, known to most as \u0093Obamacare.\u0094\n\nMake no mistake, Gerlach thinks that legislation \u0093is a monstrosity,\u0094 but he said Republicans would be better served politically, and better serve the country, by offering realistic alternatives.\n\nAlthough he would like to have spent most of his time on policy questions, Gerlach has been unable to avoid the political side of the job, both because demographic changes have made the 6th District one of the most closely-watched swing districts in the country, but also because the two-year term leaves very little time when House members are not campaigning, or planning a campaign.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s the era of the permanent campaign,\u0094 he said. \u0093From November to January, nothing really happens and then the new year comes and the robo-calls start, the emails. You get no real time off from the campaign and it\u0092s tough to legislate that way.\u0094\n\nPart of the cause for the \u0093permanent campaign\u0094 is the short-length of the terms.\n\n\u0093I do think in this day and age, a two-year-term is too short. I think it should be four years and leave the Senate at six, but those terms are in the Constitution\u0094 and given the current political difficulty in such basic functions as adopting an annual budget, Gerlach said he did not see agreement to make a change to the Constitution coming to Washington any time soon.\n\nFurther, the increasing number of \u0093safe districts\u0094 in the country allows for candidates who are further left, and further right, of the mainstream political spectrum to be elected without fear of consequences at the voting booth for taking uncompromising positions and delivering little in terms of tangible results, Gerlach said.\n\n\u0093When you have 435 seats (in the House of Representatives) but only 50 are competitive, you only have 50 members who need to be flexible, and it gets harder and harder to find common ground,\u0094 he said. \u0093And every 10 years when they re-district, more districts get a little bit safer.\u0094\n\nGerlach said he recognized the irony of that statement coming from someone who has arguably benefitted from the re-drawing of a district that now includes parts of five counties, but not one entire county, but few would say his district has historically been \u0093safe.\u0094\n\nDemocrats at the national level have repeatedly targeted the 6 District as \u0093winnable\u0094 since 2002, and Gerlach\u0092s margins of victory often have been ridiculously thin. Some national publications have, at times, called them the slimmest in the nation.\n\n(Perhaps that\u0092s why Gerlach\u0092s announcement that he will not run again made news across the country, including in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.)\n\nAs a result, over the years there has been a lot of money spent on both sides of the aisle trying to win the 6th District seat, which stretches across portions of Chester, Montgomery, Berks and Lebanon counties.\n\nIt is not a cheap proposition, as Gerlach certainly knows.\n\n\u0093Philadelphia is the fourth most expensive media market in the nation and one week\u0092s worth of television ads to get good penetration costs $800,000,\u0094 Gerlach said. \u0093That\u0092s a lot of money. In a close race, you can go through $2 million in three weeks and you can\u0092t afford not to be running ads if your opponent is. You\u0092ve got to compete.\u0094\n\n\u0093One district-wide mailing can cost $50,000,\u0094 and then you add in the funding streams unleashed by the Supreme Court\u0092s Citizens United decision \u0093and it gets to be a pretty expensive proposition. But you can\u0092t afford not to advertise. As a candidate, you are no different than any other product or service that needs to advertise to get in front of people,\u0094 Gerlach said.\n\nNevertheless, Gerlach said the amount of money now required to run a campaign is \u0093not corrosive. It\u0092s freedom of speech. Where it goes off track is not when the ads are hard-hitting, I don\u0092t have a problem with that, it\u0092s when they\u0092re not factual or relevant to the job you\u0092re running for.\u0094\n\nSo he won\u0092t miss not having to worry about those things for the next 12 months as both parties jostle for position and to find the candidate who can win the seat.\n\nIn the meantime, \u0093I\u0092m not going anywhere. There is still work to do,\u0094 said Gerlach.\n\nOf the work he has done in his 11 years in office, Gerlach said there are two aspects of which he is the most proud.\n\n\u0093I\u0092m really proud of the constituent services we provide, helping a veteran get his benefits, that kind of thing, our office staff really excels at that,\u0094 Gerlach said.\n\nAs for legislation, \u0093well I\u0092m pleased about the bill I just authored and the President signed that allows four-strain flu vaccine into the market place,\u0094 Gerlach. \u0093But in terms of my time here, I was proud to be part of the Medicare Part D bill, that was good for seniors and I helped get language in there to ensure that states like Pennsylvania,\u0094 which also provide help paying for medications, get reimbursed by the federal government. \u0093That meant hundreds of millions of dollars for Pennsylvania.\u0094\n\nLooking further back, \u0093I was very pleased with the results of my first bill, to establish a national veterans cemetery in Southeast Pennsylvania,\u0094 he added.\n\nAs he looks back on his time in Washington, Gerlach noted that his decision to leave seems to be part of a pattern.\n\n\u0093You know I was a lawyer for 10 years, and then I was in state government for 12 years and when I\u0092m done here, I will have served 12 years in Congress,\u0094 said Gerlach.\n\nAs for what\u0092s next, Gerlach continues to keep it close the vest.\n\nHe insists he has no immediate plans, but many say a man who has been in the public eye as long as Gerlach, who briefly ran for governor in 2010, is not likely to quietly fade away any time soon.\n\nFollow Evan Brandt on Twitter @PottstownNews", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Norristown news, PA news, US news, world news.", "title": "Rep.
