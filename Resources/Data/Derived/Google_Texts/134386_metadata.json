The Ohio River snakes around the borders of the scant, 620-person town, separating it from the state of Indiana immediately north, and Ohio slightly northeast. Streaks of smoke hang lazily among the clouds, stretching into the sky from the coal power plant just to the south. Ranch and split-level homes stand plain before acres of flat pasture. The silhouettes of lonesome billboards dotting the highway are as close as the town comes to a skyline. One gets the impression that a gaze out of a Petersburg window today would reveal the same landscape that existed a hundred years ago.\n\nIn 2001, however, the town saw something new. A non-profit, fundamentalist Christian apologetics ministry called Answers in Genesis (AiG) broke otherwise untroubled ground in Petersburg, in the construction of what the group would later call the Creation Museum.\n\nThe multimillion-dollar testament to a seemingly invaluable faith did not come without a fight. AiG filed several suits in order to develop the plot of Boone County land the way that they wished, with the apparent strategy being to litigate until their opponents gave up.\n\nFrom planning to construction, the 60,000-square-foot museum took nearly 10 years and $27 million to complete. The museum opened to the public in 2007, and according to AiG officials surpassed its annual attendance projection of 250,000 visitors within five months.\n\nAn array of extravagances \u2014 such as a planetarium, raptor-themed zip line, biblical-era petting zoo as well as dinosaur and insect skeleton collections \u2014 await Creation Museum visitors, as does friendly service. If hired permanently, museum employees must sign a \u201cstatement of faith\u201d affirming their beliefs in AiG\u2019s principles. The workers always smile as they greet guests.\n\nThey smile as they remind visitors that their tickets \u2014 which have just gone up from $5 to $29.95, officially due to gas hikes and a poor economy \u2014 are good for two days.\n\nThey smile as they offer Noah\u2019s Caf\u00e9 patrons a souvenir mug, featuring information on the real age of a T-rex (created on Day 6, approximately 4004 BC) for $6.99, which includes free refills all day.\n\nThey smile even more as they guide guests into a lecture hall for an hour-long talk on the physical existence of a \u201cmitochondrial Eve.\u201d\n\nOnce inside the hall, they smile as they remind visitors that Adam, Eve and Jesus were all real people; that all visions offered by the Bible are real, and that to abandon this real word \u2014 even a select passage or two \u2014 is to slip into an ugly, graffiti-covered world of depravity and sin.\n\nBeneath that smiling is fear.\n\nIn Georgia Purdom\u2019s talk on Mitochondrial Eve \u2014 in which the PhD-holding research scientist invokes science to prove that the biblical Eve did exist \u2014 she expresses concerns about the future.\n\n\u201cAmong Christians today,\u201d Purdom says, \u201cthere is an increasing debate over whether or not Adam and Eve were real people.\u201d Audience members collectively lower their chins and furrow their brows in deep consternation. Some clap their hands in frustrated agreement.\n\nPurdom then evidentiates her case by presenting slide after slide of popular Christian publications whose editorial staff, before a continuously sophisticating science, have interpreted the Bible with a more scrutinizing eye. Based on the science, these publications say, certain passages of the Bible can no longer reasonably be considered as literally true. Perhaps, they add, we too should evolve with the times. Purdom pauses, waiting for her audience to be hit by that rhetorical anvil.\n\nTo Purdom and her peers, these developments are not mere annoyances; they warn that faith is something mortal, and is thus something that can die \u2014 or be killed by a hungrier, leaner species than they. In their eyes, a predatory science has sniffed out the flesh of the faithful, forcing them to contort and camouflage their beliefs in order to survive.\n\nFor Purdom, the less-devout have already ceded their values to the demands of a new reality, and yet the appetite of science remains insatiable. They, the defendants of a truth unchanging, are under attack. If the Word is to live, if its believers are to have purpose, it is up to institutions like Answers in Genesis to save it, and likewise a guiding, collective morality. In a world abandoning the totalizing austerities of faith for the boundless frontiers of science, the Creation Museum must stand in defiance. And it does.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's easy to mock and criticize the Creation Museum.
