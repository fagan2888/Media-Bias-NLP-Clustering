But there are naysayers. ESPN analyst and former Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka says the change-the-name movement is a joke; and the latest ESPN.com poll is running 75 perecent in favor of keeping the name.\n\nIn the middle of it all, two former NFL players are coming at the debate from a position of respect, and their visits to Native reservations helped guide their perspective on the issue.\n\nRandall McDaniel is one of the finest offensive linemen in NFL history \u2013 an NFL Hall of Famer named to the NFL\u2019s All-Decade Team of the 1990s. McDaniel made his fourth trip to Jim Warne\u2019s Warrior Society youth football camp at the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota last week. Warne, Oglala Lakota, has stayed in touch with McDaniel, his former teammate at Arizona State University and when Warne brings his Warrior Society youth football camp to South Dakota every summer, McDaniel clears his schedule.\n\nEarlier this summer, former Pittsburgh linebacker Marv Kellum, who played for the Steelers when they won their first two Super Bowls, was a guest coach at the Seneca Nation football camp in New York.\n\nAnd after taking trips to Native reservations, they both have an opinion on the Washington team name. \u201cI never even knew the true meaning of the word Redskins,\u201d Kellum told ICTMN. \u201cI had no idea it was linked to the government\u2019s bounty on men, women and children. It\u2019s hard to believe that the government was paying money for killing people. Most white people are ignorant to all of that. I was. How can you have a [mascot] name like that once you know what it means?\u201d\n\nMcDaniel said he can\u2019t speak for the NFL or Daniel Snyder, but something has to change. \u201cYou see change happening around you all the time. Colleges and the NCAA have made those changes,\u201d said McDaniel. \u201cYou can highlight the team\u2019s history, but to be defiant and say it\u2019s not affecting anyone is going through life with blinders on. If you have to ask yourself, \u2018Would you want your culture being talked about like that?\u2019 then things would happen a lot sooner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NFL is a conglomerate,\u201d Warne added. \u201cMoney talks and the NFL is a big monster. But in the end, I hope they do the right thing. Daniel Snyder could change the name to the Washington Warriors, in honor of all veterans, and everybody would be happy.\"\n\nName-change debate aside, McDaniel and Kellum says they have a better understanding of Native people after the two-day Warrior Society summer camps. \u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t be like the movies. I\u2019m glad to be able to learn something new every time I come here,\u201d said McDaniel, who turns 50 in December. \u201cThe Native American perspective, just like the Afro-American perspective, was left out of the history classes I took in school. I knew when I was growing up there was slavery in my own culture, but they never talked about that in the history books. They mentioned it, but they swept aside what it was like for the people that actually lived it. So it\u2019s nice to be able to come here and learn the other side of the story from an Indian perspective.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Jim Warne\u2019s Seneca Football Camp Encourages Youth to Carry the Elders\u2019 Message\n\nWarne\u2019s mother Beverly grew up on Pine Ridge, and took him out to Wounded Knee when he was a child. As Warne walked among the mass grave at the site along with McDaniel, McDaniel paid tribute to the place where 150 men, women, and children were massacred by the 7th Cavalry on December 29, 1890. \u201cIt puts things in perspective,\u201d McDaniel said in a near-whisper. \u201cEverybody goes through struggles in their history somewhere along the line. But when [the massacre] happens right here in your own country, this is very eye opening.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NFL Greats Visit Reservations; Speak Out Against \u2018Redskins\u2019", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/05/nfl-greats-visit-reservations-speak-out-against-redskins-156740", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/photo_courtsey_of_jim_warne_jim_warne_oglala_lakota_and_randall_mcdaniel_with_lakota_students_on_pine_ridge2.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "NFL Greats Visit Reservations; Speak Out Against \u2018Redskins\u2019"}, "abstract": "NFL Greats Visit Reservations; Speak Out Against \u2018Redskins\u2019", "dc": {"title": "NFL Greats Visit Reservations; Speak Out Against \u2018Redskins\u2019"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/05/nfl-greats-visit-reservations-speak-out-against-redskins-156740", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Redskins, NFL, Dan Snyder, Pine Ridge Reservation, Seneca Nation, Marv Kellum, Randall McDaniel, Jim Warne,", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 4}, "dcterms.date": "2014-09-05T07:30-04:00", "dcterms.title": "NFL Greats Visit Reservations; Speak Out Against \u2018Redskins\u2019"}, "article_summary": "Randall McDaniel is one of the finest offensive linemen in NFL history \u2013 an NFL Hall of Famer named to the NFL\u2019s All-Decade Team of the 1990s.\nMcDaniel made his fourth trip to Jim Warne\u2019s Warrior Society youth football camp at the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota last week.\n\u201cIt puts things in perspective,\u201d McDaniel said in a near-whisper.\n\u201cThe Native American perspective, just like the Afro-American perspective, was left out of the history classes I took in school.\nAs Warne walked among the mass grave at the site along with McDaniel, McDaniel paid tribute to the place where 150 men, women, and children were massacred by the 7th Cavalry on December 29, 1890."}
