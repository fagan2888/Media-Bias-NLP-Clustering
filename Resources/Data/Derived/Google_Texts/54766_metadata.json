Moderator Neil Cavuto started by calling out \u201cthe elephant in the room,\u201d promising issues would be front and center. \u201cThat is the agenda tonight: how each of you plans to make America better tomorrow.\u201d\n\nRepublicans complained that prior debates, especially the last one, were filled with too many \"gotcha\" questions and too much baiting of the candidates to fight one another.\n\nDonald Trump has played 2016 titan for months, and most attacks from fellow candidates ended up hurting the attacker. But as Trump fights to maintain his lead, he has appeared more defensive.\n\nThe GOP field seems to have figured out how to fight Donald Trump: Belittle him.\n\n\u201cDebates need to focus on the issues, and that goal was accomplished tonight,\u201d said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. \u201cOur candidates, not the moderators, were at the center of tonight\u2019s debate, and they were all treated with fairness and respect.\u201d\n\nAfter blistering GOP reviews of the previous debate, those moderating Tuesday\u2019s match-up in Milwaukee largely succeeded in producing a thoughtful exchange that exposed the differences among the candidates\u2019 style and substance on a range of issues.\n\nPerhaps the winners of the fourth Republican presidential primary debate were not any of the candidates on stage but the people asking the questions.\n\nThe tide turned in the third debate, held last month: Carly Fiorina, with 10:32, and Sen. Marco Rubio, with 10:10, held the floor the longest.\n\nIn the second debate, which was held in mid-September and lasted three hours, Trump got in 18:47 of speaking time, three minutes more than runner-up Bush.\n\nDonald Trump dominated the clock in the first two debates. He spoke for 10:30 during August's opening showdown, a full two minutes more than Jeb Bush, who came in second.\n\nCruz spoke for 13 minutes and 35 seconds -- nearly two minutes more than the runner-up, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, according to Politico. Ben Carson clocked in with the least amount of speaking time: 9 minutes and 22 seconds.\n\nThere was less wrangling for control of the floor during this debate, but speaking time still matters, and by that measure, Sen. Ted Cruz came out on top.\n\nOptimism and pessimism? Fear or inspiration? It\u2019s a big choice for campaigns, and not just theirs.\n\nCruz infused his view of America with warmth and possibility. He spoke of the hope and promise his father saw when immigrating from Cuba in the 1950s and said he would steer the nation there again.\n\nFiorina spoke of a nearly dystopian future she said would take place should Hillary Rodham Clinton win the election. \u201cA Clinton presidency will corrode the character of this nation,\u201d she warned.\n\nIn their closing statements, Carly Fiorina and Sen. Ted Cruz each went descriptive, painting pictures of the United States -- in very different ways.\n\nIn his closing statement, Donald Trump repeated his frequent claim that his campaign for the presidency is self-funded. In fact, he has raised money from quite a few people: Nearly 74,000 people contributed to the Republican White House hopeful over the summer, and The Times' Mark Z. Barabak and Michael Finnegan wrote about why.\n\nBut Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s team appeared to be doing victory laps after the segment came to a close. The Florida senator skillfully inserted himself into the exchange and delivered a rapid-fire attack on Putin as nothing but a \u201cgangster\u201d who needs to be countered with strong U.S. leadership.\n\n\u201cWe're not going to be the world\u2019s policeman, but we sure as heck have to be the world\u2019s leader,\u201d Bush said.\n\nBush\u2019s brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, tried to flex his credentials on the debate stage by pushing back against the non-interventionist tendencies of some in the party, including two of his opponents, Trump and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).\n\nThe green-room summit couldn\u2019t help but remind of former President Bush\u2019s insistence that he, too, knew Putin after looking into his eye and getting \"a sense of his soul.\"\n\nDonald Trump had an almost George W. Bush-like moment when he suggested that he knew Russian President Vladimir Putin well because the two had an encounter while taping an episode of \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have long dominated national security politics, but Tuesday\u2019s GOP debate exposed yet more differences between the party\u2019s presidential hopefuls.\n\nAs Times columnist Michael Hiltzik wrote last year, it was \"designed to stem risky banking practices, improve consumer protections on financial products such as mortgages and credit cards, and provide regulators with more authority to deal with troubled big banks.\"\n\nBut the act, passed in 2010, is not what bailed out the nation's teetering financial institutions.\n\nIn the candidates' discussion of bank bailouts, the Dodd-Frank Act has been named several times.\n\nFree enterprise is great. Profits are great. But there have to be some values that underlie it.\n\nThe 12 nations that have pledged to adopt the deal \u2013 agreed on in part to help contain the rise of China \u2013 released the text of it last week.\n\nTrump had more to say, though using language that Clinton most definitely would not: \u201cIt is like Obamacare,\u201d he said of the trade pact. \u201cNobody read it. They passed it; nobody read it. \u2026 We need smart people making the deals. And we don\u2019t have smart people making the deals.\u201d\n\n\u201cTPP is a horrible deal,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble. It is a deal to allow the Chinese to come in through the back door like they always do.\u201d\n\nClinton often returns to currency manipulation as the reason she, too, is opposed to the deal, called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Efforts to insert a provision clamping down on such manipulation fell short in Congress this year.\n\nHe warned that the massive Pacific trade pact negotiated by the Obama administration is a bad deal for America because it doesn\u2019t address currency manipulation.\n\nDonald Trump talks often about what a disaster it would be if Hillary Rodham Clinton were to be elected president, but when Tuesday night\u2019s debate turned to the topic of international trade, Trump argued passionately for a position that could have been lifted from Clinton\u2019s talking points.\n\nTaking land in Iraq has proved relatively straightforward for the U.S. in the past. The turmoil that followed as the U.S. tried to rebuild the country, however, proved much more difficult to contain.\n\n\"In order to make [terrorists] look like losers, we have to destroy their caliphate,\" he said. \"Our goal is not to contain them but to destroy them before they destroy us.\"\n\nWhen asked his view about the U.S. troops in Syria and Afghanistan, Dr. Ben Carson said it's good the troops are there -- but if he were rolling out a strategy, he would turn his attention first to Iraq.\n\nThus far, only a handful of GOP candidates have offered a blueprint for what their replacement would look like. And even those have not detailed how they would pay for a replacement.\n\nRepeal also would require a new president to come up with an alternative plan, a process that would likely involve difficult trade-offs, potentially messy negotiations with congressional and business leaders, huge disruptions to the existing healthcare system and billions of dollars in new funding.\n\nRolling all this back would generate fierce opposition from millions of Americans and from many states where the law has been largely embraced, including California.\n\nAnd doctors, hospitals and insurers have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to implement the law, including building up new systems to meet quality standards in the law that are transforming the way many patients get care.\n\nThe nation\u2019s uninsured rate has fallen more rapidly than at any time in at least half a century.\n\nSince the law\u2019s major coverage expansion began in 2014, more than 9 million Americans have gained health insurance through Medicaid or through private insurance marketplaces created by the law.\n\nWhile the promise has become something of an article of faith in the GOP, it is increasingly unrealistic, as even many Republican lawmakers and policy experts now concede.\n\nDonald Trump used the TPP discussion to make that pledge. TPP is so big that no one has read it, he said, which is what happened with Obamacare -- and look what a mess that is. \"Yes, it will be replaced,\" Trump said.\n\nTuesday\u2019s debate brought renewed pledges from the presidential hopefuls that they would repeal the Affordable Care Act immediately upon taking office.\n\nWe might want to point out China is not part of this deal.\n\nThe Times\u2019 Lisa Mascaro explored how unorthodox Rubio\u2019s tax plan, which includes a large credit for families with children, is among Republican proposals:\n\nRubio defended his plan as a way to keep the U.S. safe, a direct appeal to the conservative crowd at the theater in Milwaukee.\n\nRand Paul challenged Marco Rubio on his tax plan Tuesday night, telling Rubio, \u201cYou cannot be a conservative if you\u2019re gonna keep promoting new programs you\u2019re not gonna pay for. \u2026 Can you be a conservative and be liberal on military spending? Can you be for unlimited military spending?\u201d\n\nBut as The Times\u2019 Noam N. Levey reported when Fiorina went on the same line of attack during the last Republican debate, there\u2019s little evidence that President Obama\u2019s landmark healthcare law has destroyed jobs:\n\n\u201cObamacare is crushing small businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not helping the families it is intended to help.\u201d\n\nCarly Fiorina attacked Obamacare on Tuesday night as a blow to the U.S. economy, particularly small businesses.\n\nI want a government really, really small. So small you can barely see it.\n\nOnly Ohio Gov. John Kasich offered an alternative point of view. He stopped short of saying he supports a wage hike, but he also warned: \u201cEconomic theory is fine, but you know what? People need help. \u2026 To just look the other way is not acceptable.\u201d\n\nThe Republican candidates warned a wage hike would be disastrous. \u201cIf you raise the minimum wage, you are going to make people more expensive than a machine,\u201d Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said. Ben Carson warned that a wage hike would create a surge of joblessness among African Americans.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton's campaign made sure her supporters were aware of the discussion. It sent them an email minutes after the Republicans moved on from the minimum-wage issue, quoting what each of the candidates on the stage said.\n\nIt was not a surprising position. Republicans have been out front about their opposition to increasing the minimum wage. But Democrats were surely delighted to see Republicans talk about it on a prominent national stage. All the Democrats running for president want to see a hike to at least $12 an hour, and they return to the issue repeatedly on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cWages are too high,\u201d said Donald Trump, when asked during Tuesday night\u2019s debate whether he sympathizes with activists demanding the minimum wage be hiked to $15. \u201cWe are not going to be able to compete against the world. \u2026 We have to leave it the way it is. We just can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nOn a national day of action for fast-food workers, who walked out of their jobs and demonstrated at large rallies in hundreds of American cities, some Republicans running for president were saying wages are already too great.\n\nDonald Trump, praising a court's ruling against President Obama's plan to defer deportation of up to 5 million immigrants\n\nWe're going to have to send people out.... We are a country of laws.\n\nCarson and his campaign stood by his accounts and accused the media of a \u201cpolitical hit job.\u201d\n\nAnd CNN spoke to several people who knew Carson growing up and could not find any who confirmed Carson\u2019s tales of struggling with a violent temper and trying to stab a friend, before his faith helped him suppress such urges. The Wall Street Journal could find no evidence to support stories Carson has told about protecting white high school classmates from rioting black students, or being the sole student to pass an honesty test by a Yale professor.\n\nThe Politico headline and story were clarified, though the news organization said it stood by its original reporting. A Politifact appraisal of Carson\u2019s comments rated them \u201cmostly true,\u201d though in need of clarification.\n\nCarson was accused by Politico of \u201cfabricating\u201d that he was offered a full scholarship to the United States Military Academy at West Point. Carson responded that he never applied, a point he has made multiple times in the past, but that he was encouraged by local military leaders to apply for an appointment to the school. Students at the academy do not pay for tuition or room and board, but most commit to several years of military service upon graduation.\n\n\u201cWe have to start treating people the same, and people who know me know that I\u2019m honest,\u201d Carson said to applause during the debate.\n\nDr. Ben Carson, who has edged Donald Trump in several recent polls, faced new scrutiny in recent days as his profile has risen, and he defended himself Tuesday night and demanded that journalists closely examine all candidates, particularly Democrats.\n\nInequality ... seems to be the worst in states run by Democrats.\n\nI think we need to repeal every rule that Barack Obama has.\n\nAs for the substance of his answer:\n\nThat's a big shift from his tone at the debate two weeks ago.\n\nMarco Rubio mentioned early in tonight\u2019s debate that he\u2019s the \u201cson of a bartender and a maid.\u201d What Rubio did not mention, though, is that he spent some of his formative years in Nevada, marching in a union picket line alongside his barkeep father and persuading his family to trade Catholicism for the Mormon Church. The Times\u2019 Lisa Mascaro got the story from Rubio\u2019s old neighborhood off the Las Vegas Strip:\n\nIf the Internet gives us a Santorum-Mortal Kombat mash-up, we will let you know.\n\n\"You know why I respect the Democrats?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they fight!\"\n\nAt one point, Christie declared that the candidates were wasting precious time debating the finer points of their records as governor. \u201cIf I go to New Jersey, they will call me lots of different things,\u201d Christie said to Jindal. \u201cBut 'liberal' is not one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton is coming for your wallet, everybody,\u201d Christie said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Huckabee or Jindal. Worry about her.\u201d\n\nChristie made clear that he\u2019s confident he won\u2019t compete in the undercard for long. He took the posture of a front-runner. He refused to indulge Jindal in a tit-for-tat. Instead, he complimented his rival, telling the crowd that Jindal has been a great governor. Christie focused all his attacks in one direction: Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI will give you a ribbon for participation and a juice box,\u201d Jindal said of Christie\u2019s record in New Jersey, as he sought to make the case that he\u2019s accomplished more than the others on stage. Jindal attacked his rivals relentlessly. He accused Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee of allowing spending to continue to rise in their states unchecked. \u201cJust sending any Republican [to Washington] is not enough,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cUnder your leadership in New Jersey, your budget has gone up 15%. You\u2019ve had nine credit downgrades.\u201d\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has had little luck gaining traction in the 2016 campaign. But he did produce one memorable line Tuesday night, when he mocked Chris Christie\u2019s description of himself as a tax-fighting, fiscally conservative governor in New Jersey.\n\nCalling her comment disgraceful, Christie cast himself as the candidate who can \"bring this entire country together.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gov. Chris Christie kept his eye on the prize: Hillary Rodham Clinton. He slammed her admission that Republicans are among the enemies she is proudest of making.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee shared a story about a third-grader who sent $6 in the mail to support his campaign. He said he would be a president who didn't forget where he came from.\n\nA struggling Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal attempted to paint a contrast between himself and the rest of the GOP field, insisting he is the Republican best suited to \"take on the establishment.\" Former Sen. Rick Santorum stuck to his focus on working families and spoke of the importance of \"making things\" in America again.\n\nIf you missed the debate, the closing statements were a good summary:\n\nSantorum said he has the experience to use troops properly. President Obama\u2019s strategy, he said, puts troops \u201cin harm\u2019s way for political purposes.\u201d\n\nChristie said he would give veterans respect \u2013 unlike Hillary Rodham Clinton, who he said doesn\u2019t understand the VA crisis and doesn\u2019t respect veterans\u2019 service.\n\nHuckabee said that veterans would \u201csure appreciate a better paycheck\u201d and if the nation kept its promises to take care of their medical care and put them in a position to send their children to college.\n\nJindal said, \u201cWe need to fire some of these VA bureaucrats,\u201d and some should go to jail for the troubles in that department.\n\nThe question: How do we restore that sense of duty and pride that was the hallmark of the \u201cgreatest generation\u201d who fought in World War II?\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz was also singled out for his view on gay rights, and the entire GOP field for supporting the defunding of Planned Parenthood.\n\nTrump, the businessman-turned-reality-show-star, was labeled the candidate most likely to forget what he is yelling about, as he is yelling about it. \u201cBut it will somehow end with making America great again,\u201d the campaign wrote.\n\nBoth men have been criticized by Donald Trump as \u201clow-energy,\u201d a preferred insult of Trump\u2019s.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was anointed the most likely to fall asleep. \u201cIt was close, Dr. [Ben] Carson, but Gov. Bush had you beat!\u201d the campaign wrote in the fundraising email.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s campaign poked a bit of fun at the Republican field ahead of Tuesday\u2019s debate, preemptively picking winners.\n\nBoth governors have lagged in polls, which prevented them from taking the main debate stage, but they represent the opposing wings in the GOP war over whether the party should nominate an establishment-backed candidate who can appeal to a broader swath of voters or a strict conservative who will rouse the base.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not just beat Hillary,\u201dJindal said. \u201cLet\u2019s elect a conservative to the White House.\u201d\n\nBut in the next round of questioning, Jindal did not let up.\n\n\u201cWe better stay focused as Republicans on her,\u201d Christie nudged. \u201cWe need someone who knows how to beat Democrats.\u201d\n\nChristie steered the debate away from Jindal\u2019s continued pounding against former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and other candidates he deemed insufficiently conservative and back to the party\u2019s main target -- Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton:\n\nAnd, after persistent attacks by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on fellow Republicans, he showed he might deserve better.\n\nDemoted to the undercard stage at the Republican debate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had an opportunity to rise above circumstance.\n\nRick Santorum addressed an earlier question and then cranked up the volume, giving a somewhat positive nod to the other party. \"You know why I respect the Democrats?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they fight!\"\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed suit, using his time to say Democratic lawmakers aren\u2019t standing behind police officers.\n\nFollowing Jindal\u2019s lead, Mike Huckabee decided to talk about something else instead: the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was the first to refuse to answer.\n\nShe is the real adversary tonight, and we\u2019d better stay focused.... Hillary Clinton is coming for your wallet, everybody. Don\u2019t worry about Huckabee or Jindal, worry about her.\n\nRick Santorum, saying there should be more jobs that don't require college degrees\n\nPeople need to go to work, and we need to provide opportunities for them to go to work -- out of high school.\n\nThe network also says the iOS Fox Business App will have live stream and the Fox News App will have live stream on both iOS and android.\n\nFBN says it has teamed up with providers including DirecTV, Suddenlink, Mediacom, Frontier, Wide Open West and Cable One to make the debates available to all their subscribers.\n\nFinding the Fox Business Network channel in your area at the network site .\n\nHow to tune in: The debates will be broadcast live from the Milwaukee Theater, airing on the Fox Business Network and streaming live on FOXBusiness.com.\n\nAsking the questions: This debate will be moderated by Neil Cavuto, FBN's managing editor of business news, and Maria Bartiromo, the network\u2019s global markets editor. Joining them will be WSJ\u2019s editor-in-chief, Gerard Baker.\n\n9 p.m. Eastern: Donald Trump, Dr. Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Rand Paul take the stage for two hours.\n\nAsking the questions: The opening-round questions will come from Fox Business Network anchors Sandra Smith and Trish Regan and the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Washington Bureau Chief Gerald Seib.\n\n7 p.m. Eastern: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Sen. Rick Santorum will take questions for an hour.\n\nAsked later by a journalist if she took the man seriously, Clinton shook her head \"no,\" CBS' Rebecca Kaplan reported.\n\nThe back-and-forth is bound to come back and haunt Clinton, who in the past has called out Donald Trump for failing to condemn \u201chateful rhetoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time I see her on TV, I want to reach through and strangle her,\" the man said, according to a CBS report. \"I know that doesn't sound very nice.\"\n\nDuring an event at a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in New Hampshire, the Democratic front-runner took a question from the man, who said he had friends who lost their jobs and homes during hard times at Hewlett Packard when Fiorina was CEO.\n\nDuring a public exchange Tuesday, a man told Hillary Rodham Clinton that he wants to \u201cstrangle\u201d Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina. Clinton laughed and told him, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mess with you.\u201d\n\nRead more about how that may serve some of the candidates as they try to win over supporters before the early nominating contests . . .\n\nThe network sponsors of the faceoffs have mostly ignored candidates' demands for more control over the debate format, fueling an \"us versus them\" dynamic between those on stage and those in front of it.\n\nThe attention is shifting to the debate moderators, as the candidates draw them into the fray as well.\n\nThe spotlight won\u2019t just be on the eight candidates in tonight\u2019s Republican presidential debate.\n\n\"Any of the candidates that you have on stage tonight,\" he said, \"are infinitely better than Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nHe echoed the sentiment on Tuesday as the party prepared for the evening debate.\n\nAs he left the race, Walker urged rivals to consider dropping out and helping the party unite behind one strong candidate.\n\nWalker ended his presidential campaign in September amid weak poll numbers. He'd hoped to fill a craving for an outside-the-Beltway candidate, but he was quickly overrun by Donald Trump and Ben Carson. Neither of them has held elected office at all.\n\n\"People are tired of what they perceive as the same old thing out of Washington,\u201d he said, \u201cand they want leaders who are fundamentally going to change it.\"\n\n\"People have largely had it with Washington, they're frustrated with Washington, they feel like Washington is disconnected from themselves,\" the Republican said Tuesday at a pre-debate breakfast hosted here by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nMILWAUKEE--Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, just six months ago a formidable presidential contender, believes next year's presidential campaign will center on a pinnacle issue: anger with Washington.\n\nTune in here for more on what to watch in Tuesday night\u2019s debate . . .\n\nCan Marco Rubio credibly and confidently clarify the details of his past under the hot stage lights?\n\nCan Ben Carson dismiss questions about his biography as a \"political hit job\u201d against him by the media?\n\n\u201cWhen they say the rules are 60 seconds for an answer,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can tell all the candidates take that as a suggestion more than an instruction.\u201d\n\nSome moderators handle the challenge better than others, Meyers says, but they're dealing with players who show up prepared to blow past the rules.\n\n\u201cDemocrats, Republicans, when you interview them, if you don't cut them off, they'll talk the whole time,\u201d Meyers tells the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThey love uninterrupted airtime.\u201d\n\nThe hot lights are on the candidates, but late-night TV host Seth Meyers says political debates are tough for the questioner, too.\n\n\"I have no idea what's going to happen, but it will be interesting,\" Trump said about the debate in a Tuesday interview with Good Morning America .\n\nWhether or not Trump will take his time to continue his break down of Rubio\u2019s presidential chances remains unknown.\n\nThanks in part to his own well-received performance in the last debate, Rubio rose in recent polls , and has drawn more attacks from rival candidates.\n\nTrump called Rubio\u2019s approach to immigration \u201cvery weak\u201d at a campaign event in Illinois earlier Monday. He referred to Rubio\u2019s role as one of the so-called Gang of Eight senators in 2013 who pushed for legislation that eased the process to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. The proposal was passed by the Senate but went nowhere in the House.\n\nLast night, Twitter users got a peek into GOP candidate Donald Trump\u2019s potential strategy for Tuesday\u2019s GOP debate in Milwaukee. Trump posted a volley of tweets attacking rival Sen. Marco Rubio and the candidate\u2019s history on immigration policy.\n\n6:31 A.M. 'SNL' ratings jump with Trump Despite a slew of negative reviews, GOP candidate Donald Trump attracted one of the largest audiences for his latest stint on \"Saturday Night Live.\" An estimated 9-10 million people tuned in \u2014 more than for 2015 hosts Miley Cyrus, Amy Schumer and Tracy Morgan, according to Nielsen. An estimated 9-10 million people tuned in \u2014 more than for 2015 hosts Miley Cyrus, Amy Schumer and Tracy Morgan, according to Nielsen.\n\nThe ratings \u2014 6.6 and a 16% share of the TV audience \u2014 were the highest since NBA star Charles Barkley hosted in January 2012. This number still came in lower than when Sarah Palin appeared on \"SNL\" in October 2008.\n\nReviewers by and large didn\u2019t believe that Trump's performance merited the numbers.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times\u2019 Mary McNamara warned that ratings are too nuanced and varied in today\u2019s TV market.\n\n\u201cBut ratings have never been the same as votes \u2014 just ask the cast of \"Empire\" \u2014 or even political support, and for all his frequently self-referenced business experience, Trump seems to have missed a major shift in the television industry: Ratings ain't what they used to be,\u201d McNamara said in her Times column.\n\nVariety \u2019s Maureen Ryan called the sketches with Trump \u201cweak, timid or predictable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty standard for a host to read most of his lines off cue cards, as Trump did stiffly in all his scenes, but when the rest of the cast appears ill at ease and many of the jokes fail to land, the sketches can seem interminable,\u201d Ryan said in her Variety column.\n\nA.V. Club \u2019s Dennis Perkins said the show came off as a no-win situation for both \"SNL\" and Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump supporters can fob off their disappointment in the quality of the show on cast and writers, but only the most blinkered could deny that the candidate came off as stilted, bland, and unprepared in the very little screen time he was given,\u201d Perkins said in his A.V.
