The Facebook-like network is open to all the department\u2019s 75,000 employees, the post said. It\u2019s focused on helping employees better engage with each other across divisions and informally crowdsourcing solutions to workflow issues.\n\nHHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 office plans to award a three-month contract to the California-based business intelligence company GoodData to sift through information posted to Yammer to determine employees\u2019 sentiment on particular topics and to learn which topics are trending on the site.\n\nThe secretary\u2019s office plans to award the contract under a Federal Acquisition Regulation provision that allows agencies to forego competitive bidding in instances where there\u2019s only one acceptable vendor for a particular good or service. The notice of intent posted Thursday is meant to give potential bidders a chance to prove they can offer a competitive monitoring service.\n\nThe document doesn\u2019t list the value of the GoodData contract or go into details about what information the secretary\u2019s office hopes to cull from employees\u2019 Yammer posts.\n\nFederal agencies including the Food and Drug Administration and the Secret Service have launched social media monitoring programs in the past, though they\u2019re usually focused on monitoring what the public is talking about, not federal employees.\n\nA guidance document from the Federal Chief Information Officer\u2019s Council released in July approves of social media monitoring provided agencies disclose how and why they\u2019re doing it to people who might be monitored.\n\n(Image via VLADGRIN/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joseph Marks", "description": "HHS wants a contractor to monitor internal social network to glean employee sentiments.", "og": {"site_name": "Nextgov", "description": "HHS wants a contractor to monitor internal social network to glean employee sentiments.", "title": "What Do HHS Employees Really Think?
