Instead of leafing through a months-old copy of People Magazine in a stale waiting room for 30 minutes (despite arriving ten minutes early), you\u2019re sitting on your couch at home perhaps finishing up some last minute work. You pick up your phone, tap on an app and initiate a video chat with your doctor.\n\nWhen your doctor answers, she greets you and asks you to put a palm-size wireless stethoscope against your chest so she can listen to your heart and make sure your breathing is unrestrained. She then takes your blood pressure using another remote monitor. That data is automatically sent to a mobile health app that both you and your doctor have access to. After checking your vitals, your doctor goes over the lab results for the blood you had drawn at a nearby clinic last week.\n\nShe reviews an analyzed report of your nutrition statistics from the past year, since you\u2019ve been logging your meals everyday. After assessing your diet she looks at how many steps you\u2019ve been taking daily along with your exercise regimen, all of which is collected from your Fitbit or Apple Watch. Overall, she says, your diet looks good, and the shedding of a few pounds since your last visit illustrates a healthy lifestyle. However, she\u2019s concerned that you\u2019re not sleeping. Are you under stress? Do you need a recommendation for a therapist? Or is it something else?\n\nThis scenario may sound overly futuristic, but in fact this technology is mostly here. Many medical appliances are already Internet connected, and an increasing number of startups are developing home monitoring systems to better capture day-to-day health data. The rise of Fitbit and fitness apps also means we have oodles of circumstantial data about our health right at our fingertips. The reason doctors aren\u2019t already considering patients\u2019 daily exercise regimens in their overall health report is because there is no platform that meaningfully collects this data.\n\nThough nascent, this platform may soon materialize. The University of Michigan in partnership with AirStrip and IBM is currently testing a way to predict when someone will get ill. To do that, it needed a platform capable of compiling a stream of health data while analyzing a patient\u2019s conditions in real-time.\n\nSame old technology\n\n\u201cI have no better tools to save your life than I had 25 years ago, and the same thing is true of other critical-care units you might go to if you\u2019re sick,\u201d says Dr. Kevin Ward, who leads the University of Michigan\u2019s Fast Forward Medical Innovation program. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not acceptable, really.\u201d\n\nThis predictive-medicine study is taking place inside the University of Michigan\u2019s intensive care wing, where having access to real-time patient data is most critical.\n\nA lot of patient information is automated through medical monitors and ventilation devices, giving doctors potential access to hundreds of thousands of data points on each patient. The problem is that much of this data is unstructured. There is no singular hub that takes in medical data, analyzes it, and allows doctors to consume it holistically. Instead, doctors have to consider all of this data, mostly by themselves.\n\n\u201cSo if I have you in the intensive care unit and I have all these monitors on you, you can produce maybe upwards of 100,000 data points per second. And human-wise, I can only track a couple a second on a patient, much less track 15 patients I might be caring for. So we have not done a great job leveraging data to do either predictive or prescriptive analytics,\u201d says Dr. Ward.\n\nBuilding a platform\n\nIn addition to a lack of infrastructure for crunching big streams of real-time data, there isn\u2019t a system for collecting patient health data from various sources.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s say a person is involved in a car accident, and a paramedic responds. The patient is immediately treated at the scene and while in transit to a hospital. The patient then enters an emergency room where nurses and doctors try to stabilize her. Perhaps after that, the patient goes into surgery so doctors can repair any life threatening damage and is transitioned to the intensive care unit. At each of these stages of care there are different people working on this one person and Dr. Ward says contextual data about a patient\u2019s health gets lost in the shuffle. Only the broad strokes get reported. Using the example above, a patient\u2019s record would show all the stages of care, but not details about the treatment or how the patient responded.\n\nTo capture the details, Dr. Ward needed a way to update a patient\u2019s record at each echelon of care.\n\nThat\u2019s where the partnership with AirStrip comes into play. AirStrip already has a platform in place for gathering patient information into a single application. The platform is called AirStrip One and it takes data from any input, filters it into an ecosystem where both patients and doctors can access it, and arranges it in a meaningful way. No small task considering that hospitals use a variety of devices and electronic health record systems \u2014 there is no one standard.\n\nPredicting health\n\nWith the health data corralled in one place, Dr. Ward is hoping to draw meaningful conclusions about a patient\u2019s health. Combining health records with incoming real-time data, Watson could assist doctors in making diagnoses. Not only that, but a system like this could also give doctors a heads up when someone\u2019s health is taking a turn for the worse.\n\n\u201cEven if I have ten minutes, that\u2019s better than being called to the bedside because someone is now totally unstable. We\u2019re hoping to have these windows of time to be able to come up with something to prevent that from happening,\u201d says Dr. Ward. That time frame could grow as the network amasses data.\n\nIn addition to working towards predicting health conditions, Dr. Ward also wants analytics to reduce the number of alarms that go off in a hospital. Walk into an ICU on any given day and you\u2019ll be bombarded with a cacophony of high-pitched beeps and alarms. That\u2019s the sound of each individual monitor notifying a doctor that something is either normal or out of sync, and it\u2019s causing nurses to develop alarm fatigue, trivializing their effectiveness.\n\nWith the right analytics, alerts could be greatly reduced and their significance retooled so they indicate an action that needs to be taken rather than a response to something that\u2019s happening.\n\nEarly signs have been good\n\nDr. Ward says that early tests have shown that this system will work. He declined to give any specific examples, because he and his team have only just begun testing the technology in the last few months.\n\nBut University of MIchigan has shown that this model can work in other scenarios. In a collaborative project with the U.S. Army Institute for Surgical Research a few years ago, the University of Michigan was able to develop an algorithm for predicting a sudden drop in blood pressure known as hemodynamic instability. Since the original tests, the University of Michigan has brought on both IBM and AirStrip to tweak the study\u2019s key algorithm so that it can assess damage to a human body involved in an explosion.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is those kids, they get hit by the IED shock wave. They\u2019re put on observation and then they end up going to the [Mobile Army Surgical Hospital] unit, and then that becomes an intensive care treatment quickly, and then they die,\u201d says AirStrip CEO Alan Portela.\n\nSo far the collaboration has been fruitful. The University of Michigan says it can now detect early evidence of internal bleeding and inflammation from infection using a connected defibrillator to monitor breathing in tandem with its algorithm for hemodynamic instability. Not only can this system potentially help doctors identify patients with serious, difficult-to-detect injuries, it also gives doctors a chance to prevent instability or death.\n\nPredictive analytics for all\n\nThat bodes well for the University of Michigan\u2019s ICU study, which hopes to make predictive health algorithms available to a broad spectrum of hospitals. The university\u2019s work in intensive care is a first step towards developing a more comprehensive system of analytics that can predict simpler health problems, like whether you\u2019re susceptible to a virus that\u2019s going around. If predictive health care can be perfected in an intensive environment, it can more easily be applied to less extreme health scenarios.\n\n\u201cWe want to have data products that help empower practitioners no matter where they practice. So it could be in a small rural hospital or a larger community hospital, and for that you really had to have a partner like AirStrip, who could easily integrate into any particular system,\u201d Dr. Ward says.\n\nOnce the network and analytics are in place, the university and AirStrip have an opportunity to expand the platform to include features like text messaging and other utilities aimed at servicing a wider population.\n\nOvercoming hurdles\n\nThough the promise of app-connected care is great, there are a series of hurdles that AirStrip will have to overcome in order to get its platform into hospitals. Making way for real-time care means changing the American health care system as we know it. Currently, doctors provide care on a fee-for-service basis. AirStrip and the University of Michigan\u2019s platform is centered on treating health before issues arise. In effect, it keeps patients out of the hospital through remote monitoring.\n\nThat approach fundamentally challenges the way medical institutions make money.\n\nThough the Affordable Care Act is nudging medical-care providers to adopt a financial strategy that supports value-based care, they are still largely dependent on charging patients large sums of money for addressing health problems as they arise. Changing that structure to reward doctors for keeping patients healthy is a gargantuan undertaking and poses questions about how medical institutions will make money from outpatient care. For instance, how do you charge a client who\u2019s being remotely monitored? Do you charge for text-message check ins?\n\nMaking this change will also require some behavioral training. Rather than reacting to symptoms, doctors will have to be more forward thinking about treatment plans.\n\n\u201cRight now we wait and watch and we need to get out of that mode,\u201d says Dr. Ward. In order to get on board with predictive medicine, doctors will have to get used to a different pace and process of handling incoming data.\n\nAnother bump on the road to predictive-care ubiquity is that most electronic health records (EHR) are proprietary and don\u2019t play well with competing networks. That\u2019s made it nearly impossible for hospitals to exchange patient records. It\u2019s also the main reason why a third-party platform like AirStrip could play a crucial role in connecting all these systems \u2014 if electronic record companies are willing to cooperate. But in reality, AirStrip may have just as much difficulty in getting EHR companies to operate with its platform.\n\nThe University of Michigan study has just reached its halfway point; there\u2019s still another year to go. Still, Dr. Ward is hopeful that his team will have a finished product in the next two years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can to get something that is usable, of value, and scalable as quickly as possible. That\u2019s our stretch goal.\u201d\n\nCorrection January 12: The name of AirStrip\u2019s CEO is Alan Portela, not Portella.", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2016-01-01T14:15:16+00:00", "author": "ruth-reader", "modDate": "2016-01-13T10:05:03+00:00", "keywords": "airstrip,big-data-3,health-care,ibm", "type": "news", "id": 1855933}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "Imagine you\u2019re waiting to see your doctor for an annual checkup.
