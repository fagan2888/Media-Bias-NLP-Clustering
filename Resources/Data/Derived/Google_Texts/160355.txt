The past eight months have been the most humbling in my nearly 30 years of public service. I thank my Newark Municipal Council colleagues for entrusting me as Newarkâ€™s first Latino chief executive.

Since November, our administration provided leadership and stability for critical services that residents need. We are proud of the following:

Sheilah Coley became first female police director. Ivonne Valentin-Roman became first Hispanic woman police chief. We moved police officers from administrative to patrol duties, updated police with 42 new vehicles, collected 174 guns in buyback program, and swore in 25 firefighters. The Department of Neighborhood and Recreational Services removed 60 inches of snow after 17 snowstorms without running out of salt.

We worked with community-based developers to create affordable housing, opened Rock Plaza Lofts, broke ground for Spruce Street Senior Citizen Housing Development, and passed legislation to rehabilitate 156 abandoned properties.

We began construction on 57 senior affordable housing units at the former Douglas Harrison site and renovated Military Park.

We opened a federally qualified health center at University Hospital. The Department of Child and Family Well-Being assisted 4,000 residents with Affordable Care Act health insurance applications. And we passed paid a sick-leave ordinance for Newark employees.

As I return to Municipal Council as councilman-at-large, I look forward to working with Mayor-elect Ras Baraka and his team. Together, we will continue to serve residents making Newark a greater city.

Luis A. Quintana, Newark mayor
