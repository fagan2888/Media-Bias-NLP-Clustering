But perhaps the strangest development unfolded over the weekend \u2014 a burgeoning bromance between rapper Kanye West and Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson.\n\nIt started with a Vanity Fair interview of West, published September 24, about his second fashion collection. West repeated his intention, which he first announced at the MTV movie awards, to run for president in 2020. Then, unprompted, expressed his deep admiration for Carson. \u201cAs soon as I heard [Ben] Carson speak, I tried for three weeks to get on the phone with him. I was like this is the most brilliant guy,\u201d West said.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t seem like West and Carson would have much in common. Carson is one of the most conservative candidates in a very conservative Republican field. He vehemently opposes gay rights, marijuana legalization, and Obamacare. He says the black community needs to \u201cconfront the entertainment industry\u201d for glorifying violence and misogyny.\n\nWest is an iconoclastic rapper who sits atop the entertainment industry that Carson derides. In 2011, he visited the Occupy Wall Street protests as a sign of solidarity. Before the 2014 midterm elections he advised everyone, via Twitter, to support the Democratic ticket.\n\nMe and my wife met with President Obama two weeks ago \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) November 4, 2014\n\nI'm supporting the Democratic ticket in these midterms \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) November 4, 2014\n\nRecently West and his wife Kim Kardashian attended a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton. They took a selfie.\n\nI got my selfie!!! I really loved hearing her speak & hearing her goals for our country! #HillaryForPresident pic.twitter.com/zGpdcGSZBD \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) August 7, 2015\n\nSo what does West see in Carson? The clue is when West said it started when he first \u201cheard Carson speak.\u201d Assuming that West isn\u2019t a regular viewer of Fox & Friends, he likely first heard Carson speak at the first Republican presidential debate, held in early August.\n\nCarson didn\u2019t speak much at that debate. His most notable answer was on the subject of race:\n\nI was asked by an NPR reporter once, why don\u2019t I talk about race that often. I said it\u2019s because I\u2019m a neurosurgeon. And she thought that was a strange response. And you say \u2014 I said, you see, when I take someone to the operating room, I\u2019m actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are. The skin doesn\u2019t make them who they are. The hair doesn\u2019t make them who they are. And it\u2019s time for us to move beyond that. Because our strength as a nation comes in our unity. We are the United States of America, not the divided states. And those who want to divide us are trying to divide us, and we shouldn\u2019t let them do it.\n\nAt first blush, this kind of post-racial argument would not appear to resonate with West. \u201cGeorge W. Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people,\u201d West famously said on live TV during a 2005 fundraiser for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nBut since that time, however, West\u2019s views on race appear to have evolved. In an interview with Clique TV earlier in March, West expressed views on race that matched Carson.\n\nRacism is a dated concept. It\u2019s, like, a silly concept that people try to touch on to either\u2026 to separate, to alienate, to pinpoint anything. It\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s like a bouncing ball in a room with two cats, when you don\u2019t feel like playing with a cat. Let them literally fight over the bouncing ball. And the bouncing ball has nothing, no purpose, anything other than that it bounces. That\u2019s racism. It\u2019s not an actual thing that even means anything. You know \u2014 It\u2019s something that was used to hold people back in the past. But now there\u2019s been so many leaps and breaking of the rules that it\u2019s, like, played out like a style from the 1800s or something. You know \u2014 the real true freedom isn\u2019t in the words. The real true freedom is in the opportunity. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\n\nCarson and West have connected over the phone and the admiration appears to be mutual. \u201cI was extremely impressed with his business acumen,\u201d Carson said in an interview with ABC News on Sunday. He suggested to West \u201cthe possibility of maybe himself and some of the other people in pop culture doing some music that might be uplifting that might give young women a sense of their value and young men a sense of responsibility.\u201d\n\nCould Carson support West for President? \u201cWell, I am certainly willing to give him a chance,\u201d Carson said.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "You wouldn't think Ben Carson and Kanye West would have much in common.
