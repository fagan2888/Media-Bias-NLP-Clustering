I always considered this a cornerstone of Christian theology. Can you encapsulate the arguments?\n\nTHE RELIGION GUY\u2019S ANSWER:\n\nA tough one, and this mere journalist has long pondered how to reply. Tough because the meaning of Jesus\u2019 crucifixion stands right at the heart of the Christian faith -- indeed the cross is its universal symbol -- and so is vitally important, sensitive, a highly complex concern of many great minds the past 2,000 years, and ultimately beyond human comprehension. But here\u2019s a rough attempt at an answer.\n\nLike many people, Christians see the reality of good and evil, believe this awareness tells us God is holy, seek to live morally, yet admit they fall short due to an inherent sinfulness in themselves and humanity in general. Theologians call this \u201coriginal sin.\u201d Finally, they believe Jesus\u2019 agonizing death by crucifixion somehow overcame humanity\u2019s sin problem and offers salvation.\n\nThat belief originated with the Bible. Jesus himself said the Son of Man came \u201cto give his life as a ransom for many\u201d (Mark 10:45, Matthew 20:28), and that the Christ should suffer and \u201crepentance and forgiveness should be preached in his name to all nations\u201d (Luke 24:46-47).\n\nPaul the apostle wrote: \u201cChrist died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures\u201d (1 Corinthians 15:3). \u201cGod was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them. ... For our sake [God] made [Jesus] to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God\u201d (2 Corinthians 5:19,21). \u201cGod shows his love for us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we are now justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God\u201d (Romans 5:8-9).\n\nChristians agree on such essentials but there\u2019s no one, universally accepted and detailed definition of how Jesus\u2019 death saves sinners. Most folks probably don\u2019t worry much about the various facets emphasized by theologians in different times and situations, for instance: In the church\u2019s early centuries many embraced a \u201cransom\u201d theory, using Jesus\u2019 own word, in which God offered his own Son to rescue captive humanity and, some said, to pay the ransom to Satan. Another early thinker, Irenaeus of Lyons, stressed \u201crecapitulation,\u201d in which Jesus is the sinless new Adam who counteracts the sinful disobedience of Adam.\n\nContinue reading \"The atonement debates: Why did Jesus Christ 'die for our sins'?\" by Richard Ostling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "JOHN\u2019S QUESTION:\r\n\r\nI understand there is currently a debate between orthodox and progressive \r\ntheologians on the doctrine of the atonement.
