That's where veterinarian Dr. James Moore came in.\n\nAccording to the Harborfront Hospital for Animals website, Dr. Moore, DVM owns Veterinary Dental Solutions (VDS), a division of Harborfront Hospital for Animals located in Spring Lake, Michigan.\n\n\"When people hear that Dr. Moore is a \"doggie dentist,\" they immediately say things like: 'What? Does he put braces on dogs, too?'\" the Harborfront Hospital wrote. \"The answer is . . . yes. Yes, he does.\"\n\nThe Harborfront Hospital said on its website that Dr. Moore also does Endodontics on animals, which includes root canals, often necessary because of pain, and oral surgery for things like fractured jaws.\n\nHe lectures to veterinarians and veterinary technicians at dental seminars around the country on topics including maxillofacial surgery, oral surgery, endodontia and surgical endodontia, surgical extraction and dental cleaning, scaling and polishing, the website said.\n\nHarborfront Hospital said the reason they posted about Wesley and his braces is because February is National Pet Dental Health month, and they thought it was a good time to let people know about the importance of oral health when it comes to their pets.\n\nWesley has become such a huge hit on the Internet, with the original Facebook post shared more than 250,000 times, that the hospital followed up with another Facebook post on Monday night.\n\nThey wrote that they are overwhelmed with the support and interest they have received in Wesley.\n\n\"He is happily enjoying some of the benefits of his celebrity (although he already had ample hugs, kisses and belly rubs),\" the hospital wrote. \"Most importantly, he is eating well, playing, and feeling wonderful.\"\n\nOne thing is for sure, Wesley is adorable.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Wesley the puppy has a lot to smile about.", "author": "CBS News", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31355600/michigan-puppy-with-braces-is-all-smiles", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10001630_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Wesley the puppy has a lot to smile about.", "title": "Michigan Puppy With Braces Is All Smiles"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10001630_G.jpg", "description": "Wesley the puppy has a lot to smile about.", "card": "summary", "title": "Michigan Puppy With Braces Is All Smiles"}, "wnreadableurl": "michigan-puppy-with-braces-is-all-smiles", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/03/01", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local, puppy, hospital, braces, michigan, news 9, kwtv, news9.com", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS08", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local, puppy, hospital, braces, michigan, news 9, kwtv, news9.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6e4\"", "article_summary": "\"Orthodontia in pets is normally not for aesthetic purposes, but because of health concerns,\" the animal hospital wrote.\nthe Harborfront Hospital wrote.\nThe puppy from Michigan has become a viral sensation after Harborfront Hospital for Animals posted photos of him with braces on their Facebook page.\nAccording to the Harborfront Hospital for Animals website, Dr. Moore, DVM owns Veterinary Dental Solutions (VDS), a division of Harborfront Hospital for Animals located in Spring Lake, Michigan.\n\"When people hear that Dr. Moore is a \"doggie dentist,\" they immediately say things like: 'What?"}
