The system is included in the city\u2019s budget, it is directly funded by the city, and its various boards of trustees include city officials and mayoral appointees. Yet, when it comes to enforcing the city\u2019s anti-corruption laws in advance of the Chicago\u2019s closely watched 2015 municipal election, Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s administration is suddenly arguing that the pension funds are not part of the city government at all.\n\nThe counterintuitive declaration came last month from the mayor-appointed ethics commission, responding to Chicago aldermen\u2019s request for an investigation of campaign contributions to Emanuel from the financial industry. The request followed disclosures that executives at firms managing Chicago pension money have made more than $600,000 worth of donations to Emanuel. The contributions flowed to the mayor despite a city ordinance \u2014 and an executive order by Emanuel himself \u2014 restricting mayoral campaign contributions from city contractors.\n\nBrushing off the lawmakers\u2019 complaint about Emanuel\u2019s donations from the financial industry, the mayor\u2019s ethics commission issued a nonbinding legal opinion arguing that Chicago\u2019s pension systems are \u201cnot agencies or departments of the city, and thus firms that contract with them are not doing or seeking to do business with the city.\u201d The commission\u2019s interpretation means financial firms\u2019 business with Chicago pension funds should be considered exempt from city ethics laws.\n\nWith the aldermen\u2019s complaint about campaign contributions generating headlines and potentially complicating Emanuel\u2019s already tough race for re-election, the Emanuel-appointed commission was unusually frank about its motives: It said the release of its opinion was designed \u201cto attempt to ensure that no ethical clouds are hanging over any candidate\u2019s head.\u201d\n\nIn an era of money-dominated politics, it isn\u2019t particularly surprising that the Windy City happens to be the place where government is pioneering such an innovative method of helping a corporate-backed incumbent. It also isn\u2019t surprising that the city commission charged with making sure the mayor is following city ethics laws is itself appointed by the mayor, thus making it more Emanuel\u2019s political weapon rather than an independent enforcement mechanism. It is Chicago, after all \u2014 a place synonymous with political chicanery.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The mayor of Chicago is now arguing that pension funds are not part of city government at all.
