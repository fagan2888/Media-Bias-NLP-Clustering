MSNBC has revamped its website, billing itself as “what progressives have been waiting for.”

When visiting MSNBC.com, guests are now prompted to choose between NBC News, “for breaking news and reporting,” on the left side of the screen, and MSNBC, “what progressives have been waiting for,” on the right side.

“Want a sneak-peek at the new MSNBC.com?” the prompt asks. After clicking “Let’s go,” visitors are offered the opportunity to register their email address to be notified when the new site is launched and “Join in the conversation with the progressive community.”

According to The Daily Caller, NBC News announced last year that MSNBC.com would relaunch sometime this year under Executive Editor Richard Wolffe.
