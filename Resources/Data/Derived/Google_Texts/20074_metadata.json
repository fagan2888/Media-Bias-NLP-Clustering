Jeffress contends end-times prophecy isn't preached often \u2013 but Christians, he argues, need to be knowledgeable.\n\n\"We cannot know when the Lord is going to return,\" he stated. \"In Matthew 24, Jesus said to his disciples No man knows the day or the hour, not even the Son of God himself \u2013 and I tell people if Christ doesn't know when he's returning, I sure don't know.\"\n\nThe key to understanding Bible prophecy, he said, is to understand God's plan for Israel because the Bible says in the end days the Jewish nation will once again be a focus \u2013 and it is today, he added.\n\nDuring the radio interview, the pastor shared his belief that President Obama and other world leaders are paving the way for the Antichrist.\n\n\"[President Obama] was able to confiscate or usurp one-sixth of the nation's economy through Obamacare. He is the first president to launch an unprecedented attack against God's people,\" Jeffress said.\n\n\"Thirdly, he's the first president to propose a change of God's most basic moral law about marriage being between a man and a woman. He was able to do this and win re-election by a comfortable margin.\"\n\nSee earlier story:\n\nAuthor says Obama not the Antichrist \u2013 he's just clearing the way\n\nJeffress believes people are being conditioned to give up their rights for a so-called \"greater good.\"\n\nEditor's note: Listen to Pastor Jeffress every weekday morning @ 6:05 a.m. (Central)\n\non American Family Radio - AFR Talk.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/church/2014/02/17/baptist-pastor-author-be-knowledgeable-of-end-times-events", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/images/ogimage.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "End-times prophecy sends a strong message to Christians to know the signs of Jesus&#39; return \u2013 but one well-known pastor is concerned many Christians don&#39;t know those signs and might not be fully prepared.", "title": "Baptist pastor, author: Be knowledgeable of end-times events"}, "twitter": {"site": "@onenewsnowcom", "image": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/images/ogimage.jpg", "description": "End-times prophecy sends a strong message to Christians to know the signs of Jesus&#39; return \u2013 but one well-known pastor is concerned many Christians don&#39;t know those signs and might not be fully prepared.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Baptist pastor, author: Be knowledgeable of end-times events"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "End-times prophecy sends a strong message to Christians to know the signs of Jesus' return \u2013 but one well-known pastor is concerned many Christians don't know those signs and might not be fully prepared."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd91da\"", "article_summary": "Editor's note: Listen to Pastor Jeffress every weekday morning @ 6:05 a.m. (Central)on American Family Radio - AFR Talk.\n\"[President Obama] was able to confiscate or usurp one-sixth of the nation's economy through Obamacare.\nDuring the radio interview, the pastor shared his belief that President Obama and other world leaders are paving the way for the Antichrist.\nJeffress contends end-times prophecy isn't preached often \u2013 but Christians, he argues, need to be knowledgeable.\nEnd-times prophecy sends a strong message to Christians to know the signs of Jesus' return \u2013 but one well-known pastor is concerned many Christians don't know those signs and might not be fully prepared."}
