That puts Milwaukee in the No. 1 spot in the challenge, which tallied which participating communities made the largest gains during the open enrollment period.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really proud of you,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cWe really want to congratulate you, and I know the president looks forward to seeing you in the coming weeks. He wants to come see the people who pulled this off and did such a great job.\u201d\n\nThe group cheered and celebrated the accomplishment in Barrett\u2019s office this morning.\n\n\u201cWe worked our keisters off here, if I can use a Midwestern term, and the Milwaukee Enrollment Network really was the team of workhorses and the navigators,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that there\u2019s a lot of political drama about the Affordable Care Act, but I think our consensus here is this is about two things: It\u2019s about making sure that Americans have health care\u2026and then second, and equally compelling, it\u2019s much more efficient than having people go to the emergency room. Because if you\u2019re sick and you don\u2019t have a primary care provider, you\u2019re going to the emergency room.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This morning, the White House announced that Milwaukee won the \u201cHealthy Communities Challenge\u201d for enrolling the most new residents in Marketplace coverage", "og": {"site_name": "BizTimes Media", "description": "President will visit to congratulate stakeholders.", "title": "Milwaukee wins national Obamacare enrollment challenge", "url": "http://www.biztimes.com/2016/02/12/milwaukee-wins-national-obamacare-enrollment-challenge/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "http://biztimes.7xwujm2pynf1lh.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hospital-156022646-shutterstock-e1444757518705.jpg", "height": 560}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://biztimes.7xwujm2pynf1lh.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hospital-156022646-shutterstock-e1444757518705.jpg?w=640", "site": "@BizTimesMedia", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@BizTimesMedia"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-12T16:59:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-12T16:59:55+00:00"}, "keywords": "affordable care act,barack obama,chris abele,kathleen falk,milwaukee,tom barrett,white house", "google-site-verification": "q525hWL29Np_TIsJ0g7DBGQn-HsUQezBxm172DFDNQw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "1 spot in the challenge, which tallied which participating communities made the largest gains during the open enrollment period.\nBecause if you\u2019re sick and you don\u2019t have a primary care provider, you\u2019re going to the emergency room.\u201d\nMilwaukee signed up 89,000 new Marketplace plans this year, which includes 38,000 new enrollees, McDonough said.\n\u201cWe worked our keisters off here, if I can use a Midwestern term, and the Milwaukee Enrollment Network really was the team of workhorses and the navigators,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe really want to congratulate you, and I know the president looks forward to seeing you in the coming weeks."}
