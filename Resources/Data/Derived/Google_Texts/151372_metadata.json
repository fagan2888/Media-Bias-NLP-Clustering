By referring to himself as in the fourth quarter, Obama reminds an increasingly distracted press corps that the game isn\u2019t officially finished for him quite yet \u2014 and, until it is, he intends to keep playing.\n\nSince being the center of attention usually means being the focal point of criticism as well, that\u2019s probably a role that Hillary Clinton, Obama\u2019s former secretary of state and would-be successor, is happy to leave him for the time being. Better he suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune (a.k.a. the Republican Party) from the comfort of the White House than she do so while pretending to enjoy Iowa\u2019s signature cuisine.\n\nBut while there may currently be a sort of harmony between the Democratic Party\u2019s two most influential figures, their respective self-interests are only complementary up to a point. Sooner or later, it\u2019ll be time for Obama to cede the spotlight and the stage to the Clintons yet again; and sooner or later, Clinton will have to accept her role as the party\u2019s de facto leader while establishing how (and why) her stewardship will be different. The guardians of American politics\u2019 unwritten rules will expect nothing less.\n\nRather than delay the inevitable until it\u2019s foisted upon her by the press, wouldn\u2019t it be easier if Clinton got ahead of the meta-narrative and established where she breaks with the president herself? I think the answer is quite clearly yes. The harder it is for the press to succumb to its weakness for narcissism and frivolity, the better. And Clinton\u2019s at her best when talking about policy \u2014 not her own \u201cauthenticity\u201d or how the press corps\u2019 feels \u2014 to boot.\n\nFor these reasons and others, I think the time is now for Clinton to announce she\u2019s against giving the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) the \u201cfast-track\u201d treatment. In terms of politics and policy, it\u2019s the right thing to do. And with liberal anger toward Obama at a TPP-induced peak \u2014 and with Sen. Bernie Sanders challenging her from her left \u2014 circumstances could hardly be better. She should do it, and she should do it soon.\n\nThere are arguments against her reaching and/or announcing a stance of opposition, of course, on grounds of policy as well as politics. It\u2019s just that none of them are especially good. Yes, there may be something awkward about a onetime NAFTA champion opposing the TPP. But Clinton has begun walking away from elements of her husband\u2019s record already, and it\u2019s hard to imagine how distancing herself from one of his most controversial and unpopular initiatives will hurt. A willingness to change your mind, provided it\u2019s for good reasons, can even be a plus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The policy and the politics are in perfect agreement \u2014 the time is now for Clinton to break away from the president", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s smartest move: Say no to TPP, and join the Warren/Krugman forces", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The policy and the politics are in perfect agreement \u2014 the time is now for Clinton to break away from the president", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s smartest move: Say no to TPP, and join the Warren/Krugman forces", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/02/hillary_clintons_smartest_move_say_no_to_tpp_and_join_the_warrenkrugman_forces/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/obama_hillary.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The policy and the politics are in perfect agreement \u2014 the time is now for Clinton to break away from the president", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s smartest move: Say no to TPP, and join the Warren/Krugman forces", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/obama_hillary.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1 percent, Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Editor's Picks, Election 2016, Elizabeth Warren, fast-track, Hillary Clinton, Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman, The Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe553e\"", "article_summary": "For these reasons and others, I think the time is now for Clinton to announce she\u2019s against giving the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) the \u201cfast-track\u201d treatment.\nAnd Clinton\u2019s at her best when talking about policy \u2014 not her own \u201cauthenticity\u201d or how the press corps\u2019 feels \u2014 to boot.\nYes, there may be something awkward about a onetime NAFTA champion opposing the TPP.\nthe Republican Party) from the comfort of the White House than she do so while pretending to enjoy Iowa\u2019s signature cuisine.\nThere are arguments against her reaching and/or announcing a stance of opposition, of course, on grounds of policy as well as politics."}
