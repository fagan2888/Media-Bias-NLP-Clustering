Teens in Vermont gathered Saturday to speak out in a variety of ways against Vermont's growing drug problem.

For Youth Speak’s first artist, the fight against drugs is personal.

“My dad is a recovering addict, so I know what it feels like to go through all of that,” said performer Kash Spencer.

Spencer said while his father's drug use wasn't as bad as most, drugs can make growing up on the right path really difficult.

“To be honest, it's kind of hard, because it can affect you many different ways, it can affect your social life, it can affect your job,” Spencer said.

The event aims to give teens a chance to voice their truth about an issue they say is on the rise.

“I think the fact that Vermont is a direct route from Montreal to Boston, and drug trafficking has really affected the drug climate in Vermont, there's a lot of drugs here,” organizer Emily Nelson-Foster said.

Teens took to the stage with song, poems and raps, most sharing their personal experiences with drugs in Vermont. It was an outlet for many to be heard by friends, peers and even political candidates.

Democratic Senate hopeful, Dawn Ellis, said teens need to be given safe alternatives before they turn to drugs.

“It’s a challenge of do we have things for young people to do. Work, activities, places to convene, ways to learn outside of the school day, ways to grow and experiment,” Ellis said.

For Spencer, he said it’s important for teens to know even with adversity, it’s possible to be successful.

“It didn’t really affect me to the point where I would look at my dad different,” Spencer said. “Or where it prevented me from reaching my goals, I graduated high school, I went to college for a year and a half.”

Spencer said teens need to keep focused on their goals and avoid following the crowd.
