Check out our interview with The Nuge below:\n\nTed, after watching and listening to the new release, it\u2019s clear your energy levels have not wavered much from way back when.\n\nNo question. My music has a life of its own and the fact that I get to dive onto this sonic white-water raft every night is no doubt a gift from God. I\u2019m 65 years clean and sober and so things are working pretty damn good except for my knees. I have two bad knees from jumping off all those amplifiers over the years. But the music has such an energy all unto itself that what Greg, Mick, Derek and I do every night keeps us young. I\u2019ve played some of these songs 5,000 times and I can\u2019t wait to keep playing them again and again. They still turn me on.\n\nI don\u2019t really think at all when I\u2019m up there. Like a great samurai warrior once said, if you\u2019re not handling your sword properly, it\u2019s the result of too many minds. One thing I do not happen to have, when I grab my guitar, is too many minds (laughs). I feel like a kid in the garage with my first live amp and my first piece of ass every night. I\u2019m a lucky guy.\n\nWas there a show you saw early on that inspired the kind of high-energy you\u2019re so famous for?\n\nAbsolutely. It was in 1960 or 61 at the Walled Lake Casino in Walled Lake, Michigan just west of Detroit. I was about 13 and my band was opening for Gene Pitney, Martha and the Vandellas and the headliner was Billy Lee and the Rivieras. A year later, Billy Lee and the Rivieras changed their name to Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels. But what I saw that night out of Earl Elliott on bass, Joe Kubert on rhythm guitar, Johnny Badanjek on drums and Jimmy McCarty on a Gibson Birdland guitar through a Fender twin reverb amp established a level of outrageous energy that I never forgot.\n\nThe spirit of that rhythm and blues band was ultra-energized and ultra-focused. And what Mitch Ryder delivered the night was a firestorm of authority. The shrapnel just from the tambourines, I think he played eight of them that night, was epic. And they were just teenagers then. The inescapable throttle of that rhythm section and the overall intensity absolutely established the only way to perform. I\u2019ve remembered that for every concert I\u2019ve played in my life, going on 6,500 now. That was the musical moment for me. That\u2019s still the bar I try to eclipse every night and you see that on this new DVD.\n\nYour band on this last tour seemed like the perfect fit for you.\n\nI look at this ridiculous career mine and think, God has blessed me every step of the way starting with the my early bands like the Royal High Boys, the Amboy Dukes, all the way through Damn Yankees and these guys today. The most gifted and renowned virtuosos have been in my bands. I\u2019ve played with some of the greatest guys to ever live, I\u2019ve jammed with guys like Keith Moon \u2013 I am blessed.\n\nMy band members today push me to try harder because these guys love these songs. I think that\u2019s what you sense \u2013 the chemistry. We have that kind of fire together. I feel all of their human passion each night and I am blessed, fortunate, humble and lucky to have these men behind me.\n\nOut of the 6,500 shows over the years, do any stand out for any special reason?\n\nIt will be hard for you to believe my response, so take a deep breath and please just believe me. We recently wrapped up our last show this year in Laughlin, Nevada, and things happened in that show that never happened before. But that\u2019s how every single night is. There is a spirit of unbridled excitement in every show. So there are none that stand out because they ALL stand out. We get together before hitting the stage each night, we punch each other\u2019s fists and we yell out the name of our favorite heroes: James Brown! Wilson Pickett! Chuck Berry! There are no Caucasian licks played by this band! (laughs) Every night is an orgy of musical dreams.\n\nI witnessed Mitch Ryder, Brownsville Station, Bob Seger, the MC5 \u2013 all of them \u2013 and I channel all those shows every night. those bands I grew up watching. And Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, James Brown. It goes on. When I watch guys today, when I\u2019ve seen [Bruce] Springsteen or Sammy Hagar or Steven Tyler or Mick Jagger \u2014 I know that they are feeling the music like I do and they understand that idea that you go out every single night and just leave it all out there.\n\nThe age range of your live audience seems to cross several generations, too.\n\nIt\u2019s very inspiring and humbling. I see little boys and girls out there along with old farts like me. We do lots of family events like River Days and Rib Fests \u2014 big outdoor family get-togethers and I love that. A lot of it\u2019s from a TV show I do on the Outdoor Channel that celebrates the way we hunt. That brings people out I know. And every night onstage I emphasize to young people, you cannot have this much fun or play with this kind of energy unless you are clean and sober.\n\nTo achieve the American dream you must be clean and sober. I tell them, don\u2019t succumb to pressure \u2013 stay clean and sober. That\u2019s the most gratifying thing for me \u2013 steering kids away from the sheep that march in the wrong direction.\n\nThe world has become, as you have no problem discussing, a much more dangerous and serious place today. Do you look at your shows as an escape from the headlines?\n\nAbsolutely. And we need musical escapes away from all this crap in the world, now more than ever. If you just pay a modicum of attention to the headlines you know it. There is an increasing abuse of force and corruption in the American government right now. When you\u2019ve got someone forcing a pallet of documents down the country\u2019s throat, screaming that you don\u2019t have to read it, you have to sign it and then find out what is in it after it gets passed, I mean, can you get any more anti-American or anti-we the people than that?\n\nYet that is what they did, the shoving down all of our throats with Obamacare, which is clearly against the Constitution and clearly did not get voted on by we the people. Then we have this Fast and Furious program from with the number one law officer in the United States, intentionally violating the oath of the Constitution and sending illegal guns to Mexican gangs! Cecil B. DeMille could not write this script \u2013 it is too obscene.\n\nSo your stage becomes your own pulpit to preach from.\n\nSure. I articulate clearly onstage every night that you came here to escape the chaos and abuse of power in our government. And you are here to celebrate the Chuck Berry escape mechanism. But at the end of each concert I tell people to go home and fight to eliminate the bad and the ugly.\n\nI\u2019ve been in our government\u2019s face since the 1960s and it breaks my heart and brings me no joy whatsoever to have to say these things. It is a tragic and heartbreaking time, but look, this experiment in self-government happens to include guitar players too \u2013 and so I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to shut up.\n\nOur thanks to Ted Nugent for taking the time to chat with us.
