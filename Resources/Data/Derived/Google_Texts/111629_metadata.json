It will cause unemployment to go up. It\u2019s devastating,\u201d Boxer said.\n\nBoxer, as the current ranking member of the U.S. Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works Committee, said that the construction and maintenance of highways, bridges and related infrastructure nationwide, which is overseen by the Environment and Public Works Committee, is at stake.\n\n\u201cIn 14 days, we have no more federal program for transportation,\u201d she said, explaining that California alone gets $4 billion, or 45 percent, of its transportation funding from the federal government each year.\n\nShe said if the U.S. House of Representatives doesn\u2019t pass the Drive Act, which provides for transportation maintenance, millions of jobs will be lost nationwide and the safety of Americans will be at risk. She said she\u2019s hoping the House of Representatives will compromise and come up with a bill that stops \u201ca transportation shutdown.\u201d\n\nWith an estimated 61,000 deficient bridges across the country and 50 percent of the nation\u2019s roads in poor condition, Boxer said transportation is not the place to cut funding.\n\n\u201cThe Golden Gate Bridge is on that list,\u201d Boxer said, adding that the bridge, and other old bridges across the country, weren\u2019t designed to support such heavy vehicle traffic that they must now accommodate.\n\nBoxer said California and the West needs to be preparing for harsh El Nino weather and said she wants to know what federal agencies plan to do if torrential rainfall and storms hit the U.S. causing mudslides. Federal agencies need to ensure that they have enough resources, especially after a particularly bad fire season in the West, Boxer said.\n\nAnother crisis, Boxer said, is the raising of the debt ceiling before the Nov. 3 deadline. She said if the country fails to do so, it could have negative repercussions on the value of the U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cWe have these three manufactured crises,\u201d Boxer said, noting that she wants to see the Democrats and the Republicans work together on addressing these issues.\n\nThe House Republicans\u2019 Fiscal Year 2016 Budget states that the $5.5 trillion in proposed decreased spending over the next decade and end to annual deficits will come about by simplifying tax codes and by streamlining or repealing regulations \u201cconjured up in the halls of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).\u201d\n\nBoxer said in all her time in Congress she\u2019s never seen the Republicans move so far to the right and be so unwilling to compromise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a mess, it\u2019s a complete mess,\u201d Boxer said. She said it\u2019s a shame that \u201ceducation, transportation, sensible gun laws\u201d aren\u2019t part of the Republicans\u2019 agenda.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable,\u201d Boxer said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California's U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer was in San Francisco Friday expressing her concerns about a potentially fierce El Nino this winter a\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=472672814", "og": {"site_name": "KRON4.com", "description": "California\u2019s U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer was in San Francisco Friday expressing her concerns about a potentially fierce El Nino this winter and three crises that have been \u201cself-inflicte\u2026", "title": "US Senator Barbara Boxer warns of harsh El Nino, looming government crises", "url": "http://kron4.com/2015/10/16/us-senator-barabara-boxer-warns-of-harsh-el-nino-looming-government-crises/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "https://mgtvkron.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/boxer.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "California\u2019s U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer was in San Francisco Friday expressing her concerns about a potentially fierce El Nino this winter and three crises that have been \u201cself-inflicte\u2026", "creator": "@kron4news", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvkron.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/boxer.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "US Senator Barbara Boxer warns of harsh El Nino, looming government crises", "site": "kron4news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Barbara Boxer, El Nino, San Francisco Bay Area News, California News, National, News, Politics, San Francisco Bay Area Weather, Weather: El Ni\u00f1o Storm", "msapplication-tooltip": "San Francisco Bay Area News and Weather", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mediageneral.kron", "fb": {"pages": 76378187097}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kron4.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/c3b964b0ec8331fdc42c806ab42993d9?s=16", "application-name": "KRON4.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KRON4", "published_time": "2015-10-17T06:17:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-02T15:00:42+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "E6zua_1Hx3PqDQT7AXZraHKgjfzBwVxgG6fPV6wzriM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b2d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe have these three manufactured crises,\u201d Boxer said, noting that she wants to see the Democrats and the Republicans work together on addressing these issues.\nFederal agencies need to ensure that they have enough resources, especially after a particularly bad fire season in the West, Boxer said.\nHowever, President Barack Obama has said he won\u2019t sign a bill that strips Planned Parenthood of federal funding.\nAnother crisis, Boxer said, is the raising of the debt ceiling before the Nov. 3 deadline.\nNow Congress has until Dec. 11 to act in order to avoid a government shutdown."}
