I thought it was so funny, I immediately tweeted it.\n\nBut as the day went on, it became clear that Overton\u2019s argument wasn\u2019t some fringe theory: It\u2019s shaping up as a core tenet of one \u201ccompromise\u201d approach to religious freedom laws that\u2019s under consideration, in the wake of the backlash to the Indiana law, which Overton fervently supported as written. It\u2019s at the heart of the fix to the law Jeb Bush pushed Wednesday night with pro-gay rights Republican donors.\n\nHere\u2019s how the pastor tried to explain it: Critics who say Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act would let businesses routinely deny service to LGBT Americans are wrong. \u201cI don\u2019t think any RFRA anywhere would say, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna give you a hotel room, I\u2019m not gonna give you a hamburger, or gasoline or groceries,\u2019\u201d Overton told Inskeep. \u201cThat\u2019s outside the bounds.\u201d\n\nBut just as a religious leader should be able to decide, according to the tenets of his or her faith, whether to preside over gay marriages, Overton argued, so should a florist or a baker get to decide whether his or her \u201cartistic ability\u201d should be part of a gay wedding.\n\nI think most Americans would agree that a pastor like myself should not be compelled by the government to use my speech to support someone else\u2019s perspective. I think that has parallels to the cake maker. The cake maker is using his or her artistic ability to make a cake and that cake communicates something. I think that cake is speech, that says \u2018we celebrate this union.\u2019 I just don\u2019t think they should be forced by the government to use their speech to support someone else\u2019s perspective\u2026.I would like the line to be drawn in services that involve speech.\n\nWhen Inskeep asked how society would determine what type of service represented \u201cspeech,\u201d Overton punted and said that would be up to courts. \u201cI think that distinction will be played out in the court,\u201d he replied. \u201cAll the legislature can do is pass principles to guide the court.\u201d (Remember when the right hated activist judges?)\n\nI admit: I thought Overton\u2019s was a fringe point of view when I first listened. And then I received the transcript Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign released to share his remarks, to Silicon Valley donors, about how he would like to clarify Indiana\u2019s law \u2013 a law, by the way, that he said needed no clarification just two nights before. Here\u2019s the key part:\n\nI do think if you\u2019re a florist and you don\u2019t want to participate in the arrangement of a wedding, you shouldn\u2019t have to be obliged to do that if it goes against your faith because you believe in traditional marriage. Likewise if someone walked into a flower shop as a gay couple and said I want to buy all these off the rack, these flowers, they should have every right to do it. That would be discrimination. But forcing someone to participate in a wedding is not discrimination; it is I think protecting the first amendment right.\n\nSo Bush, too, tries to define \u201cdiscrimination\u201d as turning someone away from a flower shop, versus a protected \u201cFirst Amendment right\u201d to refuse to participate in a wedding.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how such a compromise would work in the real world. On the one hand, it would force an LGBT bride or groom to tell a florist or a baker, \u201cOh, by the way, this is a GAY wedding, and I hope you don\u2019t have any problem with that.\u201d Otherwise if they figured it out along the way, it would seem they could legally back out, and leave the marrying couple up a creek. (And imagine if you had to tell a florist: \u201cOh, by the way, I\u2019m a Catholic, and I hope you don\u2019t have a problem with Catholic weddings.\u201d)", "article_metadata": {"description": "How absurd have Republicans gotten in their defense of \"religious freedom\" laws?
