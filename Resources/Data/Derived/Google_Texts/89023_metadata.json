They teach German, assist with bureaucratic hurdles and play with the refugee children.\n\nThe Protestant church, surrounded by pointy-roofed stone buildings that were built to house miners, is the first in Germany to have been set aside for refugees since they began streaming into the country by the thousands in late summer.\n\nGermany expects about 1 million migrants to arrive this year, far more than any other European country. German politicians are under intense pressure to stem the flow as local communities complain that they are being overwhelmed.\n\nBut the story of the church in Oberhausen suggests that Germany\u2019s \u201cWillkommenskultur,\u201d or welcome culture, remains alive and well in some pockets of the country.\n\nREAD: The \u2018Splainer: Why should we give thanks?\n\nLocal resident Sebastian Possner launched a neighborhood initiative nearly a month ago to protest against the conversion of the church. Now he says his kids are playing with the refugee children and that he\u2019s donated bicycles and toys.\n\n\u201cSome of them even manage to greet us in German now,\u201d Possner said.\n\nUp to 140 refugees are landing in Oberhausen every week, forcing authorities to come up with new locations to house them. City officials say they had little choice but to use the church.\n\nIn early November, workers removed the altar and dozens of chairs, replacing them with metal beds, which are separated by makeshift partitions to give the church\u2019s new residents a semblance of privacy. There was no question of removing the large metal cross that sits in the church, even though many of the new residents are Muslim.\n\nOne reason for the initial uproar, locals say, was that many of them learned about the plans in the newspaper.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, many older members of the parish couldn\u2019t comprehend what was happening to the church they had been going to for so many years, but we\u2019ve come a long way and people now appreciate the importance of Christian charity,\u201d pastor Stefanie Zuechner said.\n\nShe said the city has promised to move the refugees out of the church and into newly built shelters by the end of February. Then it could reopen to the public, though Zuechner acknowledges that only about 20 residents used to show up on Sundays when services were held.\n\nFor the refugees themselves, the main complaint is the cramped conditions in the church.\n\nZabyl Olabi and her husband Mahmod, who came to Germany with their 18-year-old son Humam, owned a chicken breeding farm in Aleppo. They fled to Europe six months ago, when their house was destroyed during an air raid and Islamic State militants advanced towards the city.\n\n\u201cAs you can see I am not Christian,\u201d Olabi said, pointing to her headscarf. \u201cSo at first it seemed strange to us to live in a church. Now we\u2019re just exhausted and wondering what comes next.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Tina Bellon)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Christian, church, Germany, islam, Protestant, refugees, Syria", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "When news of the plan to house 50 refugees in the church and suspend Sunday services spread through the town, angry residents pressed church and city officials to reconsider.
