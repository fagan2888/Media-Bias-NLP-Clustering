Dan Keeler for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe President of Haiti, Michel Martelly, dropped in to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s New York headquarters a few days ago to talk about his plans for stabilizing and expanding Haiti\u2019s economy. Devastated by an earthquake in 2010 that left more than 100,000 people dead, Haiti has struggled in the ensuing years to attract the attention of the international investing community.\n\nWhen Mr. Martelly breezed into the Journal\u2019s offices some half an hour later than expected, his casual outfit and cheerful demeanor contrasted starkly with the sharp suits and dour expressions worn by his surprisingly sizable entourage.\n\nHis message, however, was as polished and serious as his security crew. After rattling off the usual presidential array of statistics relating to schools and hospitals, human development and security he turned his attention to the gnarly business of, well, business.\n\nWSJ Frontiers Newsletter Enter your email to be notified when we launch the new WSJ Frontiers weekly email newsletter\n\nAttracting foreign companies to invest in Haiti is one of Mr. Martelly\u2019s key objectives. But he acknowledges that Haiti has a problem. The 2010 earthquake shattered much of the country\u2019s infrastructure, and in its wake Haiti developed an image as a basket case, a country whose only hope lay in attracting charitable aid.\n\nThat image, though, is no longer accurate, says Mr. Martelly. In a barely concealed dig at the aid community, he said: \u201cInstead of selling our problems and trying to attract pity or charity, let\u2019s sell what we have that\u2019s great and exploit that, so we can get funds and change Haiti.\u201d\n\nHaiti\u2019s President is not alone in his belief that highlighting the country\u2019s problems is hindering its development. Douglas Clayton, CEO of frontier-market fund manager Leopard Capital, which has invested $5.4 million in a range of projects in Haiti, says: \u201cThe NGOs project only Haiti\u2019s flaws, to sustain their fundraising. Actual progress tends to get under-reported.\u201d\n\nAnd actual progress has been significant. According to the IMF, Haiti\u2019s economy is among the fastest growing in the Caribbean, having expanded by 4.3% in 2013. The country is also growing its foreign direct investment, albeit from a low base. \u201cForeign investment has gone up. It was $29 million in 2009, now it\u2019s about $220 million,\u201d Martelly notes.\n\nHe also counters critics\u2019 assertions that the government is not working quickly enough to rehouse people who have been living in camps since their homes were destroyed by the earthquake. \u201cBefore, you couldn\u2019t go around the capital without seeing 10 or 15 camps,\u201d Mr. Martelly says. \u201cNow you have to actively look for them.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s focus has been on attracting investment to agriculture and tourism, but it has also tried to attract companies to Caracol, a $300 million industrial park on the site of a former fishing village on the north coast. Response has been muted, though, and fewer than 5,000 of the hoped-for 65,000 jobs have so far been created.\n\nLeopard Capital\u2019s Mr. Clayton applauds the government\u2019s efforts to attract investment but cautions that operating in Haiti can be a frustrating experience: \u201cInvestors have to navigate lots of obsolete regulations and procedures to invest in Haiti,\u201d he says.\n\nIf Mr. Martelly is true to his word, those investors who do brave the tangled web of obsolete regulations will receive a warm welcome.\n\nWrite to Dan Keeler at dan.keeler@wsj.com.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications: An earlier version of this post described the President\u2019s entourage as \u201chenchmen.\u201d In order to prevent any confusion, this reference has been removed.
