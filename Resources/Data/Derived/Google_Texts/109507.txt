Greater London Authority (GLA) has selected Galliford Try as preferred developer to construct the Silvertown Way development in Canning Town, East London.

The development, which will create more than 1,100 mixed tenure homes across 11 individual blocks, has an approximate gross development value of £360m. This makes it the largest standalone housing scheme that the company has ever undertaken.

Galliford Try has now picked up more than £800m of new work in the past two weeks, including more than £100m of affordable housing (see report here), more than £100m of building projects (previously reported here) and a major AMP6 framework deal with Southern Water, announced last week (here).

The Silvertown Way project will be delivered through an existing joint venture vehicle with Thames Valley Housing Association and deliver a third of the homes as market rent for its subsidiary Fizzy Living.

Three Galliford Try Group companies will work on the development – Linden Homes, Galliford Try Partnerships and Galliford Try Infrastructure. The development includes a hotel, a restaurant, and office/commercial space as well as homes for sale, rent and shared ownership.

In addition, topping off a great fortnight for the company, Galliford Try has been appointed as preferred developer for a £40m house-building scheme in the Bristol region, to build 210 homes for the Homes & Communities Agency (HCA).

Galliford Try chief executive Greg Fitzgerald said: "We are delighted to have been selected for both these schemes which underline our strong relationship with the GLA and HCA. These schemes are testament to the combined resources of the group and our proven expertise in regeneration and affordable housing projects. It underlines our continued investment in delivering much needed homes and working in long-term partnerships with our partners in the sector."
