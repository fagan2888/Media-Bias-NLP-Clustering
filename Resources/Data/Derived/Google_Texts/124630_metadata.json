His reckless offshore oil and gas restrictions reduced Alaska\u2019s Arctic Ocean presence to one exploration site each in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas and left us with the lowest number of prospects in the history of the Outer Continental Shelf leasing program.\n\nAlaska\u2019s U.S. senators, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, and at-large Rep. Don Young, all Republicans, vowed at a press conference to fight Obama\u2019s offshore decision, which came only days after his Interior Department announced the shocking designation of nearly all of Alaska\u2019s 19.6-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as untouchable wilderness lands. These two moves would lock up the nation\u2019s richest continental oil prospect and lock up America\u2019s share of the Arctic Ocean\u2019s estimated 30 percent of the world\u2019s undiscovered natural gas and 13 percent of its oil reserves.\n\nThe famously outspoken Rep. Young said, \u201cIt\u2019s becoming undeniably clear that this administration does not view Alaska as a sovereign state, but rather an eco-theme park for the most extreme environmentalist allies of the president and his party.\u201d\n\nYoung didn\u2019t know how stunningly accurate his claim would turn out to be. A day later, a story about some of Obama\u2019s \u201cmost extreme environmentalist allies\u201d broke under the headline, \u201cForeign Firm Funding U.S. Green Groups Tied to State-Owned Russian Oil Company.\u201d\n\nFormer Heritage Foundation investigative reporter Lachlan Markay wrote for the Free Beacon that Russian money for anti-oil and gas campaigns had been laundered through a Bermuda investment house, bank, and shell corporation and the California-based Sea Change Foundation.\n\n\u201cThe Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Food and Water Watch, the League of Conservation Voters and the Center for American Progress were among the recipients of Sea Change\u2019s $100 million in grants in 2010 and 2011,\u201d Markay wrote.\n\nJohn Podesta, White House Counselor to Obama, founded the Center for American Progress, which acts as a two-way pipeline for administration and Democratic Party policy promotion.\n\nOne of Markay\u2019s key sources was an untitled, exceptionally detailed report by the Washington-based research group, Environmental Policy Alliance, replete with names, amounts, source documents and infographics.\n\nIt reveals money flows from two notorious Russian money launderers\u2014the convicted IPOC Group run by Russian telecommunications minister Leonid Reiman and Russian telecom firm VimpelCom, which is under criminal investigation. Both Mikhail Fridman, VimpelCom\u2019s majority owner, and Reiman are close advisors to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn addition, three Russian energy investment firms kick in money to Wakefield Quinn, a Bermuda law firm which runs it through Klein, Ltd., an \u201cexists-only-on-paper\u201d firm with Kremlin ties that was mentioned in a 2014 Senate majority report on \u201cBillionaire Club\u201d donors to environmental groups.\n\nKlein passes the money to Sea Change, which dispenses it in perfectly legal laundered grants to U.S. anti-oil-and-gas green groups.\n\nThat\u2019s infuriating, but what\u2019s it got to do with Obama\u2019s war on Alaska\u2019s Arctic offshore oil and gas resources?\n\nWell, perhaps everything: While President Obama panders to the extreme environmental left, Putin prepares for an Arctic war.\n\nThe very day Rep. Young slapped Obama for appeasing his extremist green group base, the respected global intelligence company Stratfor released a report titled, \u201cRussia\u2019s Plans for Arctic Supremacy.\u201d\n\nAs Obama retreats from the Arctic Ocean with contempt for its fossil energy might, Putin sees in it global power. Russia is laying claim to great swaths of Arctic oil and gas with deployed rigs, more nuclear-powered icebreakers and a huge new strategic military command: the Northern Fleet, which represents two-thirds of the entire Russian Navy.\n\nIn addition, Putin has activated Arctic warfare units in a 6,000-soldier military group with two motorized infantry brigades and air force facilities from the Soviet era on the archipelago of Novaya Zemlya, \u201crenovated to accommodate modern and next generation fighter aircraft in addition to advanced S400 air defense systems,\u201d he report says. In other words, according to Stratfor, the Russians are out to dominate the retreating United States.\n\nPutin is no fool when it comes to dealing with weak enemies \u2013 witness Ukraine. He is particularly harsh on those who give policy power to the sort of people he puts in jail. Putin is grabbing Arctic resources while Obama turns his back on them.\n\nThe U.S. has no leadership anywhere in the high north and Russia does. There are no U.S. military bases on the entire Alaskan Arctic coast; our fighter pilots have to fly long distances to intercept increasingly numerous and bold incursions.\n\nIn August and September of last year, Russian jets made several incursions to the Air Defense Identification Zones off the coast of Alaska (officials say such incidents happen around 10 times a year), and Russian strategic bombers in the Labrador Sea near Canada practiced cruise missile strikes on the United States. American and Canadian fighters intercepted and diverted the Russians.\n\nRussia has increased its bomber patrols and submarine activity and is watching Obama\u2019s every move with a newly opened Arctic military reconnaissance drone base 420 miles off mainland Alaska.\n\nThe United States lacks ships able to operate in or near Arctic ice \u2013 two medium icebreakers to Russia\u2019s 25 nuclear-powered monsters that look like battleships. We could send our ships, but Arctic Alaska has scant support facilities and hopelessly inadequate communications.\n\nOur nation is in a bind that few even realize. Who will take action and put our energy wealth to use for the strength of America?\n\nAlaska is in the middle of that bind. Alaska is not nearly angry, outraged and frustrated enough with President Obama, Harvard Law graduate\u2014and not yet fearful enough of President Putin, former lieutenant colonel, KGB.\n\n[Originally published at the Daily Signal]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/02/will-president-obamas-new-drilling-policy-give-the-arctic-over-to-russian-domination/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/OandP.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Will President Obama\u2019s New Drilling Policy Give the Arctic Over to Russian Domination?"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2ad2\"", "article_summary": "It reveals money flows from two notorious Russian money launderers\u2014the convicted IPOC Group run by Russian telecommunications minister Leonid Reiman and Russian telecom firm VimpelCom, which is under criminal investigation.\nAlaska is not nearly angry, outraged and frustrated enough with President Obama, Harvard Law graduate\u2014and not yet fearful enough of President Putin, former lieutenant colonel, KGB.\nBoth Mikhail Fridman, VimpelCom\u2019s majority owner, and Reiman are close advisors to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nWe could send our ships, but Arctic Alaska has scant support facilities and hopelessly inadequate communications.\nWell, perhaps everything: While President Obama panders to the extreme environmental left, Putin prepares for an Arctic war."}
