Mean\u00adwhile, the per\u00adcent\u00adage say\u00ading it was un\u00adlikely they\u2019d look for a new job fell 13 points from 64 per\u00adcent to 51 per\u00adcent, a bare ma\u00adjor\u00adity.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the land\u00adscape of changes, these are the most sig\u00adni\u00adfic\u00adant changes to con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal of\u00adfices in a gen\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion,\u201d Brad Fitch, the pres\u00adid\u00adent and CEO of the found\u00ada\u00adtion told Na\u00adtion\u00adal Journ\u00adal. \u201cIt\u2019s a folly to think that those changes are not go\u00ading to have an im\u00adpact on staff re\u00adten\u00adtion or re\u00adcruit\u00adment.\u201d\n\nIn ad\u00addi\u00adtion to budget cuts, many staffers are los\u00ading their fed\u00ader\u00adal em\u00adploy\u00adee health be\u00adne\u00adfits and be\u00ading forced to pur\u00adchase cov\u00ader\u00adage through the in\u00adsur\u00adance ex\u00adchanges es\u00adtab\u00adlished by the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act, a change Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans pushed for polit\u00adic\u00adal reas\u00adons.

As a res\u00adult of the se\u00adquester, I\u2019m los\u00ading those staff to off-Hill po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtions that pay some\u00adtimes double what pay on the Hill is, with more cer\u00adtainty and no fur\u00adloughs. This is a hor\u00adrible situ\u00adation.\u201d\n\nCuts have forced man\u00adagers to do more with less, strain\u00ading re\u00adsources and pa\u00adtience. In 2011, 30 per\u00adcent of re\u00adspond\u00adents agreed that they have \u201ctoo much to do to do everything well\u201d \u2014 that num\u00adber doubled in the 2013 sur\u00advey, jump\u00ading to 62 per\u00adcent. Mean\u00adwhile, the per\u00adcent\u00adage say\u00ading \u201cjob burnout is a sig\u00adni\u00adfic\u00adant prob\u00adlem in my of\u00adfice\u201d climbed 10 per\u00adcent\u00adage points, from 30 per\u00adcent to 40 per\u00adcent.\n\nAnd the de\u00adcline of in-house re\u00adsources cre\u00adates a va\u00adcu\u00adum that can be filled by out\u00adside groups such as think tanks and lob\u00adby\u00adists, aides fear. \u201cThe elim\u00adin\u00ada\u00adtion of staff\u2019s tra\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal health care has been a com\u00adplete dis\u00adaster,\u201d one staffer said. \u201cIf you wanted a le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adive branch run by K Street lob\u00adby\u00adists and 25-year-old staffers, mis\u00adsion ac\u00adcom\u00adplished.\u201d\n\nOf course, con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal aides have al\u00adways been un\u00adder\u00adpaid and over\u00adworked, but they keep com\u00ading back be\u00adcause of a com\u00admit\u00adment to pub\u00adlic ser\u00advice or a de\u00adsire to have an im\u00adpact. But there may be a point when salary and budget cuts go too far, even for the most ser\u00advice-ori\u00adented. \u201cIs there a break\u00ading point at some point where Cap\u00adit\u00adol Hill be\u00adcomes sig\u00adni\u00adfic\u00adantly less at\u00adtract\u00adive and private sec\u00adtor is more at\u00adtract\u00adive, or an en\u00adtirely dif\u00adfer\u00adent ca\u00adreer?\u201d Fitch won\u00adders.\n\nFor any Amer\u00adic\u00adan in\u00adter\u00adested in fix\u00ading Con\u00adgress and hav\u00ading rep\u00adres\u00adent\u00adat\u00adives who can per\u00adform their jobs well, let\u2019s hope we haven\u2019t already reached that point.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "When you cut their budgets and take away their health insurance, many Capitol Hill employees will look to the exits, and that\u2019s bad news for anyone who wants to fix Congress.", "title": "Congress Cut Its Own Budget.
