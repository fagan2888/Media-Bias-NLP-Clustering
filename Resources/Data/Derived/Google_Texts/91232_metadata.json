And that\u2019s a problem.\n\nIt might just be American subculture to want things we don\u2019t need.\n\nOr, there is a possibility that it might be hard to grasp the concept that doing ?everything to be safe might actually be bad.\n\nOne-third of health care spending is on treatments and tests that aren\u2019t actually necessary and in some ?cases may cause more harm.\n\nThe American College of Physicians cites 37 clinical situations where screening did not promote health but actually hurt patients.\n\nAs our current health care system is laid out, we have a \u201cfee-for-service ?system.\u201d\n\nFor every service doctors provide, they typically get a lump sum of money.\n\nThis makes sense for a typical business model, but not for our health care ?system.\n\nOur \u201cfee-for-service-system\u201d has historically been laid out to encourage ?overtreatment, mostly because doctors are motivated by financial incentives.\n\nWhile there are certainly non-financial incentives for doctors to help their patients get better, their financial motives are often at conflict with their intrinsic motivations.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act has tried to fix some of the problems ?associated with the \u201cfee-for-service system,\u201d not enough was done.\n\nBut here\u2019s a solution.\n\nWe encourage incentives for doctors who favor ?quality over financial ?incentives.\n\nWe should be paying doctors more when they provide higher quality care for patients.\n\nkajsingh@indiana.edu", "article_metadata": {"description": "The main issues with the United States health care system have historically been linked to three main problems: cost, access, and sustainability.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"url": "http://www.idsnews.com/article/2015/01/a-hidden-american-subculture-health-care-overtreatment", "image": "http://duvq7ua50whdw.cloudfront.net/20160412QJeR6mqyqZ/dist/img/IDS-fb-icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "The main issues with the United States health care system have historically been linked to three main problems: cost, access, and sustainability.", "title": "A Hidden American Subculture: Health Care Overtreatment"}, "twitter": {"title": "A Hidden American Subculture: Health Care Overtreatment", "description": "The main issues with the United States health care system have historically been linked to three main problems: cost, access, and sustainability.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@idsnews"}, "keywords": "Indiana University, IU, Bloomington, Indiana, Monroe County, Indiana Daily Student, IDS, student newspaper, newspaper, news, students, college, university, campus, Ernie Pyle", "google-site-verification": "FkL7grEXumouo-bfJ89mrCvOGorioiCTNQ4t4X3bjjI", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd098e\"", "article_summary": "This makes sense for a typical business model, but not for our health care ?system.\nThere have been quite a few issues with the United States health care system.\nAs our current health care system is laid out, we have a \u201cfee-for-service ?system.\u201dFor every service doctors provide, they typically get a lump sum of money.\nOne-third of health care spending is on treatments and tests that aren\u2019t actually necessary and in some ?cases may cause more harm.\nThe American College of Physicians cites 37 clinical situations where screening did not promote health but actually hurt patients."}
