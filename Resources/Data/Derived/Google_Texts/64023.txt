Further cementing his status as one of the coolest presidents in history, President Obama teamed up with Hamilton creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda for a freestyle on Monday.

After Hamilton cast performed several hits from the Broadway show in the East Room, the fake Alexander Hamilton and the real President Barack Obama took it outside â€” to the White House Rose Garden â€” for something a little less buttoned up.

Miranda had the mic, while Obama held up cards with various government-related words, like "constitution," "POTUS" and "Obamacare," that Miranda had to use in his rap. Naturally, he killed it: Throw away his shot, he did not.

By far the best moment comes when Obama drops the invisible mic in his hand and says, "You think that's going viral? That's going viral."
