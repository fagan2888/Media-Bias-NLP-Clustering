Just got the phone call that her scans showed NED (no evidence of disease)! #LeahStrong #StillKickinCancersAss,\u201d Devon said via Instagram.\n\nOn June 2nd of last year, Leah was diagnosed with Stage 4 neuroblastoma and was given a 50/50 chance of survival.\n\nRelated Story: Devon Still Announces Daughter Leah's Cancer Is In Remission\n\nLeah has won the heart of many with her bravery to fight through a terrible disease at the tender age of five.\n\nIn July, she earned the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at the ESPYs for her immeasurable strength. The award was created in honor of N.C. Coach Jimmy Valvano who died of metastatic cancer in 1993.\n\nLeah was unable to attend the ceremony, so her father accepted the award on her behalf. In an emotional speech Devon said, \u201cFor every child that\u2019s out there battling cancer, you know on TV I look like I\u2019m the hero, I look like I\u2019m saving the day, but honestly y\u2019all are the real heroes. What I do is easy; I stand up here and tell them y\u2019all\u2019s story, but y\u2019all are the ones that are actually battling cancer, going through rounds and rounds of chemo every day in radiation and y\u2019all remain with a smile on y\u2019all\u2019s face and y\u2019all never give up and that\u2019s so inspiring.\u201d\n\nLater in August, Leah graced the cover of the Wheaties cereal box. \"Thanks @wheatiescerealin the words straight out of Leah's mouth, this is so awesome!! #LeahStrong#StillStrong,\" Devon captioned his daughter's picture.\n\nThrough her battle, Leah has landed national support. Devon and his former team donated over $1 million, raised through jersey sales, to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital to help fund pediatric cancer research in her honor.\n\nDevon was waived by the Bengals in September and is currently a free agent. The team originally kept him on the practice squad to help him pay for Leah\u2019s medical expenses but later added him to the active roster where he tallied 19 tackles in 12 games.\n\nAlthough he isn't on an NFL roster he has continued to raise money for pediatric research through the Still Strong Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Former Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Devon Still announced that his daughter Leah is cancer free.", "author": "Porsha Richardson", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/30643714/devon-still-announces-5-year-old-daughter-leah-is-cancer-free", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9368721_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Former Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Devon Still announced that his daughter Leah is cancer free.", "title": "Devon Still Announces 5-Year-Old Daughter Leah Is Cancer Free"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9368721_G.jpg", "description": "Former Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Devon Still announced that his daughter Leah is cancer free.", "card": "summary", "title": "Devon Still Announces 5-Year-Old Daughter Leah Is Cancer Free"}, "wnreadableurl": "devon-still-announces-5-year-old-daughter-leah-is-cancer-free", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2015/12/01", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS16", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e40\"", "article_summary": "Former Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Devon Still has announced that his daughter Leah Still is cancer free.\nRelated Story: Devon Still Announces Daughter Leah's Cancer Is In RemissionLeah has won the heart of many with her bravery to fight through a terrible disease at the tender age of five.\nOn June 2nd of last year, Leah was diagnosed with Stage 4 neuroblastoma and was given a 50/50 chance of survival.\nThe award was created in honor of N.C.
