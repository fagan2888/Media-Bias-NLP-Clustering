Now he\u2019s trying to impose it without Congress, an audacious ploy his old Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe condemns as \u201cburning the Constitution.\u201d\n\nAs his presidency wanes, Obama is desperately trying to burnish his eco-credentials with environmental zealots and the leftists at the United Nations and in the European Union. But here at home, his plan would be a disaster economically, which explains its failure in Congress.\n\nHillary Clinton is pledging to support the plan, while Republicans vying for their party\u2019s presidential nomination are vowing to oppose it.\n\nThe Clean Power Plan will be a fiercely debated issue in coal-consuming swing states like Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania \u2014 where the race for the White House is usually decided.\n\nObama\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency is imposing the Clean Power Plan on all 50 states, requiring each state to close down coal-burning electric plants and shift to other sources of electricity \u2014 natural-gas-burning plants, nuclear plants, solar- and wind-power generators \u2014 in order to reduce carbon emissions by one-third.\n\nNew York will be less affected because it gets almost all its electric power from nuclear, natural gas and hydro\u2013electric plants.\n\nBut nationwide, about 40 percent of electric power is produced by coal plants. Forcing these utilities to close will burn consumers with higher electric bills.\n\nIt will also send hundreds of thousands of jobs a year up in smoke, as employers pay more to operate their businesses, according to Heritage Foundation economists.\n\nAnd for what? The purported benefit is to avoid an imperceptible 0.02-degree-Celsius increase in global temperatures by the year 2100. That\u2019s the official EPA estimate of the benefits of this Clean Power Plan. You\u2019ve got to be kidding.\n\nThat\u2019s what as many as 25 governors are saying, and they\u2019re expected to file a lawsuit challenging the plan. They have a strong case.\n\nAlthough the EPA bases its authority on the Clean Air Act of 1970, nothing in that law authorizes the agency to do more than require plants to use the best-available technology \u2014 like scrubbers \u2014 to reduce emissions.\n\nCongress never authorized the EPA to force states to close coal plants and move on to nuclear, wind and solar-energy substitutes.\n\nThe president\u2019s defenders say he has to act alone because the Congress is gridlocked. Nonsense. It\u2019s not gridlock. It\u2019s sanity that prevented Congress from acting. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are against the plan.\n\nObama\u2019s EPA has tried several end-runs around Congress, creatively interpreting the 45-year-old Clean Air Act to suit its agenda.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t always gotten away with it. In a stinging US Supreme Court rebuke of the administration\u2019s attempt to restrict mercury emissions, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that \u201cit is not rational, never mind \u2018appropriate\u2019 to impose billions of dollars in economic costs\u201d when the benefits are so uncertain.\n\nIt\u2019s likely the court would say the same about the plan announced on Monday.\n\nDefenders of the new regulation predict the price of renewable energy will fall, but so far that is pie-in-the-sky speculation. Like the president\u2019s prediction that the average family would save $2,500 because of ObamaCare.\n\nBut long before the Supreme Court weighs in on this new plan, presidential politics is likely to determine its fate.
