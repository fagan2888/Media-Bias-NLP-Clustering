That\u2019s syndicated columnist Mark Shields and Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson.\n\nThe first topic is going to be a total shocker, gay marriage. We have talked about it a little bit. The country struggled with it for quite some time.\n\nDoes legal acceptance mean cultural acceptance?\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Yes.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right. That was the shortest answer\u2026\n\nMARK SHIELDS: No, I really \u2014 I really do think this has been moving.\n\nUnlike Roe v. Wade, where, quite frankly, 40 years later, opinions are still frozen, as it was moving toward a legislative solution, which is always the ideal in a democracy, that you can do it by popular vote and so forth, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that the momentum behind the support for same-sex marriage, for equity was just exponential.\n\nIt went from 40 percent just five-and-a-half years ago of Americans to 60 percent now, 70 percent of men under the age of 49 \u2014 49 \u2014 18 to 49, 70 percent of women. It\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s incredible. So, I think that this just accelerates it and seals it.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Michael Gerson, we heard someone from the Heritage Foundation earlier on in the program say that this conversation is not over, that this could be long-lasting.\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: Well, I think I agree with Mark on this. This has moved unbelievably swiftly.\n\nSeven years ago this summer in August, the current president of the United States said that he believed that marriage was a sacred woman of a man \u2014 a sacred union of a man and woman, seven years ago. That viewpoint has now been declared illegal as a basis for law in all 50 states, in seven years. I don\u2019t know any precedent for that. That\u2019s pretty extraordinary.\n\nIf you step back a little bit, there are some broad cultural reasons for this, not just the court. But there\u2019s really the strategy of coming out, in which more Americans now know people who are gay, which I think has changed and humanized this debate in many ways, change in sexual mores that you see in Hollywood and other places that have taken place over the last few decades, and a change in strategy in the courts, really going \u2014 wanting to join a bourgeois institution, marriage, and making a conservative argument to people like Andrew Sullivan and Jon Rauch, making conservative arguments for stability and commitment.\n\nThis was an argument that appealed to Middle America. And it is the argument that won in this court today.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, I might have misattributed. It might have been Alliance for Freedom, not Heritage Foundation.\n\nBut none of this happens in a vacuum. We\u2019re in a presidential cycle. And there, as expected, responses. The ever growing group of presidential candidates for 2016 also reacted to today\u2019s decision. Each of the four Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, praised the ruling.\n\nBut, for the Republicans, it\u2019s a very different story. Some, like Jeb Bush, said they were opposed, thought the decision best left to states and called for religious liberty. Others, like Scott Walker, called for a new constitutional amendment to oppose it.\n\nIn a statement, he said: \u201cFive unelected judges have taken it upon themselves to redefine the institution of marriage. The only alternative left is to support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to reaffirm the ability of the states to continue to define marriage.\u201d\n\nSome, like Florida Senator Marco Rubio, called it the new law of the land. He said: \u201cWhile I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law. In the years ahead, it is my hope that each side will respect the dignity of the other.\u201d\n\nMARK SHIELDS: The court this week did a \u2014 beyond the wisdom or courage or vision of its decisions, did an enormous political favor in two instances to Republicans.\n\nIt \u2014 they kept the Republicans off the hook on this issue. This had been a central plank of the Republican platform, support for one man \u2014 marriage being between one man and one woman. I mean, this was Republican solid creed.\n\nAnd if this is to become \u2014 if Scott Walker\u2019s position prevails, and he makes that and his supporters and other Republicans make it a litmus test issue in the nominating process of 2016, whoever the Republican nominee who emerges from that will be hurt and damaged in the general election of 2016 for having had to satisfy the \u2014 this litmus test.\n\nI just think \u2014 I think the same thing is true on health care, which I assume we will get to, that they let the Republicans \u2014 great relief that they don\u2019t have to have on their hands that all of a sudden six million or seven million Americans are stripped of their health care.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question politically.\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: I agree that, if that litmus test is employed here, that that\u2019s of political detriment.\n\nBut I think that Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush both came out with probably the more sustainable political position, to say they disagreed with the decision, but it\u2019s the law of the land and now we need to move on to protect religious liberty, a real set of issues that surround the institutional religious liberty in the aftermath of this court decision.\n\nI think that\u2019s the sustainable decision, the one that the nominee is likely to have. But Walker has taken a different way. It\u2019s analogous to the debate on abortion, where people supported a constitutional amendment that was never going to happen. It became like a salute, like a meaningless gesture. And I think that\u2019s true in this case as well.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, shifting gears to the Confederate Flag, since we spoke last week, really, the topic was about the tragedy.\n\nNow, throughout this week, we see retailers making shifts, states taking this emblem off the flag. What does this moment mean for the country?\n\nMARK SHIELDS: For the country, first of all, I was absolutely wrong a week ago, when I thought that \u2014 Judy asked about the flag, and I didn\u2019t see it emerging as an issue.\n\nI think two things happened. I think the example that we saw by the surviving members of the family of those who were slaughtered in Emanuel AME Church, the dignity, the forgiveness that they demonstrated \u2014 we don\u2019t have forgiveness much in our society. We don\u2019t have it in Washington, D.C. We don\u2019t have it on Wall Street. We don\u2019t have it in faculty clubs of universities.\n\nForgiveness is a rare and \u2014 valued, but increasingly rare commodity. These people showed \u2014 I think they set aside almost a political earthquake by their demonstration. And Nikki Haley, the governor of South Carolina, I thought, showed enormous courage and leadership.\n\nAnd what we have seen is the dominoes fallen since, I mean, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Georgia. It\u2019s a remarkable, remarkable response. And I \u2014 unplanned and unorganized and spontaneous, but totally genuine, and I think sparked by the families of the survivors.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Nikki Haley didn\u2019t have this position just a few years ago. So, is this an opportunity for Republicans to change their minds?\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: Well, I think this is their opportunity in many ways.\n\nI could not agree with Mark more. But this is a group of people in Charleston and the families and a church that surrounded this group of people that have raised the standards and ideals of everyone around them through their conduct.\n\nYou had politicians in \u2014 Republican politicians in South Carolina and other places. You could just see it in their mind, they were saying, you know, I\u2019m a Christian. This is a horrible symbol of exclusion and violence. I should have known better over the years.\n\nAnd when Nikki Haley gave people an opening, when she opened the door to do this, a lot of Republicans walked through. They had been clearly uncomfortable for this for years. It had only \u2014 it had been an issue because of South Carolina\u2019s position in the primary season, where all these candidates had to come through and say things they didn\u2019t want to say, probably for the most part, as John McCain eventually said.\n\nBut this gave, I think, an opportunity for Republicans to get out from under a burden that they didn\u2019t really want.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.\n\nAnd just off camera, when we were talking, this \u2014 also the moment that we saw with Obama singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d or just delivering this eulogy, you were both commenting on it. And I wanted to share that with the audience too. But there is still this opportunity for a president to do something that no one else can.\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Well, Michael knows far better personally than I do, but the president, at times of tragedy \u2014 and this is a time of national tragedy \u2014 is the comforter in chief.\n\nAnd words, presidential words at a time like this, whether it\u2019s the Challenger tragedy and Ronald Reagan, or after Oklahoma City with Bill Clinton, the president, I thought, stepped up and spoke to and for the nation today.\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: Often, that involves faith, not sectarian faith, but a broad kind of faith that the injustice you see in front of your eyes is not the final word, that there\u2019s actually an order of justice and hope that lies above and beyond the circumstances that you\u2019re seeing.\n\nAnd I think that that\u2019s often what a president provides, some vision that, you know, you\u2019re \u2014 what you\u2019re seeing in the moment is not final.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Final topic, not a small one, the Affordable Care Act. Could a new president attempt to dismantle this law, or has this finally been settled?\n\nMARK SHIELDS: I think it has been settled.\n\nI think now \u2014 as I mentioned earlier, I think the Republicans again were given a political lifesaver by the court. Now the Democrats have to make it work. I mean, it\u2019s a serious program with serious problems.\n\nToo many low-income are happy they are finally covered, but not enough, middle-income or higher-income people into the exchanges. I just \u2014 I think it \u2014 but I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s going to run quite bluntly on changing it.\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: I don\u2019t think the structure here of Obamacare is immortal. But I think the president has succeeded in embedding a series of expectations in our common life, that the government is going to help with preexisting conditions or with affording coverage, insurance coverage.\n\nIf Republicans want to get rid of Obamacare, they will now have to replace that system in some important way.\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Yes.\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: And that is an accomplishment of the president. You know, he\u2019s forced his opponents that, if they want to get rid of Obamacare, they\u2019re going to need to do something else.\n\nMARK SHIELDS: And, Hari, I just point, it\u2019s 22 years since Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton introduced health care. And we have been waiting for a Republican plan ever since.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: There are a couple of good ones out there.\n\nMARK SHIELDS: But, I mean, there\u2019s nothing that the Republicans have said, this is our plan and we\u2019re\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: We are not rallied around\u2026\n\nMARK SHIELDS: No.\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: But there\u2019s serious policy work being done.\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Well, I\u2019m not questioning that.\n\nBut there\u2019s a difference between concept and reality, and I just haven\u2019t seen \u2014 the fact is that Barack Obama put a lot of Democrats at risk and they took great political risk, many cost their own career, to pass this. And I don\u2019t see anything approaching that in the sense of unity on the other side.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Is this something that we see on the campaign trail? Is this something that\u2026\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: Republicans believe that health care is still an advantage for them.\n\nThis is a system where premiums are increasing, where people aren\u2019t all that happy sometimes with their choice of services. So, Republicans believe they still have a good issue here. Obamacare is still not wildly popular in America. But it is going to be difficult to replace this system.\n\nIt\u2019s going to require a mandate, an electoral mandate, a Republican president, a Republican House and Senate, and some serious policy work. That\u2019s a lot to come together.\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Opposition is waning, public opposition to the Obamacare, Affordable Care Act. I think there\u2019s a growing acceptance. Not by any means it\u2019s reached the sacrosanct level of Medicare or Social Security, but I think it\u2019s becoming, you would have to be able to replace it.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right.\n\nMark Shields, Michael Gerson, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Syndicated columnist Mark Shields and Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson join Hari Sreenivasan to discuss the week\u2019s news, including the historic Supreme Court overturning state bans on same-sex marriage, the Court\u2019s ruling preserving the Affordable Care Act and the growing movement to remove the Confederate flag symbols from public spaces in South Carolina.", "pubdate": 20150626, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Syndicated columnist Mark Shields and Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson join Hari Sreenivasan to discuss the week\u2019s news, including the historic Supreme Court overturning state bans on same-sex marriage, the Court\u2019s ruling preserving the Affordable Care Act and the growing movement to remove the Confederate flag symbols from public spaces in South Carolina.", "title": "Shields and Gerson on Supreme Court\u2019s gay marriage decision", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shieldsgerson.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/shields-gerson-supreme-courts-gay-marriage-obamacare-decisions/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Syndicated columnist Mark Shields and Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson join Hari Sreenivasan to discuss the week\u2019s news, including the historic Supreme Court overturning state bans on same-sex marriage, the Court\u2019s ruling preserving the Affordable Care Act and the growing movement to remove the Confederate flag symbols from public spaces in South Carolina.", "title": "Shields and Gerson on Supreme Court\u2019s gay marriage decision", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shieldsgerson.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Shields and Gerson"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Political Wrap, Shields and Brooks, Shields and Gerson"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd16ea\"", "article_summary": "Is this something that\u2026MICHAEL GERSON: Republicans believe that health care is still an advantage for them.\nI think that\u2019s the sustainable decision, the one that the nominee is likely to have.\nBut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question politically.\nI just \u2014 I think it \u2014 but I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s going to run quite bluntly on changing it.\nMICHAEL GERSON: I don\u2019t think the structure here of Obamacare is immortal."}
