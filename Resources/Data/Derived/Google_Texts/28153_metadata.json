If there was any doubt remaining about that, it was all but removed by the administration\u2019s recent decision to provide \u201chardship exemptions\u201d to just about anyone who can work up the energy to apply for one \u2013 and its admitted inability to control the security of its own web portal.\n\nIn case anyone forgets, Longfellow\u2019s \u201cThe Wreck of the Hesperus\u201d is the tragic story of a ship that floundered and sunk as the result of the captain\u2019s inflated hubris. As the doomed vessel descended upon the shoals, the captain went so far as to strap his own daughter to the mast. But, alas, that failed to provide either proper security or a hardship exemption, and she died along with the rest of the crew \u201con the reef of Norman\u2019s Woe.\u201d\n\nAs with so many of the actions taken by the Obama administration, it is difficult to ascertain exactly when and how he and his minions arrived at the convoluted decision to launch an insecure website and gut their own \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d After announcing on his first full day in office that his would be the most \u201ctransparent administration in history,\u201d Obama has conducted his affairs in such secrecy that Judicial Watch has been forced to file more than 2,500 Freedom of Information (FOIA) requests and nearly 150 FOIA lawsuits in an effort to uncover the secrets guarded by Obama\u2019s Justice Department and other federal agency lawyers.\n\nOn March 18, 2014, we filed two new Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to obtain government records related to the implementation of Obamacare. The first suit seeks communications regarding the December 19, 2013, decision by the Obama administration to establish its broad new \u201chardship exemptions\u201d for consumers whose health insurance policies have been canceled. The second seeks records related to the security \u2013 or, rather, the insecurity \u2013 of the healthcare.gov web portal.\n\nOn December 19, when the Obama administration announced it would grant massive \u201chardship exemptions\u201d to millions of Americans to allow them to avoid paying tax penalties for failing to comply with the individual mandate, most observers agreed that the exemptions were the most significant change the Obama administration had yet made in the controversial government program. The changes granted broad exemptions to anyone who \u201cbelieves\u201d that Obamacare coverage options \u201care unaffordable,\u201d essentially opening the door to exemptions for almost anyone who doesn\u2019t like the law.\n\nOn March 12, the Daily Caller quoted Fox News\u2019 Charles Krauthammer as saying, \u201cIt\u2019s now been redefined so that all you have to do is to claim that going into the exchange would create a hardship. I mean, it\u2019s ironic. It makes Obamacare itself the hardship.\u201d And so, Judicial Watch wants to know what was behind the Obamacare illicit rewrite. So we filed a FOIA request the day after Obama announced he was ignoring his signature law.\n\nThe \u201chardship exemptions\u201d suit was filed after the Obama administration ignored a FOIA request that sought from HHS \u201cany and all records of communications including, but not limited to, electronic communications (e-mails), between any officer or employee of the Centers for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), and any other employee or officer of CMS, the Department of Health and Human Services, and/or the Executive Office of the President\u201d regarding the hardship exemption decision. A simple enough request. In short, we wanted to know exactly what prompted the Obama administration to once again ignore the law without even a tip of the hat to the U.S. Congress or the separation of powers. Was there a substantial discussion of the errancy of the individual mandate itself \u2013 or could it all have been politically motivated?\n\nThe Judicial Watch web portal security lawsuit was filed after the Obama administration ignored yet another FOIA request that sought from HHS \u201cAny and all records related to, regarding or in connection with the security of the healthcare.gov web portal including, but no limited to, studies, memoranda, correspondence, electronic communications (e-mails), and slide presentations from January 1, 2012 to the present.\u201d\n\nIn November 2013, at a House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology hearing, four top technology security experts testified that the Obama administration had failed to secure the Obamacare site before rushing to the marketplace. In a rapid-fire, yes-or-no inquiry, Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) asked the four experts, \u201cDo any of you think today that the site is secure?\u201d The answer was unanimously, \u201cNo.\u201d The experts agreed that the site needed to be completely rebuilt. And the Obama administration\u2019s deputy chief information officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Henry Chao, admitted under oath that more than half of the Obamacare website\u2019s back-end computer processing systems were still unfinished when the site was launched.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Tom Fitton", "description": "We're all strapped to the mast of the ACA.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Barack Obama\u2019s legacy legislation, the Affordable Healthcare Act (ACA) \u2013 commonly known as \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 has clearly become the political equivalent of the wreck of the Hesperus.
