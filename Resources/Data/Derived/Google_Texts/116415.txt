Someone dropped the ball again when an unknown man posing as Rep. Donald Payne Jr. made it backstage to an Obama event. This guy, who was an imposter claiming to be the Congressman, made it to the backstage area as other members of the congress were in a group getting ready to get their picture taken with the president, according to NJ.com on Oct. 3.

This wasnâ€™t dangerous enough, but when an official in the crowd recognized that this imposter was not Rep. Payne, he was asked to leave the event and he made his exit without incident. The man was let go and not even detained for questioning!

No one knows who the imposter was or why he was mingling in a crowd with members of congress and President Obama. This breach came to light after two other security breaches were revealed this week, which led to the resignation of the head of the Secret Service, Julia Pierson, according to the Bloomberg Report.

This latest reveal of a breach occurred on Sept. 27 at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Awards dinner in Washington. The area that this imposter invaded was secured for the president. The other security breaches that were recently revealed started with the case of the man jumping the White House fence on Sept. 19 and making his way deep into the White House before he was contained.

The next incident to come to light happened just a few days before the fence jumper, when an ex-con carrying a gun rode an elevator with the president while he was in Atlanta. This is just not good when it comes to protecting the President of this nation and his family.

Even law enforcement officers are not allowed to carry a weapon while on an elevator with the president. This offers a complete opposite portrayal of the secret service from what you see in movies. These guys are trained to take a bullet for the president and have only one goal, which is to protect Obama and his family, but that's just in the movies apparently.
