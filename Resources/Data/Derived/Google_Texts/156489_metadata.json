He narrowly lost the race for Virginia governor to Democrat Terry McAuliffe in 2013 and has been considering another run for that office in 2017.\n\nCuccinelli praised Cruz as \u201csomeone who is committed to protecting life and family and their privacy in our society, who knows the judiciary. Senator Cruz clerked for Chief Justice Rehnquist, not Justice Kennedy, not Justice Ginsburg.\u201d\n\n[Ted Cruz to blitz across Super Tuesday states]\n\nCuccinelli told the crowd of about 1,000 that he had, for the first time in his life, made the maximum donation to a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cAnd many of you know how cheap I am,\u201d Cuccinelli said. \u201cThat hurts. I want you to give until it hurts.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli\u2019s nod came as the Texas senator appeared at a Friday afternoon rally at Life Church, a non-denominational congregation outside of Richmond Friday. The event had been scheduled for late morning but was pushed off for hours so that Cruz could be in Washington for a vote against a spending and tax deal.\n\nBefore addressing a crowd, Cruz met privately with reporters and blasted the deal, which cleared Congress with bipartisan support.\n\n\u201cI think this \u2026 was a betrayal of the men and women who elected us,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAll across this country, people are frustrated out of their minds. They\u2019re frustrated because we keep winning elections as conservatives and then Republican leaders keep advancing Barack Obama\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cThis is stunning. This is a trillion-dollar deal, thousands of pages, cut in the dark of night. It funds all of Obamacare, funds all the executive actions. It funds all of Planned Parenthood. It does nothing to stop this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. It does nothing to stop President Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s indefensible plan to bring tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to America even though the head of the FBI says they cannot vet those refugees to determine if they\u2019re ISIS terrorists.\u201d\n\nDespite the fiery rhetoric, he started his news conference off on a playful note. Sporting a plaid shirt, jeans and cowboy boots, Cruz strode into the room with a man dressed as Santa Claus.\n\n\u201cWe want to see which reporters have been naughty and which reporters have been nice,\u201d he said.\n\n[Congress passes budget deal and heads home for the year]\n\nOnce inside the cavernous church hall, Cruz repeatedly brought the crowd to its feet by criticizing the Washington establishment. They waved little American flags and at one point interrupted him with chants of, \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will repeal every word of Obamacare,\u201d Cruz said. He also called for abolishing the Internal Revenue Service and, in a tongue-in-cheek answer to rival Donald Trump\u2019s Mexican border wall, said he would post the thousands of displaced IRS workers on the border to frighten away any would-be illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cI traveled an hour and a half to get here and it was definitely worth the drive,\u201d said William Roberts, 25, a sheriff\u2019s deputy who lives inn Colonial Beach.\n\nAlso in the crowd was Ed Olive, 55, who works for Richmond\u2019s housing authority.\n\n\u201cI like his grassroots attitude ... and I like the fact that he\u2019s gone up against the big guns in D.C, and fight for what the American people believe in,\u201d he said.\n\nCuccinelli\u2019s endorsement came as a pleasant surprise to Olive, who would like to see the former attorney general run for governor again.\n\nCuccinelli said he will not make a decision about running until after the 2016 presidential race. So far, two Republicans have formally announced they are running to succeed term-limited Gov. Terry McAuliffe in 2017: political strategist Ed Gillespie and Rep. Rob Wittman.\n\nRep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), who became a hero to conservative Republicans by unseating then-majority leader Eric Cantor in a GOP primary in 2014, also attended but has not yet made any endorsements in the presidential race. But in a brief interview, Brat called Cruz \u201cphenomenal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cuccinelli, the GOP candidate for governor in 2013, is a favorite of Republican grass roots activists.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Cuccinelli, the GOP candidate for governor in 2013, is a favorite of Republican grass roots activists.", "title": "Virginia's former attorney general Cuccinelli endorses Ted Cruz", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginias-former-attorney-general-cuccinelli-endorses-ted-cruz/2015/12/18/9a195746-a5c7-11e5-ad3f-991ce3374e23_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/10/30/National-Politics/Advance/Images/Merlin_550916.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "ppinclude, virginia politics, va politics, cuccinelli, ted cruz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "9a195746-a5c7-11e5-ad3f-991ce3374e23", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "ppinclude, virginia politics, va politics, cuccinelli, ted cruz"}, "article_summary": "MECHANICSVILLE, Va. -- Former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli II endorsed GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz at an appearance outside Richmond on Friday.\nCuccinelli said he will not make a decision about running until after the 2016 presidential race.\nBefore addressing a crowd, Cruz met privately with reporters and blasted the deal, which cleared Congress with bipartisan support.\nThis is a trillion-dollar deal, thousands of pages, cut in the dark of night.\nCuccinelli praised Cruz as \u201csomeone who is committed to protecting life and family and their privacy in our society, who knows the judiciary."}
