The governor said he is disappointed in GOP lawmakers: "In doing this, I'm expressing the outrage that all of us should feel about the garbage the Republican legislative leaders have tried to dump on us."

The bill authorizes hundreds of millions less than what Wolf wanted for schools and social services.

In his statement, Wolf said, "I’m vetoing their plan to cut $95 million from schools and other items they don’t pay for."



Budget Secretary Randy Albright said that with $23.3 billion in total funding, schools will get 6-months of funding in this bill as "emergency funding."

The governor called for lawmakers to get back to Harrisburg to rework the plan: "This budget is wrong for Pennsylvania," Wolf said.

After a bipartisan budget compromise stalled last week, the Republican-controlled Senate sent the bill to Wolf in an effort to get money flowing to schools and social service agencies. It also lacks some supporting legislation and funding for state-related universities, including Penn State.

Today marks 182 days since the budget was due.
