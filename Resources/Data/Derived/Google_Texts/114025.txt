Police are investigating after a Denver-bound flight from Anchorage, Alaska, was diverted to Vancouver International Airport on Saturday, officials said.

The Richmond Royal Canadian Mounted Police have a suspect in custody from United Airlines Flight 1104, they tweeted at 9:12 a.m.

A “security concern” caused the flight crew to divert the plane, according to United Airlines spokesman Charles Hobart.

“We are cooperating with the authorities and working to rebook our customers on an alternate flight,” Hobart said.

Witnesses told Denver7 that the suspect was a 70-year-old man who was laughing a lot over nothing and trying to pull out the monitor in front of him.

The Boeing 737 had 131 customers and six crew members on board, Hobart said.

The Vancouver airport’s operations were not affected, police said.
