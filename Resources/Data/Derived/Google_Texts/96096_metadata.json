But so far provider-sponsored health plans have had at most \u201ca mild\u201d impact on their parent organizations\u2019 credit ratings, Arrick said. Of the 16 largest provider-sponsored plans rated by S&P, only two have ratings in the B category, Boston Medical Center (BBB) and Temple University Health System (BB+). The nation\u2019s second largest health system-owned plan by membership, UPMC, is rated at A+, Baylor Scott & White at AA-, Presbyterian Health System at AA and Spectrum Health System at AA.\n\nThese two charts offer a state of some large health system-owned health plans. One shows membership across commercial, Medicaid and Medicaid plans; another shows risk-based capital actuarial control level, a proportion that correlates the plan\u2019s risk with its capital reserve needs.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/see-how-largest-provider-sponsored-health-plans-are-performing", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/health-insurance-folder-feature.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Health system-run plans grab more members, affect credit ratings, S&P says.", "title": "See how the largest provider-sponsored health plans are performing"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/health-insurance-folder-feature.png"}, "description": "Health system-run plans grab more members, affect credit ratings, S&P says.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "See how the largest provider-sponsored health plans are performing"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "As more health systems take on financial risk, frustration over major private payers refusing to give up their key value-added business roles is leading many providers are creating their own health plans in tandem with accountable and integrated care projects, according to a new report by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s analyst Martin Arrick.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10b0\"", "article_summary": "The nation\u2019s second largest health system-owned plan by membership, UPMC, is rated at A+, Baylor Scott & White at AA-, Presbyterian Health System at AA and Spectrum Health System at AA.\nThese two charts offer a state of some large health system-owned health plans.\nBut so far provider-sponsored health plans have had at most \u201ca mild\u201d impact on their parent organizations\u2019 credit ratings, Arrick said.\nOf the 16 largest provider-sponsored plans rated by S&P, only two have ratings in the B category, Boston Medical Center (BBB) and Temple University Health System (BB+).\nHealth system-run plans grab more members, push up credit ratings, S&P says."}
