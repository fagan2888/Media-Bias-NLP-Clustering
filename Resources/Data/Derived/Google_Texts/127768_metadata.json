You can watch the exchange and read the transcript below (starts at 2:36):\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: He\u2019s also circulating that clip of you on Tim Russert in 1999, where you said, \u201cI lived in New York City, in Manhattan, all my life, OK? So, you know my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa.\u201d So those were your words.\n\nTRUMP: Yes, a long time ago. And, just so you understand, he\u2019s taking money from people that are very much into the whole gay marriage situation and he\u2019s taking money from them and he\u2019s, you know, raising funds from them. Then he got caught the other day on a tape when he was raising funds at a law office, talking about things that are priorities and not priorities. This was not a priority.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So you\u2019re saying he\u2019s a hypocrite?\n\nTRUMP: Oh, he\u2019s a total hypocrite.\n\nHow about his fundraising and how about when he does his personal financial disclosure form and he doesn\u2019t put on that he\u2019s borrowing money from Goldman Sachs and then today it comes out that he\u2019s also borrowing money from Citibank and he doesn\u2019t list it. You know why? He wants to look like Robin Hood, that he is the one protecting the people from the banks. Well, he\u2019s actually borrowing money and personally guaranteeing it and not disclosing it, which is illegal.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But how about you? Those were your words. You were talking about, in that interview, issues like gay marriage, talking about how you were strongly pro-choice. And as your comparison of New York values and Iowa views. And it\u2019s led a lot of conservatives to think boy, maybe he\u2019s going to switch again. He\u2019s not going to be (INAUDIBLE)\u2026\n\nTRUMP: See, it doesn\u2019t matter what they think. It doesn\u2019t matter. They understand me. They understand trade. I don\u2019t consider myself to be anything, you know, when they ask labels. We\u2019re talking about labels. I consider myself to be, right now, somebody that\u2026\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So you\u2019re not a conservative?\n\nTRUMP: No, I\u2019m conservative, but when it comes to different elements of what I believe in, that\u2019s what people really understand. I\u2019m going to solve our trade problem. I\u2019m going to solve our military problem. I\u2019m going to get rid of ISIS. I\u2019m going to create borders. I\u2019m going to do the things that this is what they want.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But they are \u2014 they\u2019re afraid you\u2019re going to abandon conservative issues if you get the nomination.\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t think too many people are afraid of that, OK, because if you look at the polls, I\u2019m leading Ted Cruz by a lot. He even lied about that. You know, he got up and said, well, the polls \u2014 well, the polls are showing that I\u2019m the one that\u2019s on the up swing. He\u2019s the one on the down swing, a big down swing. But when you look at what he said and when you look at the way he said it and the scorn toward New York, I thought it was a disgrace, in light of the World Trade Center, in light of all the people that died. And think about the firemen \u2014 the firemen that went up those buildings and they were killed instantaneously. And they probably pretty much knew those buildings were coming down and they\u2019re going up to save lives. And, by the way, speaking of Iowa, which I love, and I\u2019m leading in the polls right now in Iowa, by the way, but I love \u2014 we had firemen from Iowa which was so beautiful, and other places, many other places, coming to the World Trade Center to help. You had people from Iowa, and in particular, the fire department, coming all the way from Iowa to help with the World Trade Center. And here\u2019s Ted Cruz putting down that and the great, you know, the great\u2026\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, he didn\u2019t put that down.\n\nTRUMP: \u2014 people of New York. No, he\u2019s putting down the great people of New York. Hey, you\u2019ve been there. Who could have done \u2014 very few people could have done what New Yorkers did under that unbelievable circumstance.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let\u2019s talk about some of the issues. Judges. What kind of judges will you appoint? Will they be conservative? What does that mean to you and how will you ensure it?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, we have a lot of judges that have to be appointed because we have a lot of openings in terms of judges. And I\u2019m very happy about that, to be honest, because I think, you know, appointing judges is a very important and a very, frankly, a very, very important element of what we\u2019re doing.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But Ted Cruz says he\u2019s going to appoint rock rib conservatives with a paper trail. What are you going to do?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I\u2019m going to appoint conservative judges. I\u2019m going to appoint people that have great reputations, that are great with the legal profession\u2026\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Like?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I can say like any \u2014 you know a judge who is a totally underrated and not spoken is Justice Thomas. I mean, if you look at \u2014 if you look at some of the judges that we have like on the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts turned out to be a nightmare for conservatives. I mean\u2026\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But how are you going to\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Wait, let me first say. Ted Cruz, was the one that really wanted Justice Roberts to go on the Supreme Court. You know that, right? Have you heard that? Let me just say, he was pushing him hard. Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare. Obamacare would have been terminated twice if it weren\u2019t for Justice Roberts. First time, 100 percent, second time 90 percent it would have died of its own weight. But Justice Roberts could have killed Obamacare, and should have, based on everything. Should have killed it twice. Ted Cruz is the one that was promoting him. Ted Cruz and also Jeb Bush. But Justice Roberts was the man that gave us \u2014 and remember it \u2014 he gave us Obamacare almost as much as Obama himself.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Pulse 2016", "description": "Over the weekend, Donald Trump appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d where he was challenged by host George Stephanopoulos to respond to charges from rival Ted Cruz and others that he would not be a conservative president.
