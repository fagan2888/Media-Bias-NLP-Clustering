In his remarks, the president made clear he is not only unrepentant about his use of executive orders \u2013 he\u2019s prepared to keep moving in the same direction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let gridlock, and inaction, and willful indifference, and greed, threaten the hard work of families like yours,\u201d the president told a supportive crowd on the shore of Lake Harriet in Minneapolis. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to wait for Congress right now. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going ahead and moving without them wherever I can.\u201d\n\nRattling off a series of executive orders, including an increase in the minimum wage for federal contractors, a cap on student loan payments, and more, he contrasted the White House\u2019s action with the relative inaction of the legislative branch.\n\nRelated: Boehner v. Obama Case Might Never Get to Court\n\n\u201cNow Republicans are mad at me for taking these actions. They\u2019re not doing anything, and then they\u2019re mad that I\u2019m doing something,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure which of the things I\u2019ve done they find the most offensive, but they\u2019ve decided they\u2019re going to sue me for doing my job.\u201d\n\nHe drew laughter from the crowd with his next line: \u201cI mean, I might have said in the heat of the moment during one of these debates, I want to raise the minimum wage, so sue me when I do. But I didn\u2019t think they were going to take it literally.\u201d\n\nOf course, the Republicans would argue that they are not looking to sue Obama for \u201cdoing his job,\u201d but rather for going beyond his executive authority and cutting Congress out of its rightful role on oversight and policymaking.\n\nThe president\u2019s argument that Congress has essentially abdicated its role in the creation of public policy is a compelling one, at least when he\u2019s giving a speech. But as the Supreme Court ruled Thursday, it\u2019s a stretch to claim that Congress\u2019s failure to act effectively grants the executive additional powers.\n\nBoehner\u2019s threat to drag the president into court has some serious hurdles to clear before it can be successful \u2013 but in a courtroom, the audience likely won\u2019t be as forgiving as Friday\u2019s crowd in Minneapolis.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Barely 24 hours after the Supreme Court ruled that some of his recess appointments had violated the Constitution, President Obama mocked congressional threats to take him to court over executive actions.", "title": "Obama Mocks Congress One Day After SCOTUS Rebuke", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/27/Obama-Mocks-Congress-One-Day-After-SCOTUS-Rebuke", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/0632011obama_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/27/Obama-Mocks-Congress-One-Day-After-SCOTUS-Rebuke", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/0632011obama_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Barely 24 hours after the Supreme Court ruled that some of his recess appointments had violated the Constitution, President Obama mocked congressional threats to take him to court over executive actions.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "They\u2019re not doing anything, and then they\u2019re mad that I\u2019m doing something,\u201d Obama said.\nHe even took a moment to indirectly mock House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), who this week threatened to sue Obama over his use of executive orders to enact policy changes.\nBut as the Supreme Court ruled Thursday, it\u2019s a stretch to claim that Congress\u2019s failure to act effectively grants the executive additional powers.\nIn a combative speech Friday morning, President Obama made clear that a rebuke from the Supreme Court this week was not going to stop him from trying to work around a gridlocked Congress as he tries to implement his agenda.\nRelated: Boehner v.
