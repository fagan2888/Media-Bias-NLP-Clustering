Our \u2018three branches of government\u2019 have coalesced into a Politburo, yet many, well-meaning people stubbornly believe the GOP will save us from the big bad Democrats. Just how stubborn and stupid can people be? Who is going to protect us from the big bad GOP backstablishment?\n\nThe master manipulators have honed their devilish skills and attacks over many decades, while patriots and people of faith have been blissfully, almost willfully, ignorant of what has been happening behind closed doors, both within the U. S. and beyond our borders. We continue to hear the \u2018Democrat equals bad, Republican equals good\u2019 and/or \u2018Republican equals a conservative\u2019 refrains from the \u2018conservative\u2019 voices, yet these voices are livid at what the Republicans are doing.\n\nAs per Wikipedia, the term, \u2018False Flag\u2019, describes covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them. It is a fact that the Democrats supplied all of the votes to ram through this unconstitutional legislation, but was this \u2018by design\u2019, to maintain the divisive \u2018Democrat vs. Republican\u2019 paradigm?\n\nWith the defection of Reverend Franklin Graham from the Gutless Opposition Party (GOP) following the latest, traitorous actions by the GOP backstablishment, in ramming through ESSA and the omnibus bill, maybe it is time to posit a thought that has been ruminating for quite some time. Most likely, this will never be discussed seriously, and without prejudice, within the mega propaganda machine, but with the continual betrayal by the GOP backstablishment, the question begs to be asked, \u2018Was the ObamaCare vote a false flag\u2019?\n\nEven with all of the backstabbing actions of those atop the GOP, we are constantly told that as bad as the Republicans are, they are better than the Democrats. We\u2019ve been inculcated into believing that with just a few more Republicans replacing Democrats, we will be saved! Really? How\u2019s that been working since the historic midterm elections of 2010 and 2014? As a friend of mine might say, \u2018If you believe this, I\u2019ve got some oceanfront property in Kansas I\u2019d like to sell you\u2019!\n\nRegarding ObamaCare, we are constantly \u2018reminded\u2019 that this purposely destructive legislation was rammed through without one Republican vote. While this is true, how did it come to a vote in the first place? Didn\u2019t Olympia Snowe [R] vote to advance the draft bill out of the House Finance Committee? Any thinking person had to have known that a key to forcing this unwanted legislation upon us was to get it out of committee so that the Congressional manipulators could devise a plan to push the puppet president\u2019s fundamental transformation of our healthcare system through both houses of Congress.\n\nWhen there was an opening to shut down ObamaCare, who was it who saved it? Didn\u2019t Chief Justice Roberts connive to rule ObamaCare to be constitutional, not just once, but twice? Who nominated Roberts to be Chief Justice? Wasn\u2019t it puppet GWB? How much more of this form of conservatism can we withstand?\n\nAlso, while Republicans questioned the numerous voting districts that voted 100% (or more) for the puppet president in the 2012 General Election, they continue to brag about the 100% vote against ObamaCare by Republicans in the House and the Senate. I\u2019m not a statistician, but what are the odds that all Republicans in both the House and Senate would vote against ObamaCare, unless they were instructed to do so by the backstablishment leadership?\n\nCan\u2019t you hear the howls by those who actually believe there is a fundamental difference between the two political parties? There may have been a fundamental difference between the two political parties in days of yore, but that is history that will never be taught under Common (Conformity) Core. These same loyalists actually believe that the Republicans fought mightily to prevent the passage of ObamaCare (the Patient Abandonment and Un-Affordable Care Attack). If this is so, why did Fuhrer Boehner and Zipper-Lip McConnell abandon the fight against ObamaCare? Why did both of them use almost identical comments about ObamaCare being \u2018the law of the land\u2019? Why did they ram through votes that fully funded ObamaCare, amnesty, etc., during the lame duck session following the 2014 midterm election? Why did Mick Mobster Ryan take the baton from Boehner in joining McConnell in leading the charge to ram through the ominous omnibus bill?\n\nThe puppet president is on record for lying about ObamaCare. Many people have not able to keep their insurance and/or their doctor, even though he repeatedly stated they would be able to do so, prior to the passage of ObamaCare. The promised reduction in premiums by up to $2,500.00 has given way to spiraling increases in premiums. After ObamaCare was rammed through, weren\u2019t we told by the architect of ObamaCare that we were lied to, purposely, because the electorate is comprised of morons and to ensure that the unconstitutional legislation became law? But are the puppet president and his cabal the only liars regarding ObamaCare?\n\nDidn\u2019t Republicans promise that they would do everything possible to overturn and eliminate ObamaCare and amnesty, once in office and in the majority, not just stage meaningless show votes to string along the party lemmings? Didn\u2019t voters respond dramatically, especially during the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, to send reformers to Congress? So, why did the Republicans in the House, who control the power of the purse, sycophantically vote with Mick Mobster Ryan to fully fund the massive attacks upon the U. S. citizen/taxpayer embedded within the omnibus bill? Isn\u2019t it obvious that the number one enemy of those in power within the District of Corruption isn\u2019t a politician in the \u2018other\u2019 party, but that it is anyone who seeks to implement genuine reform, as demanded by an increasingly defenseless electorate? Regardless of the motivations of those within each party, isn\u2019t a lie a lie?\n\nIsn\u2019t it time to break out of the propaganda programmed Republican paradigm to realize just how dangerous the GOP backstablishment is? Aren\u2019t the members of the backstablishment nothing but puppets, too? Aren\u2019t the most dangerous citizens those who can think for themselves? Why do you think the passage of ESSA was so urgent and bipartisan? The more generations of students who are indoctrinated into the anti-God, anti-traditional family, anti-Constitution and Bill of Rights, and anti-U. S. agenda, the easier it is to retain power and amass considerable wealth!\n\nWith the continued deployment of ObamaCare, Common Core, the theft of local control of schools (through strings attached via taxpayer money), amnesty and sanctuary cities, and the entire U. N. Agenda 21 under GOP-led government at all levels of government, have the GOP gains proven to be beneficial at any level of government? Besides, with the continual implementation of regionalism embedded within U. N. Agenda 21 at all levels of government, many of the historic GOP gains at the city, county and state levels of government may become null and void.\n\nIsn\u2019t it time for people to begin thinking for themselves? Why pay any respect to any politician or members of the propaganda machine when they refuse to respect us and have been the instruments of our demise? Isn\u2019t it apparent that there are people outside of the \u2018limelight\u2019 who are pulling the strings of the political and propaganda puppets?\n\nFor those who seek a return to our constitutional form of government, founded upon Judeo-Christian principles, what we lack in money and power we make up in numbers and a faith in God. Do you believe in miracles? It will take a series of miracles to overcome the Satanic agenda being pushed upon us. As we head into the New Year, why not include within your resolutions a commitment to work against the destruction being pushed upon us by those atop both political parties and the propaganda machine? Become a profiler, recognizing the false flags that have become almost daily events to distract us from the attacks of the master manipulators. Once we get into the heads of those seeking our destruction, we can begin to push back. Let the fireworks of New Year\u2019s ignite an energy to defeat every member of the GOP backstablishment up for reelection in the primaries and use this momentum to win in the General Elections!", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Was the ObamaCare Vote a False Flag, GOP backstablishment, Gutless Opposition Party", "og": {"description": "Was the ObamaCare Vote a False Flag, GOP backstablishment, Gutless Opposition Party", "title": "Was the ObamaCare Vote a False Flag?"}, "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "7 days", "keywords": "Was the ObamaCare Vote a False Flag, GOP backstablishment, Gutless Opposition Party", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Regarding ObamaCare, we are constantly \u2018reminded\u2019 that this purposely destructive legislation was rammed through without one Republican vote.\nMost likely, this will never be discussed seriously, and without prejudice, within the mega propaganda machine, but with the continual betrayal by the GOP backstablishment, the question begs to be asked, \u2018Was the ObamaCare vote a false flag\u2019?\nWho is going to protect us from the big bad GOP backstablishment?\nIsn\u2019t it time to break out of the propaganda programmed Republican paradigm to realize just how dangerous the GOP backstablishment is?\nThese same loyalists actually believe that the Republicans fought mightily to prevent the passage of ObamaCare (the Patient Abandonment and Un-Affordable Care Attack)."}
