How many new drugs? How many new treatments and procedures might have been developed by now? Would opioids still be one of the first weapons doctors arm their patients with? Would they still be telling patients, \u201cYou just need to learn to live with it.\u201d\n\nI often hear this from many in the pain community: \u201cMy doctor will not continue giving me the narcotic he has had me on for years. He no longer commiserates with me and says he will do all he can to help. Now he says \u2018Sorry, I have decided to no longer write those prescriptions.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe patient looks at him, beseechingly. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?

Nothing else I can do for you.\u201d\n\nMany of us know the next step personally. We call other physicians\u2019 offices. \u201cAre you accepting new patients?\u201d Too often the answer is no.\n\nIf they say yes and you add, \u201cI am looking for a doctor to prescribe medication for my chronic pain,\u201d the door is slammed shut in our ear. \u201cWe do not take patients who want narcotics.\u201d\n\nNow we are seen as a drug seeker.

And a patient saying upfront what they feel they need is not a sign they are fakers, drug seekers or malingerers.\n\nI get it.

But it is way past time to see action on the ACA's call to arms against chronic pain.\n\nAs it now stands, many in Congress want to become the third person in the consulting room, trying to proscribe what doctors prescribe if it is in the form of an opioid.\n\nResearch and development of new treatments -- including non-opioid drugs -- is what we have needed and continue to need.
