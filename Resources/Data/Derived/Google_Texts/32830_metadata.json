From hammer-and-sickle signs at Tea Party rallies to the volumes of books about the president\u2019s \u201csecret agenda,\u201d conservatives have been sneered and jeered at by the left for this bold assertion from its most reactionary members. But, is it true?\n\nFrom a definitional standpoint, it\u2019s not even close. Socialism is \u201ca way of organizing a society in which major industries are owned and controlled by the government rather than by individual people and companies,\u201d according to Merriam-Webster. Obama\u2019s policies don\u2019t fit the glove.\n\nCertainly, one could argue that the President\u2019s large-scale government takeover of the healthcare industry through the Affordable Care Act is de facto socialism, but the means of production still belong to individuals through private hospitals, practices, and insurance agencies. While the ACA certainly expanded entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, the federal government has played a significant role in the healthcare industry for decades, even throughout Republican presidencies.\n\nAdvocates of limited government do themselves a disservice by pinning a label on the president that he does not deserve. Their time would be much better spent studying the more subtle, and arguably more scary philosophy that the president explicitly subscribes to, one that is evident in his policies \u2014 progressivism.\n\nPresident Obama has identified himself as a progressive on several occasions, as Democrats.com proudly point out. \u201cI am someone who is no doubt progressive,\u201d candidate Obama once proudly proclaimed on the 2008 campaign trail in attempt to combat claims that he was moving to the center. However, the progressive label has been used and abused by many pundits and politicians. So, what exactly does it mean?\n\nProgressivism\u2019s roots can be traced back to the Age of Enlightenment, when philosophers like Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel described history as humanity\u2019s development from barbarism to civilization. However, progressivism did not firmly take root in the United States until about a century later, when American Presidents like Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt started using the label.\n\nWilson in particular contributed volumes of work outlining his vision of a progressive government as a Princeton professor. His 1886 essay, \u201cThe Study of Administration\u201d provides rare insight into the mindset of a progressive leader, reading almost as if it was written by President Obama more than a century later:\n\nIn government, as in virtue, the hardest of things is to make progress. Formerly the reason for this was that the single person who was sovereign was generally either selfish, ignorant, timid, or a fool, \u2014 albeit there was now and again one who was wise. Nowadays the reason is that the many, the people, who are sovereign have no single ear which one can approach, and are selfish, ignorant, timid, stubborn, or foolish with the selfishness, the ignorances, the stubbornness, the timidities, or the follies of several thousand persons, \u2014 albeit there are hundreds who are wise.\n\nIn this passage, Wilson strips the progressive viewpoint down to its fundamental elements. Government does not function merely as an entity to protect individual rights, but rather to \u201cmake progress.\u201d The biggest obstacle to society\u2019s progress, ironically, is society itself \u2014 \u201cthe mean, the people\u201d who are \u201cselfish, ignorant, timid, stubborn or foolish.\u201d From this outlook, it is only logical to conclude that the few \u201cwho are wise\u201d have the responsibility to push society\u2019s progress forward using the government as a vehicle whether they like it or not.\n\nIndeed, Wilson is quite explicit about this duty later on in the essay, writing that the executive \u201cmust persuade [the people] to want the particular change he wants.\u201d This progressive modus operandi of leadership is as alive today in the Obama administration as it was when Wilson first penned it.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Casey Given", "description": "Progressives are bad enough.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "It\u2019s a claim that\u2019s the right\u2019s all too famous for: President Obama is a socialist.
