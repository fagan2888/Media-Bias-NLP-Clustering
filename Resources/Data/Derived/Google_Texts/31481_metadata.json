The good professor, you might recall, is an MIT economist who played a significant (and paid) role in producing and defending the Affordable Care Act. He also later admitted, in an astonishing variety of settings, that the law was written in a \u201ctortured way\u201d to hide tax increases and other flaws. \u201cLack of transparency,\u201d he cheerfully conceded, \u201cis a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.\u201d\n\nAt the hearing, some Republicans seemed oddly focused on Gruber\u2019s profit motive, as though a real scandal must involve venality. Democrats attempted to salvage the credibility of Obamacare by throwing the witness to the wolves. Rep. Elijah Cummings declared Gruber\u2019s past statements \u201cdisrespectful,\u201d \u201cinsulting, \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cabsolutely stupid.\u201d\n\nBut the problem for Democrats is that Gruber is not stupid. By all accounts, he is knowledgeable, candid and willing, on occasion, to criticize the Obama administration \u2014 an advocate for Obamacare without being a shill. But he is perfectly representative of a certain approach to politics that is common in academic circles, influential in modern liberalism and destructive to the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cMy own inexcusable arrogance,\u201d Gruber told the committee, \u201cis not a flaw in the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Oh, yes it is.\n\nMany academic liberals have fully internalized the \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter with Kansas?\u201d theory, given vivid expression by Thomas Frank. In its simplified version (and there is seldom any other kind), this is the argument that people who are suffering from economic inequality should naturally vote Democratic. But they often get distracted by the shiny objects of the culture war and tricked into resentment against liberal elites.\n\nIt\u2019s a very short step from this belief to its more muscular corollary: Liberal elites (through liberal politicians) should constructively mislead Americans. The task of persuasion is pretty nigh hopeless, given the unfortunate \u201cstupidity of the American voter or whatever.\u201d So the people must be given what they need, even if they don\u2019t want it.\n\nThis involves a very high regard for policy experts and a very low opinion of the political profession. Gruber clearly views his own world of policy as a place of idealism and integrity. Politics, in contrast, is a realm where \u201clack of transparency\u201d and \u201cmislabeling\u201d are sad necessities to persuade low-information voters to pursue their own interests. Purposely employing such tactics in an academic paper, for example, would be a scandal (and presumably a firing offense) at Gruber\u2019s Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But liberal academics expect politicians to have greater cunning and lower standards. In fact, academics depend upon the rougher talents of politicians to turn their ideas into reality.\n\nPolitics, in this view, is the grubby business of winning in order to put the proper technocrats in charge of large, complex systems. This assumes that academic and bureaucratic elites know how to run the world. It also relegates politicians to the job of doing their blocking and tackling, even if involves deception. The moral goal justifies it all. \u201cLook,\u201d said Gruber, \u201cI wish . . . we could make it all transparent, but I\u2019d rather have this law than not.\u201d\n\nThis reflects a deeper tension within progressivism \u2014 working itself out for more than a century \u2014 between a belief in democracy and a faith in expertise. Progressives originally assumed the people would choose to be ruled by experts \u2014 that more direct democracy would lead to more professional administration. But that now seems politically naive. So progressive elites are left believing that the people are stupid and must be managed, like everything else, in the public interest.\n\nThe success of this kind of progressivism depends on not being too obvious about it. Which is where Obamacare has utterly failed. With its self-evidently false promises \u2014 you can keep your current health-care plan \u2014 and its public displays of incompetence, the system has become a symbol of progressive arrogance. This perception has helped spark a massive, sustained populist reaction, contributing to dramatic GOP gains in Congress and state legislatures.\n\nThis does not mean that Obamacare will be easily undone. But it does provide conservatives an opportunity to present a different, more idealistic vision of government: one that enables and empowers, not misleads and controls.\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Michael Gerson, jonathan gruber, gruber obamacare, gruber affordable care act, gruber commings, gruber issa", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A candid Jonathan Gruber reveals the belief that Americans are stupid and must be managed.", "title": "Jonathan Gruber reveals the arrogance of liberals", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-gruber-reveals-the-arrogance-of-liberals/2014/12/11/1464877e-8165-11e4-8882-03cf08410beb_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/12/11/Editorial-Opinion/Images/205733982-3029.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mjgerson"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-gruber-reveals-the-arrogance-of-liberals/2014/12/11/1464877e-8165-11e4-8882-03cf08410beb_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Michael Gerson, jonathan gruber, gruber obamacare, gruber affordable care act, gruber commings, gruber issa", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "1464877e-8165-11e4-8882-03cf08410beb", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "A candid Jonathan Gruber reveals the belief that Americans are stupid and must be managed."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda306\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s a very short step from this belief to its more muscular corollary: Liberal elites (through liberal politicians) should constructively mislead Americans.\nBut they often get distracted by the shiny objects of the culture war and tricked into resentment against liberal elites.\nJonathan Gruber \u2014 the source of more smoking guns than the battle of Gettysburg \u2014 recently appeared before a hostile House committee.\n\u201cMy own inexcusable arrogance,\u201d Gruber told the committee, \u201cis not a flaw in the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Oh, yes it is.\nRep.
