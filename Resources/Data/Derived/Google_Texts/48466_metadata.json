It\u2019s a fascinating story.\n\nBut why did Montgomery Ward ultimately disappear from the scene? It wasn\u2019t the wartime obstructionism; it was bad macroeconomics. As the Times report on the final demise put it,\n\nRetail historians date the start of [Montgomery Ward\u2019s] decline to the postwar boom of the 1950\u2019s, when its rival, Sears, Roebuck & Company, moved aggressively into the then nascent suburbs, while Ward, under the steely leadership of its then chief executive, Sewell Avery, hoarded cash and waited for a second Great Depression.\n\nOr to put it a bit differently, Avery was a firm believer in secular stagnation, and a firm disbeliever in the ability of policymakers to do anything about it.\n\nOne interesting point here is that in the 1950s right-wingers like Avery didn\u2019t necessarily believe that big government leads to hyperinflation; he seems to have believed that it would cause deflation instead.\n\nAnyway, an interesting tale. In many ways, the history of Montgomery Ward from the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries is the story of America.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141227085429, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 27, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/The Fall of Montgomery Ward ( 20141227 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Not wartime obstruction but bad macroeconomics.", "title": "The Fall of Montgomery Ward", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/27/the-fall-of-montgomery-ward/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003420146, "description": "Not wartime obstruction but bad macroeconomics.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 27, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1419688469, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-12-27T17:26:56-05:00"}, "utime": 20141227172656, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141227, "pdate": 20141227, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Not wartime obstruction but bad macroeconomics.", "title": "The Fall of Montgomery Ward", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/27/the-fall-of-montgomery-ward/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/27/the-fall-of-montgomery-ward/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Fall of Montgomery Ward", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd356\"", "article_summary": "In many ways, the history of Montgomery Ward from the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries is the story of America.\nanniversary of FDR\u2019s seizure of Montgomery Ward, the once-ubiquitous catalogue and retail operation whose chairman refused to comply with wartime labor agreements.\nBut why did Montgomery Ward ultimately disappear from the scene?\nBrad DeLong, who has been doing great World War II blogging, tells us that today is the 60th 70th [math is hard!]\nOr to put it a bit differently, Avery was a firm believer in secular stagnation, and a firm disbeliever in the ability of policymakers to do anything about it."}
