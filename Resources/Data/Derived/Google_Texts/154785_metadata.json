State government would be partially shut down if a new budget isn't passed by the end of June. It's also a relief to hospitals that were anticipating more extensive cuts.\n\nSenate President Andy Gardiner, an executive at an Orlando hospital, had pushed to help hospitals dealing with the loss of federal aid. He said that the agreement would allow the hospitals to transition as the low-income pool money is reduced.\n\n\"It's important though, that we provided some stability in the health care system for hospitals,\" Gardiner said.\n\nThe issue blew up the regular session because the Senate wanted to take federal money to expand Medicaid to roughly 800,000 Floridians, which would make hospitals less reliant on the federal funds because they'd have more paying patients.\n\nBut Gov. Rick Scott and Republican House leaders were adamant against taking any money tied to President Obama's health law.\n\nThe Senate compromise would have brought more federal money to Florida while allowing recipients to choose private insurance instead of a straight up Medicaid expansion, but the House voted it down last week during the special session.\n\nAs several hospital officials warned they would be forced to close or cut services without the funds, Scott has worked to show that hospitals are not in as bad of financial shape as they maintain. He even proposed a hospital profit-sharing plan.\n\nJackson Health System officials said the small cuts under the new deal would not noticeably affect services.\n\n\"This projected loss is much more manageable than a devastating cut of approximately $200 million that we anticipated just a few months ago,\" CEO Carlos Migoya said in a statement.\n\nThe Obama administration has tentatively said it would partially extend the hospital funds for two more years. The federal funding would be $600 million in the 2015-16 fiscal year \u2014 down from about a billion in the current fiscal year\u2014 and just over $300 million next year.\n\nThe administration says it's more effective to give consumers insurance than to pay hospitals for caring for the uninsured retroactively and will not give Florida any hospital funds to help folks who would be covered if the state had expanded Medicaid.\n\nThe disagreement about Medicaid expansion and how to fill the hole in Florida's budget got so tense that the House abruptly adjourned three days before the session was scheduled to end May 1.\n\nThe governor is also suing the Obama administration over the matter, accusing them of withholding the hospital funds because the state won't expand Medicaid.\n\nBudget negotiators plan to work over the weekend to resolve remaining differences in school spending and environmental programs.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Florida legislators racing against the clock on a new state budget struck a deal Friday on a $2 billion plan to steer money to more than 200 hospitals that", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/lawmakers-agree-lip-funding", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201412/Gardiner2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Florida legislators racing against the clock on a new state budget struck a deal Friday on a $2 billion plan to steer money to more than 200 hospitals that", "title": "Lawmakers Agree on LIP Funding"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Associated Press", "wordCount": 542, "dc": {"title": "Lawmakers Agree on LIP Funding"}, "nid": 10977, "datePublished": "2015-06-13", "story_id": 414194824, "keywords": "LIP funding, Low Income Pool, Florida Legislature 2015", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The Obama administration has tentatively said it would partially extend the hospital funds for two more years.\nThe deal removes a major obstacle to finalizing a new state budget.\nThe governor is also suing the Obama administration over the matter, accusing them of withholding the hospital funds because the state won't expand Medicaid.\nSenate President Andy Gardiner, an executive at an Orlando hospital, had pushed to help hospitals dealing with the loss of federal aid.\nState government would be partially shut down if a new budget isn't passed by the end of June."}
