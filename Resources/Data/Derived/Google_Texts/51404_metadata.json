In comparison, there is about one physician per 1,000 residents on average statewide.\n\nAccording to the Bee, there are 214 doctor deserts in California. About three-quarters of them are in rural areas of the state.\n\nIn such areas, patients often have to travel long distances to seek care.\n\nDoreen Bradshaw, executive director of the Health Alliance of Northern California, said, \"Patients have to travel quite a few hours just for basic services,\" adding, \"When that travel is difficult, sometimes they just don't go.\"\n\nSuch conditions also can make it difficult to recruit physicians in those areas, where doctors typically earn less money than their counterparts in major urban hospitals, the Bee reports.\n\nDean Germano, CEO of the Shasta Health Center in Redding, said the facility has had to turn away new adult Medi-Cal beneficiaries because of provider shortages.\n\nHe said, \"There's a lot more competition than there ever was before,\" adding, \"You combine that with all these new people with coverage and it\u2019s like the Wild West of medicine out here, in terms of recruitment.\"\n\nPotential Workarounds, Solutions\n\nTo work around such physicians shortages, some patients have started seeking care:\n\nAt mobile clinics; and\n\nAcross state lines.\n\nMeanwhile, providers have started testing new care delivery models, such as telehealth, as they work to recruit more physicians, the Bee reports (Caiola, Sacramento Bee, 11/23).", "article_metadata": {"description": "A significant increase in the number of beneficiaries enrolled in California's Medicaid program since 2014 has added pressure to the 214 areas in the state with physician shortages.
