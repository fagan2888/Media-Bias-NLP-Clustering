Clarence Mittleider introduced guest speaker Dan Kallender, of Wesley Acres Camp at Lake Ashtabula. The faith-based camp is located 17 miles north of Valley City and has been operating for 62 years. There are 700 to 800 kids who attend various camps throughout the year enjoying features such as the pool, zipline and ropes course. Kallender has been with Wesley Acres Camp for only a few months, but has been in youth ministry for more than 25 years. He hopes to help realize the potential of the camp in the coming years by doubling the number of campers. The camp partners with United Methodist Churches; however, various groups are represented throughout the year.

Throughout the month of June, the Kiwanis Club will be collecting its next 100 items in celebration of Kiwanis’ 100th anniversary. Members are collecting 100 games, toys and activities to be donated to the Jamestown Parks and Recreation for kids in the summer park program.

The 45 members of Jamestown Kiwanis meet each Monday at noon. They welcome new members. For more information, visit www.Facebook.com/JamestownKiwanis, email JamestownKiwanis@gmail.com, or call Katie Ryan-Anderson at 251-8888.
