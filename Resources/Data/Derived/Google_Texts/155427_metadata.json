But that\u2019s how cocky Priebus and the Republicans are, especially after their victory last week in the special congressional election in Florida.\n\nSo Democrats, you have two options: One, get destroyed in November (Think meat being tenderized with a hammer.) Or, two: Ask yourself what would Frank Underwood do, and then start doing that. And for those who have no idea who that is because you don\u2019t watch House of Cards, all I can say is: What\u2019s wrong with you people?! Underwood is like a Democratic version of Karl Rove, except Underwood is both more likeable and more lethal. Although I think Rove might agree with Underwood\u2019s philosophy: \u201cThe road to power is paved with hypocrisy, and casualties.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not saying that Democrats should follow Underwood\u2019s literal lead and (spoiler alert!) push a person in front of a train. But it\u2019s time to do things that would make Machiavelli proud\u2014and maybe even blush.\n\nFor starters, they must remember: \u201cIt\u2019s the turnout, stupid.\u201d If voter turnout this November is 40 percent or below, the Democrats will lose badly. We saw this in last week\u2019s special election where turnout was 39 percent and the Republicans won. But in 2012, turnout was 64 percent and Obama carried the district.\n\n\n\nIn the 2010 midterm election, turnout was 41 percent, well below 61 percent of the 2008 election that carried Obama into the White House. Consequently, Democrats lost six seats in the Senate and a whopping 63 in the House.\n\nThe same disastrous result befell George W. Bush in the 2006 midterm elections where the 40 percent turnout translated into Democrats taking control of both the House and Senate. In these elections, the people who voted wanted to send a message to the President that they didn\u2019t like what he was doing.\n\nBottom line: Democrats need to focus on inspiring the people who were part of Obama's winning coalitions in 2008 and 2012 to vote this November. Maybe take a page from Republicans who in 2004 were able to get gay marriage bans on the ballots in 11 States. This motivated conservatives to vote.\n\nDemocrats should champion ballot measures that will bring out their voting base, such as proposals to raise the minimum wage. In fact, minimum wage initiatives are on the ballot in a few Senate battleground states such as Arkansas and South Dakota.\n\n\n\nDemocrats should also consider pushing for ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana since House Republicans voted last week to demand that Obama crack down on States that have done so.\n\n\n\nAnother move Dems might consider is helping to elect the worst Republican candidate in the primary. We saw this in 2012 when Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill did her part to help Todd \u201clegitmate rape\u201d Akin secure the GOP nomination. Akin won the primary, which helped McCaskill win the general election. This move was quintessential Underwood. After all, he told us\u2014in his smarmy, southern lilt: \u201cFor those of us climbing to the top of the food chain, there can be no mercy. There is but one rule: hunt or be hunted.\u201d\n\nThere are a few Republicans in key Senate races that hold the promise of a Todd Akin. For example, Georgia\u2019s Rep. Paul Broun commented last week that he would only vote for laws that agree with the Bible, so get ready for legislation that mandates woman who aren\u2019t virgins on their wedding night be stoned to death.\n\nAnd in North Carolina you have two right wing GOP frontrunners: Thom Tillis who recently stated that the minimum wage should be eliminated and Greg Brannon who claimed that Planned Parenthood wants to not only abort fetuses, but also wants to kill newborns. (He claims it\u2019s a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d)\n\nWhile former Democratic Congressman Barney Frank feels House of Cards is \u201ccartoonish\u201d and doesn\u2019t represent what truly happens in Washington DC, he did advocate a few ideas for Democrats, the best being very Underwoodian in principle: scare people.\n\nA campaign bumper sticker he once had sums up this strategy: \u201cVote Democratic: We may not be perfect, but they are nuts.\u201d Frank also recommends that Democrats run ads highlighting the Senators who will be in control of the chamber if the GOP wins control, like global warming denier Sen. James Inhofe.\n\n\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

The person could claim they had a \u201ccome to Jesus moment,\u201d says the strategist, and now sees that Obamacare must go. This will undercut the GOP\u2019s main (read: only) issue for 2014.\n\nMore Dems suggested that their party use every federal agency to investigate the Koch brothers, a la Raymond Tusk\u2014a two-faced billionaire with ties to the president in the Netflix series\u2014while other lefties recommended enacting laws that would make it more difficult for older white people to vote like the Republicans have done with voter ID laws to disenfranchise minority voters.
