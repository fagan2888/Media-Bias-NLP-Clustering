Have fun proving it, or even finding out\n\nposted at 2:01 pm on October 15, 2013 by Ed Morrissey\n\nTwelve million Americans may or may not be exempt from ObamaCare. They may or may not have to prove it through the disastrous ObamaCare exchanges. Whether they are or not, the systems aren\u2019t ready to provide them a path to claim that exemption \u2014 and it may be weeks or months before the exempt can register.\n\nWelcome to IncompetentCare:\n\nThe health law\u2019s least popular component \u2014 the requirement to obtain insurance or face a tax penalty \u2014 also features a lengthy list of exceptions for people facing certain hardships like foreclosure, domestic violence or homelessness. Members of certain religious sects or Native American tribes also are exempt. But if the online system for getting into Obamacare coverage is rickety, the system for getting out of the mandate doesn\u2019t even exist yet. HHS says it will take another month at least for the administration to finalize the forms. The Obama administration estimates that as many as 12 million people will seek exemptions through the federal enrollment system. But if they try now through HealthCare.gov, a customer service representative will tell them that applications aren\u2019t available. To make it even more confusing, not everyone who is exempt from the mandate will have to prove it via the exchange. Millions of people will have straightforward income-related exemptions \u2014 for example, low-income people in states that aren\u2019t expanding Medicaid. Their exempt status will get wrapped into their annual tax filing. But for those who want to start the exemption process online \u2014 or who incorrectly think they have to purchase health insurance or be fined despite their personal circumstances \u2014 the lack of a pathway has been another example that critics cite about how the White House bungled the rollout.\n\nYes, this would seem to be a rather big problem, especially since the federal government will sic the IRS on the non-compliant. In fact, even HHS and the IRS aren\u2019t going to be terribly clear on who qualifies, as the complexity of the law and the exemptions make it a difficult point to discern. \u201cYou almost have to ask people a thousand questions,\u201d Piper tells Politico, which gives people a great insight into just how intrusive this new law will be. Let me put it this way \u2014 does your doctor have to ask you a thousand questions? Why should the government do so in order for you to access health care in the manner you prefer?\n\nMeanwhile, HHS ally Enroll America is trying to put a positive spin on the intrusive nature of the government-mandated health-insurance regime \u2026 by applying the Nancy Pelosi spin:\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that we encourage anyone who is uninsured to apply through the new marketplace, because you never know what kind of programs and help you might be eligible for until you apply,\u201d said Justin Nisly, spokesman for Enroll America, a group that backs the administration\u2019s health care drive.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the program until you enter the program! Yes, that sounds familiar, but not in a positive way. Unfortunately, consumers can\u2019t even get into the program at the moment, and it looks like it will take them a long, long time before they can find out whether they\u2019re allowed to opt out of it, too.\n\nSpeaking of complications and intrusiveness, the Wall Street Journal reports that the IRS alone will have 47 statutory provisions to enforce:\n\nSoftware glitches are no surprise with such a complex system. For example, signing up uses a Byzantine process to check if a family is entitled to a subsidy, requiring data from dozens of federal and state agencies using databases built on different technology platforms. These include Medicaid to determine eligibility, the Internal Revenue Service to determine insurance-premium subsidies based on income, and Homeland Security to confirm citizenship. To make sure the family isn\u2019t covered elsewhere, the sites have to retrieve data from the Veterans Health Administration, the Office of Personnel Management and state Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Programs. Assuming a family is cleared and purchases a plan, the information has to be handed off cleanly to an insurance company. The Government Accountability Office last year calculated that for the IRS alone, implementing ObamaCare would be a \u201cmassive undertaking that involves 47 different statutory provisions and extensive coordination.\u201d Among them: \u201cdisclosure of taxpayer information for determining subsidy eligibility,\u201d \u201cdrug manufacturer tax\u201d and \u201chigh-cost health plan tax.\u201d Senate staffers created a mind-boggling graphic showing ObamaCare\u2019s various agencies and regulators, which can be viewed athttp://1.usa.gov/acamess.\n\nIt\u2019s the Hotel California all over again.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cYou almost have to ask people a thousand questions.\u201d", "title": "Exempt from ObamaCare?
