Because most people use social media as a platform for presenting the most polished, curated versions of their lives, researchers have been slowly discovering how frequent social media use can negatively affect self-esteem.

It turns out that obsessively logging onto Facebook to hate-click through your high school nemesis’s vacation bikini pics might have more deleterious side effects than we thought, according to a recent study linking frequent Facebook use to eating disorders in college women (if this finding sounds familiar, that’s because it is—an American University study also concluded pretty much the same thing last year).

Published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders, the study asked 960 female college students to take a test assessing whether they had disordered eating habits. They were also asked how often they logged onto Facebook. The researchers found there was a small but positive correlation between women who spent more than 20 minutes on Facebook a day and disordered eating habits.

In the second part of the study, a random cross-section of participants was split up into two groups: those who were asked to surf Facebook as they normally would, and those who were asked to use Wikipedia to study the ocelot. Afterward, they were asked to take another survey of their eating and Facebook habits.
