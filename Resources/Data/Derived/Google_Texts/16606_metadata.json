But during the Legislative session 2015, a different substance could be taking center stage as a freshman state representative from Broward County takes on the feel-good herb called kratom.\n\nUnder a bill filed by Kristin Jacobs, kratom would become what\u2019s known as a \u201cSchedule 1\u201d controlled substance. That puts it in the same category as bath salts and other street drugs that have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use.\n\nFederal drug officials say that kratom acts like a stimulant at low doses. But at higher doses the substance has the exact opposite effect and acts like a sedative.\n\nKratom is sold at some South Florida cafes that serve kava, a beverage known for its calming effects.\n\nBut Jacobs calls kratom a \u201cbad-news drug\u201d similar to heroin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already banned in the (U.S.) military,\" says Jacobs. \"So the military didn\u2019t have any problems to say, \u2018This stuff is bad, it\u2019s addictive and we are not going to allow it.\u2019 So it is banned in our country already.\u201d\n\nBut some kratom supporters say the substance is no more addictive than a cup of coffee and can actually help some recovering addicts overcome withdrawal symptoms.\n\nLast fall, Jacobs tried \u2013 and failed -- to get a countywide ban on kratom during her final days as a Broward commissioner.\n\nJacobs says a Senate version of her bill has been submitted for drafting by a Panhandle lawmaker.\n\nChristine DiMattei is a reporter with WLRN in Miami.
