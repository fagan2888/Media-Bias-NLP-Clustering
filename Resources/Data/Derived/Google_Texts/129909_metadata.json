But whether that\u2019s good news or bad news depends on who you ask.\n\nDHHS Commissioner Mary Mayhew says the MaineCare program has been in a state of financial crisis for decades, but that could be changing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve moved from a a period of focusing on bailing out the boat to now charting a course,\u201d Mayhew said Monday.\n\nAcross the country, statistics show enrollment in Medicaid is increasing by an average of roughly 5%. Here in Maine, it\u2019s a different story, where MaineCare growth is almost nonexistent. Recent projections show the program will grow by less than two-tenths of one percent in State Fiscal Year 2014 and for 2015 those numbers could actually decrease slightly.\n\nMayhew says the lower enrollment and costs are a direct result of maine lawmakers\u2019 decision not to expand MaineCare under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t live in a world of unlimited resources financially. We have to manage this program based upon core priorities and a vision for the type of program we want,\u201d Mayhew said.\n\nMayhew and Governor LePage\u2019s Mainecare vision is a program that prioritizes care for the elderly and developmentally disabled. Mayhew says the flat-lining enrollment coupled with the repayment of a half-billion-dollars in MaineCare debt to maine hospitals in 2013 are driving forces in the state\u2019s credit rating being upgraded. That puts the state in position to get better rates on bonds to fund projects at Maine Maritime Academy, National Guard armories and highway and bridge construction.\n\nBut Democratic leaders, who lost a highly publicized battle to expand Medicaid in Maine, aren\u2019t entirely convinced. Assistant House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe says it\u2019s Augusta lawmakers, not the LePage administration, who deserve credit for the higher credit rating.\n\n\u201cWe sat at the table, we helped pay the hospitals back. We\u2019ve balanced budgets. We\u2019ve come up with good investments through bonds. We\u2019ve made smart investments here in the state of Maine. And we\u2019ve also tried to balance a governor who\u2019s irrational, erratic and volatile. Which also contributes to our bond rating as well,\u201d McCabe said.\n\nAs for the declining MaineCare numbers.\n\n\u201cI think anytime we can sort of slow the growth of MaineCare, if people are getting private insurance or if we\u2019re helping people receive access to see a family doctor that\u2019s a good thing. But if we\u2019re just kicking people off of MaineCare rolls who actually need the service, who are seeking service and just not paying the hospitals, that\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d\n\nMayhew also spoke about the termination of the state\u2019s contract with the Alexander Group. The Rhode Island based consulting firm was hired to analyze Maine\u2019s current welfare system and the potential impacts of expanding the MaineCare program under the Affordable Care Act. According to findings from the Alexander Group\u2019s report, MaineCare expansion would cost Maine more than $800 million over the next decade.\n\nLast month, it was revealed that parts of the report were plagiarized from other reports. Mayhew said the fact that parts of the report were found to be plagiarized that won\u2019t stop the department from using those findings to shape policy.\n\n\u201cWell I want to be clear, there is still value in the work and the report that they did, Mayhew said. \u201cThere was poor performance around attributing resources upon which their reports were based. But we still found tremendous value in the expansion report that they did. And the operational report they provided to help shape the direction for all of the welfare programs we still intend to continue to review and evaluate as it relates to changes in the department.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recently released data from the Department of Health and Human Services shows the number of people enrolling in MaineCare could be declining over the next", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "WABI TV5", "description": "Recently released data from the Department of Health and Human Services shows the number of people enrolling in MaineCare could be declining over the next", "title": "DHHS Commissioner: MaineCare Enrollment On The Decline | WABI TV5", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.wabi.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/061614News5-6MaryMayhew_thumb17.jpg?ad7567", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2014-06-16T22:13:49-04:00", "url": "http://wabi.tv/2014/06/16/dhhs-commissioner-mainecare-enrollment-decline/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "[jwplayer mediaid=\"131521\"]Recently released data from the Department of Health and Human Services shows the number of people enrolling in MaineCare could be declining over the next few years.
