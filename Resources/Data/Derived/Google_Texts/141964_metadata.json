When the Marine Corps announced two years ago that it would be the first military service to be audited by a Defense Department inspector general, they were touted as a stellar example to the other service branches\u2014none of which had ever completed an audit.\n\nNow, the validity of a \u201cclean\u201d financial audit of the Marine Corps\u2019 finances is being called into question again following the new Government Accountability Office study.\n\nThe Defense Department\u2019s inspector general, who oversaw the audit for fiscal 2012, \"did not perform sufficient procedures, under professional standards, and consequently did not obtain sufficient, appropriate\" evidence to \"support the audit opinion,\" according to GAO investigators.\n\nRelated: The Dirty Truth About the Marines\u2019 Clean Audit\n\nIn addition, the service\u2019s \u201cbudgetary activity\u201d wasn\u2019t thoroughly vetted by the Pentagon\u2019s internal watchdog, nor was the reliability of the information adequately questioned, the report states.\n\nThe findings are the latest setback for the Marine Corps audit. DOD\u2019s inspector general withdrew its unqualified opinion backing of the accounting exercise last March when the IG discovered transactions that were never included in the audit and never brought to the auditors\u2019 attention. Since 1997, the GAO has been required to audit the federal government\u2019s consolidated financial statements, but the watchdog agency has repeatedly said its reviews of the Pentagon are not based on accurate data.\n\nRelated: With $8.5 Trillion Unaccounted for, Why Should Congress Increase the Defense Budget?\n\nThat\u2019s particularly troubling for DOD, which accounts for more than half of the government\u2019s discretionary spending. In a choreographed bid to lower expectations, department officials have hinted to congressional lawmakers that the agency may not be able to meet a legally-mandated goal of being fully auditable by September 2017.\n\nA handful of senators reacted to the report\u2019s findings with increased disdain for the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cI often like to say that you can\u2019t manage what you can\u2019t measure; nowhere is that statement more true than at the Department of Defense, the largest federal agency,\u201d Sen. Tom Carper (DE), the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said in a statement.\n\nHe said the report is \u201cmore than just a disagreement among accountants; it raises questions about the Department\u2019s basic financial practices and whether the department is being held to the high standards that taxpayers deserve.\u201d\n\nRelated: Marine Corps Declares Its Problem-Plagued F-35 Ready for Combat\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee chair John McCain (R-AZ) called the GAO report \u201ctroubling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent billions of taxpayer dollars and decades implementing financial management improvement efforts across the Pentagon,\u201d he added. Yet many of the Defense Department\u2019s well-known and longstanding problems stretching back 25 years still remain. We need results from the Pentagon, not more \u2018lessons learned.\u2019\n\nWhy This Matters:\n\nCongressional Republicans are seeking additional funds to bolster the Pentagon\u2019s current $585 billion budget to fight ISIS. Sloppy financial management like the Marine Corps audit won\u2019t help them get more money.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Marines are good at many things, but they apparently fail at basic accounting acco", "title": "Marine Corps' Sloppy Accounting Could Make Congress Less Willing to Boost Defense Budget", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/05/Marine-Corps-Sloppy-Accounting-Could-Make-Congress-Less-Willing-Boost-Defense-Budget", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11102012_veterans_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/05/Marine-Corps-Sloppy-Accounting-Could-Make-Congress-Less-Willing-Boost-Defense-Budget", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11102012_veterans_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Marines are good at many things, but they apparently fail at basic accounting acco", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Sloppy financial management like the Marine Corps audit won\u2019t help them get more money.\nThe findings are the latest setback for the Marine Corps audit.\nNow, the validity of a \u201cclean\u201d financial audit of the Marine Corps\u2019 finances is being called into question again following the new Government Accountability Office study.\nThe Marines are good at many things, but they apparently fail at basic accounting according to a new report.\nRelated: With $8.5 Trillion Unaccounted for, Why Should Congress Increase the Defense Budget?"}
