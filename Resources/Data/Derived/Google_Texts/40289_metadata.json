Law enforcement officials say a fake passport used by one of the suicide bombers may mean he posed a Syrian refugee and entered France via Greece.\n\nRelated: Ted Cruz\u2019s Flawed Logic for Blocking Muslim Refugees\n\nRepublicans now want a moratorium on the Syrian asylum effort until they feel confident the administration has the right vetting and security procedures in place.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) echoed Ryan\u2019s complaints and cited a 2011 case in which an Iraqi refugee who settled in his home state was arrested for plotting a terror attack and then had his fingerprints traced back to an improvised explosive device in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe ability to vet people coming from that part of the world is really quite limited, and so that\u2019s why I, for one, don\u2019t feel particularly comforted by the assertion that our government can vet these refugees, which leads to what you\u2019re hearing from all the governors around the country,\u201d McConnell said during a Capitol Hill press conference.\n\nRelated: Christians Only? Debate Over Syrian Refugees Quickly Turns Toxic\n\nSince Monday almost 30 states, nearly all with Republican governors, have announced they won\u2019t accept Syrian refugees.\n\nMcConnell said \u201cthere\u2019s certainly a possibility\u201d of adding a measure on refugees to the spending package. \u201cThe speaker and I were talking about this yesterday. We\u2019re talking to the White House. We\u2019ll see what they\u2019re open to,\u201d he said.\n\nMcConnell also used the simmering crisis to rake Obama over the coals for not doing enough to eliminate ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to have refugees as long as Syria looks like it does,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we need is a strategy obviously to give the refugees an opportunity to stay in their own country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are staying mum until they receive a classified briefing Wednesday night about the Paris attacks.\n\n\u201cMy personal feeling is I\u2019m going to wait until tomorrow. I don\u2019t think at this stage we should be pausing until we get the facts,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (R-NV) said during a press conference.\n\nSen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), who is expected to replace Reid as leader in the next Congress, said \u201ca pause may be necessary.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), who has called on the administration to accept more Syrian refugees, told reporters he\u2019s \u201call for\u201d making changes to how the U.S. country accepts migrants, so long as any fixes are applied to applicants from around the globe, including adjustments to the visa waiver program, which allows some Europeans to travel to the U.S. without a visa.\n\nHe said half of the Syrians who have sought asylum in the U.S. have been turned down and noted that the roughly 2,000 refugees already in the country are just a drop in the bucket. The U.S. takes in 70,000 refugees annually, primarily from Burma, Iraq and Somalia.\n\nDurbin, a member of the powerful Senate appropriations committee, wouldn\u2019t speculate on Democratic reaction if a provision halting the program was stuck into the year-end funding bill.\n\nHowever, the second-ranking Senate Democrat did mock a plan by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a GOP presidential contender, to introduce legislation to prevent Syrian refugees from obtaining U.S. visas as \u201cscrewy.\u201d He also called an proposal from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to favor Christian refugees over Muslims an \u201coutrageous statement by a major American politician.\u201d\n\nThe White House seems to be spoiling for a fight on the issue.\n\n\"Mindful of the particular conditions of the Syria crisis, Syrian refugees go through additional forms of security screening,\" Amy Pope, deputy homeland security adviser at the White House National Security Council, wrote in a blog post.\n\n\u201cWe are going to do the right thing in the right way -- protecting the American people even as we provide refuge to some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people,\u201d she added.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Days after the massacre in Paris, the Republican-controlled Congress is uniting around", "title": "Congress Wants to Slam the Door on the Syrian Refugee Program", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Congress-Wants-Slam-Door-Syrian-Refugee-Program", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Congress-Wants-Slam-Door-Syrian-Refugee-Program", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Days after the massacre in Paris, the Republican-controlled Congress is uniting around", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Debate Over Syrian Refugees Quickly Turns ToxicSince Monday almost 30 states, nearly all with Republican governors, have announced they won\u2019t accept Syrian refugees.\nDays after the massacre in Paris, the Republican-controlled Congress is uniting around a strategy to freeze the resettlement program for Syrian refugees inside the United States.\nWe\u2019re talking to the White House.\n\"Mindful of the particular conditions of the Syria crisis, Syrian refugees go through additional forms of security screening,\" Amy Pope, deputy homeland security adviser at the White House National Security Council, wrote in a blog post.\nLaw enforcement officials say a fake passport used by one of the suicide bombers may mean he posed a Syrian refugee and entered France via Greece."}
