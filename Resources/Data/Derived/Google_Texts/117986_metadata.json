The group was brand new\u2014founded in February 2010\u2014and regulatory policy is \u201cesoteric,\u201d he said.\n\nBut six years later, Batkins, who remains in the post, tells Bloomberg BNA that the opportunities are ripe for new areas of research into this little-understood field.\n\nThe forum is led by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office. The forum states that it is an independent, nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization that aims to educate the public about the complex policy choices that face the country.\n\nThe forum, which has a center-right political philosophy, is affiliated with the American Action Network, which engages in direct legislative advocacy in support of the policy proposals discussed by the forum.\n\nDaily Data Collection\n\nIn thinking about how to set up his new job, Batkins said that the one idea he took from the National Taxpayers Union, a former employer, was that more data and a bigger picture are always better.\n\nHis first task was to go through the Federal Register and examine every single proposed and final regulation, and start tracking all of them, something he still does to this day.\n\n\u201cIt takes about an hour every day to narrow down this massive universe of regulation and focus it to a point that we hope can be easily digestible to the public,\u201d he said.\n\nFor example, a search of the Affordable Care Act in the Federal Register would result in 14,000 different hits, and far more on Google, Batkins said. But the link to the act on the AAF website comes up with just the 111 actual regulations that have some sort of quantified cost, benefit or paperwork figure associated with them, Batkins said.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nBatkins said back-filling the AAF database is a big goal. Also, getting a robust retrospective review component is important, he said.\n\nIn addition, the group is only a year or two out from determining the effect of some of the initial regulations issued during the first part of the Obama administration, Batkins said.\n\nHe said he would like to look back and study the effects of the first Dodd-Frank and Affordable Care Act rules.\n\n\u201cAnd I would like those to be more than just flashes in the dark in terms of our overall knowledge, and more frequent going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nClaims Versus Reality\n\nBatkins said he is far more focused now on what actually happened with existing regulations.\n\nThe AAF has a great data team that can go back and examine a lot of the claims that were made and compare them to reality, he said.\n\nFor example, the staff can use complex regression analysis to determine what effect a particular rule did or didn\u2019t have on employment and wages, Batkins said.\n\nIt is a difficult task, but one that could inform policymakers on both sides of the aisle, because everyone gets sick of agency projections versus industry projections and fighting those out in the public sphere, Batkins said.\n\n\u201cI think policymakers on both sides want to know what the actual effects of the rule are, as opposed to just projections,\u201d he said.\n\nElection-Year Activity\n\nHis appreciation for retrospective analysis, however, doesn't distract Batkins from monitoring new rulemakings.\n\nSo far, the last year of the Obama administration hasn't seen an extraordinarily high number of rulemakings compared to other presidential-election years, Batkins said. However, the number of significant regulations discharged from the White House is higher than in any other presidential-election year since at least 1996, he said. There has been a lot of activity just in the last few weeks, with a major rule on inversions, the fiduciary rule and a major rule on silica.\n\nWhether regulatory activity will increase next year will likely depend on the outcome of the election, Batkins said. If a Democrat wins, a \u201cmad rush\u201d of rulemakings is unlikely, whereas a Republican victory portends a lot of action, Batkins predicted.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Cheryl Bolen in Washington at cbolen@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Heather Rothman at hrothman@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/new-direction-regulatory-n57982070254/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Fresh out of law school during the economic downturn, Sam Batkins got an offer he couldn't refuse: a full-time...", "title": "New Direction for Regulatory Policy Shop: Batkins"}, "csrf-token": "V2IDWW9MEO9J6wREiBoNwC_xjmdrewMR4nniYftiXfw4wPgtP2KwUwdXHh4rOj2xdIiB-Ga9WqD0DJPuHjO1vjXk4XxU1atImSt9UoC6OuY1:jR02UWvpOJ-XyofQN8ONFUv-9GW1Hw0lfTdcYly3NPQd0RrDqwZgSdoTIkpWQYt720Qrdkgd2nGx62nPQOS-D642Vit234md4FQLQdgkjOU1", "description": "Fresh out of law school during the economic downturn, Sam Batkins got an offer he couldn't refuse: a full-time", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d65\"", "article_summary": "The group was brand new\u2014founded in February 2010\u2014and regulatory policy is \u201cesoteric,\u201d he said.\nHe was hired as director of regulatory policy at the American Action Forum.\nWhether regulatory activity will increase next year will likely depend on the outcome of the election, Batkins said.\nIf a Democrat wins, a \u201cmad rush\u201d of rulemakings is unlikely, whereas a Republican victory portends a lot of action, Batkins predicted.\nBy Cheryl BolenApril 22 \u2014 Fresh out of law school during the economic downturn, Sam Batkins got an offer he couldn't refuse: a full-time job."}
