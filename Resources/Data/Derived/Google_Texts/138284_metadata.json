Who\u2019s going to get the vote out? Democrats are going to get their vote out. The question is: Are we going to get our vote out? Had we done that in 2012, we absolutely would have President Romney and not President Obama. There\u2019s just no doubt about it.\n\nPerdue continued to mount a defense of his career, which has been under withering attack from Democrat Michelle Nunn, broadsides Perdue says are \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s what she\u2019s trying to do,\u201d Perdue told reporters. He continued:\n\n\u201cOne man doesn\u2019t decimate an entire industry. We\u2019ve had several industries \u2013 apparel, footwear, textile, electronics, even furniture \u2013 that in the past 30-40 years have been decimated by these policies and put our manufacturers at a disadvantage relative to the rest of the world. She\u2019s trying to put that back on me individually and that\u2019s a distraction away from the very policies of this administration that\u2019s perpetrated right now like Obamacare.\n\nJonathan Weisman of the New York Times pointed out that just down the road was a former Sara Lee plant that had shut down. Perdue worked for the conglomerate in Hong Kong, building up its Asian sourcing. Asked whether Sara Lee\u2019s policies were to blame for the plant closing, Perdue replied:\n\n\u201cNo, they had to compete in a global economy. It had nothing to do with Sara Lee\u2019s policies. If it did, West Point paper mill \u2013 just down the street in West Point, Georgia \u2013 would still be there. Or Bibb Manufacturing in Macon would still be there. Or several others would still be there. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can pin it on one company like that. And by the way the argument that was made last night that I had anything to do with the closing of those plants in Georgia is irresponsible and divisive and I think just absolutely appalling. I was in another hemisphere doing something totally different, and they know that.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOur AJC colleague Aaron Gould Sheinin, traveling with Michelle Nunn, has filed the following response:\n\nNunn on Monday, however, said Perdue didn\u2019t explain his career on outsourcing as she asked him to during Sunday night\u2019s debate. The facts are, she said, that Perdue \u201cwas responsible for growing jobs in places China and Mexico and for Sara Lee responsible for building their operations there while 500 people at the same were losing their jobs in Georgia. People do understand that.\u201d\n\nPerdue is right, Nunn said, that outsourcing is a part of the free enterprise system and \u201cit\u2019s part of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s what Georgians are looking for in qualifications for U.S. senator,\u201d Nunn said.\n\nThe former non-profit CEO also took aim at Perdue\u2019s comment Sunday night that seemed to dismiss criticism of his time at the helm of Dollar General because only \u201cabout 2,000\u201d women claimed pay discrimination out of 70,000 employees.\n\n\u201cTwo thousand women you were responsible for in your own company and you paid them less than their counterparts who were men?\u201d Nunn said after a campaign stop at the Thumbs Up Diner on Edgewood Avenue downtown. \u201cThat is very distressing for a lot of Georgians. David has said despite that record he\u2019s not for pay equity legislation for women.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are taking note,\u201d Nunn said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/10/27/david-perdue-one-man-doesnt-decimate-an-entire-industry/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/perdue1027.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "CARTERSVILLE -- Republican U.S. Senate hopeful David Perdue took off to North Georgia today, with seven stops in GOP-heavy areas.\r\n\r\nHe gave his usual stump speech in Cartersville, bashing President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, but he acknowledged he did not need to persuade this crowd:\r\n\"It\u2019s not about the message, it\u2019s...", "title": "David Perdue and Michelle Nunn keep sparring over \u2018outsourcing\u2019 | Political Insider blog"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "AJC blog about Atlanta politics, Georgia politics, Georgia and metro Atlanta election campaigns.
