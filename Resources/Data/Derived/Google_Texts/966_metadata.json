Diplomas, pictures and objects of inspiration went up on the walls last week. One corner is especially meaningful to him.\n\nIn one frame is the 1982 Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award presented to his father, George, when he was at Vanderbilt. \u201cIn recognition of a higher and more noble aspect of college coaching,\u201d it says. \u201cA style that emphasizes something more than winning. \u2026 A belief that the game of football should be kept in perspective with college life in general.\u201d\n\nAbove that is a frame with two pictures. One shows his father coaching on the Vanderbilt sideline. Next to it is a picture of MacIntyre coaching quarterback Sefo Liufau. Above them is the word \u201cLegacy.\u201d Below is a Billy Graham quote: \u201cA coach has the opportunity to impact more young people and their families in one season than the average person does in a lifetime.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what motivates MacIntyre: the opportunity to shape the lives of young men. To keep that opportunity \u2014 and the stunning view of Folsom Field that his new office affords \u2014 he has to win eventually. He has gone 6-18 in his first two seasons.\n\n\u201cThe words I\u2019ve used are perseverance, hope and passion,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a passion about what you do. I believe this is my calling \u2014 to coach college football. You\u2019ve got to have hope. I see hope here \u2014 the new facility, the people we work with, the kids we\u2019re recruiting, the involvement of the people in the community. You\u2019ve got to persevere. If you keep your passion, you have hope, then you keep persevering. If you do those things long enough the right way, eventually you will have success.\u201d\n\nThe third year of a head coach\u2019s tenure often renders a pass-fail verdict, but athletic director Rick George insists he\u2019s not putting pressure on MacIntyre.\n\n\u201cThe most pressure on Mike is what Mike\u2019s putting on himself,\u201d George said. \u201cHe has done a great job, he\u2019s doing the things we want him to do, his recruiting is improving. I think we\u2019ve got all the elements in place to have a really good football season and to have long-term success.\u201d\n\nThe Buffs, who open their season at Hawaii on Thursday, have 14 returning starters, including Liufau, a junior. Players are measurably bigger and stronger than last year, and there is more experienced depth. If the defense improves even a little, the Buffs should be able to do better than the 2-10 team a year ago that lost four Pac-12 conference games by 15 points.\n\n\u201cThe league we play in is very good,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cWe took a good step last year. For us to be successful, we have to take a leap in our conference. That\u2019s what I believe will happen, and we\u2019ll win a lot of the close games we lost last year.\u201d\n\nThe offense returns six starters, including outstanding receivers in Nelson Spruce and Shay Fields.\n\n\u201cIt was a very good offense last year,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cI think it should be an excellent offense this year. We have a quarterback who\u2019s played a lot of football games who is big, strong, powerful and smart. When you have a quality quarterback, you have a good opportunity to win games.\u201d\n\nMacIntyre sees a confidence in his players that wasn\u2019t there a year ago.\n\n\u201cI hear it in them, I see it in them, I see it in their work ethic,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from \u2018Can we beat them?\u2019 to \u2018Can they beat us?\u2019 It\u2019s not me trying to convince them anymore. That\u2019s a totally different mind-set.\u201d\n\nGeorge said he believes CU is \u201cpoised to have success,\u201d acknowledging there wasn\u2019t much talent when MacIntyre took over after Jon Embree went 4-21 in 2011-12.\n\n\u201cIn year one, we weren\u2019t as competitive as I\u2019d like us to be, but we won four football games,\u201d George said. \u201cLast year, we were more competitive, but we didn\u2019t win football games. Now we\u2019ve got to be even more competitive and win football games. Being close isn\u2019t good enough \u2014 we\u2019ve got to win football games. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to propel this athletic department. I think we\u2019ve got the right guy in place to do that.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mike MacIntyre motivated to lead Colorado football through walls", "title": "Mike MacIntyre motivated to lead Colorado football through walls", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/29/mike-macintyre-motivated-to-lead-colorado-football-through-walls/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150829__BN20150830_C13_BNSP30FBCCOACHMACp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150829__BN20150830_C13_BNSP30FBCCOACHMACp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-29T22:50:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T09:42:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe064d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn year one, we weren\u2019t as competitive as I\u2019d like us to be, but we won four football games,\u201d George said.\n\u201cLast year, we were more competitive, but we didn\u2019t win football games.\nWe have a quarterback who\u2019s played a lot of football games who is big, strong, powerful and smart.\nBOULDER \u2014 Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre moved into his office in the stunning new $156 million Champions Center two weeks ago.\nNow we\u2019ve got to be even more competitive and win football games."}
