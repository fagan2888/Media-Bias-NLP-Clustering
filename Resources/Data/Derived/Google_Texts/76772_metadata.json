Nathan Deal said Monday that it would cost about $100 million to make the changes that the Department of Community Health is expected to approve today in response to the outcry from some of the 650,000 teachers, public employees and their dependents.\n\nHe\u2019s tapping the insurance plan\u2019s reserve funds for the money rather than take from other parts of the budget, a move that would leave the account with roughly around $300 million. His proposal to increase K-12 funding by $547 million is off-limits, the governor said after an appearance at a gathering of the Georgia Municipal Association.\n\n\u201cWe believe the reserve is adequate to cover any unexpected circumstances,\u201d Deal said. \u201cWe had enough reserve in the account to be able to absorb these additional changes.\u201d\n\nDeal again said President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul is partly to blame for the rising costs and fewer options under the new state plan. But he said the changes shouldn\u2019t become fodder for a political blame game.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there should be any political blame at all. We are trying to do what is best for the citizens of our state and the taxpayers as well as those who work for the state, whether they be teachers or employees.\u201d\n\nBut behind the scenes, a debate is raging over how to explain them.\n\n\n\nThe argument from Gov. Nathan Deal and other conservatives is that President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul is partly to blame for the rising costs and fewer options under the new state plan.\n\nDeal said as much last week, and some Republican lawmakers are using the tumult to push legislation that seeks to exempt the state health plan from changes under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n***\n\nThe Georgia Municipal Association today has its Mayor\u2019s Day at the state Capitol. The kickoff event is a U.S. Senate debate that will start within the next few minutes at the downtown Hilton Atlanta.\n\nIn the audience will be Edna Branch Jackson, the mayor of Savannah, who had breakfast with both House Speaker David Ralston and Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle.\n\nShe has more traveling ahead of her. Tomorrow night, she\u2019ll be U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson\u2019s date at the State of the Union address by President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited. I\u2019m humbled,\u201d said Jackson, who said Isakson\u2019s invitation was a mark of bipartisanship. \u201cTo do what you have to for your community, you have to deal across the aisle. [Isakson\u2019s staff] have been very helpful with us.\u201d\n\nIsakson does this with some regularity. Last year, Atlanta City Council President Ceasar Mitchell was his guest.\n\nBut two reasons may behind Jackson\u2019s invite: Georgia\u2019s political leadership will be looking for some mention of federal cash for dredging the Port of Savannah. If that happens, Isakson and the mayor of Savannah arm-in-arm would make a timely photo.\n\nSecondly, consider the invitation more proof that Isakson will be running for re-election in 2016.\n\n***\n\nThe Georgia Municipal Association\u2019s annual shindig this morning provided Gov. Nathan Deal with fodder for an endorsement. Flanked by a few dozen mayors, the governor\u2019s campaign announced the endorsements of about 110 mayors across the state.\n\nAmong them: Deke Copenhaver of Augusta, Boyd Austin of Dallas, and Ames Barnett of Washington, who runs a town that is about 70 percent Democratic. Deal talked of a rebounding Georgia economy, and promised more job announcements were in the works.\n\n***\n\nSpeaking of the Port of Savannah: A Wall Street Journal article this morning looks at how earmarks have survived in Congress, picking out one particular Republican candidate for U.S. Senate:\n\nRep. Jack Kingston (R., Ga.), who is running in a crowded GOP primary field for a Senate seat, faced a particularly ticklish dilemma. As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, he was well positioned to shape the bill. He used that influence to advance a provision to expedite federal funding of a huge infrastructure project crucial to Georgia, the dredging of Savannah harbor. It was a coup, but Mr. Kingston voted against the bill on grounds that it spent too much overall. He was the only member of the appropriations committee to vote against the measure, a move that colleagues attributed to him facing a primary slate of Republicans competing to establish themselves as the most conservative candidate.\n\n***\n\nAttorney General Sam Olens doesn\u2019t have to worry about a Democratic challenger quite yet. We\u2019re told his 2010 opponent, Ken Hodges, is staying out of the race. And our colleague Aaron Gould Sheinin brings us the news this morning that Lester Tate, the ex-State Bar of Georgia president, has decided against a bid.\n\nFrom Sheinin\u2019s dispatch:\n\nTate, a Cartersville lawyer, said Democratic Party of Georgia chairman DuBose Porter and others approached him to consider a race against Republican incumbent Attorney General Sam Olens. But he said his two children, both in college, demand his attention. \u201cI did think about it very seriously,\u201d Tate said. \u201cI just decided it wasn\u2019t the right time for me. It\u2019s something I might like to do at some point in the future. It\u2019s just not the right time for me.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOur AJC colleagues Bill Torpy and Johnny Edwards had what was likely the most important piece of the weekend in political Georgia:\n\nAlmost a decade since Sandy Springs set the incorporation template, six cities in Fulton, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties have been created. Today, 44 of the 46 elected officials in those cities are white, the lone exception being a Hispanic councilman in Johns Creek who steps down next week. One seat is vacant. And in the history of those cities, of the 66 people elected since their inception, just one was black, a councilwoman, also in Johns Creek. Almost no one involved with the incorporations would say race is a factor in the cities\u2019 creation. But the stark results give new ammunition to opponents\u2019 claims that the cities were a plan to erect new racial barriers and siphon revenue from areas that have a limited tax base for public services.\n\n***\n\nIn the \u201cWeek Ahead in Washington,\u201d Malloy looks at the State of the Union and the state of flood insurance reform.\n\n***\n\nThe New York Times on Sunday offered a front page piece on Michelle Nunn and her U.S. Senate bid. From the article:\n\n\u201cI know the Nunns; they\u2019re fine people,\u201d said Larry Walker, a former Democratic leader of the Georgia House, who does legal work for the former senator. Yet Mr. Walker, whose politics now tilt Republican, is neutral so far. Ms. Nunn is not Georgia\u2019s only legacy Democrat. Jason Carter, a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, is trying to unseat Gov. Nathan Deal. Mr. Walker is skeptical. \u201cPolitical legacies don\u2019t last like they used to,\u201d he said.\n\nThe content of the article is of less importance than the fact that such national attention will likely help Nunn turn in a large fund-raising number by the end of this week, reinforcing her status as a formidable Democratic opponent to whoever survives the GOP primary runoff in July.\n\n(Nunn, by the way, turned away the Georgia Municipal Association\u2019s invitation to a debate this morning with fellow Democrat Branko \u201cDr. Rad\u201d Radulovacki. He\u2019ll be on the stage alone.)\n\n***\n\nBill Barrow of the Associated Press took a big-picture look at the Republican side of the race. Barrow quotes Phil Gingrey\u2019s departed general consultant, warning about the primary\u2019s rightward pull:\n\nRepublican consultant Chip Lake, who worked briefly for Gingrey\u2019s campaign in 2013, said the key to holding the white suburban vote \u201cis nominating the most electable conservative.\u201d Of course, Lake conceded, the GOP primary puts the definition of conservative up for grabs. \u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of us in the movement who would rather win that argument than win elections,\u201d he said.\n\n***\n\nApparently, one of the two candidates in the Feb. 4 special election runoff for state House District 2, to replace Jay Neal, is hinting that he\u2019s got the backing of U.S. Rep. Tom Graves. But Graves is saying it ain\u2019t so:\n\n\u201cI want to make it clear to Georgians in House District 2 that I have not made an endorsement in the Special Election Runoff. Any use of my name or image on campaign materials in this race has been done without my knowledge or approval. \u201cMy staff has been in contact with the campaigns to reiterate that I will not make an endorsement in this race and to request that they immediately stop using any potentially misleading material involving my name. This election will be decided by the people of District 2 and I\u2019m confident that either of the candidates will serve well and represent the values of North Georgia.\u201d\n\nThe two surviving candidates, both Republican, are Steve Tarvin and Neal Florence.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/01/27/nathan-deal-taps-100-million-in-reserves-to-provide-fix-for-state-employee-health-care-plan/", "image": "http://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/nathan-deal.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "Soothing complaints from teachers over the state\u2019s new health care plan won\u2019t come cheaply.\r\n\r\nGov.
