It\u2019s becoming all too common for members of the majority party to attempt to balance the budget on the backs of seniors,\u201d said Davis.\n\n\u201cWe can meet America\u2019s needs in a fiscally responsible manner if we simply work together to reach a compromise like we did last year. Let\u2019s not fall into the familiar partisan patterns of the past.\u201d\n\nThe letter to Speaker Ryan says that proposals which harm Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and other programs are detrimental to the well-being of senior citizens.\n\nFive years ago, Speaker Ryan made proposals, as a Chair of the Budget Committee, to sharply reduce funding for these programs, and the letter asks him to consider the ramifications of these policies.\n\nHis plan would eliminate funding for services that provide seniors with transportation services to the grocery store, Meals on Wheels and other community support programs for seniors, according to the letter.\n\nThe letter states: \u201cAt a time when senior poverty is on the rise, median senior income is $24,500 and many of our older constituents are still struggling from the loss of retirement savings and the erosion of defined benefit plans, Congress should not pass a budget that includes the harmful cuts included in the Roadmap for America\u2019s Future and subsequent Republican budgets.\u201d\n\nIn addition to this, Davis has also pushed for the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, said Press Secretary Hunter.\n\n>> Subscribe to Times of San Diego\u2019s free daily email newsletter!
