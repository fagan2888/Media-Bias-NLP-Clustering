It was with "Mixed Emotions" that she accepted frenemy Steny Hoyer, a more centrist party official, into that role after he beat Murtha in the leadership contest.

Not one Democrat voted against the two-year budget deal last October, while 167 Republicans said ‘no,’ defying their party leader. Many activists on the left and right regarded Pelosi’s support as nothing less than "Sympathy for the Devil."
