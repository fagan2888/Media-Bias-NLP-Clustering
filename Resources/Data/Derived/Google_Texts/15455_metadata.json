Increased U.S. oil-and-gas production has created millions of well-paying jobs and given us a new energy security. The president often peppers his speeches with braggadocio talk about our abundant supplies and decreased dependence on foreign oil.\n\nSo now that the economic powerhouse faces hard times, how does the Administration show its appreciation for the oil-and-gas industry boon to the economy over the past six years?\n\nBy introducing a series of regulations\u2014at least nine in total, according to the Wall Street journal (WSJ)\u2014that will put the brakes on the US energy boom through higher operating costs and fewer incentives to drill on public lands.\n\nWSJ states: \u201cMr. Obama and his environmental backers say new regulations are needed to address the impacts of the surge in oil and gas drilling.\u201d\n\nU.S. oil production, according to the Financial Times: \u201ccaught Saudi Arabia by surprise.\u201d The kingdom sees that US shale and Canadian oil-sand development \u201cencroached on OPEC\u2019s market share\u201d and has responded with a challenge to high-cost sources of production by upping its output\u2014adding to the global oil glut and, therefore, dropping prices.\n\nMost oil-market watchers expect temporary low-priced oil, with prediction of an increase in the second half of 2015, and some saying 2016. North Dakota Petroleum Council President Ron Ness believes \u201cWe\u2019re in an energy war.\u201d He sees \u201cthe price slump could last 16 months or even one to two years as U.S. supply stays strong, global demand remains weak and OPEC continues to challenge U.S. production.\u201d However, Ibrahim al-Assaf, Saudi Arabia\u2019s finance minister, recently said: \u201cWe have the ability to endure low oil prices over the medium term of up to five years, even if it means delving into fiscal reserves to cover a large deficit.\u201d\n\nWhile no one knows how long the low-price scenario will last\u2014geopolitical risk is still a factor.\n\nMany oil companies are already re-evaluating exploration, reining in costs, and cutting jobs and/or wages. \u201cIn the low price circumstance like today,\u201d Jean-Marie Guillermou, the Asian head of the French oil giant Total, explained: \u201cyou do the strict minimum required.\u201d\n\nIn December, the WSJ reported: \u201cSome North American companies have said they plan to cut their capital spending next year and dial back on exploring for new oil.\u201d It quotes Tim Dove, President and COO for Pioneer Natural Resources Co.: \u201cWe are seeking cost reductions from all our suppliers.\u201d\n\nLast month, Enbridge Energy Partners said: \u201cit has laid off some workers in the Houston area\u201d\u2014which the Houston Chronicle (HC) on December 12 called: \u201cthe latest in a string of energy companies to announce cutbacks.\u201d The HC continued: \u201cOther key energy companies have also announced layoffs in recent days as oil tumbles to its lowest price in years. Halliburton on Thursday said it would slash 1,000 jobs in the Eastern Hemisphere as part of a $75 million restructuring. BP on Wednesday revealed plans to accelerate job cuts and pare back its oil production business amid crumbling oil prices.\u201d Halliburton said: \u201cwe believe these job eliminations are necessary in order to work through this market environment.\u201d\n\nCiveo, a lodging and workforce accommodation company for the oil-and-gas industry has cut 30 percent of its Canadian workforce and 45 percent of its U.S. workforce. President and CEO Bradley Dodson said: \u201cAs it became evident during the fourth quarter that capital spending budgets among the major oil companies were going to be cut, we began taking steps to reduce marketed room capacity, control costs and curtail discretionary capital expenditures.\u201d\n\nI have warned the industry that while they have remained relatively unscathed by harsh regulations\u2014such as those placed on electricity generation\u2014their time would come. Now, it has arrived. The WSJ concurs: \u201cIn its first six years, the administration released very few regulations directly affecting the oil-and-gas industry and instead rolled out several significant rules aimed at cutting air pollution from the coal and electric-utility sectors.\u201d\n\nAccording to the WSJ: \u201cSome of the rules have been in the works for months or even years.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean the administration should introduce them now when the industry is already down\u2014after all, the administration delayed Obamacare mandates due to the negative impact on jobs and the economy.\n\nGreg Guidry, executive vice president at Shell, recently said that he doesn\u2019t want the EPA to \u201cimpose unnecessary costs and burden on an industry challenged now by a sustained low-price environment.\u201d\n\nDifferent from Obama, Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Stephen Harper gets it. Under pressure from the environmental lobby to increase regulations on the oil-and-gas industry, he, during a question session on the floor of the House of Commons in December, said: \u201cUnder the current circumstances of the oil and gas sector, it would be crazy\u2014it would be crazy economic policy\u2014to do unilateral penalties on that sector.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are not going to kill jobs and we are not going to impose a carbon tax.\u201d\n\nIntroducing the new rules now kick the industry while it is down and shows that President Obama either doesn\u2019t get it, or he cares more about burnishing his environmental legacy than he does about American jobs and economic growth.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/01/obama-administration-kicks-the-oil-and-gas-industry-while-it-is-down/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oil-derrick-bakken-640x423.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Obama Administration Kicks the Oil-and-Gas Industry While it is Down"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca200\"", "article_summary": "So now that the economic powerhouse faces hard times, how does the Administration show its appreciation for the oil-and-gas industry boon to the economy over the past six years?\nIncreased U.S. oil-and-gas production has created millions of well-paying jobs and given us a new energy security.\nFor the past six years, the oil and gas industry has served as a savior to the Obama presidency by providing the near-lone bright spot in economic growth.\nMany oil companies are already re-evaluating exploration, reining in costs, and cutting jobs and/or wages.\nThe president often peppers his speeches with braggadocio talk about our abundant supplies and decreased dependence on foreign oil."}
