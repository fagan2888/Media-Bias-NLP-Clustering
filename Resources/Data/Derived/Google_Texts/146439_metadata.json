Sure, we\u2019ve known the American people have little regard for Congress, which has been experiencing record-low approval ratings. Yet fellow elected officials working in America\u2019s cities also hold Washington in disfavor, and they had a clear message for their representatives on Capitol Hill: Gridlock has gone too far.\n\nSome 82 percent of mayors queried said they had very little or no confidence in Washington lawmakers to address the nation\u2019s most pressing problem, according to Politico Magazine\u2019s inaugural Mayors\u2019 Survey. What did mayors find most grating? Was it lawmakers\u2019 almost genetically-encoded aversion to solving important challenges? Their tendency to grandstand? Their inability to resist kowtowing to powerful special interests? All of the above, nearly half of the respondents reported.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe must do what we can on our own, locally and regionally,\u201d said one mayor, \u201cand support Washington to get past gridlock and invest in infrastructure that will create quality jobs and stimulate sustainable quality jobs.\u201d\n\nAnd what does Washington do well? Procrastinate, wrote one West Coast mayor, without a hint of humor.\n\nThe revelations in Politico Magazine inaugural Mayors\u2019 Survey, which was conducted as an extension of the magazine\u2019s award-winning \u201c What Works\u201d series, were part of a survey that heard from 21 mayors in more than a dozen states, in places as far-flung as Miami and Oakland, Pittsburgh and Las Vegas, and New Orleans and Yonkers.\n\nThe mayors were asked in the survey to answer a series of questions about economic development, their biggest challenges, the most stubborn obstacles and Washington\u2019s role in helping\u2014or hurting\u2014their city\u2019s fate. The vast majority of the respondents\u201416\u2014identified themselves as Democrats, with two Republicans and three mayors elected in non-partisan races also taking part. While Congress fared poorly, President Barack Obama was given high marks in this Democratically-heavy (and non-scientific) poll. Roughly 67 percent of respondents said the president deserves \u201ca great deal of credit\u201d for the country\u2019s economic turnaround, even though a majority believes that the Affordable Care Act\u2014and not his bailout of the auto industry or the federal stimulus program\u2014will be his greatest economic legacy.\n\nNot everyone is an Obama fan, however. One respondent said the president would be remembered for the \u201cgovernment takeover of banking, auto, healthcare and energy industries.\u201d What could the president do that he hasn\u2019t done already to spur the economy? This mayor answered: \u201cGet out of office.\u201d\n\nYet regardless of the feelings about the president and with the near universal condemnation of Congress, mayors were united that the federal government and Washington officials weren\u2019t doing enough to help their cities and their citizens and instead were ignoring key crises in infrastructure and education.\n\nCloser to home, most mayors reported that their greatest challenge involved fixing crumbling infrastructure\u2014a problem they overwhelmingly believed should be a top priority in Washington. Their view that Washington needed to provide more funding for roads, bridges, and other infrastructure was bipartisan and comes as Congress is locked in a sustained battle over providing money for the nation\u2019s Highway Trust Fund.\n\nWhile many city leaders thought that improved roads and transportation would help their citizens, a full 50 percent of the mayors cited a \u201cbetter educated workforce\u201d as the most important factor in improving their city\u2019s economic trajectory.\n\nThe survey also asked what action would mayors take if they if they had unilateral power and were guaranteed no political fallout? Almost one-third said they would significantly raise the minimum wage, an issue that has become an increasingly potent political debate in cities and states around the country in the last year. Meanwhile, just 16 percent of the mayors said they\u2019d raise taxes if given a chance.\n\nFour of their mayoral colleagues garnered multiple mentions when those responding to the survey were asked to name the current city leader they most admire. Philadelphia\u2019s Michael Nutter topped the list, cited by four of his counterparts. \u201cI watched as he came from being an underdog to becoming a mayor, with a commitment to fiscal discipline, innovation and social equity,\u201d wrote one mayor about Nutter. \u201cHe understands the problems faced with being a blue city in a predominantly red state and how to maneuver to get Philadelphia much of the aid they\u2019ve needed. In a short period of time he has risen to national prominence as a dean of American mayors and at the same time stays grounded to everyday issues facing the people of Philadelphia.\u201d\n\nSURVEY PARTICIPANTS (in alphabetical order): Mayor William V.
