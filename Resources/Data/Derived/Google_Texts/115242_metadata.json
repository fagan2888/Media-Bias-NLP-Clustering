They have dropped for the first time since 1998.\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nCalifornia law requires that children entering kindergarten be fully vaccinated against a range of diseases. But despite overwhelming evidence that vaccines are safe and effective, the rate of parents opting out of vaccines for their children has doubled since 2007.\n\nTo opt out, parents must file a personal belief exemption, or PBE, a signed statement that vaccines are against their personal beliefs. In the 2007-2008 school year, the statewide PBE rate was 1.56 percent. By 2013-2014, the most recent year statistics are available, the rate had jumped to 3.15 percent.\n\nPBE rates vary by county and by individual school. In the Bay Area, Marin has the highest PBE rate by far \u2014 7.57 percent. (Marin was highest in the Bay Area last year too.) The PBE rate at private schools tends to be higher, overall, then that at public schools. In the 2013-2014 school year, only 85 percent of private school kindergarten students statewide were fully vaccinated when school started, compared to about 90 percent of public school students. Other students enter on \u201cconditional\u201d status, meaning the school is to follow up with these children to make sure they receive all their vaccines.\n\n\n\nThe California Department of Public Health collects vaccination rates and PBE rates at every kindergarten in the state with more than 10 students \u2014 both public and private schools. Further below, we\u2019ve made it easy for you to look up your own school.\n\nEntering kindergarten children are required to be vaccinated against:\n\nPolio\n\nDiphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTaP)\n\nMeasles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR)\n\nHepatitis B\n\nVaricella (Chickenpox)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely concerned\u201d about the increasing PBE rates, said Dr. James Watt, chief of the state\u2019s division of communicable disease control. \u201cWe\u2019ve been monitoring that. We\u2019ve been increasing our analysis of the data to try to understand what\u2019s happening with that trend.\u201d\n\nThe biggest concern, he said, is not the overall statewide rate. But that growing rate signals that individual schools or areas may have very high PBE rates. \u201cWhen those exemptions congregate in settings,\u201d Watt said, \u201cthat\u2019s the risk where disease transmission is greatest.\u201d\n\nIn 2014 alone, California has seen outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease. \u201cWe\u2019ve been grappling earlier this year with a lot of measles brought back in from other countries,\u201d Watt said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a whooping cough epidemic.\u201d The latest data from the state shows nearly 8,000 cases so far this year, and more than two-thirds of those hospitalized are infants younger than four months.\n\nThe state also experienced a whooping cough epidemic in 2010. Later research proved that vaccine refusal was a factor in the epidemic.\n\nUnder a new state law that went into effect on Jan. 1, parents who don\u2019t want to have their children vaccinated now must meet with a health care provider to discuss risks and benefits of vaccines. The provider must sign a form that the conversation has happened and the parent must provide a written statement.\n\nAfter a similar law passed in Washington state in 2011, the PBE rate dropped 25 percent in 18 months. In California, the school year that is just starting is the first that makes this additional requirement of the PBE.\n\nWatts said he hopes that the conversation with a health care provider \u201cwill help (parents) to come to decisions that will enable children to be protected against disease.\u201d\n\nIn comparison to Marin\u2019s 7.57 percent PBE rate, five other Bay Area counties have a significantly lower opt-out rates:\n\nSan Francisco: 1.64 percent\n\nSanta Clara: 1.72 percent\n\nAlameda: 1.78 percent\n\nSan Mateo: 2.26 percent\n\nContra Costa: 2.32 percent\n\nFind Any School in California\n\nYou can look up the personal belief exemption rate at your own school below. So you can see the trend, we include data from the 2007-2008 school year through the 2013-2014 school year, the most recent year for which data are available. This tool includes data from every kindergarten in the state, public or private, with 10 or more students.\n\nThe column to the far right \u2014 \u201cPBE\u201d \u2014 shows the percentage of children at a kindergarten with a personal belief exemption on file. The higher the number, the more children are not receiving vaccines.
