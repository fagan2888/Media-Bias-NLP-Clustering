Two people were injured in a far north Fort Worth mobile home fire Sunday morning, fire officials say.

Fort Worth firefighters responded to a call in the 1100 block of Fumar Lane just after 8:30 a.m. When crews arrived, flames were coming from the side of the mobile home, according to fire officials.

A neighbor had helped both occupants of the home escape the blaze, fire officials said.

One occupant, a 69-year-old man, was transported by Careflite helicopter to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas with 2nd-degree burns. The next door neighbor, a 46-year-old woman, was also transported by ambulance to Parkland with non-life threatening injuries.

Fire officials say the other occupant of the mobile home suffered minor injuries, but did not go to the hospital.

Though the family’s dog was rescued, their two birds reportedly died during the incident.

Fire officials say the fire was likely caused by an improperly discarded cigarette.

“Someone was smoking and that must have caused the fire,” fire department spokesman Kyle Clay said.
