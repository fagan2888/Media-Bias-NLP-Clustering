Vestar & Goldman-Backed Hearthside Gobbles European Snack Bars with VSI Deal

North Castle and Permira have also bought better-for-you snack brands recently

Hearthside Food Solutions is scooping up nutrition bar maker VSI to expand in Europe.

VSI, headquartered in Leerdam, The Netherlands, makes private-label weight control, fitness and snack bars.

The Vestar Capital and Goldman Sachs(NYSE: GS)-backed business is also buying a nutrition bar production facility in Boise, Idaho. The facility is a subsidiary of Post Holdings Inc. (NYSE: POST), the parent company of cereals Honey Bunches of Oats and Grape Nuts. Terms were not disclosed for either transaction.

Hearthside has 19 U.S. facilities, which it says makes it North Americas largest contract manufacturer for bars and baked goods. The VSI deal adds three European manufacturing facilities to the business.

Goldman Sachs merchant banking division and Vestar Capital bought equal stakes in Downers Grove, Illinois-based Hearthside in 2014. Before that, the business was owned by Chicago private equity firm Wind Point Partners.

Consumer interest in better-for-you living has dealmakers diving into healthy snack transactions. Recent deals include North Castle Partners purchase of Sprout Organic Foods Inc., and Permiras deal for the maker of PopCorners. For more on the trend, see Snack Time.
