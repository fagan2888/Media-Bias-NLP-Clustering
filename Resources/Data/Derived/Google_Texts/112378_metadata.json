A new study this week shows that a doctor\u2019s rate of finding and removing adenomas \u2014 these are pre-cancerous growths \u2014 is linked to the patient\u2019s lower risk of developing colon cancer later.\n\nFor every 1 percent increase in adenoma detection there was a 3 percent decrease a person\u2019s colon cancer risk.\n\nColonoscopy is one of the recommended screening tests for colon cancer. Yet doctors have differing rates at how often they find these adenomas. This is the first study in the U.S. to look at the association between finding adenomas and later cancer risk, as part of a national review funded by the National Cancer Institute. It was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn the study, researchers at Kaiser Permanente Northern California reviewed more than 300,000 colonoscopies performed by 136 gastroenterologists between 1998 and 2010.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 detection rates for adenomas ranged from 7.4 percent to 52.5 percent. The researchers found that for every 1 percent increase in detection rate there was a 3 percent decrease in colon cancer risk over the next decade.\n\nDr. Douglas Corley is research scientist with Kaiser\u2019s Department of Research and lead author of the study. \u201cThe (doctors) who were at the higher end of the detection, their patients were actually less likely in the future to be diagnosed with a colon cancer, an advanced colon cancer and to die of colon cancer,\u201d he said.\n\nMedicare is in the process of setting standards for doctors\u2019 groups to report their detection of adenomas as a quality measure but \u201cpatients certainly ask their physicians if their groups measure adenoma detection rates\u201d now, Corley said.\n\nHealthDay spoke to a gastroenterologist not involved in the study who backed up Corley\u2019s recommendation. From HealthDay:\n\n\u201cMany (doctors) make quality measures available to their patients,\u201d said Dr. Lawrence Kim, who serves as the community private practice councilor for the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). That information may be in the written materials your doctor gives you, or even on the practice\u2019s website, Kim said.\n\nA \u201cminimum threshold\u201d for finding adenomas is at least 15 percent for women and 25 percent for men, Corley noted. Adenomas are more common in men. Most of the doctors in the study were above 20 percent overall. Kaiser is working to develop interventions to improve adenoma detection rates among all doctors, he said. Those interventions may ultimately be applied to physicians beyond Kaiser.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Major study finds that the more adenomas the doctor removes, the lower a patient's later risk of cancer.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Your Doctor's Skill at Colonoscopy May Reduce Your Later Colon Cancer Risk\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/04\\/04\\/your-doctors-skill-at-colonoscopy-may-reduce-your-later-colon-cancer-risk\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-04-04 14:44:20\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-04-08 14:26:19\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":18529,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Colon Cancer\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/04\\/136237601-e1396647760530.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Major study finds that the more adenomas the doctor removes, the lower a patient's later risk of cancer.", "title": "Your Doctor\u2019s Skill at Colonoscopy May Reduce Your Later Colon Cancer Risk", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/04/04/your-doctors-skill-at-colonoscopy-may-reduce-your-later-colon-cancer-risk/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/04/136237601-640x437.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "colon cancer,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15fe\"", "article_summary": "For every 1 percent increase in adenoma detection there was a 3 percent decrease a person\u2019s colon cancer risk.\n\u201cThe (doctors) who were at the higher end of the detection, their patients were actually less likely in the future to be diagnosed with a colon cancer, an advanced colon cancer and to die of colon cancer,\u201d he said.\nColonoscopy is one of the recommended screening tests for colon cancer.\nYour Doctor\u2019s Skill at Colonoscopy May Reduce Your Later Colon Cancer RiskIf you\u2019re going to go to the trouble of having a colonoscopy, you\u2019d probably prefer that you get as much as you can out of the screening test.\nThe researchers found that for every 1 percent increase in detection rate there was a 3 percent decrease in colon cancer risk over the next decade."}
