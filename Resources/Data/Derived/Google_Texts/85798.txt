The Koch-funded AFP has spent millions of dollars running ads that star real Americans who have been hurt by Obamacare. Each one has been systematically debunked. So AFP switched gears. In their latest ad, instead of focusing on a single case, they simply make the broad charge that "millions of people have lost their health insurance, millions of people can’t see their own doctors, and millions are paying more and getting less." Take that, meddling fact checkers!

So Glenn Kessler took a look. Verdict: when you make broad statements, it is indeed harder to demonstrate that they're concretely wrong. After all, some people have lost their health insurance, some people can’t see their own doctors, and some people are paying more and getting less. Nonetheless, Kessler concludes that AFP's broad charges aren't much more defensible than their bogus real Americans. Two Pinocchios.
