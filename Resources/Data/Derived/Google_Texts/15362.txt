“Real Time” host Bill Maher Friday night sat down with Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez.

Maher began by citing GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s hearsay statistic that the unemployment rate is upwards of 42% — an infuriatingly ridiculous figure that could only be believed by a Trump supporter — as opposed to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ estimated 5%.

“There’s a reason his name rhymes with dump,” Perez explained. “Because he’s really full of you-know-what.”

“The reality is … this president inherited a mess,” he continued. “The unemployment rate was inching up to 10%, 2 million-plus jobs lost in the three months before he took office, and now we’ve seen 73 months in a row of private sector job growth to the tune of over 14 million jobs.”

“The fact-free zone is indeed fact-free,” he added.
