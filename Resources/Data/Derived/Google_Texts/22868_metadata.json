Saturday\u2019s banquet also served as a fundraising effort for Spectrum Health United\u2019s planned obstetrics expansion and renovation.\n\nLondon has long been a supporter of the Spectrum\u2019s Tree of Lights and has repeatedly contributed substantial donations to the hospital\u2019s Building Healthy Futures campaign.\n\nAdditionally, London serves on Greenville\u2019s Board of Appeals and is one of the founding members of the Women\u2019s Action Network, an organization that provides scarves, wigs and hats to cancer patients.\n\nLast year\u2019s recipient, the Rev. Jerry Jones, introduced London and presented her with the award.\n\n\u201cThe Fred and Lena Meijer Spirit of Caring Award is presented to an individual who has demonstrated a remarkable commitment to improving the quality of life for people in our community, now and for future generations,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe award is named after Fred and Lena Meijer in honor of their longstanding commitment and dedication to the Greenville and Lakeview communities. Each recipient is selected based on that same spirit of selfless community support and participation the Meijers have exemplified for decades.\u201d\n\nJones went on to relate the events of the evening last Sept. 27, when London learned she would be receiving the award. London was attending the ceremony at the Winter Inn restaurant in Greenville with the belief she would be congratulating a friend who had been chosen as a recipient.\n\nHowever, as Jones described the accomplishments of this year\u2019s winner, London realized she was to be receiving the award. At the time, London said, \u201cI\u2019m never quite sure why people are so nice to me. I\u2019m always amazed at how Greenville is in terms of caring and giving. This community is as great as it is because of the kind of people that are in it. It\u2019s just a day-to-day thing for them to care about the people around them and do nice things for them.\u201d\n\nGreenville resident and Daily News columnist Maureen Burns commented, following the ceremony and dinner, that she could think of no better recipient for the award than London.\n\n\u201cI think Joyce is the perfect choice for this year\u2019s recipient,\u201d Burns said. \u201cShe does so much for the community.\u201d\n\nPrior to the auctions, which made up the fundraising portion of the event, the gathering heard from Spectrum Health Foundation Director Shelly Westbrook, who laid out the hospital\u2019s plans for expansion and renovation of the OB department.\n\nAt present, Westbrook said, some of the rooms in the OB do not have many of the amenities \u2014 such as private showers \u2014 that have become the norm at most facilities. The planned expansion would remedy this situation. Westbrook also expressed gratitude to the those gathered for their help in making the expansion a reality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful for each and every one of you here this evening,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cBecause of you we will be able to expand and renovate our OB department. There\u2019s something magical about interacting with a baby that ignites something magical in all of us.\u201d\n\nAnother Spectrum obstetrician, Dr. Connie Januzelli, also thanked the gathering, while pointing out the very real need for an expanded OB department at the hospital.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve practiced obstetrics in Greenville for 15 years,\u201d Januzelli said. \u201cThat first year, we delivered 300 babies. This year we\u2019re on track to deliver 500. That\u2019s a lot of sleepless nights. To accommodate this, we have added staff, going from two obstetricians to four.\u201d\n\nThe fundraising auctions \u2014 one silent, the other traditional \u2014 featured many \u201cbig ticket\u201d items like vacations, get-away packages, wine refrigerators and dozens more.\n\nFunds raised from the annual event will go toward creating five new private postpartum rooms, adding another labor and delivery suite, installing a new nurses\u2019 station with enhanced security, and creating a new guest lounge, nourishment room and storage room for medication.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily News", "description": "GRAND RAPIDS \u2014 Area movers and shakers gathered Saturday evening at the Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park in Grand Rapids to pay homage to the recipient of this year\u2019s Fred and Lena Meijer Spirit of Caring Award, Dr. Joyce London.\r\n\r\nLondon was tapped last September to receive the award.
