Noah has been preoccupied with death for as long as he can recall. When he was 8 years old, he read the obituary section of the newspaper daily, studying each line. ���I wonder who this person was,��� he would say, as he tried to share his interest with his mother. But she would shrug and mumble, ���You can never really know.��� Noah wanted to know; he needed to know. He was searching, investigating. Who had these dead people been? Whom had they left behind? How old were they when they died and what had killed them? Could Noah die? Could his parents?

Decades later, Noah starts his psychoanalysis with what he calls his ���obsession with dead people.��� He wants to know everything about these people in the obituaries, and I want to know everything about him. With each obituary that Noah brings in to the consulting room, we piece together our respective puzzles, hunting for the missing pieces to complete our pictures.

���I got it,��� Noah reports after hours of painstaking research, Googling, filling in the dates and details of the latest obituary. ���I think I know everything. Now I can let it go.��� Unlike Noah, I don���t get it. Missing many parts of Noah���s personal history, I try to wait patiently for them to enter the room. I know from experience that sooner or later the missing pieces will appear. I just have to silently listen and invite them in.

Noah becomes irritated when he is missing a piece in his puzzle. He holds the newspaper and reads aloud to me from an obituary of a woman named Marie, then rolls his eyes. ���Listen to how annoying this is,��� he says. ���How come they write that ���Ronald��� was her second husband? If you Google him, you find this same Ronald was also the translator of a book she co-wrote many years earlier with her first husband ��� who was also named Ronald.���

I am confused, and jokingly think to myself, ���Maybe she only liked people named Ronald.��� My reaction is a result of the fact that I have trouble following the details, which makes me anxious. I don���t yet fully understand Noah���s interest in these facts about the dead.

���Both of her husbands were called Ronald ��� is that possible?��� he wonders. ���Marie married a Ronald and then another Ronald.��� He counts the Ronalds again, as if he needs to make it clear that there is something behind those names, something more than meets the eye.

Noah holds those who died in his mind and refuses to let them go. He embraces their stories as if they belong to him, and in that sense those people are neither alive nor dead but rather exist as ghosts, between two worlds, never fully seen but present in his life, and now in mine as well.

As I join Noah on his search, I become aware that ghosts ��� the ghosts of the dead, the ghosts of his history ��� haunt us both. We always know less than we want to.

���How old was your mother when you were born?��� I ask him one day, trying to imagine his family.

Noah answers: ���Forty-four, I think. Old, right?���

He is almost 44 and doesn���t have children of his own.

���Are you old?��� I ask.

���I guess so,��� he says. ���Growing up as an only child to parents in their mid-40s wasn���t easy, and for some reason, I always imagined I had a twin brother who had died in childbirth. But I didn���t. My mother used to get annoyed when I joked about it. She thought it was another one of my crazy ideas about death. I secretly imagined we were both Noah. Noah One and Noah Two ��� like Thing One and Thing Two from the Dr. Seuss story.���

���And you, are you Noah One or Noah Two?��� I ask.

���Of course I am Noah Two, do I look like a Noah One?��� he replies playfully. ���It reminds me of Ronald One and Ronald Two from Marie���s life. Do you think she loved them equally? Don���t you think she married Ronald Two only because she missed her first Ronald and wished he were alive?���

I listen to Noah and think about the lonely little boy that he once was, preoccupied with the idea of the death of his parents and what he calls his ���bizarre fantasies��� about a lost brother. There are so many gaps in his narrative, so many missing details, and in his therapy we try to fill them in: to imagine who he used to be; to consider the meanings of his dreams and fantasies; to understand his childhood yearning for a brother and the anguish he constantly felt but couldn���t quite name.

As time passes, Noah stops investigating obituaries and begins to talk more about his own psychic losses, his symbolic deaths. We talk about the dead brother as representing the ���dead��� parts of himself, including his depressive withdrawal from the world, and the emotionally deadened aspects of his parents, both of whom are still involved in his life. His mother, especially, has always struck him as disconnected, as if she is emotionally invested in something she has left behind.

We all have our phantoms. But as the psychoanalysts Maria Torok and Nicolas Abraham once wrote, ���what haunts are not the dead, but the gaps left within us by the secrets of others.��� They were referring to intergenerational secrets and unprocessed experiences that very often don���t have a voice or an image associated with them but loom in our minds nonetheless. We carry emotional material that belongs to our parents and grandparents, retaining losses of theirs that they never fully articulated. We feel these traumas even if we don���t consciously know them. Old family secrets live inside of us.

ONE Saturday night, I receive an email from Noah. ���Dr. Atlas,��� he writes. ���This morning, two shocking things happened. I couldn���t wait until our session to tell you.��� The first announcement is that his mother died early this morning. The second is that he has found his dead brother.

���This morning,��� his email continues, ���as I hugged my father, he told me that there was one thing they never wanted to burden me with. He said, ���We decided when you were little that you would never find out the secret until one of us died.�������� The secret is that there was another son, about a year older, who died before Noah was born.

���My parents have reserved their burial plots next to a very small grave,��� Noah goes on. ���We will bury my mother there tomorrow afternoon. Noah One was buried there 44 years ago, at the age of 8 months, just a few months before I was born and named after him. They did not want to weigh me down with that, to cause me pain or devastation.���

After decades of searching, Noah Two can now complete the obituary.
