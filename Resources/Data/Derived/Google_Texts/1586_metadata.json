The relay is expected to kick off in May in Brasilia and will continue for about 100 days. The torch will travel nearly 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) of Brazilian roads and fly some 16,000 kilometers (10,000 miles) over the north and mid-west parts of the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to show the world the chemistry that we believe will be born when the Olympic flame meets the warmth of the Brazilian people,\u201d local organizing committee president Carlos Nuzman said.\n\nThe design was created by Sao Paulo-based design studio Chelles & Hayashi, which won a tender over more than 70 agencies.\n\nEach torch weighs between 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) and 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) and measures 63.5 centimeters (25 inches) when contracted and 69 centimeters (27 inches) when expanded. Organizers said lightweight materials were used to improve the experience of the torchbearers, as well as a design that induces a grip closer to the torch\u2019s center of gravity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rio de Janeiro organizers unveiled the Olympic torch for the 2016 Games on Friday, saying it brings together \"movement, innovation and Brazilian flavor.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Rio de Janeiro organizers unveiled the Olympic torch for the 2016 Games on Friday, saying it brings together \u201cmovement, innovation and Brazilian flavor.\u201d", "title": "Rio 2016 organizers unveil Olympic torch", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/3/rio-2016-organizers-unveil-olympic-torch/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/03/fec6d437a03b291d7b0f6a706700b53b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/03/fec6d437a03b291d7b0f6a706700b53b.jpg", "title": "Rio 2016 organizers unveil Olympic torch", "description": "Rio de Janeiro organizers unveiled the Olympic torch for the 2016 Games on Friday, saying it brings together \"movement, innovation and Brazilian flavor.\"", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe design of the Rio 2016 torch was inspired by the Olympic spirit, our country\u2019s nature, and the harmonious diversity and energy of our people,\u201d said Beth Lula, the brand director for the local organizing committee.\nThe torch, crafted from recycled aluminum and resin with a satin finish, innovates with different segments that open up when the Olympic flame is passed from one torchbearer to another.\nBRASILIA, Brazil (AP) - Rio de Janeiro organizers unveiled the Olympic torch for the 2016 Games on Friday, saying it brings together \u201cmovement, innovation and Brazilian flavor.\u201dOrganizers said the torch\u2019s design was inspired by Brazil\u2019s \u201cnature, and the harmonious diversity and energy\u201d of the Brazilian people.\n\u201cWe used the specific stroke of the Rio 2016 brand to design the torch\u2019s contours.\u201dAbout 12,000 torchbearers will carry the Olympic flame across some 300 cities and towns in the 26 Brazilian states and the federal district.\n\u201cWe want to show the world the chemistry that we believe will be born when the Olympic flame meets the warmth of the Brazilian people,\u201d local organizing committee president Carlos Nuzman said."}
