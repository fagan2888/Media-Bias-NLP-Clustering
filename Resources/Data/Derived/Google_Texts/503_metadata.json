According to the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., federally insured credit unions (FICU) have outpaced banks in small-business loan growth over the past several years. Here\u2019s what the numbers say:\n\n2011: Small-business lending up 5.1 percent at FICUs, down 4.3 percent at banks.\n\n2012: Up 6.5 percent at FICUs, down 1.5 percent at banks.\n\n2013: Up 10.1 percent at FICUs, down 0.5 percent at banks.\n\n2014: Up 12.4 percent at FICUs, up a modest 1.9 percent at banks.\n\nUnfortunately, credit unions have been hampered from doing more business lending by an arbitrary lending cap that limits their business loans to 12.25 percent of assets.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLawmakers and regulators have long recognized credit unions\u2019 value to Main Street businesses, which help create jobs and boost our economy. In the past few weeks, credit unions have seen several new bills introduced in Congress that would help advance their ability to provide access to much-needed capital to small-business members:\n\n\u2022 Reps. Ed Royce (R-Calif.) and Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), both on the House Financial Services Committee, recently reintroduced H.R. 1188, the Credit Union Small Business Jobs Creation Act of 2015, legislation to raise the credit union member business loan cap from 12.25 percent to 27.5 percent of assets for eligible institutions.\n\n\u2022 Rep. Jeff Miller (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, recently reintroduced a bill, H.R. 1133, which would exclude business loans made to veterans from the statutory credit union member business lending (MBL) cap.\n\nWhile this legislation is pending, credit unions are not resting on their laurels. Maria Contreras-Sweet, the administrator for the Small Business Administration (SBA), and I recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to invest in America\u2019s future entrepreneurs and economy. This partnership affords credit unions much-needed flexibility and more access to SBA to help serve their small- business members. Credit unions have always wanted to do more to help their small-business members, and this initiative will go a long way toward making that possible.\n\nMember business lending is one of the key tenets of NAFCU\u2019s five-point plan for regulatory relief and NAFCU\u2019s new \u201cTop Ten\u201d list of regulatory requirements that should be eliminated or amended to ensure regulatory relief. Credit unions did not contribute to the financial crisis yet are still subject to increasing regulatory requirements mandated under the Dodd-Frank Act. Broad-based regulatory relief continues to be a top priority for NAFCU.\n\nCredit unions proved to be a particularly valuable resource for small businesses during the financial crisis. A 2011 study commissioned by the SBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy found that bank business lending was largely unaffected by changes in credit unions\u2019 business lending, and credit unions\u2019 business lending can actually help offset declines in bank business lending during a recession. The study indicates that, during the 2007-2010 financial crisis, while banks\u2019 small-business lending decreased, credit union business lending increased in terms of the percentage of their assets both before and during the crisis, which is highlighted by the chart above.\n\nThe time is right for Congress to act now to allow credit unions to build on their successes and allow them to fulfill their mandate to serve their small-business members to the best of their ability.\n\nBerger is president and CEO of the National Association of Federal Credit Unions.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Lawmakers and regulators have long recognized credit unions\u2019 value to Main Street businesses.", "description": "Lawmakers and regulators have long recognized credit unions\u2019 value to Main Street businesses.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "B.
