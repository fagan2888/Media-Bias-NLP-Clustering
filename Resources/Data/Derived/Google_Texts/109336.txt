“The Hunting Ground,” the 2015 film documentary about sexual assault on American college campuses, will be broadcast at 9 p.m. Thursday on CNN.

The film provides dozens of candid interviews with sex assault victims from college campuses. Three cases of sex assaults allegedly committed by University of Notre Dame male students are recounted in the film, and the three women who reported the cases were all Saint Mary’s students.

The broadcast will be followed at 11 p.m. with a round-table discussion featuring legal and counseling professionals, and the filmmakers, according to CNN. The discussion will be moderated by CNN New Day anchor Alisyn Camerota.

The film has been shown throughout the year on many college campuses, including at Notre Dame, Saint Mary’s and Indiana University South Bend.

CNN will provide encore broadcasts at midnight Thursday and 9 p.m. Nov. 22.
