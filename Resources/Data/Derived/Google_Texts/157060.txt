Tim Allen (as Mike Baxer) is always good for a conservative political joke on ABC's Last Man Standing. Tonight he took a jab at the failure of Obamacare.

(To set the scene, in the opening of the episode "He Shed, She Shed," Mike comes home to find Vanessa has taken over his office space.)

Vanessa: Hi, honey. I needed more space. Mike: We talked about this. You working at my desk was a one-time experiment that failed, like Obamacare.

Oh, how I WISH Obamacare was a one-time experiment! Instead, weâ€™re stuck with this failure with no end in sight.
