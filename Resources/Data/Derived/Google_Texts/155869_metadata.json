Tom Corbett became the ninth Republican governor to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. He will likely not be the last. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is actively negotiating with the Obama administration, and GOP leaders in Tennessee and Wyoming are reportedly developing expansion proposals of their own.\n\nAs Republican governors cave, a narrative is taking shape that the Obama administration is willing to work with state leaders in good faith and seriously address their concerns in exchange for expanding Medicaid under the ACA. Sometimes the media refers to these GOP proposals as \u201calternatives,\u201d as if states were not expanding their Medicaid programs at all but devising something wholly new. Because the White House has shown a willingness to compromise and accommodate Republican ideas, the argument goes, the only possible justification for rejecting Medicaid expansion at this point is irrational ideology or partisan politics.\n\nThis is nonsense. It\u2019s like saying states should have set up their own health insurance exchanges in order to have more control over them. Remember that argument? Turns out the exchanges were never going to be anything but a mechanism to deliver standardized insurance plans according to federal rules. No wonder most states opted for the default federal exchange in the end. Whatever control they might have had over the exchanges was merely cosmetic\u2014a thin ruse to get states to implement an otherwise rigid federal policy on their own dime.\n\nSo too with Medicaid expansion. The \u201caccommodations\u201d the White House has granted to a handful of GOP-controlled states pay lip service to the notion of state flexibility while rejecting any substantive reforms to traditional Medicaid.\n\nA Closer Look at the Medicaid Expansions The deal Corbett cut with the feds is a case in point. In negotiations with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the governor requested dozens of changes to Medicaid for the expansion group (those earning less than 133 percent of federal poverty, or $15,500). He wanted to tie cost-sharing reductions to employment and job training, for example, and increase co-pays for a non-emergency ER visit from $8 to a whopping $10.\n\nOther states have agreed to Medicaid expansion alternatives only to discover the concessions they thought they won were illusory. Almost all these requests were denied. In fact, as Josh Archambault and Nic Horton noted at Forbes, \u201cnot a single \u2018state-unique\u2019 request was approved as included in Corbett\u2019s original application. Of the roughly 24 changes he asked for, only 3 were granted, but in severely watered down forms.\u201d\n\nThis should not come as a surprise. Other states have agreed to Medicaid expansion alternatives only to discover the concessions they thought they won were illusory. Arkansas\u2019 much-vaunted \u201cprivate option,\u201d whereby the state would use Medicaid expansion funds to pay for private coverage on the exchange, obliged the state to pay for all Medicaid benefits not covered by a private plan and also kept all cost-sharing restrictions in place. In practice, this meant Medicaid expansion enrollees would get superior private insurance, plus all the additional Medicaid benefits, but wouldn\u2019t be charged higher co-pays or deductibles than those in the traditional Medicaid program. That\u2019s partly why Arkansas ran into massive cost overruns earlier this year, prompting state leaders to seek a federal bailout.\n\nThe media nevertheless continues to propagate the myth that minor bureaucratic tweaks to Medicaid are something more than window dressing on the standard Obamacare Medicaid expansion. A piece from Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff last week, for example, posited that the Obama administration has been willing to bend Medicaid to entice GOP governors to expand, but not break it. It\u2019s unclear what Kliff means by \u201cbend,\u201d since almost all the changes CMS has approved for \u201calternative\u201d expansion plans involve things that were allowed under federal waivers prior to the ACA.\n\nEnding Health Care Innovation The one case Kliff cites where a state was arguably doing something innovative in its Medicaid program prior to the ACA\u2014the pre-Pence Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP), which uses health savings accounts to encourage cost-conscious health care consumption\u2014is actually a model lesson in why states should not embark on Medicaid expansion negotiations with the White House. As I explained in these pages back in May, Pence\u2019s Medicaid expansion scheme\u2014dubbed HIP 2.0\u2014simply dresses up an entitlement program to look like consumer-driven health coverage, which it manifestly is not.\n\nMedicaid is an entitlement program, after all, which means you can\u2019t kick anyone out if they\u2019re eligible, no matter what. Consider the details of Pence\u2019s expansion proposal. While Kliff rightly notes that under the original HIP, enrollees had to contribute a monthly premium to their health savings accounts (HSAs) or get kicked out of the program, she fails to mention that HIP 2.0 would get rid of such requirements. If enrollees don\u2019t pay their premiums, they\u2019ll simply be bumped down to a \u201cHIP basic\u201d plan, which still requires nominal co-pays, but paid out of an HSA account funded entirely by Medicaid. Deductibles would increase, but who cares? They would be paid with taxpayer dollars, defeating the entire purpose of using health savings accounts in the first place.\n\nKliff writes that HIP 2.0 \u201cwould, by far, be the broadest use of health-savings accounts in the Medicaid program\u2014so broad that Pence wasn\u2019t initially sure the White House would sign off.\u201d Why might the White House refuse to sign off? Because the old HIP program kicked people out if they didn\u2019t pay their premiums and dumped them back into traditional Medicaid. If you want to put the entire Medicaid population into something like HIP 2.0, as Pence is proposing, you can\u2019t require enrollees to pay anything. Medicaid is an entitlement program, after all, which means you can\u2019t kick anyone out if they\u2019re eligible, no matter what. Federal law simply won\u2019t allow it.\n\nDon\u2019t Look at the Feds Behind the Curtain And here we arrive at the heart of the problem with Medicaid expansion: it\u2019s a federal entitlement program, and the feds write the rules\u2014thousands of pages of mind-numbing rules, down to the minutest detail\u2014and every one of them trumps whatever conflicting rules a state might want to put in place.\n\nRepublican governors are bending over backwards to call their schemes anything but Medicaid expansion. Republican governors like Corbett and Pence know this, and are therefore at pains to appear as though they\u2019re winning big concessions from the Obama administration. They want their constituents to think they\u2019re getting something important and substantive in return for capitulating. They are bending over backwards to call their schemes anything but Medicaid expansion. They are loath to admit that expansion is even a feature of Obamacare, let alone one of its pillars.\n\nThe media is trying to do the same thing, although for different reasons. If they can make it seem like the White House will meet GOP governors halfway on Medicaid expansion, governors who refuse to negotiate with the feds must be acting in bad faith. They must be ideological. They must be obtuse. Most of all, they must not care about the poor.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Thu, 04 Sep 2014 07:40:49 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The \u2018accommodations\u2019 the White House has granted to a handful of GOP-controlled states pay lip service to state flexibility while rejecting any substantive reforms to traditional Medicaid.", "title": "The Myth Of \u2018Alternative\u2019 Medicaid Expansions", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/8639003804_2bd2b5f140_b.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-08T07:46:47+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/09/04/the-myth-of-alternative-medicaid-expansions/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "The \u2018accommodations\u2019 the White House has granted to a handful of GOP-controlled states pay lip service to state flexibility while rejecting any substantive reforms to traditional Medicaid.", "title": "The Myth Of \u2018Alternative\u2019 Medicaid Expansions", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/8639003804_2bd2b5f140_b.jpg"}, "creator": "@johnddavidson", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,GOP governors,Medicaid,Medicaid Expansion,Mike Pence,Republican governors,Tom Corbett", "published_time": "2014-09-04T07:40:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-08T07:46:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The \u2018accommodations\u2019 the White House has granted to a handful of GOP-controlled states pay lip service to state flexibility while rejecting any substantive reforms to traditional Medicaid."}, "article_summary": "The media nevertheless continues to propagate the myth that minor bureaucratic tweaks to Medicaid are something more than window dressing on the standard Obamacare Medicaid expansion.\nIn practice, this meant Medicaid expansion enrollees would get superior private insurance, plus all the additional Medicaid benefits, but wouldn\u2019t be charged higher co-pays or deductibles than those in the traditional Medicaid program.\nRepublican governors are bending over backwards to call their schemes anything but Medicaid expansion.\nThey are bending over backwards to call their schemes anything but Medicaid expansion.\nOther states have agreed to Medicaid expansion alternatives only to discover the concessions they thought they won were illusory."}
