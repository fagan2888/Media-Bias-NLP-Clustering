He\u2019s not a blue character with a floppy red cap, but the news story he ignited would have made more sense had it been a fictional cartoon.\n\nThe Mets second baseman missed two games last week to be with his wife and newborn child. He is permitted three days of paternity leave in the collective bargaining agreement. This type of absence happens frequently in Major League Baseball, which has gradually clomped out of the cave.\n\nAttendance was required only for conception, baseball curmudgeons said with a straight face for the past century. The pendulum has swung. Family comes first in many workplaces. Which is what made the comments of former father of the year Boomer Esiason so appalling. He has raised millions of dollars in the battle against cystic fibrosis, which inflicts his inspiring son, Gunnar. Yet he said Murphy should have instructed his wife to \u201chave a C-section before the season starts. I need to be at opening day, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t just insensitive, it\u2019s selfish and stupid. Esiason implied Murphy\u2019s attendance at the Mets\u2019 Citi Field was necessary because it helps provide a better life for his family. He\u2019s made $10.3 million entering this season. I don\u2019t think his kids are worried about paying for books at the local community college. New York radio- show host Mike Francesca continued the rant, telling fathers: \u201cYour wife doesn\u2019t need your help the first couple of days; you know that you\u2019re not doing much the first couple days with the baby that was just born.\u201d\n\nI think what he meant was that \u201cYour future ex-wife doesn\u2019t need your help.\u201d\n\nThere are some moments that can be missed. Holiday dinners, parties, family reunions. The birth of a child when your employer actually encourages the absence in name of your well-being?\n\nPapa Murph made the right decision, correctly eschewing the club-wielding and pelt-wearing for one of the most important days of his family\u2019s life.\n\nFootnotes. It should come as no surprise that Carlos Gonzalez homered Friday. His family is in town. \u201cI always try to put on a show for them,\u201d Gonzalez said. His mom watches every Rockies game on TV in Venezuela and texts CarGo with advice. \u201cShe loves baseball,\u201d he said. \u2026 The Dodgers\u2019 chemistry bears watching. The Yasiel Puig dynamic can be overstated, but when Nick Punto and Skip Schumaker left Los Angeles as free agents \u2014 they are considered premier clubhouse guys \u2014 it left a void. \u2026 There are wrinkles to iron out with baseball\u2019s replay review. The system is welcomed, but at some point the managers need to be removed and have everything reviewed from an eye in the sky, like in college football.\n\nTroy E.
