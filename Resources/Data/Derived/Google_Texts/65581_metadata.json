Their styles are so tuned to clash with each other, their careers so intertwined, a third fight between them seemed certain.\n\nFive years ago, within two months, Denver\u2019s Alvarado and California\u2019s Rios twice fought and won on the same cards at the National Western Complex Arena. And in the long route from the stockyards to world titles, Alvarado and Rios gave each other their first career defeats.\n\nSo a score was left to settle Saturday night at the FirstBank Center in the capper to what set up as a classic boxing trilogy, one that was supposed to echo the bloodied series between Micky Ward and Arturo Gatti, and Marco Antonio Barrera and Erik Morales.\n\nThe result came quickly. Rios battered Alvarado from the jump, rocking him with a right uppercut in the third round that sent Alvarado to one knee \u2014 the first time either fighter was knocked down in 23 rounds between them. Alvarado teetered from there.\n\nBefore the fourth round, the ringside physician held up two fingers in front of Alvarado\u2019s face and asked him how many.\n\n\u201cFour,\u201d Alvarado said.\n\nFight over. Rios won by technical knockout in a brutal end to the three-fight set. It will probably stand as a disappointing end to Alvarado\u2019s career, although he wasn\u2019t willing to make that concession.\n\n\u201cIt was all in the preparation. I didn\u2019t train like I should have,\u201d Alvarado said while getting booed by the home crowd. \u201cI got what I should have got. I\u2019ll get myself out there again.\u201d\n\nRios (33-2-1) was sharp throughout. He cut Alvarado (34-4) in the first round and marked up his face with hooks. And 5,988 fight fans started to mix \u201cRi-os\u201d chants in with Alvarado \u201c3-Oh-3\u201d chants.\n\n\u201cIt was my best fight ever,\u201d Rios said. \u201cMy plan was to box from the outside and hit him with body shots.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had nothing, zero,\u201d said Bob Arum, who promoted the fight for Top Rank. \u201cAlvarado looked like he had very little.\u201d\n\nRios landed 120 of his 290 punches thrown in three rounds. Alvarado countered by landing just 20 of the 87 thrown. And Rios was throwing heavy punches \u2014 of 198 power shots, he landed 100.\n\n\u201cOur careers were on the line,\u201d Rios said. \u201cI had to prove to everybody that I\u2019m here to stay.\u201d\n\nAlvarado\u2019s best punch, a left hook in the second that pushed Rios back a step, failed to turn the tide. And Rios took over in the third before forcing a stoppage.\n\nIn their first two bouts, Alvarado and Rios battered each other bloody. In Carson, Calif., the two lobbed power shots and jabs with so much frequency, they had little time to move their feet. And Rios finally caught Alvarado with a body shot that tipped him toward a standing TKO.\n\nAlvarado evened the score five months later, winning a unanimous decision and the World Boxing Organization world title.\n\nThose first two bouts saw an incredible number of punches \u2014 an average of 158.1 per round, more than twice the welterweight average, according to CompuBox. And 65 percent of the punches were power shots.\n\nBut all those bloody brawls have taken a toll on Alvarado and Rios.\n\nAlvarado is 34, with a 2-4 mark in his six most recent brutal bouts. And with legal trouble looming after an arrest this month for weapon possession in Denver, his next career move is on hold.\n\nRios, 28, remains a big draw in boxing. But with a 3-2 record since his first meeting against Alvarado, Rios hinted prefight that he may consider retiring, although he contradicted that after the fight.\n\nFor their trouble Saturday, Rios took home an $850,000 fight purse. Alvarado made $785,000.\n\nIn the co-main event, 23-year-old light heavyweight Gilberto Ramirez (31-0) of Mazatlan, Mexico, earned a unanimous decision victory over Maxim Vlasov (30-2) by three scores of 97-93.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mike Alvarado loses to Brandon Rios by TKO after brutal third round", "title": "Mike Alvarado loses to Brandon Rios by TKO after brutal third round", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/24/mike-alvarado-loses-to-brandon-rios-by-tko-after-brutal-third-round/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20150124_093453_mike-alvarado-brandon-rios-III.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20150124_093453_mike-alvarado-brandon-rios-III.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-24T21:36:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T21:16:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Alvarado evened the score five months later, winning a unanimous decision and the World Boxing Organization world title.\nIn their first two bouts, Alvarado and Rios battered each other bloody.\nBut with a 3-2 record since his first meeting against Alvarado, Rios hinted prefight that he may consider retiring, although he contradicted that after the fight.\nAnd in the long route from the stockyards to world titles, Alvarado and Rios gave each other their first career defeats.\nBROOMFIELD \u2014 Mike Alvarado and Brandon Rios always walked in lockstep."}
