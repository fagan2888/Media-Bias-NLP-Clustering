According to Andrew Lee, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Sheffield in England, most infections are spread by people who fail to show any symptoms. This is explained by the 80/20 rule, phenomena observed in both human and animal populations that speculate that 80 percent of all infections are spread by only 20 percent of the infected. These 20 percent are aptly named \u201csuper-spreaders,\u201d and they are truly a force to be reckoned with.\n\nLee explains that although many scientists acknowledge the existence of super-spreaders, they aren\u2019t quite sure what causes their super-spreading capabilities, as reported in The Independent. It\u2019s believed that it may lie in how their body chooses to fight off an infection. For example, when most of us become sick our immune systems fight back to defeat the invading pathogen. In the fight against the infection, our bodies usually receive a bit of collateral damage, hence our feeling poorly.\n\nIt\u2019s suspected that super-spreaders are able to tolerate an infection. The pathogen is able to live inside the body without inciting an attack from the immune system. This causes the person to have little or no symptoms, but still be highly contagious.\n\nThis theory has been supported in animal studies. Researchers purposely created super spreader mice and found that although they shed considerable amounts of bacteria they also experienced poor health. Mice that were natural super spreaders did not experience poor health. Furthermore, when the researchers suppressed the immune system response of non-super-spreader mice their health improved.\n\nIn his article, Lee highlights that one of the biggest implications of super spreaders is their inability to show symptoms.\n\n\u201cSuch individuals are a hidden threat who would continue to live and move freely within their communities where they could unwittingly transmit infection on to others,\u201d Lee wrote.\n\nThere have already been documented cases of outbreaks suspected to be steamrolled by super-spreader. For example, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome pandemic in 2003 was reported to have 75 percent of infections specifically linked to these super-spreaders.\n\nThere are more than biological factors in the creation of super-spreaders. In his 2010 study, Dr. Richard Stering from Princeton University highlights that co-infection with other pathogens, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers all play a role in the super-spreading event.\n\n\u201cPredicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans,\u201d wrote Stein.\n\nSuper-spreaders may be identified via mass screenings, contact tracing, and isolation of infected victims, but as we\u2019ve learned from past outbreaks, including the current Ebola outbreak, these methods are not foolproof.\n\nStill, it\u2019s important that more effective methods to identify these important individuals are developed because, as Lee puts it, \u201cif the 20 per cent of infected individuals who spread 80 per cent of infections are identified early and managed appropriately, 80 per cent of onward infections within the community could be avoided \u2013 a tantalizing prize for public health.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "viral, infections, spread, only, 20, population, what, makes, super, spreaders, so, contagious", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Under the 80/20 theory, most viral infections are spread by only 20 percent of the population: \"super spreaders.\"", "title": "20% Of People Spread The Majority Of Viruses", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/viral-infections-spread-only-20-population-what-makes-super-spreaders-so-contagious-313172", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/04/spread.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Under the 80/20 theory, most viral infections are spread by only 20 percent of the population: \"super spreaders.\"", "title": "20% Of People Spread The Majority Of Viruses", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/viral-infections-spread-only-20-population-what-makes-super-spreaders-so-contagious-313172", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/04/spread.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/04/spread.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-12-04T17:06:47-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-04T17:06:46-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Under the 80/20 theory, most viral infections are spread by only 20 percent of the population: \"super spreaders.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16ff\"", "article_summary": "According to Andrew Lee, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Sheffield in England, most infections are spread by people who fail to show any symptoms.\nThis is explained by the 80/20 rule, phenomena observed in both human and animal populations that speculate that 80 percent of all infections are spread by only 20 percent of the infected.\nThese 20 percent are aptly named \u201csuper-spreaders,\u201d and they are truly a force to be reckoned with.\nFor example, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome pandemic in 2003 was reported to have 75 percent of infections specifically linked to these super-spreaders.\nResearchers purposely created super spreader mice and found that although they shed considerable amounts of bacteria they also experienced poor health."}
