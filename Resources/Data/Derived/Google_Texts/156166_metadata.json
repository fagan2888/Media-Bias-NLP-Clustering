Hospital leaders must know that today's doctors are \"fiercely competitive\"--a trait that, if leveraged properly, can be a powerful motivator, he writes. Further, physicians care very deeply about their patients and their health outcomes, but have not necessarily been trained to address the health needs of the rest of the community.\n\nModern physicians also, perhaps unlike generations before them, strive to maintain a healthy work-life balance, a trend their bosses must be aware of if they \"wish to keep them once they've paid off their debts,\" Goldsmith writes. Along the same lines, hospital leaders can expect to lose their most talented doctors if these physicians find their practices are being managed poorly with substandard clinical leaders and practice managers, he argues.\n\nBut understanding these key traits of today's doctors--and recognizing that they are a \"different species\" from healthcare executives--isn't enough to achieve successful integration. Hospital leaders also must practice transparency and integrity by promising only what they can actually deliver and being honest about what they don't know, Goldsmith writes.\n\nAnother way to improve the relationship between hospitals and their employed doctors is to empower physician leadership, FierceHealthcare has reported. Some ways to achieve this include prioritizing patients and performance, streamlining processes and conducting effective evaluations.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n4 steps for successful hospital-physician integration\n\nPrimary care physicians, specialists flock to hospital jobs\n\n3 ways for hospitals to promote physician leadership\n\nACPE: Physician leadership linked to organizational success\n\nYoung docs pick hospital jobs over private practice", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u200bHealthcare executives who seek to\u00a0successfully integrate doctors into their organization\u00a0will soon find out the task is easier said than done, argues Jeff Goldsmith, Ph.D., in a recent\u00a0article\u00a0for\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks Magazine, but a good place to start is by taking steps to build physicians' trust.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "\u200bHealthcare executives who seek to\u00a0successfully integrate doctors into their organization\u00a0will soon find out the task is easier said than done, argues Jeff Goldsmith, Ph.D., in a recent\u00a0article\u00a0for\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks Magazine, but a good place to start is by taking steps to build physicians' trust.", "title": "How healthcare executives can gain doctors' trust", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/how-healthcare-executives-can-gain-doctors-trust/2015-02-18", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,physician engagement,Physician Integration,Physician Leadership,Population Health Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "In order to work more effectively with physicians, healthcare executives first must better understand their mindset, Goldsmith writes.\nHospital leaders must know that today's doctors are \"fiercely competitive\"--a trait that, if leveraged properly, can be a powerful motivator, he writes.\nHealthcare executives who seek to successfully integrate doctors into their organization may find the task easier said than done, but taking steps to build physicians' trust is a good start, according to Hospitals & Health Networks Magazine.\nAnother way to improve the relationship between hospitals and their employed doctors is to empower physician leadership, FierceHealthcare has reported.\nHospital leaders also must practice transparency and integrity by promising only what they can actually deliver and being honest about what they don't know, Goldsmith writes."}
