Dear Abby: I have noticed that some people in my age group (60s) are becoming compulsive talkers. These people donâ€™t ask questions of those around them. When someone begins to speak, the compulsive talker interrupts, usually in a louder voice and returns to dominating the conversation. Some of them continue to ramble on even when no one is listening anymore.
