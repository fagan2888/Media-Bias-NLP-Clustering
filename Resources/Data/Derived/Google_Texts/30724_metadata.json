But it all could go to some other state, said advocates who held a Capitol press conference Wednesday with the message: \u201cTake the Money!\u201d\n\nThe money in question is the estimated $51 billion over 10 years that is sitting in Washington D.C., to be sent to Florida to buy health coverage for the poor. If Florida doesn\u2019t take it, they said, it will go to some other state, said Dr. Mona Mangat of St. Petersburg, who drove a big blue bus with three other doctors and 15 navigators to Tallahassee for the event.\n\nShe said the state\u2019s refusal to provide coverage for the poor means thousands of Floridians will suffer and die prematurely each year from illnesses that could have been caught with preventive care. Those patients are part of her practice, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here pleading with state leaders to expand access to health care,\u201d said Mangat, national chairwoman of Doctors for America, an advocacy group. \u201cIf Florida fails to extend coverage, nearly 1 million people (in the state) will be left with no coverage at all.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d she said. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats across the country are putting politics aside and doing the right thing for the people they serve.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as she spoke, health advocates in Arkansas were celebrating Tuesday\u2019s House vote to accept federal funds for what they call the \u201cprivate option.\u201d It passed by the needed 3-to-1 margin, and means Arkansas will take money from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion program and use it to buy private-plan coverage for the uninsured.\n\nArkansas leaders call it the \u201cprivate option\u201d to avoid any reference to Medicaid or Obamacare, hot-button words among Republicans there as in Florida.\n\nAs the Arkansas News reports, the private option is quite similar to the bill that Florida Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, sponsored in Florida last year. It got bipartisan support in the Senate, but Republican leaders in the Florida House blocked it.\n\nArkansas News quotes House Speaker Davy Carter, a Republican, as saying: \u201cI\u2019m proud of the members, I\u2019m proud of everybody coming together. I think the story is about political courage.\u201d\n\nPolitical courage is what speakers at the Tallahassee press conference Wednesday want. They didn\u2019t name names, but they were clearly referring to House Speaker Will Weatherford and fellow Republicans, as Democrats in 2013 all were in favor of Negron's plan. Republicans in Florida have tried to avoid even talking about the issue this year, with an election coming in November.\n\nThere is an exception: Sen. Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah. He has filed a bill (SB 710) that would accept the federal funds and use them for an Arkansas-style private option. A long-shot companion bill in the House (HB 869) is sponsored by Rep. Amanda Murphy, D-New Port Richey.\n\nMurphy said at the press conference that she \u201cjumped for joy\u201d when she learned there was a Republican senator willing to put his name on the bill.\n\nGarcia knows it\u2019s an uphill fight, but one he believes in \u201cpassionately.\u201d Asked why he is optimistic when his colleagues are saying the bill won\u2019t fly, Garcia pointed to his forehead, and a spot of ash to signify his aprticipation in Ash Wednesday worship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about hope,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nHe said the list of objections that House Speaker Will Weatherford has given for rejecting the money doesn't hold up.\n\nFirst, the federal government has promised to pay 100 percent of the cost of covering the low-income uninsured for three years, and 90 percent thereafter. The amount available to Florida for the first decade has been estimated at $51 billion.\n\nWeatherford and his lieutenants have said many times that they don\u2019t believe the federal government will actually hold up its end of the bargain. Garcia said his bill has a sunset provision that would discontinue the program if the federal revenue didn\u2019t come through.\n\n\u201cWhat more protection do you want?\u201d Garcia asked. \u201cLet\u2019s protect the residents of this great state and give them affordable health coverage.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans argue that federal spending is out of control and Florida shouldn\u2019t add to the debt. Garcia said he could accept that argument if the money Florida is turning down would be applied to the debt, but it\u2019s not.\n\n\u201cYou know who that money is going to? Other states, like Ohio and Pennsylvania and the Northeast and California. Does that make sense?\u201d Garcia asked. \u201cAbsolutely not, it does not make sense.\u201d\n\nThe don\u2019t-add-to-the-debt argument also doesn\u2019t hold up when one looks at state leaders\u2019 votes on other matters, Garcia said. They accept billions of dollars in federal funds each year for education and transportation, he said.\n\nThe League of Women Voters of Florida organized the press conference.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A lot of money - $200 million a month or $7 million a day \u2013 could be used to buy health coverage for Florida's poor.
