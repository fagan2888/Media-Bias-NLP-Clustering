The fight had been going on for so long that I had pushed it to the back of my mind and forgotten about it. Hearing about other people\u2019s fights with their health insurance is not that interesting. But I suspect many people with T1D in their families have waged or will wage similar battles. So I\u2019d like to pass along what worked for us.\n\nIt all started with the pump education appointments required when Bisi selected and started on the Omnipod. The endocrinology program at the pediatric hospital where she\u2019s seen requires everyone starting on a pump to go to a class to check out the different pumps, and then to 3 start up appointments to learn how to use the pump (one of them a required visit with a nutritionist). Our insurance covered the Omnipod, so I was surprised and confused when we started getting bills for these four appointments\u2014adding up to $3,000. (Getting all these unexpected bills around Christmas-time was an unwelcome surprise.) What I learned from multiple calls to my husband\u2019s company benefits administrator, our insurance company, the hospital billing department, and her endocrinologist\u2019s office, and from reading through the text of our insurance policy, was that these appointments (in fact, all of Bisi\u2019s diabetes appointments with her nurse educator) had been coded as \u201cnutritional counseling\u201d\u2014and my husband\u2019s insurance only covered three nutritional counseling visits a year\n\nHere\u2019s part of what I wrote in my first appeal, which was rejected.\n\n\u201cThese three appointments [I focused on the pump start up appointments] were essential training sessions where Bisi\u2019s diabetes nurse educator in the endocrine department at XXX showed us how to use a powerful medical device we were completely unfamiliar with. Thankfully, XXX covers the cost of our daughter\u2019s Omnipod pumps and accompanying Personal Diabetes Manager\u2014but it makes no sense that you wouldn\u2019t also cover the training required for us to properly use the device. It\u2019s like covering the cost of a pacemaker without covering the cost of setting it up.\n\nKnowing how to use an insulin pump correctly can literally be a matter of life or death\u2014it is not a matter of nutrition. If we, through lack of training, give our daughter too much insulin with the pump, she could die; or, if we\u2019re lucky, end up in the hospital in a diabetic coma. If we\u2019re not trained how to deal with pump failures, she could end up in the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis caused by high blood sugar. For these reasons, as an insurance company you should be encouraging people to get trained to use an insulin pump, rather than denying them coverage for those appointments\u2026.\n\nThese training appointments are a one-time investment and expense for the insurance company\u2014not something to be lumped into the small number of appointments covered each year under the aegis of nutritional counseling. (Part of me wonders if whoever decided that diabetes health education for type 1 diabetics should fall under the category of nutritional counseling doesn\u2019t understand that type 1 diabetes\u2014unlike type 2\u2014is an autoimmune disease.)\n\nAfter this attempt was rejected, I was told by my insurance that I could file another appeal. At this point, I dug into our plan and into protections offered by the Affordable Care Act to bolster my case. I wrote back to Mark\u2019s insurance company quoting elements of the plan:\n\n\u201c\u2019Essential Health Benefits are defined by federal law\u2019; \u2018Essential Health Benefits provided under this Plan are not subject to lifetime or annual dollar maximums.\u2019 As stated in your plan, Essential Health Benefits include \u2018Chronic disease management and pediatric services.\u2019 Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease, so according to the language in this Summary of Benefits, care related to treatment of our daughter\u2019s disease should be covered.\u201d\n\nI asked Bisi\u2019s endocrinologist to send a letter to our insurance on our behalf, which said, in part:\n\n\u201cIt has come to my attention that these visits are not being covered by your plan as they are being lumped in with her nutritional counseling benefits for the year. These visits are absolutely medically necessary and are not nutritional counseling. It makes no sense to lump them together nor does it make sense to limit the number of visits. Bisi was approved to start an insulin pump and these visits are 100% essential to make sure that her transition to insulin pump therapy occurred safely These extra visits occur only during the initial implementation of pump therapy. Can you please reconsider covering these visits?\u201d\n\nFrom talking to the health insurance, my husband\u2019s company\u2019s health insurance liaison, and the hospital billing department (each of whom blamed the other for the fact that the appointments weren\u2019t covered, leaving us to foot the bill), I learned that the hospital had coded these appointments as pump education, and that our insurance lumped pump education as part of nutritional education. Yet, when I referenced our plan, I saw that:\n\n\u201cOn page 32 of the Benefits booklet for our plan, it\u2019s written that covered benefits for diabetes include: \u2018Diabetes Equipment and outpatient self-management training and education, including nutritional therapy for individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes, insulin-using diabetes, gestational diabetes, and non-insulin using diabetes as prescribed by the Physician.\u2019\u201d\n\nI continued in my letter:\n\n\u201cIn this part of the plan, it seems clear that nutritional therapy falls under the wider umbrella of diabetes treatment. Yet for the purposes of our claim, nutritional benefits are being interpreted in exactly the opposite way\u2014that diabetes care falls under the umbrella of nutritional benefits. This makes no sense for a chronic auto-immune disease like type 1 diabetes, which is in no way caused by how or what someone eats.\n\nWe believe that our coverage is being limited in an unfair way, which seems to us to directly conflict both with what is written in our plan and with the mandate of the Essential Health Benefits portion of the Affordable Care Act to cover chronic conditions.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked my husband\u2019s health insurance liaison about why these appointments weren\u2019t covered under the Essential Health Benefits portion of our family\u2019s health care plan I got this bit of double speak:\n\n\u201cNutritional counseling is covered up to 3 visits with no diagnosis restrictions, which includes diabetic education. Nutritional counseling does not fall into the EH benefit.\u201d\n\nAnd I responded:\n\n\u201cWe are not arguing that nutritional counseling falls under the EH Benefit. However, we are arguing that type 1 diabetes, a chronic disease, falls under the EH Benefit.\u201d\n\nAnd I asked the billing department at our hospital to refrain from sending the bills to a collections agency, since we were still disputing them (the billing department told me to call back every month to make sure the bills didn\u2019t get released to a bill collector). I also asked if perhaps the appointments could be coded differently, under the \u201cinsulin pump initiation code, instruction in initial use of pump\u201d (which my husband found at findacode.com), because I thought this might get around the nutritional counseling limit, and, after all, that code accurately described what went on at the pump appointments. But that effort didn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\nThis appeal, too, was rejected. At this point I considered giving up. I\u2019d spent hours of complete aggravation trying to make my point and unravel this insurance knot, and I was sick of it. But then I decided I should file another appeal, just BECAUSE I\u2019d already spent so much time on this. I didn\u2019t want to just give up (partly because I knew that giving up was exactly what the insurance company was hoping I would do).\n\nSo I sent a short letter as part of a \u201csecond-level appeal,\u201d in which I wrote, in part:\n\n\u201cThese were not nutritional visits; they were training visits essential for teaching us how to use a medical device that can cause great harm if used incorrectly. I feel that XXXX/XXXX\u2019s coverage of only three nutritional counseling/diabetes education visits a year shows a lack of understanding that there are fundamental differences between our daughter\u2019s disease, type 1 diabetes\u2014an auto-immune disease which has made her permanently insulin-dependent\u2014and type 2 diabetes\u2014which is indeed affected by nutrition. Thank you very much for your help and attention to this matter.\u201d\n\nOver the next couple of months, I noticed that the bills from the hospital stopped coming. Then, in digging through an old pile of mail, I found a letter saying we\u2019d won the appeal. Woo hoo!!\n\nI\u2019m quoting it in part here, because I suspect others have or will go through the same rigmarole, and I want you to be armed with a good argument.\n\nThe letter quoted, as I had, the Essential Health Benefits provided under the plan, benefits mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. \u201cAccording to the letter from Dr. XXX, these visits are not nutritional counseling for diabetes but are education self-training for the medical device required to treat your chronic condition, type 1 diabetes. Since this treatment is part of the management for a chronic condition, the annual maximum of three nutritional counseling sessions would not apply.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly what worked, but here is my advice to anyone facing a similar situation:\n\nAppeal, appeal, appeal, and then appeal again. Follow the appeals process through to its end, and see who blinks first. Comb through your benefits package to see if you can find arguments to bolster your case. Don\u2019t expect anyone else, including your employer\u2019s human resources office, to help you come up with ammunition. Ask your doctor to write a letter. Call the billing department to see if the can offer advice on how to approach the insurance company (after all, they want the bill paid ASAP), and to put a hold on your account for as long as the fight continues.\n\nAs anyone on this site knows, living with and treating type 1 diabetes is expensive, aggravating, and time consuming. The last thing anyone touched by this disease needs is more expense, aggravation, and time spent fighting it. I\u2019d rather be using my brain power and time helping my daughter live as well as she can with this disease, not arguing with a health insurance company over her care.", "article_metadata": {"position": 3, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "description": "Recently, when doing an end-of-year bill-paying sweep, I realized we had won a fight with our health insurance over paying for Bisi\u2019s diabetes care.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "robots": "noodp"}, "article_summary": "Nutritional counseling does not fall into the EH benefit.\u201dAnd I responded:\u201cWe are not arguing that nutritional counseling falls under the EH Benefit.\n(Part of me wonders if whoever decided that diabetes health education for type 1 diabetics should fall under the category of nutritional counseling doesn\u2019t understand that type 1 diabetes\u2014unlike type 2\u2014is an autoimmune disease.)\nRecently, when doing an end-of-year bill-paying sweep, I realized we had won a fight with our health insurance over paying for Bisi\u2019s diabetes care.\nHearing about other people\u2019s fights with their health insurance is not that interesting.\nYet for the purposes of our claim, nutritional benefits are being interpreted in exactly the opposite way\u2014that diabetes care falls under the umbrella of nutritional benefits."}
