Bernie Sanders called allegations from Hillary Clinton regarding Sanders’ Healthcare proposal “nonsense”.

The two democratic candidates traded blows over healthcare proposals during this weekend’s Democratic debate hosted by NBC News.

“Is it fair to say Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare,” debate moderator Andrea Mitchell asked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

After dodging the question, Bernie Sanders called out Hillary Clinton.

“She did not answer the question,” Bernie Sanders said.

“What her campaign is saying is he [Sanders] wants to end Obamacare. That is nonsense,” Sanders continued.

Hillary Clinton, in her response to the moderator’s question, described her support for building on President Obama’s signature healthcare bill, the Affordable Healthcare Act, and avoiding repealing and replacing it. She suggests Sanders would like to repeal the Affordable Healthcare Act and replace it with Universal healthcare.

While both Clinton and Sanders support Universal healthcare, Clinton proposes building on Obamacare to achieve such goal. However, Sanders challenges the allegations made by Clinton that he wants to repeal and replace Obamacare.

“It is absolutely inaccurate. Nobody wants to tear up [Obamacare]. We should move forward,” Sanders repeated after Clinton’s continued to push the idea that Sanders would like to “start over.”

The two democratic presidential candidates have been going back and forth lately since polls show the two campaigns are closely tied in the early voting state of Iowa.
