(Photo: Jeffrey Phelps, AP)\n\nCorrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated Carly Fiorina's position on paid maternity leave. She does not believe it should be mandated by the federal government.\n\nThe four Republican debates have touched on the biggest issues in the presidential election, from terrorism and national security to immigration and taxes.\n\nYet, on a number of other critical matters, including plans for replacing Obamacare, equal pay for women and the sensitive issues of racism and criminal justice reform, there\u2019s been little discussion by the top candidates.\n\nIn a number of cases, the questions have been limited to second-tier contestants, such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is no longer in the race, on criminal justice reform. That leaves some open questions for the top candidates, including the current front-runner, Donald Trump.\n\nWomen\u2019s issues\n\nIn one previous debate, Carly Fiorina, the only woman in the GOP field, was asked about her position on paid maternity leave. She said it should not be mandated by the government. But that was just one question to one candidate on a big issue that\u2019s gotten scant attention. Last year, the United Nations\u2019 International Labour Organization said that, out of the 185 countries and territories with available data, the U.S. is one of just three countries that have no paid benefit law. Since then, Oman has established a law, leaving the U.S. alone with Papua New Guinea. Does the rest of the GOP field agree with Fiorina?\n\nCarly Fiorina takes part in a CNN Republican presidential debate at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 16, 2015. (Photo: Mark J. Terrill, AP)\n\nOther issues of interest to women, such as the Paycheck Fairness Act and Lilly Ledbetter Act, have also received little discussion. Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have repeatedly voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act. In an August interview, Trump said he would take a position \u201cin the not too distant future.\u201d\n\nU.S. troop levels in Iraq/Syria\n\nTuesday night will mark the first debate since the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., so candidates have yet to have the opportunity to address how they'd respond on a debate stage. The issue figures to dominate much of the discussion in Las Vegas.\n\nIn recent weeks, though, none of the GOP hopefuls have been specific about how their approaches would be different from the president\u2019s, with the exception of Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator who's called for 20,000 ground troops split between Iraq and Syria. The field's distinction with Hillary Clinton is even less apparent since she supports a no-fly zone. That, experts say, would have to be enforced with a large number of ground troops. The major candidates aren\u2019t committing to that, saying they\u2019ll rely on military advisers or, in the case of Bush and Rubio, that the bulk of the force should be Arab fighters.\n\nLindsey Graham speaks to the media after a debate in Boulder, Colo. (Photo: AP)\n\nBlack Lives Matter, criminal justice reform and voting rights\n\nRepublicans and Democrats agree criminal justice reform is needed. Yet the issue has come up only briefly at Republican debates.\n\nTrump has called the movement \u201ctrouble\u201d and has come under criticism for calling the behavior of a Black Lives Matter protester at a rally \u201cdisgusting\u201d and saying \u201cmaybe he should have been roughed up.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not alone in making provocative statements about the movement, created in the aftermath of multiple police killings of unarmed African Americans. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has said that many such activists \u201cadvocate for the murder of police officers.\u201d Ted Cruz has cited the group as evidence of a new anti-police \u201cculture.\u201d\n\nYet they haven\u2019t had a full discussion of the issues underpinning the movement, including police brutality and racism. While making suggestions, the candidates have not explicitly linked the group to the killing of multiple law enforcement officers across the country. Do they think they\u2019re responsible? Do they believe there is structural racism in policing or just in society in general? Can Cruz provide specifics of what he\u2019s called the movement\u2019s \u201crabid anti-police language?\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Gov.

Their dislike of the policy is dramatic, with Ben Carson even saying it\u2019s the worst thing since slavery.\n\nBen Carson speaks a debate sponsored by Fox Business Network in Milwaukee on Nov. 10, 2015.

In one debate, Fiorina referred briefly to creating high-risk insurance pools at the state level. Beyond that, there hasn\u2019t been much discussion.\n\nThe 2016 Republican field is facing the same dilemma as congressional Republicans, who\u2019ve voted more than 50 times to repeal Obamacare without offering an alternative. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said earlier this month that he\u2019ll roll out a plan next year. He hinted that his plan would include tax credits that, like under Obamacare, help people afford insurance. It would also repeal the individual and employer mandates that have been a target of Republican critics. Given this is a top priority for virtually all of the candidates, there\u2019s lots of room for more details. Trump has said simply that he would replace it with \u201csomething terrific.\u201d\n\nFollow @HeidiPrzybyla on Twitter.\n\nMORE COVERAGE OF THE TUESDAY DEBATE:\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1YhyrNX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The GOP debates have touched on the biggest issues in the election, from terrorism and national security to immigration and taxes.
