You can call it anything you want, but I want \u2014 including people that don\u2019t have anything,\u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201cThe John Fredericks Show.\u201d about \u201cWe gotta do that.\u201d\n\nMr. Fredericks, a Virginia-based radio host who has predicted that Mr. Trump will win the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, had asked Mr. Trump how to reconcile his statements critical of President Obama\u2019s health care law with past statements in which Mr. Trump was warm to the notion of universal health care coverage.\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m a very conservative guy \u2026 number one, the people that can do it, we\u2019re going to get them plans that are so good and we\u2019re going to break the borders, we\u2019re going to go [to] the private plans,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cA lot of people had plans they loved before Obamacare came along. You probably did. I have friends that had really good plans \u2014 now they have horrible plans and they\u2019re paying five times more for [them].\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get great plans, we\u2019re not going to have huge costs \u2014 the biggest thing the government has to do is make sure these companies are very, very solvent, you know, that they\u2019re very strong,\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause what you don\u2019t want is having a company collapse, right? So that\u2019s the only function of the government.\n\n\u201cThen on top of that, the people that can\u2019t afford to do that, we have to help them out at the lower level, we have to help them out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I would make deals with hospitals and I\u2019d make deals with people where they can get them care, John. I mean, you can\u2019t have a guy that has no money that\u2019s sick and he can\u2019t go see a doctor, he can\u2019t go see a hospital. I just don\u2019t think [you] can have that, \u2018cause I\u2019m actually a conservative with a heart. And if I lose votes for that, I don\u2019t really care.\n\n\u201cBecause you have to take care of poor people \u2014 I mean, think of yourself: you\u2019re really sick and you\u2019re not allowed to see a doctor. I mean, it\u2019s almost like, sort of \u2026 being in hell,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSo we have to take care of people that are poor. We have to do it. And we can make a plan, we can work a deal \u2014 I can work a deal with hospitals that\u2019ll be great for everybody and they\u2019ll be able to go there.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to want to do that \u2014 it won\u2019t be pretty, it won\u2019t be as nice as the other \u2014 but at least they\u2019re being taken care of,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd under Obamacare, they\u2019re actually not being taken care of very well, either. But Obamacare is a disaster; it\u2019s going to cost a fortune and it really kicks in in \u201816 and it has to be repealed and replaced and we can do a great job with that, I have no doubt \u2014 I\u2019m very expert on that stuff.\n\n\u201cYou know, I have thousands of people working for me and I have great plans and \u2026 they got lucky but I have good people so I guess I got lucky, too,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Fredericks said he\u2019s \u201cthe only media person this side of the Milky Way\u201d that\u2019s predicting Mr. Trump, who has surged to first in a poll released this week on the 2016 GOP field, will ultimately win the nomination.\n\nMr. Trump said \u201cyou may be right\u201d and that he will work hard to make him right.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always right,\u201d Mr. Fredericks said.\n\n\u201cYou are always right \u2014 have a good time John, thank you very much,\u201d Mr. Trump said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Businessman Donald Trump on Thursday said the country has to provide health care for the poor and that he's \"actually a conservative with a heart\" who can work out deals with hospitals to make it happen.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Businessman Donald Trump on Thursday said the country has to provide health care for the poor and that he\u2019s \u201cactually a conservative with a heart\u201d who can work out deals with hospitals to make it happen.", "title": "Donald Trump: \u2018I\u2019m actually a conservative with a heart\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/16/donald-trump-im-actually-a-conservative-with-a-hea/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/15/7403a8e58b60391f7c0f6a7067009081.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/15/7403a8e58b60391f7c0f6a7067009081.jpg", "description": "Businessman Donald Trump on Thursday said the country has to provide health care for the poor and that he's \"actually a conservative with a heart\" who can work out deals with hospitals to make it happ", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Donald Trump: \u2018I\u2019m actually a conservative with a heart"}, "Author": "David Sherfinski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Donald Trump"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1701\"", "article_summary": "I mean, it\u2019s almost like, sort of \u2026 being in hell,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nMr. Trump said \u201cyou may be right\u201d and that he will work hard to make him right.\n\u201cYou are always right \u2014 have a good time John, thank you very much,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\u201cI\u2019m always right,\u201d Mr. Fredericks said.\nI just don\u2019t think [you] can have that, \u2018cause I\u2019m actually a conservative with a heart."}
