Travel farther out on the right and left, and ultimately the sides bend to a common position on an issue like taxpayer subsidies for big business. To many progressives, such expenditures are giveaways to the already wealthy. To many conservatives, they are a free-market-distorting waste of taxpayer resources. Both sides also often criticize the subsidies as an instrument of cronyism and corruption.\n\nIn recent years, taxpayer subsidies for corporations have become a huge expense: The New York Times estimates that states and cities now spend more than $80 billion a year on such so-called \u201cincentives.\u201d For the most part, this gravy train has not faced much pressure to slow down.\n\nBut now, as the 2016 presidential campaign intensifies, both the left and the right will have a prime opportunity to spotlight its critiques. That is because one of the most prominent Republican presidential candidates \u2014 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2014 has made such subsidies a central part of his public policy agenda. Those subsidies have produced both high-profile scandals and lackluster economic results.\n\nIn 2011, Walker created the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation to give businesses taxpayer loans and grants. Within a few years, state auditors published reports spotlighting \u201cconcerns with WEDC\u2019s administration and oversight of its economic development programs and its financial management.\u201d Specifically, auditors said \u201cWEDC did not require grant and loan recipients to submit information showing that contractually required jobs were actually created or retained\u201d and also noted that money was handed out \u201cin ways that did not consistently comply\u201d with state law.\n\nMuch of the cash flowed to Walker\u2019s political allies. According to a new report by the left-leaning One Wisconsin Institute, 60 percent of the $1.14 billion given out by the WEDC went to firms connected to Walker\u2019s campaign contributors \u2014 that includes more than $2.1 million those donors have given Walker\u2019s election campaigns directly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taxing the poor to subsidize massive corporations is calamitous in the long term.
