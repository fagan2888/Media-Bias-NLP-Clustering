Staring at the camera, he says,\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken time out of my busy day to try and put to rest one of the more moronic things I have seen on the internet lately.\u201d\n\nTye of the Georgia-based Purgatory Iron Works explains that he has heard through his Facebook feed \u201cthat old tired argument\u201d that jet fuel burns at 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit, but that the melting point of steel is 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. Thus, 9/11 sceptics argue that the official explanation for the collapse of the World Trade Center of during the September 11 terrorist attacks must be wrong, and there must be another, more nefarious explanation.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cCheck it out, it\u2019s a freakin\u2019 noodle!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so sick and tired of this argument,\u201d Tye says to the camera.\n\nTye stated that he doesn\u2019t care about whether or not 9/11 \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d are true.\n\n\u201cWhat I am upset about is the retarded metallurgical things you guys are saying,\u201d he says. \u201cI am not arguing the facts\u2026 but if you hold this up as a reason for a conspiracy, you are an idiot.\u201d\n\nTye then shows that by heating a piece of structural steel to around 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit, the steel essentially loses its structural integrity long before it ever melts.\n\n\u201cCheck it out, it\u2019s a freakin\u2019 noodle!\u201d he added before tossing the piece of steel to the ground. \u201cYour argument is invalid. Get over it. Find a job.\u201d\n\nPopular Mechanics said Tye\u2019s demonstration was entertaining, but slightly flawed.\n\n\u201cHe openly admits that the forge he was using heated the steel beam several hundred degrees above the temperature at which jet fuel burns,\u201d the magazine observed. \u201cThat, and he doesn\u2019t say how long the beam has been in the forge, or offer any evidence of the forge\u2019s actual temperature. His little experiment here is more party trick than perfect simulation.\u201d\n\nNYPD commissioner lobbies for permanent 9/11 first responders health bill https://t.co/ZImS27OU9b pic.twitter.com/oydGiN35HW \u2014 RT America (@RT_America) December 11, 2015\n\nThe magazine is no defender of 9/11 skeptics, however, and has done its own debunking experiments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A frustrated Georgia blacksmith made a video to debunk a common argument made by 9/11 sceptics that \u201cjet fuel can\u2019t melt steel beams.\u201d The viral video racked up more than two million views in just a day., 9/11, 9/11 sceptics, blacksmith, Jet Fuel, Trenton Tye,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "RT", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "A frustrated Georgia blacksmith made a video to debunk a common argument made by 9/11 sceptics that \u201cjet fuel can\u2019t melt steel beams.\u201d The viral video racked up more than two million views in just a day., 9/11, 9/11 sceptics, blacksmith, Jet Fuel, Trenton Tye,", "title": "Georgia Blacksmith Makes Video Claiming To Debunk 9/11 Jet Fuel Claims", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/212192-2/212192/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/567227b4c46188ac478b4590.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-18T18:21:32-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A frustrated Georgia blacksmith made a video to debunk a common argument made by 9/11 sceptics that \u201cjet fuel can\u2019t melt steel beams.\u201d The viral video racked up more than two million views in just a day., 9/11, 9/11 sceptics, blacksmith, Jet Fuel, Trenton Tye,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/567227b4c46188ac478b4590.jpg", "title": "Georgia Blacksmith Makes Video Claiming To Debunk 9/11 Jet Fuel Claims", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Trenton Tye", "published_time": "2015-12-19T05:00:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-18T18:21:32-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "official MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\u201cCheck it out, it\u2019s a freakin\u2019 noodle!\u201d\u201cI am so sick and tired of this argument,\u201d Tye says to the camera.\nThe screen opens with a shot of a blacksmith shop, as Trenton Tye strides into view.\n\u201cThat, and he doesn\u2019t say how long the beam has been in the forge, or offer any evidence of the forge\u2019s actual temperature.\n\u201cCheck it out, it\u2019s a freakin\u2019 noodle!\u201d he added before tossing the piece of steel to the ground.\nTye stated that he doesn\u2019t care about whether or not 9/11 \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d are true."}
