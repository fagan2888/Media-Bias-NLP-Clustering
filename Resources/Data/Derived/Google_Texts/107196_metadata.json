So do those who use force to inflict punishment rather than to protect themselves, or who instigate physical confrontations for reasons that seem personal, rather than professional.\n\n\u201cIf an officer goes rogue, really, and is acting personally, and not as an officer of the law, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll see a criminal charge,\u201d said Candace McCoy, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.\n\nPhilip Matthew Stinson, a professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who has been studying a database of 10,000 police arrests for various types of misconduct, said judges and juries are perfectly willing to throw the book at an officer \u2014 if they did something that went beyond their official duties, like robbing a drug dealer or using the authority of their badge to settle a personal score.\n\n\u201cIf the jury is sitting there thinking, \u2018Oh my God. A split-second decision like that? What would I have done? Would I have shot the guy?\u2019 you\u2019re not going to get an indictment,\u201d he said.\n\nSecond-guessing an officer\u2019s judgment can get even harder if there are conflicting accounts about what happened. That was the case in the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old shot to death in Fergusson, Missouri. Witnesses disagreed about whether he was charging the officer when he was killed or was trying to surrender.\n\nWhen prosecutors do bring charges, they have often been linked to an attempt at a cover up.\n\nThat was the case with the death of Raymond Robair, a 48-year-old handyman who was fatally beaten on a New Orleans street in 2005.\n\nThe police officers who initially brought Robair to the hospital claimed that they had found him beneath a bridge. In written reports, they described their encounter with Robair as a medical call.\n\nWitnesses told a different story. They said one of the officers, Melvin Williams, had beaten the man with his baton. An autopsy concluded he died from a ruptured spleen. When interviewed by the FBI, Williams\u2019 rookie partner, Matthew Moore, claimed that Robair had hurt himself when he fell down while trying to run away.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indicting a police officer is uncommon occurrence", "title": "Indicting a police officer is uncommon occurrence", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Indicting a police officer is uncommon occurrence", "title": "Indicting a police officer is uncommon occurrence", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/06/indicting_a_police_officer_is_uncommon_occurrence/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/killings-by-police-rare-indictments.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Indicting a police officer is uncommon occurrence", "title": "Indicting a police officer is uncommon occurrence", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/killings-by-police-rare-indictments.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David B.
