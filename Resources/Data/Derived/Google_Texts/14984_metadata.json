After all, the \u201clong bill\u201d is a necessary but mind-numbing legislative drudgery, salted with indiscernible acronyms.\n\nTo most inside the State Capitol, the budget is a very big deal \u2014 a $26 billion big deal. That\u2019s nearly $5,000 for every Colorado resident.\n\nWhile Coloradans go about living their lives, the spending lobby at the State Capitol is paying very close attention to the budget. (Incidentally, \u201cspending lobby\u201d need not be taken as a pejorative; it simply describes those paid to lobby lawmakers on behalf of organizations and individuals whose programs are funded with our tax dollars.)\n\nConsider some illuminating numbers that chart key developments in Colorado over the past eight years:\n\n\u2022 State population has grown by 12 percent. Personal income is up 22 percent.\n\n\u2022 Enrollment in K-12 public schools has increased by 10 percent, and general fund money spent on those public schools is also up 10 percent.\n\n\u2022 The total state budget has grown by 45 percent, and general fund (primarily state income and sales-tax receipts) spending is up 55 percent.\n\nSo, why isn\u2019t school funding generally keeping pace with overall budget growth? In those same eight years, spending on Medicaid and the Department of Health Care Policy and Finance is up 148 percent. Enrollment in Medicaid is up 196 percent.\n\nNo wonder public education and other budget priorities are getting squeezed.\n\nIn 2007-08, K-12 public education received 42 percent of state general fund budget. Health care and human services (HHS) were a distant second, receiving 28 percent. In the budget now under consideration, HHS spending consumes almost as much of the general fund (35 percent) as education (37 percent).\n\nFor as long as anyone can remember, funding our public schools has been the largest expenditure of state tax receipts, and despite debates about how to make our schools better, that spending represents government looking forward \u2014 spending on tools for growth and opportunity.\n\nFor the past five years, general fund spending on HHS entitlements has grown by $1.2 billion while spending on public education has grown by just $118 million. That\u2019s 10 times more growth for entitlements and their attendant bureaucracy than on schools.\n\nWhen spending on entitlements overtakes spending on education, that\u2019s a sign that our budget doesn\u2019t reflect the people\u2019s priorities.\n\nMedicaid spending was growing rapidly before the Affordable Care Act, which only made matters worse by requiring states to adopt more lenient eligibility criteria.\n\nMedicaid historically focused resources on providing a health care safety net for those most in need of assistance \u2014 the elderly, disabled and children in low-income families. Eight years ago, these groups accounted for 83 percent of Medicaid enrollees.\n\nObamacare forced states to open the floodgates to pay for health care for adults with no dependent children and for all adults whose income is as much as 33 percent above the federal poverty level.\n\nIn just the last eight years, the number of adults \u2014 excluding the elderly and disabled \u2014 enrolled in Medicaid has grown from 64,000 to 494,000. Projections estimate more than 600,000 in another two years.\n\nToday, more than one in five Coloradans is enrolled in Medicaid; eight years ago, that ratio was just one in 12.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that Obamacare is wrecking our federal budget and piling trillions of dollars of debt on our children and grandchildren without their consent. It is just as pernicious to children in the state budget in the way it hoards money and resources that could otherwise be sent to classrooms.\n\nMark Hillman served as state treasurer and Senate majority leader.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: Health care spending hurts Colorado school funding", "title": "Guest Commentary: Health care spending hurts Colorado school funding", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/03/guest-commentary-health-care-spending-hurts-colorado-school-funding/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150403__20150406_Z00_OP04C_HILLMANp1.jpg", "height": 356}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150403__20150406_Z00_OP04C_HILLMANp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-03T17:12:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T11:51:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca14b\"", "article_summary": "For the past five years, general fund spending on HHS entitlements has grown by $1.2 billion while spending on public education has grown by just $118 million.\nIn 2007-08, K-12 public education received 42 percent of state general fund budget.\nColoradans\u2019 eyes understandably pass over reports about legislators working on the annual state budget.\n\u2022 The total state budget has grown by 45 percent, and general fund (primarily state income and sales-tax receipts) spending is up 55 percent.\nMedicaid spending was growing rapidly before the Affordable Care Act, which only made matters worse by requiring states to adopt more lenient eligibility criteria."}
