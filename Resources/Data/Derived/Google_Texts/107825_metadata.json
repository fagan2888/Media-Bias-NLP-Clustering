Rick Perry was the first of three likely presidential candidates to address Texas Republican delegates who opened their state convention in Fort Worth on Thursday.\n\nStory on KERA radio.\n\nA glitzy video took the delegates down memory lane, recounting the highlights of Perry\u2019s three decades in state politics. Then first lady Anita Perry introduced him, hinting there\u2019s more to come.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to say we\u2019ve both got some tread left on our tires,\u201d the first lady told 11,000 pumped-up Republicans.\n\nPerry listed achievements during his three terms as governor, including a strong Texas economy, job creation and low taxes. But he said the greatest legacy of his administration is education reform.\n\n\u201cYou can be proud the Texas Class of 2012 achieved the second highest graduation rates in America,\u201d he said. He said the state approval of more than 200 charter schools is also helping at-risk students finish school.\n\nEducation reform is a message that might resonate with conservative voters beyond Texas as they choose their next Republican presidential nominee.\n\nSo too are a number of other hot-button issues Perry hit, including Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\n\nPerry told the crowd: \u201cSome states took the bait of Obamacare and they expanded Medicaid. We did not. And we will not subscribe to federal blackmail.\"\n\nPerry railed against the federal government for bungling veterans\u2019 healthcare and the excessive waits for appointments experienced by many veterans.\n\nHe brought delegates to their feet with his rallying cry for states\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cNowhere in that Constitution does it say Washington should control our classrooms,\" he said. \"Nowhere in that Constitution does it say the federal government should have primary responsibility over the air we breathe, the water we drink or the land that we farm.\"\n\nShortly after Perry spoke, delegates lined up to vote in a GOP presidential straw poll that lists 14 names of potential candidates, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who will also address the delegates.\n\nBill Schereck from Dallas says it\u2019s a tough choice, but Perry\u2019s speech convinced him.\n\n\u201cI will tell you my dream team would be Rick Perry and Ted Cruz,\u201d he said. He added that he\u2019d put Perry at the top of the ticket \u201cbecause of his executive experience.\u201d\n\nA husband and wife from Llano like Texas\u2019 feisty junior senator.\n\n\u201cHe did exactly what we sent him to Washington to do,\u201d Brent Richards said.\n\n\u201cHe knows how to speak and get things across,\u201d Patricia Richards added.\n\nPat McGinnis of Friendswood is looking outside the Lone Star State. He thinks Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker looks promising.\n\n\u201cHe was able to resist a very catfight of a recall for him and he prevailed quite well,\" Walker said.\n\nOn Friday, Cruz and Paul get their chances to impress the delegates. Like Perry, they'll try out a few messages that might play well in Iowa.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Gov.
