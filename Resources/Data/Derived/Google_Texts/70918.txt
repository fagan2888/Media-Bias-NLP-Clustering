Sioux Falls, SD

People looking to add to their garage or shed got a first-hand look at the newest power tools.

Today was the 24th Annual Stan Houston's Woodworking and Power Tool Show. There was seminars teaching different woodworking techniques, and factory representatives were giving demos of different products.

One of the products demonstrated was the SawStop, which is a table saw that stops the moment it comes in contact with human skin.
