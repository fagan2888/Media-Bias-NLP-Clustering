To raise costs, gain pricing power and steer patient referrals, say skeptics.\n\nResearchers at Stanford University tested those opposing arguments by comparing referral patterns between independent doctors and those working for hospitals.\n\nOwnership by a hospital \u201cdramatically increases\u201d odds that a doctor will admit patients there instead of another, nearby hospital, they found. Worse, from the viewpoint of reformers, it boosts chances that patients will go to higher-cost, lower-quality hospitals.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that was most surprising to me about the paper was the quality and cost effect,\u201d said economist Laurence Baker, one of the authors.\n\nWhile not as pronounced as doctors\u2019 hospital referral pattern, the findings that hospital-physician ownership hurts care quality \u201chead in the direction that might make us concerned,\u201d he said.\n\nThe findings were published in August by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nThe report is not the final word. More research is needed, the authors say.\n\nThe 2009 Medicare data they used don\u2019t reflect substantial quality improvements made in many hospitals since then, said Caroline Steinberg, vice president of trends analysis at the American Hospital Association.\n\nEven so, the paper raises questions about hospital-doctor lockups and the idea that consumers are in charge of where they buy health services.\n\nDoctors are the hospital\u2019s sales force, although they don\u2019t like to think of it that way. Without doctors there are no admissions and no revenue to pay hospitals\u2019 huge fixed expenses.\n\nSo hospitals have long been interested in owning physician practices, including a spurt of acquisitions in the 1990s in which many lost money and a renewed boom in the last decade as the Affordable Care Act promised to squeeze costs.\n\nBut few researchers have closely studied admission patterns of hospital-owned doctors\u2019 practices next to those of docs working for themselves.\n\nBaker and colleagues analyzed millions of 2009 admissions using a model that predicts patient hospital choice based on historical patterns.\n\nHospital ownership raised the probability that an admitting doctor would send her patients to the owner hospital by a third, they report. Doctors working for hospitals admitted an average of 83 percent of their hospitalized patients to the proprietor hospital.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the researchers found that patients are more likely to be treated in \u201ca high-cost, low-quality hospital when their admitting physician\u2019s practice is owned by that hospital.\u201d\n\nTo score hospitals the authors used Medicare cost records as well as data on mortality and other quality gauges.\n\nAs policymakers try to revamp a system that often harms patients and delivers billions of dollars in unnecessary care, the researchers\u2019 findings about hospital-owned practices aren\u2019t in line with the way the system things are supposed to work.\n\n\u201cIf these results are valid, then there are large implications,\u201d said Martin Gaynor, a health economist at Carnegie Mellon University who was not involved in the study. \u201cHospital acquisitions of physician practices could disadvantage rival hospitals and harm competition.\u201d\n\nA less alarming interpretation is that hospitals hire doctors who already admit most of their patients to that hospital.\n\n\u201cYou would expect that the entities would be approaching the ones that they\u2019re already working with,\u201d said the AHA\u2019s Steinberg.\n\nBut tests of the data suggest that\u2019s not the case, said Baker. The matter needs further investigation, but, the results \u201care not reassuring,\u201d said Gaynor.\n\nWith the passage of the Affordable Care Act taking place since the activity measured by the paper, \u201cit\u2019s really kind of looking at the past,\u201d said Steinberg. \u201cIt would be interesting to know whether affiliation with physicians allows hospitals to improve their quality.\u201d\n\nThe health law encourages doctor-hospital collaboration in groups called accountable care organizations that put participants on the hook for financial and quality results.\n\nACOs are supposed to reduce incentives for hospitals to gobble market share, raise prices and slight quality \u2014 the kind highlighted by the Stanford paper.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic about ACOs,\u201d said Baker. \u201cBut I think we should still be paying attention to these issues.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
