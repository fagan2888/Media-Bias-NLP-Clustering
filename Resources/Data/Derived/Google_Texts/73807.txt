Police have released a timeline showing their response to a Washington state shooting scene where a man apparently killed four people before turning the gun on himself.

The Mason County Sheriff's Office says that after negotiating with the barricaded suspect for 3 1/2 hours Friday, it became apparent he wasn't going to surrender. The timeline says they used a "chemical agent" to flush him from the house.

He stepped outside with a gun in his hand, yelled at police, went back inside, then came out again and killed himself as officers watched.

Authorities say they found four other bodies in a chicken coop on the property.

A coroner has released the identity of the gunman and three of his four victims in what authorities described as a mass shooting and suicide.

The Kitsap Sun newspaper reports that 51-year-old David Wayne Campbell shot and killed his wife, 49-year-old Lana J. Carlson, as well as her children Quinn and Tory Carlson, who were 16 and 18, respectively.

The Mason County coroner on Saturday was withholding the identity of a fourth victim pending notification of relatives.

The Kitsap County Sheriff's Office said Campbell called authorities Friday morning to report that he had shot four people at a home near Belfair, southwest of Seattle. A SWAT team negotiated with him for more than three hours before he came outside and killed himself.

A 12-year-old girl was able to escape the house and survive.
