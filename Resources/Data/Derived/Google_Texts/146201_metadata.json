Some examples of healthcare items not covered by the KeySolutions plan, according to the document, are a primary care \u201cvisit to treat an injury or illness,\u201d diagnostic tests, hospital stays, emergency care, and both generic and brand drugs. The plan does cover preventative care, screenings, immunizations and prenatal exams.\n\nA 2014 \u201cwebinar\u201d about skinny plans that was jointly presented by UnitedHealthcare and an insurance brokerage and consultancy called Crawford Advisors, lauds the cost-effectiveness of the plans, as I\u2019ve previously reported. Employers \u201ccan offer preventive-care benefits like doctors\u2019 visits and generic drugs without offering much in the way of care,\u201d states the Crawford Advisors portion of the presentation, \u201cand they are considered to be offering insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nA simple Google search for skinny plans, also known as \u201cMinimum Essential Coverage\u201d plans, shows numerous firms selling them. Many of the skinny plan descriptions available online trumpet the fact that the plans offer more than 60 preventative care options but are far more vague in addressing the larger universe of healthcare options that the plans do not cover.\n\nSeveral firms that promote skinny plans online did not respond to requests for interviews. One broker who responded said that he would only consent to an interview under the guarantee that the article would present the plans in a favorable light. (I said no.) Citing confidentiality, Key Benefit Administrators declined an interview request regarding its skinny plan and did not answer a list of questions sent by email.\n\nBut, in general, insurance brokers who sell the plans argue that low-wage employees jump at the opportunity to buy the inexpensive coverage, which prevents them from getting fined for having no insurance at all under the ACA\u2019s individual mandate.\n\nLabor groups fear that many employees, believing that they are entitled to certain protections under the new health law, will enroll in the skinny plans from their employers without understanding just how minimal the coverage is. (Voices within the industry have also expressed this concern.) \u201cIt violates the spirit of the law: that everyone needs to contribute in order to have a functional health care system,\u201d said Anthony Wright, The Executive Director of Health Access California, a statewide advocacy coalition for consumers in healthcare. \u201cTo allow some employers to exploit loopholes, that\u2019s unfair to their competitors.\u201d Wright even objected to the common term for the plans. \u201c\u2018Skinny\u2019 is too kind a word for them,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThis just fundamentally isn\u2019t coverage. It\u2019s junk. It\u2019s fake. It doesn\u2019t provide what people understand coverage to be.\u201d\n\nState lawmakers have taken notice. In October, California governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill, lobbied for by Health Access, that bans skinny plans. (The year before, Brown had vetoed a similar law, which also had backing from a coalition of labor organizations, after opposition from the state\u2019s insurance industry.)\n\nUnder the ACA\u2019s employer mandate, any large business that does not offer its employees health insurance that satisfies the health law\u2019s \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d\u2014that is, an array of preventative care options that all insurance plans must help cover\u2014will be exposed to an automatic $2,000 fine per employee. If the employer offers insurance that contains these preventative basics but does not meet the minimum standard of affordability for real medical care\u2014i.e. a skinny plan\u2014the employer is liable for a $3,000 fine but only for each employee who foregoes the plan and instead goes to a state healthcare exchange for subsidized insurance. And the companies are wagering that most workers won\u2019t forgo the company plan, however poor it is, Thus, employers have a direct financial incentive to flout the law.\n\nEmployers can dodge even the lesser penalty by offering employees the option of purchasing an add-on plan to bring the skinny plan into the compliance with Obamacare\u2019s affordability metric. Heading into the new year, this appears to be the prevailing strategy for skinny plans. Gass said that she could have bought a skinny plan add-on, but did not fully grasp how exposed the original plan left her and did not opt for the additional coverage.\n\nGass was unable to afford the surgery and had to stop working. She now lives off of public disability payments, and hopes to enroll in Medicaid next year, a step which she believes is not guaranteed to help her pay for the surgery she still needs. \u201cIt\u2019s been devastating,\u201d Gass said. \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t know what your gonna do; it\u2019s like your holding onto a rope and you\u2019re about to fall off.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\"Skinny\" health insurance plans make a mockery of the Affordable Care Act", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "\"Skinny\" health insurance plans make a mockery of the Affordable Care Act", "title": "How Large Companies Are Exploiting a Loophole in Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e155aa0d7e8d21ebac5aeff575f98c8c4f90dc9e.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/126575/large-companies-exploiting-loophole-obamacare", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Skinny\" health insurance plans make a mockery of the Affordable Care Act", "title": "How Large Companies Are Exploiting a Loophole in Obamacare", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e155aa0d7e8d21ebac5aeff575f98c8c4f90dc9e.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@spencerwoodman", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/e155aa0d7e8d21ebac5aeff575f98c8c4f90dc9e.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"How Large Companies Are Exploiting a Loophole in Obamacare \",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/126575/large-companies-exploiting-loophole-obamacare\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-28T13:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":126575,\"author\":\"Spencer Woodman\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"Obamacare\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"skinny plans\",\"health insurance\",\"-homepage-top\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-12-28"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "Several firms that promote skinny plans online did not respond to requests for interviews.\nCiting confidentiality, Key Benefit Administrators declined an interview request regarding its skinny plan and did not answer a list of questions sent by email.\nHeading into the new year, this appears to be the prevailing strategy for skinny plans.\nIn October, California governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill, lobbied for by Health Access, that bans skinny plans.\nEmployers can dodge even the lesser penalty by offering employees the option of purchasing an add-on plan to bring the skinny plan into the compliance with Obamacare\u2019s affordability metric."}
