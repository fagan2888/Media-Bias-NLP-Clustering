The recent guest column titled "What GOP must do to win White House," by state Rep. Jeremy Faison, a Republican representing Cocke County and parts of Greene and Jefferson counties, was right on the nose.

The Republican Party must end corporate welfare, reach out to blacks and Latinos, etc. I would also like to point out that they need to move back to the center on other issues.

I used to vote Republican, but the emphasis lately on religion in politics has been a turn-off. Also, Republicans need to come up with a plan to improve the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, not just jettison it with nowhere for the millions of people who signed up for it to go.

Unfortunately for the GOP, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz as the front-runners in the Republican Party will result in a Democratic victory in November.
