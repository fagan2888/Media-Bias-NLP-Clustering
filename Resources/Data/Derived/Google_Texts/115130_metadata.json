On.\n\nThe battle went to double overtime as each player tried to one-up his competitor. LaVine would come up victorious, receiving a perfect score of 200, edging out Gordon\u2019s 197.\n\nFor my money, Gordon should have won after his second dunk in the final. Leaping over Stuff, he grabbed the ball and put it below both his legs, seemingly sitting in mid-air. Incredible.\n\nWhether these two become all-star caliber players remains to be seen, but come 2017 in Charlotte, their rematch will be the hot ticket at all-star weekend.\n\nCHEW ON THIS\n\n\u2022 Mikaela Shiffrin wins her first race back after suffering a knee injury.\n\n\u2022 Back-to-back Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos?
