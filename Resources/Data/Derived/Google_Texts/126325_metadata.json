Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, said in a statement that he has directed the state\u2019s Department of Human Services to end its contracts with the organization.\n\n\u201cIt is apparent that after the recent revelations on the actions of Planned Parenthood, that this organization does not represent the values of the people of our state and Arkansas is better served by terminating any and all existing contracts with them. This includes their affiliated organization, Planned Parenthood of Arkansas and Eastern Oklahoma,\u201d Hutchinson said.\n\nUtah Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, also announced Friday that he had directed the state\u2019s Department of Health to cease funding Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn a statement provided to Salt Lake City\u2019s FOX 13 News, Herbert said:\n\nThe allegations against Planned Parenthood are deeply troubling. Current Utah state law prohibits the use of state funds to provide abortions by Planned Parenthood or any other organization. The federal government has provided grants to Planned Parenthood, distributed through the Utah Department of Health. These funds are also prohibited from being used to perform abortions. In light of ongoing concerns about the organization, I have instructed state agencies to cease acting as an intermediary for pass-through federal funds to Planned Parenthood.\n\nAccording to the Montgomery Advertiser newspaper, state officials have been told by the Obama administration that cutting funding for Planned Parenthood may be in violation of federal law.\n\n\u201cLongstanding Medicaid laws prohibit states from restricting individuals who have coverage through Medicaid from receiving care from a qualified provider,\u201d a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. \u201cBy restricting which provider a woman could choose to receive care from, women could lose access to critical preventive care, such as cancer screenings.\u201d\n\nState officials have argued that there are numerous other providers where individuals with Medicaid coverage may receive care.\n\nAccording to a map released by Alliance Defending Freedom and the Charlotte Lozier Institute, \u201cthere are currently 13,540 clinics providing comprehensive health care for women, versus 665 Planned Parenthood locations,\u201d reported The Daily Signal\u2019s Kelsey Harkness.\n\nSarah Torre, a policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, wrote in a recent op-ed that \u201cCongress is not bound by those regulations and can determine which providers are \u2018qualified\u2019 to perform the services covered under the entitlement program.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood does not have a right to the hard-earned money of American taxpayers,\u201d Torre wrote.\n\nThis post has been updated to correct the name of the Montgomery Advertiser.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Now five states have acted to defund the organization.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Now five states have acted to defund the organization.", "title": "Arkansas, Utah Become the Latest States to Defund Planned Parenthood", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150817_UtahPP_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-17T23:40:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1IYTjlC"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Now five states have acted to defund the organization.", "title": "Arkansas, Utah Become the Latest States to Defund Planned Parenthood", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150817_UtahPP_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-08-17T14:46:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-17T23:40:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Center for Medical Progress, undercover Planned Parenthood videos, Arkansas, Utah, Gary Herbert, Asa Hutchinson, Louisiana, Alabama, New Hampshire"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2bf0\"", "article_summary": "This includes their affiliated organization, Planned Parenthood of Arkansas and Eastern Oklahoma,\u201d Hutchinson said.\nCurrent Utah state law prohibits the use of state funds to provide abortions by Planned Parenthood or any other organization.\nIn a statement provided to Salt Lake City\u2019s FOX 13 News, Herbert said:The allegations against Planned Parenthood are deeply troubling.\nGary Herbert, a Republican, also announced Friday that he had directed the state\u2019s Department of Health to cease funding Planned Parenthood.\nThe federal government has provided grants to Planned Parenthood, distributed through the Utah Department of Health."}
