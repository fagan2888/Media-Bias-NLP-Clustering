All are eligible to apply for the Doctor of Nursing Practice program at Misericordia University.\n\nThe 27-credit part-time track to complete the transition from a Master of Science in nursing to a Doctor of Nursing Practice can be completed in two years while attending the fall, spring and summer over six semesters.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine and the American Association of Colleges of Nursing recommend that by 2015, all advanced practice nurses should be educated at the doctoral level.\n\nWilkes University in Wilkes-Barre has offered an online Doctor of Nursing Practice program since 2010 and 27 students have received the degree so far, said Deborah Zbegner, Ph.D., associate professor of nursing and director of the nursing graduate programs at Wilkes University. Master's level advanced practice nurses must complete 30 hours to complete the program.\n\nWilkes University offers concentrations for adult gerontology primary care, psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, adult gerontological clinical nurse specialist, psychiatric/mental health clinical nurse specialist and nurse executive. All of these concentrations are acceptable to move forward with the doctor of nursing.\n\nDr. Zbegner said the program is offered online because it is more convenient to adult students who are currently working full-time.\n\nThe University of Scranton offers traditional master's degree programs in nursing for advanced practice nurses with specialization in either the family nurse practitioner program, adult health nursing program or nurse anesthesia program. It also offers other advanced certifications.\n\nReceiving a Doctor of Nursing Practice offers a major avenue for employment in the future, with the need for advanced practice registered nurses popping up in places like urgent care centers, hospital clinics and physician offices, Dr. Zbegner said. The average starting salary advanced practice registered nurses can expect is $85,000 to $95,000 a year while experienced ones can earn more than $100,000 a year, she said.\n\nAdvanced practice registered nurses can do many of the same things as physicians. They can not only assess, diagnose and treat common acute and chronic disorders, but can help with preventing disease and providing counseling, but they do not conduct surgery or do certain diagnostic tests.\n\nMore advanced practice nurses will be needed in the future as a result of the Affordable Care Act and shortage of primary care physicians, especially in rural areas, which are prevalent throughout Northeast Pennsylvania, concurred Mary Jane Hanson, Ph.D., professor of nursing and graduate program director at the University of Scranton.\n\n\"The need in our geographic area is significantly greater than throughout the entire nation,\" she said.\n\nContact the writer: dallabaugh@citizensvoice.comTypes of nurses\n\n- Licensed practical nurses, LPN, and licensed vocational nurses, LVN, provide basic nursing care.
