You know there's always one song that catches on like fire. You hear it everywhere, some may love it, others not so much. One Wichita dad wanted to see how long his daughters could go without singing one popular tune called "Let It Go" from the Disney move Frozen.

"You know it just got popular," said Dave Gass. "They were singing all around the house."

You may have heard this song, a number of times, "Let It Go." For Dad Dave Gass, it was one too many. He said, "this one particularly got annoying and the day I first heard it on the radio I was 'this has got to stop' this madness is going too far."

His daughters Willow and Bethany belted it out anyway. Even though their dad would cringe everytime he heard it.

"I love to sing and it's catchy and it's fun to sing," said Willow.

"We're listening to it on the computer and he hears it, he's like please skip it because it's getting really, really annoying," said Bethany.

Dad could only take so much of the song. "I woke up one morning and my dad had made that," said Willow.

The 'that' Willow is referring to is a dry erase board with the challenge to freeze out Frozen. "My goal is to preserve sanity in the home," said Dave.

His challenge, which he posted on the internet, grabbed him national spotlight. "of all of the things to have your 15 minutes for this has got to be the weirdest thing to have your 15 minutes for," said Dave as he laughs.

While the challenge has fizzled, "we made it to two days and then somebody sang the song again, there was an incident, so we had to reset it,' said Dave.

It's given this already tight-knit and musical family something to laugh about. As for the fate of this dry erase board, once the Frozen frenzy has faded, Dave said "it could change into anything. it doesn't necessarily have to be a song so it could change into if our girls say 'um' all the time or 'like' all the time."
