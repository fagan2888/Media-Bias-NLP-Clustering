Joe Bielawa, CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nThirty-five-year-old Robert Hunter used Justin Bieber\u2019s identity to lure girls as young as 9 to make them undress and engage in sexual acts while talking to him via webcam. Hunter\u2019s victims can rest a little easier now that the man faces 14 years in prison in what Judge Peter Bowers called \u201cone of the most serious cases on internet abuse that the courts have dealt with.\u201d\n\n\u201cRobert Hunter was a calculating and malicious predator who set out to coerce and bully young girls into exposing themselves over the internet,\u201d said Cleveland Police Sergeant Paul Higgins. \u201cThis investigation highlights the dangers that children face when conversing with people over the internet.\u201d\n\nAt Teesside Crown Court, Hunter pleaded guilty to 15 charges of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and 14 counts of making indecent photos. Over 800 photos and videos found on Hunter\u2019s computer were used as evidence, the Daily Mail reported.\n\n\u201cIt's a warning to all parents of teenage children of what can be done via the internet,\u201d Judge Bowers told the Daily Mail. \u201cThe public will be disgusted by how you have behaved even after you had been arrested and bailed. It represents callous and sadistic exploitation of a number of girls over a number of years.\u201d\n\nThe children that Hunter abused using Justin Bieber and other identities resided in a number of different countries across North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. An international investigation launched by Interpol started after a girl from Tasmania alerted the authorities, according to BBC.\n\nJustin Bieber impersonator sentenced to 14 years in prison.
