She tracks and shares her workouts with co-workers through FitCare.\n\n\"We can do public blogs, so you can talk back and forth. You can put recipes out there,\" Fiedler said.\n\nFitCare is a new online program for DAKOTACARE clients. You can keep your goals personal or share them with a group.\n\n\"If you're doing a specific challenge or training for a particular race, you can post different tips,\" DAKOTACARE Director of Health and Wellness Trisha Dohn said.\n\nIt also synchs up with wearable activity-tracking devices, like the Fitbit wristband.\n\n\"I can also use my cell phone if I don't have my Fitbit. I can text in my activity and my steps through my cell phone,\" Fiedler said.\n\n\"They can text their exercise. They can scan their different foods to find out nutrition facts from their phone,\" Dohn said.\n\nDAKOTACARE Director of Health and Wellness Trisha Dohn believes online programs and apps will become increasingly popular for people looking to lose weight or eat healthier.\n\n\"It allows them to stay engaged no matter where they're at,\" Dohn said.\n\nWhich Fiedler hopes will help to keep her New Year's resolution to eat healthier and exercise more.\n\n\"Like everyone else I've made New Year's resolutions that lasted only a couple months. Hopefully this year will be a little bit different,\" Fiedler said.\n\nIf you're interested in the online wellness program, you can learn more by contacting DAKOTACARE Health and Wellness.\n\nHealthBeat\n\nWellness & Nutrition {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
