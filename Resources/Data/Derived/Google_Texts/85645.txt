Dylan and Mark Redwine

Investigators continue to search for clues in the death of southern Colorado teen Dylan Redwine.

According to the Durango Herald, crews found several items of interest Saturday during a search of the area where Dylan's body was found more than two years ago.

It's not clear how the items may be connected to Dylan's death.

Dylan, 13, went missing during a court ordered visitation with his dad who lives near Durango during Thanksgiving break in 2012. His remains were found months later.

Last month, the La Plata County Sheriff's Office named Dylan's dad, Mark Redwine, a person of interest.

Dylan's mom lives in Monument.
