Saturday Night Live gave 28 reasons this week \u2014 and 27 of them were slavery.\n\nIn honor of Black History Month, SNL\u2018s Jay Pharoah, Kenan Thompson and Sasheer Zamata played students giving a musical class presentation on 28 reasons to hug a black guy today, one for each day in February. Kate McKinnon played the school teacher, awkwardly dancing on the side of the room.\n\nAs Thompson and Pharoah rapped, with Zamata singing background, the trio gave the first reason to hug a black guy today: \u201cWe deserve a chance!\u201d\n\nReasons 2 through 28? Slavery.\n\nThe rest of the song poked fun at white guilt and black oppression in the funniest ways possible. The three black students listed off white people they aren\u2019t mad at \u2014 like singers Daryl Hall and Michael McDonald. Then they asked all of the white students to put their hands in the air if they were down for the cause, but then flipped it on them and said, \u201cKeep \u2019em up if your ancestors owned us.\u201d\n\nBobby Moynihan\u2019s character, a student in the class, stood up during the song to try to defend white people and play \u201cdevil\u2019s advocate,\u201d but was immediately asked to sit back down by the McKinnon.\n\n\u201cWhen I say \u2018slavery,\u2019 you say \u2018sorry,'\u201d Thompson rapped at the class. \u201cSlavery!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d the students begrudgingly responded.\n\nCheck out the hilarious sketch here:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Need a reason to hug a black person today?
