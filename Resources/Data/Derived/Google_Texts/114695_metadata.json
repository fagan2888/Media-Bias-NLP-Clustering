Bernie Sanders of Vermont backed down on Friday from his controversial assertion that rival Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t qualified to be president following a huge backlash from Democrats complaining that Sanders was hurting their party\u2019s chances for victory in November.\n\nFuming after days of perceived slights from Clinton that he might not be prepared to be president and needs to do his \u201chomework\u201d -- even on his signature issue of breaking up the big banks -- Sanders earlier this week said she had disqualified herself by accepting millions of dollars in campaign funds from Wall Street and other special interests, voting in 2002 to support the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and backing free trade deals that hurt U.S. workers.\n\nHere\u2019s the Big Risk Sanders and Clinton Are Taking as They Trade Insults\n\nThe response from Democratic party leaders and liberal columnists was swift and stern: The Vermont senator who once prided himself on his civility in campaigning had breached political etiquette and risked creating an irreparable fissure in the party. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote that Sanders\u2019s campaign \u201chas lost its ethical moorings\u201d in attacking Clinton.\n\nIn back-to-back appearances on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe and NBC\u2019s Today, a mildly repentant Sanders sought to repair the damage with laudatory comments about Clinton\u2019s intelligence and experience. He told Today hosts Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie that \u201cof course\u201d Clinton was qualified to be the next president.\n\nDespite the bitter exchanges between the two, Sanders hastened to add, \u201cOn her worst day, she would be an infinitely better president than either of the Republican candidates.\"\n\nSanders said during both television appearances that it had become apparent that the Clinton campaign had decided to \u201cchange its tone\u201d and go negative after losing to Sanders in Wisconsin and five other states recently, and that Sanders felt he had no choice but to punch back.\n\nRelated: Sanders: I\u2019ll Win New York, Too \u2013 and Then the White House\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do? Just sit back and say, hey, I come from a small state. We\u2019re really nice people,\u201d Sanders told the Morning Joe anchors. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fight back and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. I hope though, let me be clear on this, let\u2019s get back to the issues. Hillary Clinton and I have strong disagreements, I respect her, but let\u2019s start debating the issues.\u201d\n\nAs for Krugman\u2019s criticism that he has lost his ethical moorings, Sanders retorted: \u201cHow often have I talked about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails? Have you heard me? Not a word? How often have I talked about the Clinton Foundation\u2019s fundraising? Have you heard me say one word about that? I am trying to stay away from personal attacks on Hillary.\u201d\n\nDemocrats who have been tolerant and even encouraging of Sanders\u2019 run at Clinton from the left balked at his most recent statements, and by Friday morning he faced a torrent of attacks from pundits on the left.\n\nWashington Post columnist Eugene Robinson, who has been generally friendly toward Sanders, called his attack on her qualifications \u201ca ridiculous thing to say\u201d and mocked him for falling back on \u201cthe she-hit-me-first defense,\u201d noting, \u201cThe problem is that Clinton never said such a thing.\u201d\n\nRelated: Not So Fast, Hillary: Bernie\u2019s Right About Breaking Up the Banks\n\nKrugman, the liberal New York Times columnist who has been notably cool to Sanders so far, blew up on Friday, saying, \u201cthe way Mr. Sanders is now campaigning raises serious character and values issues.\u201d\n\nKrugman took issue with Sanders\u2019 claim about Clinton\u2019s supposed disqualification for office by supporting past trade agreements and voting to authorize the Iraq war.\n\n\u201cThis is really bad, on two levels. Holding people accountable for their past is O.K., but imposing a standard of purity, in which any compromise or misstep makes you the moral equivalent of the bad guys, isn\u2019t. Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t meet that standard; neither did F.D.R. Nor, for that matter, has Bernie Sanders (think guns).\u201d\n\nThe criticism of Sanders echoed on Capitol Hill on Thursday, when virtually no Democratic senator would take Sanders\u2019s part in his mushrooming feud with Clinton.\n\nRelated: Sanders\u2019 Plan Would Raise Taxes a Staggering $13.6 Trillion over a Decade\n\n\u201cThere are policy disagreements he may have with her on some things \u2013 let\u2019s stick to those, let\u2019s not say that the most qualified candidate for president is simply unqualified,\u201d Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), told The Washington Post. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to refrain from ad hominem attacks. We\u2019ve got to stay focused on what we\u2019ve got to do in November.\u201d\n\nDespite his surprisingly strong performance throughout the primary contests, Sanders rarely has gotten a favorable nod from congressional Democrats, in part because he has run as an independent throughout his political career and only caucuses with the Democrats to leverage his influence in the Senate. Clinton, by contrast, has labored in the Democratic vineyards for decades and enjoys widespread support among Democratic lawmakers and party leaders.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a veteran lawmaker, voiced deep concern that Sanders was doing terrible damage to the party\u2019s prospects this fall with his outbursts. \u201cWhat he does is divide the Democratic faithful, and why would he want to do that?\u201d\n\nThe Sanders camp quickly went into full retreat, evidenced by the candidate\u2019s own comments on the morning talk shows and by an interview Sanders\u2019 senior advisor Tad Devine gave to the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent.\n\n\u201cBernie has said he\u2019s going to support the nominee, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll do everything to make sure that the next president is a Democrat,\u201d Devine said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sen.", "title": "Facing Democratic Fury, Sanders Walks Back His Attack on Clinton", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/08/Facing-Democratic-Fury-Sanders-Walks-Back-His-Attack-Clinton", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04082016_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/08/Facing-Democratic-Fury-Sanders-Walks-Back-His-Attack-Clinton", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04082016_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3078\"", "article_summary": "Clinton, by contrast, has labored in the Democratic vineyards for decades and enjoys widespread support among Democratic lawmakers and party leaders.\nHe told Today hosts Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie that \u201cof course\u201d Clinton was qualified to be the next president.\nNew York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote that Sanders\u2019s campaign \u201chas lost its ethical moorings\u201d in attacking Clinton.\nNor, for that matter, has Bernie Sanders (think guns).\u201dThe criticism of Sanders echoed on Capitol Hill on Thursday, when virtually no Democratic senator would take Sanders\u2019s part in his mushrooming feud with Clinton.\nRelated: Sanders: I\u2019ll Win New York, Too \u2013 and Then the White House\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?"}
