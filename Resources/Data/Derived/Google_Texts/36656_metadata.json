I get it now.\"\n\nClinton said he can't wait to get to the desert this week, both for the sunny, warm temperatures and for the activities of the PGA Tour's Humana Challenge in partnership with the Clinton Foundation. Those activities include the third annual Health Matters health and wellness conference, which Clinton hosts on Tuesday as a key part of the Clinton Foundation's effort to make a lasting impact on the country's wellness and health care.\n\n\"The people in the valley should be really proud of the fact that since we started this wellness initiative there, there are people everywhere else that read about it and asked us to start there,\" Clinton said in an exclusive telephone interview with The (Palm Springs, Calif.) Desert Sun. \"We have a great program in Little Rock now, where my library is. We've got a great program in Jacksonville, Fla.\n\n\"Now the program is spreading to other places in the country, and it is all because of the publicity from the valley effort,\" he added.\n\nThirteen years after leaving office, Clinton, 67, devotes almost all of his time to his foundation. Clinton quickly points out the initiatives have made an impact on the Coachella Valley as much as anywhere in the country.\n\n\"We've got $11 million of investments just in the Coachella Valley in health and wellness,\" he said. \"We believe, including the things we are doing in the schools, we will impact about 400,000 people in that valley.\"\n\n\u201cThe people in the valley should be really proud of the fact that since we started this wellness initiative there, there are people everywhere else that read about it and asked us to start there.\u201d Former President Bill Clinton, on Health Matters conference\n\nFrom a conference of intriguing ideas in 2012 to a conference of some tangible results in 2013, Clinton believes the conference is moving toward bigger and more wide-ranging impacts in 2014.\n\n\"Facebook and MTV are going to partner with the Jed Foundation to try to do a real initiative on college campuses in the area to make sure that we eliminate, if possible, all the health problems associated with prescription drug abuse,\" Clinton said. \"There are now more people dying of (prescription) drug overdoses than heroin and cocaine combined.\"\n\nWhile past conferences have focused on nutrition and information on healthy foods, Clinton said this year an emphasis will be on increasing physical activities for adults and children through Boys & Girls Clubs and other organizations. The Aspen Institute's Sports in Society Program, Nike, the U.S. Olympic Committee and others are some of the corporate and non-profit sponsors.\n\nClinton says one of his favorite initiatives this year will be the 800-Calorie Challenge from the James Beard Foundation and Palisades Media, a national cooking campaign to focus on healthy eating and nutrition. Pastor Rick Warren of Southern California's Saddleback Church will share details on the Daniel Plan, which allowed his church members to lose more than 250,000 pounds.\n\n\"We've done about all we can do now to reduce the total calories and to improve the nutrition of the food (in schools),\" Clinton said. \"The physical activities depend in large part on what is available to the schools and what they are prepared to do. So we are working on out-of-school (programs) now. The Knight Foundation is going to help us with using digital platforms to make the right kind of knowledge available to individuals and community groups.\"\n\nHaving knowledge on healthy foods is one thing. Having access to that food or to health care in general is another. In parts of the eastern Coachella Valley and the Imperial Valley with higher unemployment and poverty, healthy food options are harder to come by. Clinton calls those generally low-income areas food deserts. One area with pockets of low income that is not a food desert is Manhattan, where the tradition of small, local food markets dates back more than 100 years.\n\n\u201cThe physical activities depend in large part on what is available to the schools and what they are prepared to do. So we are working on out-of-school (programs) now. \u201d Former President Bill Clinton\n\n\"I am trying to study this distribution chain (in Manhattan) to figure out if there is some way to make this work economically in less-populous areas,\" Clinton said. \"It costs a lot of money to live in New York, even for four people. But one thing you can do is, if you live within a mile of one of these markets, is get access to healthy affordable food. And it is a distribution problem.\n\n\"A lot of people who are stuck in low-income neighborhoods would take the trouble to make good food for their kids and for their parents and grandparents if they could have access to it at a price they could pay,\" he said.\n\nFor all the talk of the health care conference, Clinton still has his eye on the PGA Tour event, where the tour and Humana will help to promote healthy living as well as put on a high-powered PGA Tour event.\n\n\"It certainly helps to have the former leader of the free world associated with your tournament,\" said Bob Marra, CEO and executive director of the Humana Challenge. \"He brings a lot of energy to the tournament and to the health care conference. The players and the amateurs are excited to see him each year, and the thing is he is just as excited to see them and talk to them and shake their hands and thank them for coming to the event.\"\n\nMajor changes have come to the tournament since Humana and the Clinton Foundation joined the event for 2012, including a decrease from five days to four and playing just three courses instead of four.\n\nThe golf and the conference are important, but for a New York resident shivering through one of the coldest winters in recent history, the Coachella Valley has other appeals for Clinton.\n\n\"We've had a 20-year cold front here in the east and I'm ready to come to California,\" Clinton said. \"I can't wait.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1eNHnoX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "PALM SPRINGS, Calif. -- Sitting in his office in a cold, overcast New York City, former President Bill Clinton laughs that at one time he didn't understand the allure of Southern California.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "PALM SPRINGS, Calif. -- Sitting in his office in a cold, overcast New York City, former President Bill Clinton laughs that at one time he didn't understand the allure of Southern California.", "title": "Bill Clinton finds gold chasing wellness for all", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/12/bill-clinton-wellness-health-matters-conference/4441947/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "PALM SPRINGS, Calif. -- Sitting in his office in a cold, overcast New York City, former President Bill Clinton laughs that at one time he didn't understand the allure of Southern California.", "title": "Bill Clinton finds gold chasing wellness for all", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/69875500a00b9b0cf843451facdb273425996728/c=268-0-1624-1356&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/12//1389565031000-GAN-CLINTON-WELLNESS-HUMANA-011214.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/nation", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1585d6205a74ab3f9f8327e4aa62f47fd63421fe/c=436-0-1456-1357/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/12//1389565031000-GAN-CLINTON-WELLNESS-HUMANA-011214.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d83aeb64116bd9ccd645d6c49089fefd51eb647f/c=268-0-1624-1356/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/12//1389565031000-GAN-CLINTON-WELLNESS-HUMANA-011214.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1d784b798e87c5e702212b0040577f50397bcb6c/c=68-0-1876-1357/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/12//1389565031000-GAN-CLINTON-WELLNESS-HUMANA-011214.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1b2bd5b6f6742a1ebbe55096612c5bc457037075/c=0-24-2000-1152&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/12//1389565031000-GAN-CLINTON-WELLNESS-HUMANA-011214.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-01-12T17:22:29.067000-05:00", "shorthed": "Bill Clinton finds gold chasing wellness", "articleid": 4441947, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8a996ece042f5981f9484136a98f3bbb700820ff/c=0-24-2000-1152/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/12//1389565031000-GAN-CLINTON-WELLNESS-HUMANA-011214.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e11074ce22de61fcb831fbed1aa49b81d358cdc7/c=288-0-1048-1357/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/12//1389565031000-GAN-CLINTON-WELLNESS-HUMANA-011214.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Bill Clinton finds gold chasing wellness for all", "pageclass": "article", "author": "Larry Bohannan"}, "news_keywords": "bill clinton, humana challenge, pga tour, pga tour humana challenge, clinton foundation, coachella valley"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1bf\"", "article_summary": "Those activities include the third annual Health Matters health and wellness conference, which Clinton hosts on Tuesday as a key part of the Clinton Foundation's effort to make a lasting impact on the country's wellness and health care.\nThe Health Matters health and wellness conference will take place Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2014, during this year's Humana Challenge.\nClinton said he can't wait to get to the desert this week, both for the sunny, warm temperatures and for the activities of the PGA Tour's Humana Challenge in partnership with the Clinton Foundation.\n\"We've got $11 million of investments just in the Coachella Valley in health and wellness,\" he said.\nIn parts of the eastern Coachella Valley and the Imperial Valley with higher unemployment and poverty, healthy food options are harder to come by."}
