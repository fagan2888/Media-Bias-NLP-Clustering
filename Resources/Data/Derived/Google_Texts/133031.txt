Jenks West Elementary School was evacuated for several hours Friday morning because of a natural gas odor in the building.

The school says a teacher on the first floor of the building in the 200 block of B Street noticed a strong smell of gas, so students were initially moved to the school's gym.

The Jenks Fire Department was called to investigate. Oklahoma Natural Gas workers are also called and ONG says the odor was coming from a gas regulator on the roof.

The students were then moved to a building across the street. The fire department cleared the building and just before 11 a.m. the students were then allowed to return to the school.
