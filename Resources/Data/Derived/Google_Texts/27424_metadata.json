Tom Price, R-Ga., chairman of the House Budget Committee, said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe Congressional Budget Office should be a lot more transparent and responsive to members\u201d because the baselines it uses in its scoring of legislation \u201cis now gamed for predetermined outcomes,\u201d Price said on a panel at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cThe budget process is broken\u2014in the end we came together for a last-minute deal\u201d this fall, Price noted, \u201cbut that\u2019s not the way a family or a business does budgeting.\u201d\n\nPrice, who said his north Atlanta district is \u201cfilled with great people who want government to stay out of their lives and pocketbooks,\u201d allowed that the House did a good job last year moving spending bills and writing a budget that would balance over 10 years. \u201cAnd for the first time in 14 years, the House and Senate came together on a budget. But that\u2019s nothing to celebrate because the people of this great country ought to expect that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe budget panel is already at work on reforms that, while aimed at reducing the size of government, would \u201cafford each member of Congress the opportunity to engage, then force them to come together,\u201d said Price, who plans to draft such a bill after the fiscal 2016 appropriations bills are complete, in time for a new president in 2017. Democrats would be welcome as partners, he said, but \u201cso far they haven\u2019t shown interest.\u201d\n\nAnswering questions from Brookings policy experts, Price said President Obama\u2019s Tuesday State of the Union address provided no common ground for the two parties. \u201cI am continually disappointed,\u201d he said, calling the speech \u201cterribly political\u201d for the president\u2019s final such address. \u201cObama has probably completely alienated all on our side of the aisle,\u201d and the president\u2019s pleas for a more civil political process \u201cring hollow,\u201d he said, citing a negative experience working with the administration on the Affordable Care Act. \u201cYes, there is enough blame to go around,\u201d but easing the polarization would \u201ctake a certain style of leadership.\u201d\n\nPrice initially balked when asked to imagine common ground that could be found between the parties if Hillary Clinton is the next president and Republican Paul Ryan of Wisconsin remains the House speaker. But when pressed, he said, \u201cMy responsibility is to define what can be done\u201d\u2014citing, in rank order, tax reform, regulatory reform and entitlement reform.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 pledge never to raise taxes applies only to tax rates, not to all revenue raisers, Price clarified. Entitlement reform would mean raising the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare and offering a \u201cvoluntary opportunity to use one\u2019s own resources for investments, which saves money,\u201d he said. \u201cMedicare can no longer provide what\u2019s promised, so the idea is not to make it more oppressive and prescriptive.\u201d\n\nLike many in his caucus, Price dubbed Obamacare an embarrassing \u201cfailure,\u201d saying it still leaves 25 million uninsured while the exchanges and co-ops experience problems. \u201cMillions have coverage but no care,\u201d he said, adding that fellow doctors (he\u2019s an orthopedic surgeon) tell him that their patients can\u2019t afford the deductibles. \u201cThe majority of the American people oppose it and they know in their gut something is wrong,\u201d Price said.\n\nHe said his own alternative, H.R. 2300, would cover all Americans, not raise taxes and cost less than the Affordable Care Act, while allowing states to experiment with more efficient healthcare approaches.\n\n\u201cNice work if you can get it,\u201d responded moderator David Wessel, a Brookings fiscal and monetary policy specialist.\n\nUnder prodding, Price said the government should spend more on defense. But he stressed the need to let Congress\u2019s specialized committees determine how much. \u201cDefining resources before defining the mission and goals leads to folly,\u201d Price said. Another area that needs more dollars is infrastructure, he agreed, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t seem to get any traction.\u201d\n\nHe recommended cuts in commerce and education, saying the federal government could spend less money on schools \u201cif it were less prescriptive.\u201d Overall, Congress has done \u201ca terrible job\u201d of setting priorities, Price said.\n\nAsked by Government Executive whether Republicans on the budget and appropriations panels consider the possibility of a presidential veto when they set spending levels, Price implied they did not, noting that a budget resolution does not require the president\u2019s signature. Nor should it, he added.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles S.
