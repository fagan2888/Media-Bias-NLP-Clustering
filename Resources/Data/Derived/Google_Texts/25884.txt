ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Molina Healthcare of New Mexico plans to consolidate two Albuquerque office locations and about 650 employees from the North Interstate 25 corridor to Downtown by mid-2015.

Molina will reportedly lease space in the seven-story, 477,394-square-foot Plaza Campana at 400 Tijeras NW, which has housed offices of CenturyLink and its predecessor companies going back to the days of US West. Mayor Richard Berry announced the move Monday in his annual State of the City address.

Molina spokeswoman Leigh Woodward confirmed the Downtown move but said the company could not identify the building until a lease is signed.

Molina, which entered New Mexico with its acquisition of Health Care Horizons in 2004, currently occupies 70,874 square feet at the Horizon I Building at 8801 Horizon NE, just off Alameda near Balloon Fiesta Park, said Barbara Haase of Cauwels & Stuve Realty and Development, which owns and manages the building.

Molina’s lease expires in July 2015. The Long Beach, Calif.-based company has been in the building since its Horizon acquisition.

Molina Healthcare of New Mexico also leases 47,528 square feet at Journal Center for a call center tied to customer service requirements of the Affordable Care Act.

Both the headquarters and call center locations are in an office market called the North I-25 corridor, which straddles Interstate 25 north of the Big I.
