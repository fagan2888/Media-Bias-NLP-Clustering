Easley) (Photo: AP )\n\nPatrick O\u2019Hara, a prisoner convicted of murder, is 69 years old and mostly confined to his bed. He is incarcerated in a sparkling-clean facility where nurses work behind steel cages and he gets oxygen from tubes in his nose while a television plays nearby.\n\nHe\u2019s one of 67 inmates in the Kentucky State Reformatory\u2019s nursing care facility near La Grange, which costs state taxpayers more than $4.4 million a year. In a state grappling with $1.6 billion in budget cuts since 2008, some Kentucky lawmakers ask why it\u2019s worth keeping O\u2019Hara and others like him behind bars.\n\nThe General Assembly has approved a pilot program that requires Kentucky to parole some infirm inmates \u2014 excluding sex offenders and death row prisoners \u2014 to private nursing homes where the federal government, through Medicaid, would pay most of the medical bills.\n\nFor the plan to work, inmates cannot be in prison because the federal government will not pay for inmates\u2019 medical expenses. But if the inmates are paroled to a private facility, they become eligible for Medicaid. Inmates who leave the nursing home would be returned to prison for violating parole.\n\nThe expanded program comes as many states are grappling with the cost of aging prisoners. Connecticut began paroling inmates to a private nursing home last year under a program officials say will save that state up to $5 million annually.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2010, when the nation\u2019s prison population grew 42 percent, the number of inmates over age 55 quadrupled, according to a 2012 study by Human Rights Watch. From 2001 to 2008, state spending on inmate health care increased in 42 of 44 states surveyed by the Pew Charitable Trust and the MacArthur Foundation.\n\nThe geriatric prison population is swelling for multiple reasons, including longer sentences with no chance of parole and the fact that the huge population of aging baby boomers accounts for more arrests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a crime wave, it\u2019s just there are more older people in that age category,\u201d said Ron Aday, a professor at Middle Tennessee State University and author of the book \u201cAging Prisoners: Crisis in American Corrections.\u201d\n\nIt costs $182 per day to care for inmates such as O\u2019Hara, while Kentucky\u2019s daily cost for an average healthy inmate is $50.\n\n\u201cThat really isn\u2019t the mission of the department to provide nursing care for elderly folks,\u201d Kentucky Corrections Commissioner LaDonna Thompson said.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the mission of private nursing facilities to cater to ex-convicts, said Steve McClain, communications director for the Kentucky Association of Health Care Facilities. Kentucky nursing homes have among the highest liability costs in the country, according to a 2013 study from the American Health Care Association and Aon Global Risk Consulting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a huge liability risk that our facilities have anyway, that they are not going to take this without a lot of thought and discussion,\u201d McClain said.\n\nKentucky already has a medical parole option, subject to the Parole Board\u2019s discretion. Since 2011, the department has released 12 inmates on medical parole. Of the 67 inmates in the nursing care facility, three have been denied medical parole.\n\nThe new program, enacted as part of the state budget, requires the Parole Board to release inmates if they meet certain conditions. Even then, however, they might not have a place to go.\n\nO\u2019Hara was paroled to a Louisville halfway house in December 2010 but stayed there only one day because his condition had deteriorated so much he needed full-time care, prison officials said. Because no private nursing facility would take him, corrections officials say they had no choice but to revoke his parole and lock him up again.\n\n\u201cI got a parole, just have no place to go,\u201d O\u2019Hara said.\n\nThat\u2019s where Carlo Musso sees opportunity. The Georgia doctor owns CorrectHealth, a company that provides prison medical services. Last year, Musso bought an old prison in Milledgeville, Ga., that he is converting into nursing facility for paroled inmates. Musso said he expects to hire about 200 people.\n\n\u201cWhen we studied the problem, in many states we found much to our surprise that many inmates were past their parole date \u2014 but because they were so medically fragile they had no place to go,\u201d Musso said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you would want an individual who has a prior history of violent criminal past mixed in with your grandparents.\u201d\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Musso bought the Georgia prison for half of its appraised value and stands to make millions of dollars off the deal, which some have criticized.\n\n\u201cWe responded to an open bid process \u2026 and it\u2019s all aboveboard,\u201d Musso said.\n\nMusso has participated in some of Georgia\u2019s executions. In 2011, some anti-death penalty advocates asked for Musso\u2019s medical license to be revoked because they said he imported sodium thiopental from overseas without registering with state regulators. At the time, he said he was being targeted for political purposes.\n\nMusso has hired Kentucky lobbyist Kim Nelson, who has introduced him to some Kentucky lawmakers. Kentucky House Speaker Greg Stumbo said he wants Musso to open a similar facility at the defunct Otter Creek Correctional Center in Wheelwright. The private, for-profit prison closed in 2012 after the state removed its inmates.\n\nStumbo, D-Prestonsburg, said he has been trying to reopen the facility to create jobs for his district.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.
