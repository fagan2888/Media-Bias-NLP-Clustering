Ted Cruz (R-TX) said, encouraging Georgia voters at Saturday\u2019s rally in Atlanta to vote for him over Donald Trump in the pivotal Super Tuesday election.\n\n\u201cSixty-five per cent of Republicans don\u2019t think Donald Trump is the right candidate to go up against Hillary Clinton,\u201d Cruz said near the end of his stump speech. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2019 think it makes sense for Republicans to nominate a candidate who has agreed with Hillary Clinton on issue after issue after issue. Whether it\u2019s supporting partial birth abortion, or supporting John Kerry or supporting Bernie Sanders style socialized medicine and government being in charge of our healthcare.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nFormer Georgia Congressman Jack Kingston joined the event, energizing the crowd ahead of Cruz\u2019s appearance.\n\n.@JackKingston: \"Cruz didn't make people comfortable in [D.C], because you're not expected to follow through on campaign promises\" #gapol \u2014 zpolitics (@zpolitics) February 27, 2016\n\nCruz rallied the hundreds gathered at the Atlanta State Capitol, as seen in MSNBC\u2019s livestream of the event.\n\n\u201cAmerica has receded from leadership in the world and the world has become a much more dangerous place, but I am here today with a word of hope and encouragement and exhortation. All across Georgia, all across this country, people are waking up. There is a spirit of awakening that is sweeping this nation. So I want to ask everyone here to look forward. Look forward to January, 2017.\u201d\n\nCruz laid out his plans should he win election to the office of President of the United States.\n\nHe hit on the importance of who will replace the recently deceased \u201cdefender of the Constitution\u201d Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. This has been a rallying cry for Cruz and his supporters since the passing of the Justice who was lauded for his strong constitutional record. Cruz\u2019s record serving the high court has been highlighted as an elevated point of experience following Scalia\u2019s passing. Cruz emphasized to the crowd that his record means the people of Georgia and America can trust him to appoint a \u201cprincipled constitutionalist.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis passing underscores that this election is not about one branch of government, it\u2019s about two branches of government. Because we are one liberal justice away from a five justice leftwing majority the likes of which this country has never seen,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nCruz went on to promise to repeal Obamacare, prosecute any criminal violations in Planned Parenthood, end persecution of religious liberty, rip up the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d Iranian nuclear deal, and move the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem on day one. He went on to say he will secure the border and end sanctuary cities, reform the Veteran\u2019s Administration, and defend the Second Amendment. He invoked the term \u201cradical Islam,\u201d saying he would stand up to radical Islamic terrorism. Cruz pledged to take on the EPA and CFPB and the \u201calphabet soup of federal agencies\u201d killing jobs across America, pass a simple flat tax, and abolish the IRS.\n\nTo workers with stagnated wages and those forced into part-time employment, to single mothers, to students with \u201cmountains of student loan debt\u201d worried about getting a job, Cruz said, \u201cIf you want another Washington dealmaker, you\u2019ve got choices on that stage. If you want someone who will go and cut deals with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi, you\u2019ve got candidates who have done so and who promise to do so,\u201d an apparent reference to candidates Marco Rubio and Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Cruz said, \u201cif you want someone who will stand up to Washington, ask yourself who actually has stood up to Washington.\u201d\n\nCruz also doubled down on Super Tuesday, saying that the race in \u201cbattleground\u201d Georgia is \u201cneck and neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt took Jimmy Carter to give us Ronald Reagan,\u201d Cruz said before likening the 2016 election to the birth of the \u201cReagan Revolution.\u201d\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick told Breitbart News that around 60 per cent of ballots were expected to have been cast by Friday under early voting in Texas. Texas awards more delegates than the first four primary states combined. The Cruz campaign emphasized looking toward Super Tuesday at last Tuesday night\u2019s Nevada caucus night rally.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz in Atlanta: If We Nominate Donald, We End Up Electing Hillary Clinton as President", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ted Cruz in Atlanta: If We Nominate Donald, We End Up Electing Hillary Clinton as President", "title": "Ted Cruz in Atlanta: If We Nominate Donald, We End Up Electing Hillary Clinton as President - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Cruz-Rally-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-02-27T20:11:14-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/27/holdholdhold-for-alexsteve-cruz-in-atlanta-if-we-nominate-donald-we-end-up-electing-hillary-clinton-as-president/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz in Atlanta: If We Nominate Donald, We End Up Electing Hillary Clinton as President", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Cruz-Rally-AP.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz in Atlanta: If We Nominate Donald, We End Up Electing Hillary Clinton as President - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Antonin Scalia, Atlanta, barack obama, Donald Trump, EPA, Flat Tax, Georgia, Harry Reid, Hillary Clinton, iranian nuclear deal, irs, Jack Kingston, Jimmy Carter, Jobs, Lt.
