VFW 1 was the first post established by the organization in the country, in 1899.\n\n\u201cI have no family, so this is my family,\u201d Kelly said smiling warmly, when asked what he was thankful for. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for this nation. I\u2019m grateful for the camaraderie of my brethren.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the reason he joined VFW 1 was because it wasn\u2019t just a bar where veterans sit around and complain about their hardships.\n\nIt is a place that tackles veterans issues with ongoing fundraisers, such as helping them get jobs, education and a home, Kelly said.\n\nThe post sponsors yoga classes, sells artwork of post members in a gallery and offers a heaping plate of turkey with all the fixings on Thanksgiving day.\n\nThe feast was provided by a veterans group founded by Tony Garvin called Boots On The Ground for Boots Not Around, which honors the 66 Coloradans killed in action during the Iraq war.\n\nA single pair of boots was placed on the edge of one of many long dinner tables patriotically decorated in red. The chair in front of the boots was leaned against the table for a Colorado veteran who died in the war.\n\nMinutes before the feast, Diana Aragon bustled through the building as she helped to set up the buffet. She was there in honor of her husband, retired Master Sgt. Pete Aragon, who died of cancer in April.\n\n\u201cHe was the glue that held this post together. It was important to him,\u201d said Aragon as she wiped away tears. \u201cNow that he is gone, I want people to know who he was.\u201d\n\nDozens of men, many wearing jackets displaying patches from every branch of the military, bowed their heads when \u201cPapa Joe\u201d Carlie, 61, said grace before the Thanksgiving meal. He prayed for the veterans.\n\n\u201cYou know without them, there would be no freedom,\u201d Carlie prayed.\n\nAfter the prayer, Carlie loaded up his plate with turkey, stuffing, corn and cranberry sauce and sat down next to a homeless veteran, a close friend. The Vietnam War Army veteran said his shoulder is designated for homeless veterans to cry on. The country should at least provide a home for veterans who risked their lives for their country, he said.\n\n\u201cSeveral of our brethren have died right on these streets in Denver,\u201d he said.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or @kirkmitchell and denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "First VFW in America serves Thanksgiving meal to vets and homeless in Denver", "title": "First VFW in America serves Thanksgiving meal to vets and homeless in Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/26/first-vfw-in-america-serves-thanksgiving-meal-to-vets-and-homeless-in-denver/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151126__20151127_A2_CD26VETSp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151126__20151127_A2_CD26VETSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-26T14:06:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T07:18:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The 44-year-old man gave cheerful greetings to fellow war veterans who came Thursday to \u201cVFW 1\u201d to share a Thanksgiving feast on Santa Fe Drive.\nThe jobless, homeless, wheelchair-bound man was positioned at the entrance of a Veterans of Foreign Wars post Thanksgiving morning because of a glowing, unquenchable spirit.\nAfter the prayer, Carlie loaded up his plate with turkey, stuffing, corn and cranberry sauce and sat down next to a homeless veteran, a close friend.\nThe Vietnam War Army veteran said his shoulder is designated for homeless veterans to cry on.\nVFW 1 was the first post established by the organization in the country, in 1899."}
