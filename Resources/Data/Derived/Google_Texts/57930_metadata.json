The foreigners were even flown to Miami to further the scheme, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nBased in Coral Gables, the HMO was marketed in 16 Florida counties, including the Tampa Bay area. In Florida, the HMO was sold under several brands, mainly DayBreak and Sunrise. As of June 30, it had about 10,500 enrollees, according to records from the Office of Insurance Regulation. OIR spokesman Harvey Bennett said Wednesday updated numbers aren't available.\n\nEnrollment was frozen by both federal and state authorities after the plan was accused of failing to provide needed medications to patients and after misstating its assets in a state report. As Health News Florida reported last month, the plans sponsored by Florida Healthcare Plus were erroneously listed as options on Medicare.gov for 2015 enrollment, which started Oct. 15 and goes through Dec. 7. The plans have since been removed.\n\nEight of those indicted are residents of Miami-Dade, and three are residents of Nicaragua, according to a press release from the Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s office. That release said the state and federal attorneys have frozen the HMO\u2019s assets .\n\nThe HMO, based in Coral Gables, was most active in South Florida, but had offices and enrollees in Tampa and several other cities.\n\nEight of those indicted are residents of Miami-Dade, and three are residents of Nicaragua, according to a press release from the Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s office.
