Wilmington Firefighters Memorial

WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) — Area firefighters, law enforcement and community members remembered 9/11 at Wilmington’s Firefighter Memorial, which features a piece of a beam from the World Trade Center.

During the ceremony Friday morning a wreath was laid at the memorial, honoring lives lost in the attacks that day 14 years ago.

New Hanover County Sheriff Ed McMahon said though it was an emotional day, he is also proud of the bravery shown by the first responders.

“It’s a good time to not only remember 14 years ago, the tragedy,” Sheriff McMahon said. “But also to just be thankful for emergency workers and the sacrifices they do every day.”

The Sheriff encourages the community to thank an emergency worker today. He said the courage it takes to do those kind of jobs each day makes him proud to be an American.
