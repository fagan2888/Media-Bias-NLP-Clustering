The San Gabriel Mission is one of the oldest buildings in Los Angeles County.\n\nA decade earlier, the county had removed a cross from the seal \u2014 this one shown floating above the Hollywood Bowl \u2014 after being threatened with a similar lawsuit. The proponents of reinstating the cross on the seal argued it was needed to make the image of the mission historically and architecturally accurate. When the seal was redesigned in 2004, there was no cross on top of the mission, as it had gone missing during earthquake retrofitting. The cross was later restored atop the building.\n\nIn a 55-page ruling released Thursday, U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder wrote that the addition of the cross \u201dcarries with it an aura of prestige, authority, and approval. By singling out the cross for addition to the seal, the county necessarily lends its prestige and approval to a depiction of one faith\u2019s sectarian imagery.\n\n\u201cThe county also provides a platform for broadcasting that imagery on county buildings, vehicles, flags, and stationary.\u2026 Permitting such a change and the associated expenditure of public funds places the county\u2019s power, prestige, and purse behind a single religion, Christianity, without making any such benefit available on an equal basis to those with secular objectives or alternative sectarian views.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hope nobody learns what \"Los Angeles\" translates to....05/26/2016 19:38:53PM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Hope nobody learns what \"Los Angeles\" translates to...", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Los Angeles County Seal's Tiny Cross Ruled Unconstitutional", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/04/08/los-angeles-seal-unconstitutional-tiny-cross-n2145233", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/240/d63c2616-4e80-477a-97ca-72df884da87c.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Hope nobody learns what \"Los Angeles\" translates to...", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Los Angeles County Seal's Tiny Cross Ruled Unconstitutional", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/04/08/los-angeles-seal-unconstitutional-tiny-cross-n2145233", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/240/d63c2616-4e80-477a-97ca-72df884da87c.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Los Angeles County Seal's Tiny Cross Ruled Unconstitutional , Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "A judge has ruled that the tiny cross on top of the San Gabriel Mission, pictured in the official seal of Los Angeles County, is unconstitutional.\nThe San Gabriel Mission is one of the oldest buildings in Los Angeles County.\nBy singling out the cross for addition to the seal, the county necessarily lends its prestige and approval to a depiction of one faith\u2019s sectarian imagery.\nA decade earlier, the county had removed a cross from the seal \u2014 this one shown floating above the Hollywood Bowl \u2014 after being threatened with a similar lawsuit.\nThe proponents of reinstating the cross on the seal argued it was needed to make the image of the mission historically and architecturally accurate."}
