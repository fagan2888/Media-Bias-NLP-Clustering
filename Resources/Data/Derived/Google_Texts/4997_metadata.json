His 6.50 ERA is the second-worst among qualified major league starters. Batters are hitting .321 against him, with an .838 on-base-plus-slugging percentage.\n\n\u201cI know that he\u2019s out there, throwing hard, good fastball again,\u201d manager Matt Williams told reporters following the game Saturday, trying to offer some words of explanation. \u201cEarly fastball command was there, but just when he got them to two strikes he couldn\u2019t put them away. That happens sometimes, but today it was just outside the strike zone or up in the strike zone or not throwing it where he wanted to with two strikes. So, it happens.\u201d\n\nNo, it doesn\u2019t. Or it hasn\u2019t before. Not to \u201cThe Savior.\u201d\n\nThis Strasburg is probably even confusing to the gutless wonders who declared the Nationals fools for shutting him down after 160 innings pitched in their National League East division-winning 2012 season, as part of the team\u2019s protocol for post-Tommy John recovery \u2014 the same plan they followed for Jordan Zimmermann the year before.\n\nThe critics likely expected Strasburg to wind up blowing out his elbow again or encounter some other ailment as payback for the gall of general manager Mike Rizzo protecting an athlete. That was probably the scenario they hoped for, and so far have been denied, as Strasburg has pitched 442 innings since the 2012 shutdown \u2014 for the most part, healthy innings.\n\nThis one, though \u2014 a seemingly healthy Strasburg who just can\u2019t pitch \u2014 well, no one expected it, critics and supporters alike. And no one seems to have an answer on how the next pitcher who was going to change baseball could struggle so much with the basics of command and mechanics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not concerned,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of our guys. He been one of our guys. He will continue to be one of our guys. He\u2019s going through a rough stretch. It doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t come out of it his next start and be absolutely dominant. He has that capability every time he walks out on the mound. He will work hard until the next one and be ready to go. I\u2019m not concerned about it. Everybody has issues sometimes and has a mini-slump. The next opportunity for him is five days from now and you never know what might happen there. It may be really good.\u201d\n\nYou never know what might happen there? It may be really good? These are words they used in post-game press conferences to describe Garrett Mock or Collin Balester. To use them to describe Stephen Strasburg is unnerving. And if it is unnerving to us, imagine what it is like inside Strasburg\u2019s head \u2014 a seemingly complicated place where doubt could feast like Bartolo Colon at an Old Country Buffet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Strasburg told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m not pitching to my ability and I just keep grinding. \u2026 It\u2019s definitely something that I\u2019ve never experienced before. I think it\u2019s a test. It\u2019s a test for me and I\u2019m going look at it that way and I\u2019m not going to quit. I\u2019m going to keep going.\u201d\n\nHe better. Williams is right about one thing \u2014 Strasburg is one of their guys. It may seem like the pitching-rich Nationals, the hottest team in baseball, can survive a struggling Strasburg. But Doug Fister is on the disabled list with right forearm tightness and Gio Gonzalez continues to be inconsistent, although he was outstanding on Sunday. And Strasburg will be one of the ones left behind when Zimmermann and Fister leave for free agency at the end of the season. They are counting on him for the new 2016 version of the Nationals rotation \u2014 the last year of his contract in Washington.\n\nThe night of Strasburg\u2019s 2010 debut, former Nationals manager Frank Robinson, working for baseball commissioner Bud Selig, walked into the Nationals clubhouse before the game and declared, \u201cWhere\u2019s \u2018The Savior\u2019 hiding?\u201d\n\nHe appeared that night five years ago. He has shown up from time to time since. But now, he\u2019s lost.\n\n\u2022 Thom Loverro is co-host of \u201cThe Sports Fix,\u201d noon to 2 p.m. daily on ESPN 980 and espn980.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Strasburg, who former Nationals manager Frank Robinson termed \"The Savior\" on the night of his debut in 2010, has been dominant, down on his luck and disabled.
