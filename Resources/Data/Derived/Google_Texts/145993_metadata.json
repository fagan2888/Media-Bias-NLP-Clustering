Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican and chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said.\n\n\u201cRight now the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, is being very resistant to agreeing to attend. I\u2019m prepared to issue a subpoena, if need be, to get them there. I think the public needs to hear about this,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said on C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers\u201d program, taped Friday and aired Sunday.\n\nThe OPM didn\u2019t respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nAs the new chairman of the committee, Mr. Chaffetz has oversight over much of government, and has ongoing investigations ranging from drone policy to border security to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s questionable email practices during her time in office.\n\nOne major topic for his committee is the IRS\u2019s targeting of tea party groups, and of former IRS employee Lois G. Lerner\u2019s emails, which the agency had said were lost when her computer hard drive crashed.\n\nSince then, the IRS\u2019s inspector general found backup tapes with those emails, and has been working to reconstruct them, as well as looking into why the IRS itself was unable to find those emails.\n\nMr. Chaffetz said the inspector general was just \u201cdays away\u201d from releasing his findings, but said he suspects it was more than just bureaucratic bungling that kept the IRS from turning over the Lerner emails. He said it took the inspector just 15 days, start-to-finish, to get backup computer tapes and find emails on them \u2014 and when the investigators approached the storage facility where the backup tapes were kept, the staffers said the IRS hadn\u2019t never bothered to ask for the tapes.\n\n\u201cIt really does reek and smell and look like, I think, an obstruction of Congress,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said.\n\nOn border security, Mr. Chaffetz just returned from a visit to Texas where he saw a Customs and Border Protection helicopter was shot at from the Mexican side, and the pilot was saved by his bulletproof vest.\n\nHe had particularly harsh words for Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who this week said apprehensions of illegal immigrants along the border are down, which means overall illegal immigration is down. He said the pace is the slowest for illegal immigration since 1972.\n\nMr. Chaffetz, though, said that\u2019s a questionable equation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a great deal of respect for him, but he\u2019s doing this country a disservice by telling people that apprehensions are down so it\u2019s safer. I\u2019ll go show him, any place he wants, where they\u2019re able to cross by the hundreds on a nightly basis,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said.\n\nThe congressman also said Secretary of State John F. Kerry needs to spend more time in Mexico helping that country get a handle on the drug-fueled violence that\u2019s left a deteriorating security situation, particularly along their border with the U.S.\n\n\u201cHe spends an awful lot of time in France riding his bike, he\u2019s been to the Middle East and that\u2019s a troubled situation, but we have 100,000 people who\u2019ve died in Mexico in the last nine years and our secretary of state has been there once?\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound to me like it\u2019s a priority and I think it should be.\u201d\n\nMr. Chaffetz has demanded answers about steps the State Department is taking to protect its employees who work in northern Mexico, and has raised concerns over a plan department staffers in the region told him about to cut their danger pay.\n\nThe State Department has said it takes security of its personnel seriously, and periodically reviews its danger pay awards to make sure they match the needs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House's top investigator said in an interview Sunday that he may have to subpoena the Office of Personnel Management to testify next week after Obama administration officials resisted his request to come before Congress and detail the massive identity theft revealed last week.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The House\u2019s top investigator said in an interview Sunday that he may have to subpoena the Office of Personnel Management to testify next week after Obama administration officials resisted his request to come before Congress and detail the massive identity theft revealed last week.", "title": "Jason Chaffetz may subpoena Office of Personnel Management to testify on identity theft", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/14/jason-chaffetz-may-subpoena-office-of-personnel-ma/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/14/6_142015_ap8144223080898201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/14/6_142015_ap8144223080898201.jpg", "description": "The House's top investigator said in an interview Sunday that he may have to subpoena the Office of Personnel Management to testify next week after Obama administration officials resisted his request", "card": "summary", "title": "Jason Chaffetz may subpoena Office of Personnel Management to testify"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Jason Chaffetz, Office Of Personnel Management, Congress, Internal Revenue Service"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019ll go show him, any place he wants, where they\u2019re able to cross by the hundreds on a nightly basis,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said.\nI think the public needs to hear about this,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said on C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers\u201d program, taped Friday and aired Sunday.\n\u201cIt really does reek and smell and look like, I think, an obstruction of Congress,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said.\nMr. Chaffetz, though, said that\u2019s a questionable equation.\nOn border security, Mr. Chaffetz just returned from a visit to Texas where he saw a Customs and Border Protection helicopter was shot at from the Mexican side, and the pilot was saved by his bulletproof vest."}
