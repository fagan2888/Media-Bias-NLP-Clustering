A missing 16-year-old New Mexico girl is believed to be in the Denver area with a 37-year-old man, Denver police said Sunday morning.

An Amber Alert was issued for Andrea Lucero who is missing from Rio Rancho, New Mexico. Lucero may be in the company of Joe Medina, according to a Denver Police Department bulletin.

Lucero is described as four feet eleven inches tall, about 98 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes. Medina is described as six feet one inch tall, around 220 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes.

The two are possibly associated with a black 2001 Lexus convertible with a New Mexico license registration of 188RFK, police said. Lucero and Medina are believed to be in the Denver area with potential plans to travel west out of the state, authorities said.

Anyone who sees either of these individuals or has any information regarding their whereabouts is asked to contact the Denver Police Department at 720-913-2000.
