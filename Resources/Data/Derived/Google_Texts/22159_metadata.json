Charlie Culberson was optioned to Triple-A to create room. There could be another roster move in the next few days based on Anderson\u2019s bruised left finger. It was worse Sunday than expected, swelling significantly over night. He will undergo an X-Ray and possibly an MRI. He injured the finger on a groundball out in Saturday\u2019s game, exiting in the top of the fourth inning.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a firecracker went off in my batting glove,\u201d said Anderson, wondering aloud about his injury curse the past few seasons. The video included here of Anderson is from Saturday. The finger has not improved.\n\nIf Anderson goes on the disabled list \u2014 a distinct possibility \u2014 Franklin Morales is the logical replacement in the rotation. He was moved to the bullpen to keep Jordan Lyles start, but Morales has not pitched in relief yet.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brett Anderson,Franklin Morales,Tyler Chatwood", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Tyler Chatwood was activated for his season debut Sunday, just in time for the Rockies to shift their concern to pitcher Brett Anderson.", "title": "Tyler Chatwood returns as Brett Anderson might leave to DL", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/04/13/tyler-chatwood-activated-charlie-culberson-optioned-bad-news-brett-anderson/17193/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2013/06/tyler-chatwood-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Tyler Chatwood was activated for his season debut Sunday, just in time for the Rockies to shift their concern to pitcher Brett Anderson.", "title": "Tyler Chatwood activated, Charlie Culberson optioned and bad news about Brett Anderson", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/04/13/tyler-chatwood-activated-charlie-culberson-optioned-bad-news-brett-anderson/17193/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2013/06/tyler-chatwood-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Tyler Chatwood was activated for his season debut Sunday, just in time for the Rockies to shift their concern to pitcher Brett Anderson."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabe2\"", "article_summary": "There could be another roster move in the next few days based on Anderson\u2019s bruised left finger.\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Tyler Chatwood was activated for his season debut Sunday, just in time for the Rockies to shift their concern to pitcher Brett Anderson.\n\u201cIt felt like a firecracker went off in my batting glove,\u201d said Anderson, wondering aloud about his injury curse the past few seasons.\nIf Anderson goes on the disabled list \u2014 a distinct possibility \u2014 Franklin Morales is the logical replacement in the rotation.\nHe was moved to the bullpen to keep Jordan Lyles start, but Morales has not pitched in relief yet."}
