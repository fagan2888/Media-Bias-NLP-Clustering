From POLITICO\u2019s Andrew Restuccia and Elana Schor: \u201cEven if a package of green incentives \u2014 such as an extension of perennially embattled tax credits for wind and solar \u2014 were to win 60 votes for a bill ending crude exports, the deal would face significant resistance among House conservatives who want to see the ban removed without sweeteners for the left. \u2018Republicans would have to be morons to agree to that deal\u2019 marrying oil exports to renewables and climate language, GOP energy lobbyist Mike McKenna said in an interview. \u2018We may have a Republican president in 16 months. Making a deal in 2017 may be a necessity.

More than a storefront, or a website. It\u2019s working together as a community, creating the things people want, today. It\u2019s the smile at the end of every transaction and the effort and innovation that customers don\u2019t see. Retail businesses \u2013 98% of which are small businesses \u2013 are at the heart of many towns and neighborhoods nationwide. That\u2019s why when retail thrives, communities thrive.
