In this instance, the role of disingenuous and ill-informed politician was played by North Carolina\u2019s GOP Sen. Richard Burr, who decided to use his question time to imply that the Canadian healthcare system was bad because it led to Canadian doctors moving to America and rich people going to the U.S. to get complicated and expensive surgery. These were both good points \u2013 except for the fact that they were, as Martin made clear, completely wrong.\n\nI\u2019ve seen some senators struggle during committee hearings before, but this was unusually brutal. Burr, reading prepared questions with an unfortunate smirk, genuinely seemed to think he\u2019d get the better of the Canadian physician.\n\nHe thought wrong.\n\nThe North Carolina Republican, citing testimony that doesn\u2019t exist, asked why doctors are exiting the public system in Canada. \u201cThank you for your question, senator,\u201d Martin responded. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t express myself in a way that made myself understood, I apologize. There are no doctors exiting the public system in Canada; and in fact we see a net influx of physicians from the United States into the Canadian system over the last number of years.\u201d\n\nUndeterred, Burr tried again and again, asking pointed questions based on faulty assumptions. In each instance, Martin patiently and politely explained why the conservative senator was mistaken.\n\nIt led to one especially memorable exchange:\n\nBURR: On average, how many Canadian patients on a waiting list die each year? Do you know? MARTIN: I don\u2019t, sir, but I know that there are 45,000 in America who die waiting because they don\u2019t have insurance at all.\n\nOuch .", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "If you're going to come at a Canadian healthcare policy expert, you best not miss.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/martin-1-burr-0", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "If you're going to come at a Canadian healthcare policy expert, you best not miss.", "title": "Martin 1, Burr 0", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/martin-1-burr-0", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/congress_unemployment.jpeg-08021.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/martin-1-burr-0", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/congress_unemployment.jpeg-08021.jpg?itok=ERPNtuYA", "title": "Martin 1, Burr 0", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "If you're going to come at a Canadian healthcare policy expert, you best not miss."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-03-14T09:54:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "canada,health,health-care,health-care-policy,health-care-reform,richard-burr,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Martin 1, Burr 0", "published": 1, "date": "03/14/2014 09:54:00 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/martin-1-burr-0"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "If you're going to come at a Canadian healthcare policy expert, you best not miss.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Canada, Health Care, Health Care Policy, Richard Burr"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce216\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThank you for your question, senator,\u201d Martin responded.\nBurr, reading prepared questions with an unfortunate smirk, genuinely seemed to think he\u2019d get the better of the Canadian physician.\nThese were both good points \u2013 except for the fact that they were, as Martin made clear, completely wrong.\nMARTIN: I don\u2019t, sir, but I know that there are 45,000 in America who die waiting because they don\u2019t have insurance at all.\nThe North Carolina Republican, citing testimony that doesn\u2019t exist, asked why doctors are exiting the public system in Canada."}
