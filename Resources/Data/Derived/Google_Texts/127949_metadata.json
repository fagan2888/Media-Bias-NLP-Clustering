The extremist group uses border crossings to shift fighters and resources to different fronts as it seeks to defend and expand its self-styled Islamic caliphate.\n\nIS group captured the Tanf crossing from Syrian government forces in May 2015.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on activists inside Syria, said IS fighters recaptured the crossing, but the Homs Media Center, another opposition outlet, said clashes were still underway.\n\nThe fighting began Friday when U.S.-backed fighters from the Free Syrian Army's Southern Front routed IS fighters at the border, killing one and wounding several others, according to the Local Coordination Committees, an opposition network in Syria.\n\nThe Observatory said the FSA fighters crossed into Syria from Jordan to launch the attack, and were supported by airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition.\n\nThe IS-affiliated Aamaq News Agency denied the crossing was ever captured.\n\nIS fighters meanwhile attacked the government's supply route to the contested northern city of Aleppo, killing 15 soldiers, the Observatory said. Government forces repelled the attack and secured the road, according to the Observatory and SANA, the Syrian state news agency.\n\nSANA said government forces killed dozens of IS fighters in the clashes.\n\nA U.S. counterterrorism official said the IS group has lost important ground in Syria in recent weeks.\n\n\"The overall square kilometers that Daesh has now lost in Syria has increased exponentially in just over the last couple weeks. But it's not just the territories, it's the strategic nature of the territory,\" said Brett McGurk, President Barack Obama's envoy to the coalition, at a press conference in Baghdad, referring to the extremist group by its Arabic acronym.\n\nThe group still controls large swaths of Syria and Iraq, including Iraq's second largest city, Mosul. It has also carried out a number of large bombings in Iraq over the past week that have killed dozens of people.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Susannah George in Baghdad contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Syria rebels battle IS for control of  Iraq crossing - AP News: BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Syrian insurgents were battling the Islamic State .05/26/2016 19:01:46PM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Syrian insurgents were battling the Islamic State group for control of a", "title": "AP News - Syria rebels battle IS for control of  Iraq crossing", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/03/05/syria-rebels-take-border-crossing-from-is-n2129050", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\65\\1a39502b-9ad1-49d7-ba55-79836723da56.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Syrian insurgents were battling the Islamic State group for control of a", "title": "AP News - Syria rebels battle IS for control of  Iraq crossing", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/03/05/syria-rebels-take-border-crossing-from-is-n2129050", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/65/1a39502b-9ad1-49d7-ba55-79836723da56.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Syria rebels battle IS for control of  Iraq crossing, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The group still controls large swaths of Syria and Iraq, including Iraq's second largest city, Mosul.\nBEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Syrian insurgents were battling the Islamic State group for control of a key border post with Iraq on Saturday, a day after the U.S.-backed fighters seized control of the crossing, activists said.\nThe Tanf crossing in southeastern Syria links the Homs province, including the IS-held ancient city of Palmyra, to Iraq's Anbar province, where IS has a large presence.\nIS group captured the Tanf crossing from Syrian government forces in May 2015.\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on activists inside Syria, said IS fighters recaptured the crossing, but the Homs Media Center, another opposition outlet, said clashes were still underway."}
