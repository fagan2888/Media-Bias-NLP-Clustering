Credit: Reuters\n\nBy\n\nSOCHI, Russia (AP) \u2014 Phil Kessel is the first American in more than a decade to score a hat trick in an Olympic hockey tournament.\n\nHe\u2019s more interested in something no American has accomplished on Olympic ice since 1980 \u2014 winning a gold medal.\n\nKessel scored two of his three goals within the opening five minutes to lead the U.S. to a 5-1 win against Slovenia on Sunday. The U.S. is undefeated through three games and if it can win three more, the nation will celebrate its first Olympic championship in hockey since the \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d at the Lake Placid Games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the wins, right?\u201d Kessel asked, rhetorically. \u201cWe just want to win games.\u201d\n\nNo members of Team USA was alive when the U.S. beat the Soviet Union in 1980 in one of the biggest upsets in sports history. But if they end up with gold around their neck on Sunday, this title won\u2019t be regarded as a miracle.\n\nKessel and his teammates earned an automatic spot in the quarterfinals of the 12-team tournament by routing Slovenia and Slovakia, and outlasting Russia in a shootout, to finish atop their group. They\u2019ve scored 15 and allowed only four goals so far.\n\nKessel scored 1:04 after the puck dropped, removing any thought the Americans would have a hangover after their much hyped victory against the host Russians on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI was certainly concerned after the emotional game,\u201d said coach Dan Bylsma. \u201cWe were fortunate that we got right out of the gate with a couple great plays.\u201d\n\nKessel\u2019s third goal midway through the second period made him the first U.S. player to score a hat trick at the Olympics since John LeClair did it on Feb. 15, 2002, against Finland.\n\n\u201cI was saying right before the game, I hope somebody does something pretty cool, so that some of the focus gets off of me and onto someone else,\u201d said T.J. Oshie, who scored on four of six attempts in an eight-round shootout against Russia. \u201cHe didn\u2019t need six shots in the shootout to do it. He did it in regular time.\u201d\n\nSlovenia\u2019s Marcel Rodman scored with 17.6 seconds left in the game, denying U.S. goalie Ryan Miller a shutout. Miller made 17 saves in his Sochi debut.\n\n\u201cYeah, I definitely had some nerves,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt was an important game to ensure that we\u2019re at the top of our pool.\u201d\n\nWith plenty of support at the other end of the rink, the 2010 silver medal winner didn\u2019t need to worry.\n\n\u201cThey were stronger on the puck,\u201d Slovenia coach Matjaz Kopitar said. \u201cThey\u2019re strong. They\u2019re fast.\u201d\n\nRyan McDonagh scored about a minute after Kessel\u2019s third goal to put the Americans up 4-0. David Backes gave them a five-goal cushion early in the third.\n\nKessel is the first American to score four goals in the three-game preliminary round of the Olympic tournament since Bill Cleary and Roger Christian in 1960. Fittingly, the native of Madison, Wis., and his teammates were sporting throwback jerseys in the style Cleary and Christian wore at the games in Squaw Valley \u2014 \u201cUSA\u201d from right shoulder to left hip.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got grit and determination throughout the lineup, but that\u2019s the type of speed and skill we need,\u201d Bylsma said.\n\nThe U.S. also has two goalies, Quick and Miller, who are potentially great, and a good one in Jimmy Howard. Who will be in net for the quarterfinals, when it\u2019s win-or-go-home?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you that now,\u201d Bylsma said after Sunday\u2019s game.\n\nLuka Gracnar made 23 saves for Slovenia, who play in the qualification-playoff round Tuesday after beating Slovakia and losing to the U.S. and Russia.\n\nEven if Slovenia doesn\u2019t win another game, it has been a successful appearance for a country that earned a surprising spot in the Olympic hockey tournament for the first time.\n\nSlovenia has just one NHL player, Anze Kopitar of the Los Angeles Kings, and he didn\u2019t play in the third period of Sunday\u2019s game because flu-like symptoms, according to his father and coach.\n\n\u201cHe don\u2019t feel good, because he has something with the stomach,\u201d Matjaz Kopitar said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t feel well. He was without the power. Hopefully, he\u2019s going to be better.\u201d\n\nSlovenia was also without another key player, forward Sabahudin Kovacevic, who was suspended for one game for swinging his left elbow and landing it on the head of Slovakia\u2019s Tomas Kopecky.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Larry Lage on Twitter: http://twitter.com/larrylage", "article_metadata": {"title": "Phil Kessel scores hat trick in U.S. win over Slovenia", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/olympics/phil-kessel-scores-hat-trick-in-us-win-over-slovenia-b99206792z1-245748311.html", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99206792z.1_20140216104947_000_glt4s85g.1-1.jpg", "height": 1281}, "type": "article", "description": "Phil Kessel scored two of his three goals in the opening five minutes and became the first U.S. player to record an Olympic hat trick in more than a decade, leading the Americans to a 5-1 win over Slovenia on Sunday.", "title": "Phil Kessel scores hat trick in U.S. win over Slovenia"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99206792z.1_20140216104947_000_glt4s85g.1-1.jpg", "title": "Phil Kessel scores hat trick in U.S. win over Slovenia", "description": "Phil Kessel scored two of his three goals in the opening five minutes and became the first U.S. player to record an Olympic hat trick in more than a decade, leading the Americans to a 5-1 win over Slovenia on Sunday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@journalsentinel"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd74be\"", "article_summary": "Credit: ReutersBySOCHI, Russia (AP) \u2014 Phil Kessel is the first American in more than a decade to score a hat trick in an Olympic hockey tournament.\nKessel scored two of his three goals within the opening five minutes to lead the U.S. to a 5-1 win against Slovenia on Sunday.\nKessel is the first American to score four goals in the three-game preliminary round of the Olympic tournament since Bill Cleary and Roger Christian in 1960.\nTeam USA's Phil Kessel is congratulated by teammate Joe Pavelski after scoring on Slovenia during the first period.\nEven if Slovenia doesn\u2019t win another game, it has been a successful appearance for a country that earned a surprising spot in the Olympic hockey tournament for the first time."}
