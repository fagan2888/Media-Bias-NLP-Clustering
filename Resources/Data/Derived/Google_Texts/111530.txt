SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Shops, businesses and schools are shut in Indian-controlled Kashmir after separatist groups opposed to Indian rule announced a strike to protest a visit by the country’s prime minister.

Newly elected Narendra Modi is on his first official visit to the disputed Himalayan region on Friday. He is expected to inaugurate a railway line and a power station, and also review security and development.

The scenic region is divided between India and Pakistan but claimed by both the rival neighbors in its entirety.

A police officer, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, says a curfew has been declared in the old quarters of Srinagar, the main city in Indian Kashmir, and residents have been asked to stay indoors. He says the restrictions were imposed to prevent any violent protests.
