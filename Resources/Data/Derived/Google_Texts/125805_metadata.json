(Photo: David Wallace/The Republic) Story Highlights University of Arizona Health Network and Banner Health are merging on Feb. 27\n\nThe new network will be anchored by academic medical centers in Tucson and Phoenix\n\nWe aim to produce lots of quality doctors and provide better care at lower costs\n\nIn a few days, the merger of the University of Arizona Health Network into Banner Health will be complete.\n\nOn Feb. 27, UA Health Network will become part of Banner, and the long-term partnership with the University of Arizona Colleges of Medicine in Phoenix and Tucson will be reflected in a new name for this statewide academic enterprise: Banner\u2013University Medicine.\n\nRELATED: Regents approve merger\n\nThe creation of a private-public partnership of this magnitude and scale is a tremendously complex endeavor. Few private-public partnerships such as ours exist, so there was no \"blueprint\" we could follow.\n\nBut the primary focus that helped drive and join our organizations through long hours of sometimes challenging negotiations was the vision that this merger and partnership could bring long-term and important benefits to the people of Arizona.\n\nIt has the potential to transform academic medicine in the U.S.\n\nOver the next 30 years the population of Arizona will increase significantly. At the same time, the gradual aging of the population will continue. As a result, the need for doctors will increase.\n\nDuring this same time period, through the thick and thin of lean state budgets and ample ones, this agreement will bring $40 million a year to support the UA Colleges of Medicine in Phoenix and Tucson. This funding source, combined with continued support of the state, will ensure a steady supply of quality physicians to care for Arizona's citizens.\n\nOUR VIEW: Doctor education gets a booster shot\n\nBanner\u2013University Medicine will be anchored by academic medical centers in Tucson and Phoenix. These centers will serve as catalysts for a significant gathering of physicians, researchers and professionals who support them.\n\nWe anticipate that this will result in corridors of health care-related commerce, attracting highly skilled workers into high-paying jobs. Clearly, these centers hold strong potential to serve as powerful economic drivers for local communities and the state.\n\nPeter S. Fine (Photo: handout)\n\nThere is growing evidence that the real transformation of our health-care system \u2014 a system that provides better care and improved service at lower costs \u2014 will be found in two areas that haven't been the focus of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOne is the over-usage of costly medical services. The other is the linkage of medical provider organizations with private and government insurers in models of care that successfully utilize population health management.\n\nThrough highly coordinated care, population health management seeks to improve care, reduce unnecessary and duplicated medical services, and better manage the care of complex, chronic patients \u2014 all at a lower cost. This is transformation.\n\nWe are convinced that our private/public partnership will help play a lead role in the transformation of health care in our state and beyond. The academic rigor of Arizona's premier medical education program will be combined with the clinical delivery excellence and population health know-how of the state's leading health system.\n\nAnn Weaver Hart (Photo: handout)\n\nThis is a formula that can elevate both the quality and management of care for our state's citizens, along with the reputation of Arizona as a national leader in health care.\n\nAs we prepare for our launch into this exciting future that will reshape the health-care landscape of our state, we want to express our gratitude to three groups of visionary leaders that were instrumental in helping to move this merger forward:\n\nWe are grateful to the Arizona Board of Regents for their approval on behalf of the University of Arizona and to the Banner Health Board of Directors for their insightful focus on the transformation of health care. Finally, we are grateful for the leadership and courage of UA Health Network's Board of Directors, who guided the transition of their organization into Banner Health.\n\nPeter S. Fine is president and CEO of Banner Health. Ann Weaver Hart is president of the University of Arizona.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1AaIpbG", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Officials: The merger that's creating Banner-University Medicine has the potential to transform care nationwide.", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "Officials: The merger that's creating Banner-University Medicine has the potential to transform care nationwide.", "title": "New name, new future for health care", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2015/02/19/banner-ua-health-merger/23696839/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Officials: The merger that's creating Banner-University Medicine has the potential to transform care nationwide.", "title": "New name, new future for health care", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d4c7d18d64da1cd288c09e57d18fd56c5fbe8c86/c=0-0-2301-2301&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/02/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635599628439323212-ua-medical.jpg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/University of Arizona", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/University of Arizona", "title": "New name, new future for health care", "author": "Peter Fine and Ann Weaver Hart", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/op-ed", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/098dc6bac2e64e9e554ca3ce7979da60d5303bc1/c=107-0-1833-2301/local/-/media/2015/02/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635599628439323212-ua-medical.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f2b58a772490e2a64430f0eecd693eb95d8ce5bd/c=0-0-2301-2301/local/-/media/2015/02/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635599628439323212-ua-medical.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/22c6d25ec770496eac5d8df57aa54e5dd956317d/c=0-0-2754-2071/local/-/media/2015/02/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635599628439323212-ua-medical.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fbc9033e39f23ed6f64d274e6dc734a2417b2a48/c=0-142-2754-1698&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/02/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635599628439323212-ua-medical.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-02-20T15:20:16.163000-07:00", "shorthed": "Officials: New name, new future for health care", "articleid": 23696839, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/18987cbf0fdf8ffe04b78ab5fbdc08c34c7f2eb1/c=0-142-2754-1698/local/-/media/2015/02/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635599628439323212-ua-medical.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c39851ad53aeeb3ec6e3f10d9a2a630517c2564c/c=361-0-1650-2301/local/-/media/2015/02/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635599628439323212-ua-medical.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "banner university medicine, university of arizona health network, banner health, banner ua merger, transforming health care, doctor shortage arizona, affordable care act,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4305\"", "article_summary": "Through highly coordinated care, population health management seeks to improve care, reduce unnecessary and duplicated medical services, and better manage the care of complex, chronic patients \u2014 all at a lower cost.\nWe are convinced that our private/public partnership will help play a lead role in the transformation of health care in our state and beyond.\nFinally, we are grateful for the leadership and courage of UA Health Network's Board of Directors, who guided the transition of their organization into Banner Health.\nAnn Weaver Hart (Photo: handout)This is a formula that can elevate both the quality and management of care for our state's citizens, along with the reputation of Arizona as a national leader in health care.\n(Photo: David Wallace/The Republic) Story Highlights University of Arizona Health Network and Banner Health are merging on Feb. 27The new network will be anchored by academic medical centers in Tucson and PhoenixWe aim to produce lots of quality doctors and provide better care at lower costsIn a few days, the merger of the University of Arizona Health Network into Banner Health will be complete."}
