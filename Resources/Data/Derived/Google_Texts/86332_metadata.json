As for the high-end health insurance coverage for wealthier consumers, Gold\u2019s median premium rate will jump 15 percent compared to 8 percent last year while Platinum\u2019s rate will rise by 12 percent, compared to 10 percent this year.\n\nThe premium increases shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise because numerous health experts and critics of the program have been predicting sizeable increases since last summer. That\u2019s when a number of major insurers across the country sought regulatory approval for significant increases for 2016 to cover higher than anticipated claims from sick people who re-enrolled for individual policies, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nRelated: An Obamacare Change to Medicare Is Backfiring\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), a leading opponent of Obamacare, told reporters earlier this week, \u201cIf you look at how it unfolded over the years, everything we predicted is coming true. Higher premiums, higher co-payments, higher deductibles, lost jobs.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act provides government subsidies in the form of federal tax credits for many lower-income Americans who must purchase insurance on their own because they can\u2019t obtain it through an employer or through a government program like Medicare. The federal subsidies will blunt the impact of price increases for some but not all enrollees for the 2016 coverage season.\n\nThe price hikes will be a mixed bag throughout the country, with consumers in some states seeing relatively modest hikes while others slapped with median price increases for the lowest-price Silver plans of between 18 percent and 26 percent. According to the McKinsey study, consumers in Arizona will see a 20 percent increase, Montana and Tennessee 22 percent, Hawaii 25 percent and Oklahoma 26 percent.\n\nAccording to Modern HealthCare, most enrollees on the federal-run insurance exchanges have chosen Bronze or Silver plans because of their relatively low premiums. From the looks of signups since the start of the new enrollment period on Nov 1, those two plans remain the most popular. However, a majority of the options have high deductibles, in which people could potentially be stuck with large medical expenses before insurance kicks in, the publication reported.\n\nRelated: House GOP Scores a Major Win in Obamacare Legal Challenge\n\nAlong those lines, Modern HealthCare cited the example of family of four living in Tinley Park, Ill, that makes $90,000 a year and has 69 health plan options available for 2016. But 58 of those 69 program options are considered high-deductible plans, meaning people covered by them must pay a certain percentage of their medical costs up-front before the coverage kicks in.\n\nFor the least expensive bronze plans, the average deductible for individuals is $5,731\u2014and 11 percent increase. Silver plans are a little less onerous at $3,117 or an increase of 6 percent for individuals.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Millions of Americans who recently began shopping for new health insurance coverage un", "title": "Millions Face Premium and Deductible Sticker Shock under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/11/Millions-Face-Premium-and-Deductible-Sticker-Shock-under-Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03122010_Kaiser_premiums_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/11/Millions-Face-Premium-and-Deductible-Sticker-Shock-under-Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03122010_Kaiser_premiums_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Millions of Americans who recently began shopping for new health insurance coverage un", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Millions of Americans who recently began shopping for new health insurance coverage under Obamacare may be suffering from sticker shock.\nSilver plans are a little less onerous at $3,117 or an increase of 6 percent for individuals.\nThe federal subsidies will blunt the impact of price increases for some but not all enrollees for the 2016 coverage season.\nAccording to Modern HealthCare, most enrollees on the federal-run insurance exchanges have chosen Bronze or Silver plans because of their relatively low premiums.\nFor the least expensive bronze plans, the average deductible for individuals is $5,731\u2014and 11 percent increase."}
