A Florida teenager reportedly punched a man in the face as part of the “knockout game” fad — but first made sure the man did not have a concealed gun before attacking him.

The Florida Times-Union reported Friday that a teenager approached a man who was walking alone on Neptune Beach on July 31.

The victim said the teen, flanked by three accomplices, asked him if he had a “Glock.” When the man admitted he was not carrying a weapon, the teen punched him in the face.

The “knockout game” has grown in popularity among teenagers across the country. The object of the “game” is to knock a stranger unconscious. In several instances, victims have been severely injured or have died.
