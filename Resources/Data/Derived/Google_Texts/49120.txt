Authorities say a New Jersey couple sent anonymous emails to their son's high school basketball coach in a bid to force him to resign.

The Record reports David and Nanci Kushner are charged with stalking. Their attorney tells the newspaper they have pleaded not guilty.

Authorities say the Cresskill residents, both 49, sent harassing emails to the coach and his employers for two years. Their son plays basketball at the school.

The couple allegedly used two fake email addresses to talk to school officials and the coach on at least four occasions between February 2013 and January of this year.

Authorities say the emails were an attempt to have the coach "dismissed" from that position and his job as a health teacher.
