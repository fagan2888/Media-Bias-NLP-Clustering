Company stock shoots up when people get laid off.\n\nNow we find that the richest Americans \u2013 a tiny sliver of the country\u2019s population \u2013 are literally getting all the benefits of the recovery.\n\nSince 2009, 95% of the total gain in income went to the top 1% of wage earners in America. Only 4% went to the rest of all other Americans. As Thomas Edsall said on the Diane Rehm show this morning, the very top are doing superbly and everyone else is on a flat line.\n\nThe new report is from economists at the University of California, Berkeley, the Paris School of Economics and Oxford University who analyzed Internal Revenue Service figures dating to 1913. They found that over the last 20 years, the wealthy have made most of the gains in income:\n\nFrom 1993 to 2012, for example, average real incomes per family grew by only 17.9% over this 19 year period (implying an annual growth rate of .87%). However, if one excludes the top 1 percent, average real incomes of the bottom 99% grew only by 6.6% from 1993 to 2012 (implying an annual growth rate of .34%). Top 1 percent incomes grew by 86.1% from 1993 to 2012 (implying a 3.3% annual growth rate). This implies that top 1 percent incomes captured just over two-thirds of the overall economic growth of real incomes per family over the period 1993 \u2013 2012.\n\nEconomist Emmanuel Saez of University of California Berkeley explains how things have gotten much worse since the end of 2009. During that period:\n\nTop 1% incomes grew by 31.4% while bottom 99% incomes grew only by 0.4% from 2009 to 2012. Hence, the top 1% captured 95% of the income gains in the first three years of the recovery.\n\nWhat kind of income are we talking about? The top 1 percent of American households had pretax income above $394,000 last year. The top 10 percent had income exceeding $114,000.\n\nEven during more recent economic downturns and recoveries, the income gains have been more equitable: in the economic expansion of the 1990s, the top 1 percent had a 45 percent share of all income increases and a 65 percent share from the expansion that followed the 2001 recession.\n\nDon\u2019t want to pay more for your healthcare or to pay more taxes so other people can get healthcare? Too bad, that\u2019s the system we\u2019ve set up. Everything is getting more expensive, but income isn\u2019t going up for anyone except the very rich. Nothing in the market is helping 99% of people in America to get ahead or even stay afloat, never mind pay for healthcare. Productivity has increased steadily since the 1980s but wages have been flat. That contrasts to the 60s when productivity gains were matched by increases in wages.\n\nIf we are creating a system where there are no economic opportunities for people to pay their own way, increasing taxes to help them get healthcare is the only alternative to a country where half the population has no healthcare.\n\nI include the information on tax rates and the graph below because of a recent e-mail exchange with a reader. He said my recent column about the real reason behind the resistance to universal healthcare was unproductive name calling. He said that the real reason some people are opposed to the expansion of Medicaid and Obamacare is because we are taxed too much already. In fact, tax rates are at the lowest levels in decades.\n\nA report from the Congressional Research Service from September 2012 shows that tax rates have dropped steadily since the 1950s. Also, capital gains tax rates have dropped even more:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The richest Americans are literally getting all the benefits of the recovery.
