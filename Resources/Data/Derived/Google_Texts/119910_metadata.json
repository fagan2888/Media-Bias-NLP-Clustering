CMS officials are still \u201cignoring\u201d integrated security testing requirements for the website, said Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican and chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\n\u201cOn the day of the launch, and even today, there are material failures in the security of the Obamacare website,\u201d Issa said during a committee hearing. \u201cHackers may have already, or may soon, find those vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nSecurity issues?\n\nSeveral Republican critics of the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 insurance-reform law known as Obamacare, questioned the security of HealthCare.gov during two separate hearings Wednesday morning. So far, critics of the law and its main website have been able to point to a single security incident, when one insurance applicant\u2019s personal information was shared with a second user.\n\nHenry Chao, deputy CIO at CMS, and other Obama administration officials defended the security practices at HealthCare.gov during an often contentious oversight committee hearing. Despite a Sept. 27 internal memo raising concerns about a lack of end-to-end testing on the site, security testing is continually happening, Chao said.\n\nHealthCare.gov hasn\u2019t had end-to-end testing because security testing has not been completed on some portions of the website that are not yet rolled out or have not yet been completed, Chao told the committee. \u201cWe are still building parts of the system,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if HealthCare.gov is as secure as a banking website, Chao answered: \u201cIt was designed, implemented, and tested to be secure.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican, asked if the website was \u201cfully\u201d tested to be as secure as other CMS sites.\n\nThe website meets all federal data-security standards, said Chao, who earlier told committee staffers he did not see the Sept. 3 Trenkle memo.\n\nLaunch decision questioned\n\nSeveral Republicans questioned why CMS launched the site on Oct. 1 when there were outstanding questions about security and functionality. Many users were unable to navigate the website in the days after the launch, with page time-outs and several other malfunctions.\n\nThe problems persist a month-and-a-half after launch, Representative James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said. Lankford tried to create an account on HealthCare.gov for about 90 minutes Wednesday morning with no success, he said.\n\nStill, Chao and Todd Park, CTO for the Obama administration, both declined to say whether they would have delayed the website\u2019s launch, knowing what they know now. The decision to launch was not theirs, they both said.\n\nSome Democrats accused committee Republicans of raising security questions in an effort to discredit Obamacare. Republicans are trying \u201cto scare Americans away from the website by once again making unsupported assertions about the risk to their personal medical information,\u201d said Representative Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat. \u201cNobody in this country believes that Republicans want to fix the website.\u201d\n\nThe effect of oversight hearing might be to \u201cexaggerate the security difficulties of the website,\u201d added Representative Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat. \u201cThe entire Internet probably should be more secure.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://core5.staticworld.net/images/article/2013/10/healthcare_dot_gov-100067042-small.jpg", "description": "Henry Chao, deputy CIO at CMS, and other Obama administration officials defended the security practices at HealthCare.gov during an often contentious oversight committee hearing Wednesday.", "og": {"site_name": "PCWorld", "description": "Henry Chao, deputy CIO at CMS, and other Obama administration officials defended the security practices at HealthCare.gov during an often contentious oversight committee hearing Wednesday.", "title": "Lawmakers: HealthCare.gov security warnings came before launch", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2063220/lawmakers-healthcaregov-security-warnings-came-before-launch.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/10/healthcare_dot_gov-100067042-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Henry Chao, deputy CIO at CMS, and other Obama administration officials defended the security practices at HealthCare.gov during an often contentious oversight committee hearing Wednesday.", "title": "Lawmakers: HealthCare.gov security warnings came before launch | PCWorld", "url": "www.pcworld.com/article/2063220/lawmakers-healthcaregov-security-warnings-came-before-launch.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/10/healthcare_dot_gov-100067042-orig.jpg", "site": "@pcworld", "card": "summary", "account_id": 6070762}, "parsely-tags": "type: news,source: idg news service,imported", "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-13", "parsely-image-url": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/10/healthcare_dot_gov-100067042-large.jpg", "parsely-title": "Lawmakers: HealthCare.gov security warnings came before launch", "fb": {"app_id": 1542125639335283, "pages": 7352931005}, "sailthru.tags": "government,security,websites,grant-gross,news,medium", "parsely-author": "Grant Gross", "parsely-section": "Government", "date": "2013-11-13", "parsely-type": "NewsArticle", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-11-13T20:25:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "http://core3.staticworld.net/images/article/2013/10/healthcare_dot_gov-100067042-orig.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-link": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2063220/lawmakers-healthcaregov-security-warnings-came-before-launch.html"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd398e\"", "article_summary": "Republicans also pointed to a Sept. 13 CMS memo saying security vendor Mitre was unable to complete end-to-end security testing of the health-insurance website.\nDespite a Sept. 27 internal memo raising concerns about a lack of end-to-end testing on the site, security testing is continually happening, Chao said.\nHenry Chao, deputy CIO at CMS, and other Obama administration officials defended the security practices at HealthCare.gov during an often contentious oversight committee hearing.\nLaunch decision questionedSeveral Republicans questioned why CMS launched the site on Oct. 1 when there were outstanding questions about security and functionality.\nSeveral Republican critics of the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 insurance-reform law known as Obamacare, questioned the security of HealthCare.gov during two separate hearings Wednesday morning."}
