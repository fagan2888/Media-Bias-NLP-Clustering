Enslaved Africans; dispossessed native Indians; women of every race; white men without property; LGBT Americans; the rights claimed in the stirring Declaration of Independence didn\u2019t fully belong to most of us for many years.\n\nThat\u2019s still a real, historic truth. But maybe, at least this year, we can celebrate the genuinely liberating, animating ideals of a country that came close to living up to them in a dizzying 24 hours last week.\n\nIn just one day, the country we are, the country we\u2019ve been trying so long to become, emerged in indelible, unforgettable images. A few will always stay with me: Our first African-American president, standing before purple-robed ministers, singing the first notes of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d with sorrow and defiance at a funeral for yet another black martyr. Two beaming elderly white gentlemen, Jack Evans and George Harris, becoming the first men to marry in Dallas, Texas, after the Supreme Court ruled for marriage equality.\n\nAs the sun set Friday night, the White House glowed in rainbow colors. In the dawn\u2019s early light the next day, a black woman scrambled up a flagpole, as if to freedom, and snatched down the Confederate flag. For a day, anything seemed possible. Which reminded us that it is. We celebrated a genuine Independence Day in that 24 hours, so let\u2019s pause to take it in on this July 4 holiday.\n\nI\u2019m a staunch believer in the need for people to experience success, in social movements, and that to make it clear what\u2019s possible, you have to make it visible. That\u2019s why San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom will go down in history as an LGBT hero, because by temporarily legalizing marriage equality in San Francisco in 2004, he let American see exactly whose freedom they were crushing with their fear, \u201cpiety\u201d or indifference. When Bree Newsome climbed that pole and took down the Confederate flag, however briefly, she reminded us that direct action makes visible the liberating power of all of us. (Only in writing this paragraph did I notice the similarity of their names; I didn\u2019t link them for any corny reason like that, but make of it what you will.)\n\nEven South Carolina GOP Gov. Nikki Haley opened new political horizons that hadn\u2019t seemed possible just days before. I didn\u2019t give Haley enough credit last week for her turnaround on the Confederate flag. I may not like the fact that it took political courage to reverse herself and rebuke the leaders \u2013 which included some Democrats, to be honest \u2013 who protected that symbol of hate for too long.\n\nBut it did take courage, and it shouldn\u2019t have been lost on me that a young Indian-American woman who grew up Sikh in South Carolina, caught in the bitter chasm between black and white, found the grace and bravery to do what many white men of both parties could not. She changed our notion of what was possible, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marriage equality arrives! The Confederate flag (almost) departs!
