We\u2019ve got depth there. We keep them fresh. Despite the fact that Aaron doesn\u2019t like to come out, we make him come out just to catch his breath. I\u2019d rather them catch their breath standing on the sideline next to me rather than on the field.\u201d\n\nFor the second consecutive week, the Washington Redskins\u2019 offensive line will face a stiff test on Sunday, but it is different than what they saw against the Miami Dolphins.\n\nFisher and the Rams believe in power in numbers and they will spin the dial against the Redskins\u2019 protection.\n\nWhen Donald or Brockers need a break, they rely on Nick Fairley and Ethan Westbrooks. On the ends, William Hayes and Eugene Sims spare Quinn and Long.\n\nIn a 34-31 overtime victory against the Seattle Seahawks last week, the Rams sacked quarterback Russell Wilson six times \u2014 including two sacks each for Donald and Quinn.\n\nDonald was on the field for 72 percent of the team\u2019s defensive snaps, while Quinn and Long were both present for 65 percent. Brockers played 53 percent of the defensive snaps.\n\nNo other defensive lineman played less than 27 percent of the team\u2019s defensive snaps as the Rams mixed and matched against the Seahawks offensive line.\n\nTo compare that with what the Redskins saw against Miami, nose tackles Ndamukong Suh and Earl Mitchell both played 85 percent of the team\u2019s defensive snaps. Defensive end Cameron Wake played 73 percent, while Olivier Vernon played just 38 percent. However, Olivier was injured in the first quarter and returned later in the game.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 offensive line drew praise last week \u2014 particularly the young right side consisting of rookie guard Brandon Scherff and second-year tackle Morgan Moses drew praise for their play against Suh and Wake.\n\nIt will be more difficult this week against the Rams\u2019 different looks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like after you play the Dolphins you can take a sigh of relief,\u201d Redskins coach Jay Gruden said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re faster and they pose a little bit different threat. The [offensive line] can\u2019t ever relax, man. Every week is going to be a challenge for them and we have to stay after them and keep pushing them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Redskins face another tough test in the trenches against the Rams.
