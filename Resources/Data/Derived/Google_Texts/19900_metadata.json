No single practitioner earns recognition in all of the IP, product liability, transactional and regulatory sections, which demonstrates the diverse nature of the work in this sector.\n\nThe life sciences industry is changing and companies are entering a \u201cnew normal\u201d, according to Deloitte\u2019s 2013 \u201cGlobal Life Sciences Outlook\u201d report. Market conditions such as expiring patents, pricing pressures, heightened regulatory scrutiny, persistent economic slowdown and changing demographics around the world are likely to cause upheaval in the coming years, and to survive life sciences companies will need to adapt. The end result will be an industry that is driven by patients and focused on health outcomes.\n\nThe changing health-care landscape presents a myriad of opportunities for lawyers to assist life sciences companies, both during the transition period and into the future, and law firms have been watching closely \u2013 for, as one lawyer put it, \u201cThey need to know what companies are doing in order to follow suit.\u201d The market is seeing \u201cchange at every level\u201d as companies gravitate towards personalised medicine and lawyers across disciplines are seeing an increase in activity.\n\nPATENT LITIGATION\n\nPatent litigation forms the largest section of this edition and lawyers worldwide reported high volumes of activity during the last 12 months. By all accounts, disputes are proliferating and the trend shows no sign of slowing down.\n\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny, pricing pressure and growing payer demands for product performance have placed considerable strain on pharmaceutical companies to maximise returns on products. In this environment, the value of patents is ever higher and, as one lawyer explained, \u201cCompanies are really fighting to defend them.\u201d Even countries such as Switzerland, which had previously not seen such aggressive tactics from generic companies, reported a rise in pharma patent litigation, noting that generic companies are launching products even if a patent has not yet expired, if they believe it to be weak. As generic companies have become more aggressive in their sales efforts, innovator companies are defending their products more forcefully and the result has been an upsurge in patent litigation.\n\nSmall molecules make up over 90 per cent of the drugs on the market today and constitute the bulk of lawyers\u2019 practices. Despite media claims of pipeline issues for the largest companies, lawyers do not expect this type of work to slow down anytime soon. One lawyer described the \u201cpatent cliff\u201d as a \u201cmisconception\u201d, adding that it has been heavily \u201coverstated\u201d by the media. It is true that many blockbuster products are coming off-patent in the next three years and that Big Pharma\u2019s R&D programmes have not been as productive as anticipated, but the increase in transactional activity shows that companies have sought out partnerships and alliances with younger innovator companies and for the majority their pipelines look healthy.\n\nBiologics are becoming increasingly important and market analysts predict that they will represent a $200 billion market as early as 2014. Biosimilars, the \u201csecond version\u201d of a biologic, represent an emerging industry and one that companies are \u201cactively looking to enter\u201d according to lawyers. Europe has been at the forefront of creating a pathway for biosimilars, with the European Medical Agency having approved its first biosimilar in 2006. 2013 saw the European Commission give final marketing approval to Hospira\u2019s Inflectra and Remsima from Celltrion, treatments for a variety of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease and psoriasis. These products can now be launched in countries not covered by patents on Remicade, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s monoclonal antibody drug. European lawyers reported a sharp increase in enquiries from clients relating to biosimilars during the second half of 2013 and expect to see cases reach the courts in the near future. By comparison, the US enacted the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act as late as March 2010 and as of March 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration confirmed that it had not yet received a single application for its biosimilar pathway.\n\nThe use of supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) in Europe is widespread. SPCs extend patent protection for those who experience substantially reduced effective patent terms due to the need to obtain regulatory approval prior to selling their patented product. The past few years have seen a flurry of activity in national courts with many questions being referred to the European Court of Justice in an attempt to provide further clarity on the scope of protection afforded. SPCs are a \u201chuge area of work\u201d for lawyers at present and the law \u201ckeeps changing all the time\u201d.\n\nA further way in which patent holders are looking to maximise their returns and keep generics off the market is by filing for secondary-use patents. These can be gained through patents for composition, new polymorphs/formulation, synthesis and new therapeutic uses. While at present many of the cases are concerning validity, it is an area that lawyers noted \u201cwill need to be dealt with\u201d - although no resolution is expected in the immediate future.\n\nIn the US, the ramifications of the introduction of the America Invents Act in March 2013, which brought the US in line with the rest of the world by changing the system to \u201cfirst to file\u201d rather than \u201cfirst to invent\u201d, are starting to be felt. The Act enables a party to challenge the validity of an issued patent at the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) via an inter partes review (IPR), a proceeding that has been met by the industry with widespread acceptance; as of 3 September 2013 there had been 476 IPR filings and they are expected to double in its second year.\n\nAs in previous years, the looming Unified Patent Court (UPC) was a topic of conversation among lawyers with some predicting an increase in the number of US firms active in the London market as they try to position themselves for the chemical and pharmaceutical seat. At present, the UPC presents a lesser concern for lawyers and clients. The court is not expected to come into operation until 2015 and with many countries predicted to \u201copt out\u201d during the transitional period (seven years but possibly prolonged up to a further seven years by the administrative committee), the real impact of the court will not be seen for a long time.\n\nAn interesting development for lawyers\u2019 practices is the increasing number of instructions to assist in prosecution cases, an area traditionally the domain of patent agents. With many portfolios likely to be litigated at some later date, the risk of the potential loss of privilege in communications with non-attorney patent agents is something that clients are carefully considering.\n\nREGULATORY\n\nIn a highly regulated industry such as life sciences, consideration of the applicable regulations is fundamental to all decisions ranging from corporate transactions to IP licensing and litigation. According to those we spoke to, \u201cregulatory advice is becoming increasingly important to clients\u201d and is \u201cno longer a stand-alone area of law\u201d. Just as private practice lawyers are linking regulatory advice with IP and transactional advice, in-house teams are also joining the respective departments to offer a \u201clinked-up service\u201d.\n\nThe key issues for clients in 2013 were pricing and reimbursement. The economic downturn has placed increased pressure on governments worldwide to decrease their spending and this is having a marked impact on pharmaceutical companies\u2019 profit margins. Furthermore, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, which enters into force in January 2014 has increased scrutiny on drug pricing in the US.\n\nTo add to the mix, the industry also has to come to terms with a changing model of reimbursement, from a volume-based model to one based on value and the quality of service delivered. This will also have an impact on which medicines advance through the R&D pipelines. As one lawyer put it, \u201cThe goalposts have been moved,\u201d and companies will need to go the extra mile to prove their product is better than anything else on the market to deserve a higher price.\n\nLawyers also reported that advising on cutting-edge technology is a \u201cbooming\u201d area of work with applications for smartphones and tablets of particular interest among clients.\n\nA further hot topic is the transparency of clinical trial data. The argument in favour of sharing the data is that it could serve to enhance disease research, fortify drug development and strengthen patient safety; however, some pharmaceutical companies disagree and claim the data is proprietary and sharing it could prompt an unfair market advantage to competitors. The European Medicine Agency is developing a policy on proactive publication of clinical trial data, which is expected to come into force in January 2014. It is a similar picture in the US: Massachusetts senator Ed Markey announced in May 2013 the reintroduction of legislation that is intended to introduce a measure of transparency and bring the US closer towards reforms now under way in the EU. Furthermore, the British Medical Journal (BMJ) introduced a policy in January 2013 to publish clinical trials only if the researchers have agreed to provide detailed patient-level data when requested. This move was applauded by the drug firm GlaxoSmithKline, whose pharmaceuticals R&D president Patrick Vallance said: \u201cGSK fully supports the commitment made today by BMJ to drive greater transparency of clinical trial data. Moves like this should help medical research by allowing scientists to study the detailed results of clinical trials and increase understanding of current and new medicines. Ultimately this should improve patient care.\u201d\n\nAlthough not regulatory work in the traditional sense, fraud and bribery work are also becoming increasingly active areas for lawyers to advise upon within the life sciences industry. Bribery scandals, such as those that have emerged in China (where several pharmaceutical companies are being investigated by the authorities), are expected to become more frequent as companies look to expand into more emerging markets in the future.\n\nCompetition authorities have continued their investigations into the sector focusing on life-cycle management, settlement agreements and pay for delay. The European Commission recently found that settlement agreements entered into by Lundbeck with Alpharma, Merck KGaA/Generics UK, Arrow and Ranbaxy providing that, against a payment, they would not bring generic versions of citalopram on the market for the duration of these agreements, violated the prohibition of agreements that restrict competition. Similar investigations are also under way. Similarly in the US, following the decision by the US Supreme Court in FTC v Actavis, innovators and generics are more likely to become risk-averse in contemplating patent litigation settlements and disputes will increasingly be fought in the court, increasing costs for both sides of the industry and increasing the work for our listed lawyers.\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nOur transactional section features lawyers active in corporate and commercial matters from mergers and acquisitions to licence and distribution agreements; by all accounts activity is starting to pick up, despite financing still being very difficult for start-ups. In Europe, there is very little venture capital funding available; however, the situation in the US is slightly better. The overarching theme was that transactions are becoming increasingly creative and complex, and ensuring the advice of a specialist with a thorough knowledge of the regulatory system is essential to a successful outcome.\n\nOn the corporate side, lawyers reported a high volume of transactions focusing on high-tech and biotechnology companies. The predicted consolidation in the pharmaceutical market is starting to take place and more is expected over the coming years as the cost of getting a product to market increases and companies look to diversify both in terms of products and geographical reach. At present, mature markets generate 59 per cent of total revenues, but they are becoming more difficult locations in which to prosper. According to Deloitte\u2019s 2013 \u201cGlobal Life Sciences Outlook\u201d report, strong growth is expected in China and Russia where pharma sales are expected to more than double in dollar terms by 2016. Argentina, Indonesia, India and Ukraine are also expected to perform strongly due to rising populations and increasing average life expectancy. It follows that companies are very focused on establishing themselves in these markets, and acquisitions are one way in which they will be looking to tap into the emerging markets.\n\nWhile transactional activity has increased, companies were described as \u201crisk-averse\u201d and the use of contingent value rights is widespread, one of the most recent examples being the acquisition by Zeneca (a subsidiary of AstraZeneca) of Omthera Pharmaceuticals at a value of $323 million equity value, $260 million enterprise value. The contingent value right included increased payments per share if certain regulatory approvals were received by stated deadlines.\n\nCommercial activity is also on the rise as Big Pharma continues to collaborate with smaller innovative companies at an earlier stage.\n\nPRODUCT LIABILITY DEFENCE\n\nOur product liability section features 194 specialists from 26 jurisdictions. For those countries with a strong plaintiffs bar, this area of work is thriving and class actions are said to be on the rise. The medical devices field is also providing lawyers with highly complex, time-consuming and resource-demanding cases. In those jurisdictions that see fewer cases, the sector does not support a full-time practice and the lawyers taking on the work tend to have a wider commercial litigation focus. That said, lawyers noted that offering product recall and safety expertise is one way in which firms can distinguish themselves from the competition and offer a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d to clients.\n\nOne of the largest (and still ongoing) cases in recent years is the Poly Implant Proth\u00e8se (PIP) scandal. The French company produced breast implants for 15 years to approximately 400,000 women worldwide. Medical issues arose when the implants began to rupture and cause inflammation and irritation; by the end of 2011 there were eight cases of breast tumours uncovered in women following removal of the implants. In the latest in a series of legal cases, a landmark ruling in the commercial court in Toulon in November 2013 ruled that T\u00dcV Rheinland, a German safety company that had certified the sub-standard silicone implants, shared responsibility with PIP. As PIP is now bankrupt, this ruling could make T\u00dcV Rheinland liable to pay compensation to up to 400,000 women around the world.\n\nThe case has fuelled debate that there is a lack of regulatory control in the medical device sector. Given the broad range of products the sector covers, it is expected to be some time before a system is developed that covers the field adequately and accommodates its increasing complexities. Proposals for increased regulation are under way in Europe and they include conformity assessments for manufacturers which would require testing, inspection and certification to determine a product fulfils the relevant requirements of the applicable technical harmonisation legislation before a batch is released on to the market.\n\nLEGAL MARKETPLACE\n\nThe legal market is closely monitoring changes in the life sciences industry to ensure it remains ideally placed to service its demands. One way in which the legal profession has altered its approach is by offering a more linked-up service combining regulatory expertise alongside IP and transactional services. This is a direct response to increased regulatory oversight and scrutiny and the need for clients to consider regulatory advice when deciding strategy. With lawyers requiring a solid understanding of the regulatory landscape, the practice is becoming increasingly specialist and clients are actively seeking firms with a diverse offering. Of all the sections, the greatest overlap is between those recognised as regulatory and transactional experts demonstrating that the two areas of expertise are becoming inextricable. There is also a high degree of overlap between the product liability defence and patent litigation sections with the regulatory chapter a further sign that regulatory considerations are becoming inseparable from other fields of work in the life sciences sector.\n\nThose firms offering a full-service life sciences team are in a strong position due to their ability to work alongside colleagues in other disciplines; they reported that they have seen increasing amounts of work from clients based on this alone. IP boutiques and niche firms, on the other hand, have had to actively expand their offering to maintain their market edge, which some have accomplished \u201cto great effect\u201d with lateral hires. While many firms spoke of \u201cbulking up\u201d their regulatory teams, there has been a relatively low level of lateral movement so far \u2013 and with a small pool of lawyers to choose from, it is likely that firms will have to focus on bringing lawyers through the ranks to fill the required positions. Consolidation in the industry is also likely to lead to a similar phenomenon in the legal marketplace, as there will be fewer clients for law firms to service \u2013 as a result, things could look very different in the years to come.\n\nGlobal expansion among pharmaceutical companies is also likely to alter the legal marketplace as firms look to service clients \u201con the ground\u201d. As figure 2 shows, there is already a considerable number of life sciences experts based in emerging markets such as China and Singapore, alongside lawyers in the mature markets. With pharmaceutical companies focusing on these emerging markets for their growth in the coming years, we can expect this number to increase.\n\nBack to top", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legal News and Research from Who's Who Legal", "copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Law Business Research Ltd.
