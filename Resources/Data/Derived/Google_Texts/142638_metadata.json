The Conference Board and Gallup both reported the highest levels of confidence among consumers since the financial crisis ushered in the Great Recession.\n\nGallup\u2019s Economic Confidence Index spiked to its highest level ever last week, for five weeks in a row in positive territory. Gallup began tracking the economic confidence of Americans on a daily basis in 2008, and until recently, the poll had never been in positive territory. During the financial crisis and the beginning of the recession, the index plumbed lows of negative 65.\n\nRelated: The Dark Shadow Hanging Over the Economic Recovery\n\nTuesday\u2019s release highlights a sharp upward trend in attitudes toward the economy. In the third quarter of 2014, for example, the index was near negative 20.\n\n\u201cAmericans continue to feel better about the economy \u2013 as good as they have at any time since the recession began,\u201d wrote Gallup\u2019s Rebecca Riffkin. \u201cAfter a brief dip the prior week, confidence recovered this past week, perhaps helped by President Barack Obama's State of the Union address in which he was able to make clear to a national audience that the economy is getting better.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThe president's positive spin on the economy is certainly defensible as most economic measures have been trending in a positive direction over the past year, including official government reports of economic growth and unemployment, but also measures that Gallup tracks, including on employment, company hiring and consumer spending.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nFacing economic growth and a president whose popularity is rebounding, GOP lawmakers who had hoped momentum from the November midterms would drive major conservative changes in Washington may now find they need to trim their sails \u2013 or be seen as interfering with the recovery.\n\nThe Conference Board on Tuesday said its Confidence Index had jumped from 93.1 in December 2014 to 102.9 this month. Consumers\u2019 judgment of the economic climate and expectations for the future also improved.\n\nRelated: Economic Freedom in U.S. on the Rise, Study Says\n\n\u201cConsumer confidence rose sharply in January, and is now at its highest level since August 2007,\u201d said Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board. \u201cA more positive assessment of current business and labor market conditions contributed to the improvement in consumers\u2019 view of the present situation.\u201d\n\nThe dual announcements came just a day after another Gallup poll showed that President Obama\u2019s approval rating had again risen to the 50 percent level, the highest since 2013, after bottoming out at 38 percent in September.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S. public is increasingly confident about the economy, according to both the Conference Board and the Gallup Economic Confidence Index, which both spiked last week.", "title": "More Americans Say Thumbs Up on the Economy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/27/More-Americans-Say-Thumbs-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08052014_America_USA_Thumbs_Up.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/27/More-Americans-Say-Thumbs-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08052014_America_USA_Thumbs_Up.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The U.S. public is increasingly confident about the economy, according to both the Conference Board and the Gallup Economic Confidence Index, which both spiked last week.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Conference Board on Tuesday said its Confidence Index had jumped from 93.1 in December 2014 to 102.9 this month.\nGallup\u2019s Economic Confidence Index spiked to its highest level ever last week, for five weeks in a row in positive territory.\nGallup began tracking the economic confidence of Americans on a daily basis in 2008, and until recently, the poll had never been in positive territory.\n\u201cAmericans continue to feel better about the economy \u2013 as good as they have at any time since the recession began,\u201d wrote Gallup\u2019s Rebecca Riffkin.\nRelated: The Dark Shadow Hanging Over the Economic RecoveryTuesday\u2019s release highlights a sharp upward trend in attitudes toward the economy."}
