But at work, she has to use her \u201cboy name\u201d \u2014 the one on her birth certificate. There\u2019s a co-worker that has joked about using \u201cfags and trannies\u201d as target practice. The day she goes to work as Alice would probably be the day she quits, or gets fired.\n\nAt 60, Alice has been forced to make the choice between living an authentic life and living her retirement in poverty. Her firewall is more than a matter of principle \u2014 it\u2019s a matter of survival. In Missouri, where she lives, Alice could still be fired for being transgender. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a firewall between home and work, and why she asked to be referred to only as Alice. Her firewall is her double life.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, most of us who are older are looking at life after work,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we realize that it could well be lived in poverty. We can be true to ourselves, but at what price?\u201d\n\nIn the end, living an authentic life is a financial risk for transgender individuals. A 2013 study found that transgender workers report unemployment rates two times higher than the population as a whole, and are generally underemployed, more likely to have lower income and more likely to be in an unstable housing situation.\n\nBut there\u2019s always retirement, right? Not always.\n\nAs more and more transgender individuals get older, the unique challenges they face are becoming apparent. Shortfalls in health care could mean the difference between life and death for some. Discrimination in retirement communities or assisted-living facilities could tarnish the golden years, and a later-in-life transition could leave some ostracized from the families they\u2019ve loved their whole lives.\n\nFor a transgender baby boomer such as Alice, retirement could offer a relief from the workplace discrimination and the double life many have begrudgingly become used to in order to put food on the table. Alice will finally be able to be Alice all the time. It\u2019s the beginning of a new chapter, but a happy ending is still uncertain.\n\n\u201cWhat it comes down to in terms of older trans people, our biggest problem is finding health care,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the crosses we have to bear.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s had a host of health issues over the past year, but knows of only two physicians in her area who see patients for trans-specific health concerns and offer an open and accepting practice. In the past, she and other people she knows have been turned away from clinics or met with hostility from doctors who refused service based on religious views or other grounds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While it could mean the end of pretending, the golden years can also come with health care issues, intense isolation", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/20/for-aging-transgenderpopulationretirementcanbebittersweetrefuge.html", "image": {"width": 990, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/2/20/for-aging-transgenderpopulationretirementcanbebittersweetrefuge/jcr:content/mainpar/textimage/image.adapt.990.high.June_LaTrobe_2.1392904943816.jpg", "height": 618}, "type": "article", "description": "While it could mean the end of pretending, the golden years can also come with health care issues, intense isolation", "title": "For aging transgender population, retirement can be bittersweet refuge"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/2/20/for-aging-transgenderpopulationretirementcanbebittersweetrefuge/jcr:content/mainpar/textimage/image.adapt.990.high.June_LaTrobe_2.1392904943816.jpg", "description": "While it could mean the end of pretending, the golden years can also come with health care issues, intense isolation", "card": "summary", "title": "For aging transgender population, retirement can be bittersweet refuge"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Transgender, Gay Rights, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9cc8\"", "article_summary": "At 60, Alice has been forced to make the choice between living an authentic life and living her retirement in poverty.\nThe day she goes to work as Alice would probably be the day she quits, or gets fired.\nWe can be true to ourselves, but at what price?\u201dIn the end, living an authentic life is a financial risk for transgender individuals.\nAs more and more transgender individuals get older, the unique challenges they face are becoming apparent.\nFor a transgender baby boomer such as Alice, retirement could offer a relief from the workplace discrimination and the double life many have begrudgingly become used to in order to put food on the table."}
