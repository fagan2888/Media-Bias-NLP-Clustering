John McCain John McCainMcCain files B amendment to boost defense spending Senators push to authorize 4,000 more visas for Afghans Senate panel passes 4.5B defense bill MORE (R-Ariz.), who chairs the committee, told reporters Tuesday, calling the status quo \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nWhile tech companies and privacy experts say that strong encryption is necessary to protect consumer privacy \u2014 especially after the revelations about National Security Agency surveillance from Edward Snowden \u2014 law enforcement officials and some lawmakers say the secrecy is a risk to national security.\n\n\u201cThe French clearly in this instance had no understanding that this was going to happen,\u201d New York City police commissioner William Bratton said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday, blaming encryption. \u201cAnd we're seeing the ramifications of that.\u201d\n\nFor months, privacy advocates had been steadily gaining ground in their fight for universal, unbreakable encryption. They repeatedly argued that any permanent entry point built into encryption exposes all locked data to hackers, weakening global online privacy.\n\nAfter a year of this pressure from technologists, major Silicon Valley players and digital rights groups, the Obama administration in October publicly declared it would no longer seek a legislative solution that would require companies to decrypt data for law enforcement.\n\nEven supporters of guaranteed access \u2014 both on Capitol Hill and in the administration \u2014 acknowledged earlier this year that the encryption debate had become too charged for legislation to pass.\n\n\u201cThe legislative environment is very hostile today,\u201d the intelligence community\u2019s top lawyer, Robert S. Litt, said to colleagues in an August e-mail published by The Washington Post.\n\nBut, Litt noted, \u201cIt could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris may be that moment.\n\n\"It's causing a lot more attention in Congress,\u201d McCain said.\n\nMomentum in the debate appears to have swung back toward law enforcement, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle raising the alarm about encrypted technology on Tuesday.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin Dick DurbinFunding boost for TSA sails through committee Senate panel passes 4.5B defense bill Reid: 'Lay off' Sanders criticism MORE (D-Ill.), the second ranking Democrat, told reporters, \u201cI\u2019m open\u201d to law enforcement\u2019s argument \u201cthat the new encryption standards make it more difficult for them to do their work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know what we can do to give them access,\u201d added Durbin, who has sided with privacy advocates before on certain cybersecurity-related topics.\n\nMcCain was more direct when asked if he would require tech companies to build a portal into their encryption for government officials.\n\n\u201cYeah, I would,\u201d he said.\n\nBut exactly how McCain and his allies might accomplish this is unclear.\n\nDespite the unexpected light the Paris attacks have shed on the encryption debate, many congressional leaders were unwilling to commit to any specific course of action.\n\nBurr and Sen. Dianne Feinstein Dianne FeinsteinClinton\u2019s email troubles deepen Top Dem: CIA officials thought spying on Senate \u2018was flat out wrong\u2019 Senate panel advances spy policy bill, after House approves its own version MORE (D-Calif.), the Intelligence Committee\u2019s ranking member, told reporters they were launching an investigation into the issue.\n\n\u201cThe chairman and I will consult other members of our committee will consult and hopefully we will be able to come forward with some proposals that make some good sense,\u201d said Feinstein, adding when pressed on what those proposals might look like, \u201cI don\u2019t think it makes sense to speculate.\u201d\n\nSenate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson Ron JohnsonThe Trail 2016: Interleague play Sanders fundraises for Feingold in Wisconsin Senate race Pressure builds from GOP to delay internet domain transition MORE (R-Wis.) struck a similar tone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there's a legislative solution because if we do this with U.S.-based companies, there are going to be other companies around the world that do it,\u201d he told The Hill. \u201cTechnology is just going to continue to move forward and it\u2019s going to be a vexing problem.\n\nThe complexity of writing a congressional proposal has intensified the pressure on Silicon Valley to voluntarily work with the government on the issue.\n\n\u201cLet me just tell you something, there are things that are more important than the profitability of a private company,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cI think security of the United States is.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, privacy advocates and their Capitol Hill allies have stood firm.\n\nEncryption is simply a matter of life on the modern Internet, they maintain, and no government action is going to change that.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to use the Internet in 2015 and not use encryption,\u201d tweeted Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). \u201cTerrorists are using encryption = terrorists are using the Internet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also far from clear the type of guaranteed access law enforcement is calling for would have allowed officials to actually intercept messages in the lead-up to the Paris attacks.\n\n\"It's important to be careful about some of these knee-jerk approaches that don't give you more security and put at risk your liberty,\u201d Sen.
