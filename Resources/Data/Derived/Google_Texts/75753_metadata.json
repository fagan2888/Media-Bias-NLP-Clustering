And retailers, from Amazon to Sears, have announced that they will no longer sell Confederate-themed merchandise.\n\nThe shift has been remarkable: In Alabama, Republican Gov. Robert Bentley on Wednesday ordered four Confederate flags to come down from a Civil War memorial near the statehouse. Tennessee Democrats said earlier this week that a bust of a Confederate lieutenant general and an important figure in the founding of the Ku Klux Klan has no place inside their Capitol. Mississippi\u2019s junior Republican senator, Roger Wicker, said the state\u2019s current flag depicting the rebel-flag emblem belongs in a museum, urging the creation of a flag that represents all Mississippians. In Virginia, Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe announced this week that the state will recall all license plates with the Confederate flag at no charge to holders within the next 90 days, giving drivers with the Sons of the Confederacy plates another 30 days to get a new one without the emblem.\n\nA few lonely voices on the right, though, are saying: Enough is enough.\n\nNeoconservative pundit Bill Kristol, for instance, supported the battle flag\u2019s removal but has slammed liberals for what he called their efforts to \u201cexpung[e] every trace of respect, recognition or acknowledgment of Americans who fought for the Confederacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext, [the] Left will ban teaching of Lincoln\u2019s Second Inaugural in schools. None of that \u2018with malice toward none, with charity for all\u2019 stuff\u2026,\u201d Kristol tweeted Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA cause can be unjust but some of its defenders honorable. Its defeat can be a very good thing but reconciliation can be worthwhile as well,\u201d he then tweeted Wednesday, hours after an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d in which he cautioned against the \u201cOrwellian rewriting of history.\u201d\n\nRush Limbaugh has gone further, calling the fight to have the battle flag removed an \u201cattempt to segregate and isolate the entire South and to sort of Alinsky it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, the Rules for Radicals,\u201d Limbaugh said on his Tuesday show, referring to the late left-wing activist Saul Alinsky. \u201cYou seek the target, you isolate it, you attack it, humiliate it.\u201d\n\nAnd even after the flag does come down, that will not be enough, Limbaugh added: The American flag is next.\n\n\u201cThe American flag is what? It\u2019s the symbol of America. The left what? Doesn\u2019t like this country very much and never has and it\u2019s getting angrier and angrier about it seemingly every day. The American flag stands for the United States of America and, as such, everything that\u2019s wrong with it,\u201d he told listeners.\n\n\u201cThe American flag has flown over a slave nation much longer than the Confederate flag did, folks. The American flag has flown over all kinds of atrocities,\u201d he noted.\n\nConservative provocateur Ann Coulter, appearing on Fox Business Network, denied that the flag had any connection to the Charleston shooting or any racist connection at all, and attacked South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for her call for its removal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appalled by \u2014 though I\u2019d really like to like Nikki Haley since she is a Republican,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cOn the other hand, she is an immigrant and does not understand America\u2019s history.\u201d (Haley was born in the United States.)\n\nOthers argued the flag issue was diverting attention from more pressing matters.\n\nGlenn Beck, who agreed that the flag should come down in South Carolina, said on his radio program, \u201cIf this is the biggest thing we\u2019ve got going on in our country, we\u2019ve got a sweet, sweet life.\u201d\n\nBeck ticked through national problems, ranging from Obamacare to the threat of global terrorism, before asking, \u201cAnd we\u2019re talking about the Confederate flag? Are you kidding me?\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina state Sen. Lee Bright, Republican presidential contender Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign co-chair in the state, earlier this week likened removing the flag from the state Capitol to a \u201cStalinist purge.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the flag,\u201d Bright told POLITICO on Tuesday. \u201cThey want to take down the Confederate monuments, I\u2019ve gotten emails from people who want to rename streets \u2026 anytime you want to basically remove the symbols of history from a state, that\u2019s something that just is very bad \u2026 These are honorable men who fought for their homes, their home state, to disgrace them in the name of political correctness is just wrong. They\u2019re not here to defend themselves.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly, speaking to center-left pundit Juan Williams on Monday, laid out his view of why some conservatives are so upset about the debate over the flag.\n\n\u201cIt represents bravery [in war]\u201d to them, O\u2019Reilly said.\n\n\u201cYou know as well as I do that it represents, to some, bravery in the Civil War because the Confederates fought hard,\u201d O\u2019Reilly told Williams. \u201cYou\u2019re right historically, but in their minds, that\u2019s what it represents. And in your mind it represents hate. So, and everybody should know what the two sides are believing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A few lonely voices on the right are saying: Enough is enough.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "A few lonely voices on the right are saying: Enough is enough.", "title": "Some conservatives balk at Confederate flag debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/some-conservatives-balk-at-confederate-flag-debate-119383.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/23/150623_confederate_flag_1160_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Republicans,Ann Coulter,Nikki Haley,Race,Confederate Flag,GOP", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NickGassReports"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Some conservatives balk at Confederate flag debateThe Republican establishment has lined up swiftly behind calls to remove the Confederate battle flag from public spaces in the wake of last week\u2019s racially charged massacre in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\u201cThe American flag has flown over a slave nation much longer than the Confederate flag did, folks.\nThe American flag stands for the United States of America and, as such, everything that\u2019s wrong with it,\u201d he told listeners.\n\u201cYou seek the target, you isolate it, you attack it, humiliate it.\u201dAnd even after the flag does come down, that will not be enough, Limbaugh added: The American flag is next.\nThe American flag has flown over all kinds of atrocities,\u201d he noted."}
