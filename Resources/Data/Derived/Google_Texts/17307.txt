Cherokee Health Systems has received a $419,345 grant from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration to increase access to preventive and primary care in East Tennessee.

“We plan to add an entire primary-care team to our Center City office in Knoxville (2018 Western Avenue),” said Bob Franko, Cherokee Health’s vice president for marketing.

“This will include a total of six full-time-equivalent staff including a primary care physician, a behavioral health consultant, nursing staff and community health coordinators.”

That mixture of staff is part of the organization’s service delivery model, which allows teams to treat the “whole person,” both physically and mentally, he said, which can save 26 percent to 28 percent of costs compared with traditional approaches.

The new team will let Cherokee see an additional 1,500-1,800 patients annually. The Knoxville site normally serves about 15,000 patients per year.

Currently, Cherokee Health Systems has a staff of more than 600 employees who serve 66,300 patients annually across 13 East Tennessee counties.

Tennessee got a total of $7.45 million through the same program to serve an estimated 16,848 new patients statewide. Besides Cherokee, Choto Community Health Services in Vonore received $266,914; Dayspring Family Health Center in Jellico, $259,600; East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, $263,895; the Department of Health in Cookeville, $347,436; the Morgan County Health Council in Wartburg, $251,638; Mountain People’s Health Councils in Huntsville, $266,242; and Rural Medical Services in Newport, $264,512; along with several organizations in Middle and West Tennessee.

The grants are part of the Health Center Expanded Services initiative using funds from the Affordable Care Act to expand services by HRSA. The awards include approximately $350 million for 1,184 health centers to increase access to services such as medical, oral, behavioral, pharmacy and vision care.

Nearly $150 million will be awarded to 160 health centers for facility renovation, expansion, or construction to increase patient or service capacity. The awards are projected to increase access to care for 1.4 million people nationwide.
