On Sunday\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) said that passing any kind of immigration measures would be unlikely because of distrust in President Obama\u2019s ability to enforce border security measures before immigrants are granted \u201camnesty.\u201d\n\nWhen questioned by Stephanopoulos on whether the President would have an immigration bill to sign at the end of the year, Ryan said, \u201cI really don\u2019t know the answer to that question. That is clearly in doubt. It depends on whether they\u2019re willing to actually secure the border, actually have interior enforcement and not \u2014 and agree to not having an amnesty. If we can do that, where it\u2019s security first, no amnesty, then we might be able to get somewhere.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u2018\u2018This isn\u2019t a trust-but-verify, this is a verify-then-trust approach.\u201d\n\nRyan has little reason to doubt Obama\u2019s commitment based on his record. Statistics suggest Obama has been pretty willing thus far \u2014 nearly two million immigrants have been deported, \u201cillegal entries are at a 40-year low,\u201d there are more \u201cboots on the ground\u201d at the border than there have ever been in history, and the Senate bill would simultaneously secure the border and implement a biometric exit system that would track visa overstayers.\n\nAlthough Republicans have divergent views on how best to deal with the undocumented population, at least two other key players in the immigration debate, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) have voiced similar sentiments to Ryan\u2019s statement. During a conference call on Friday, Rep. Mario Diaz Balart (R-FL) said that there were concerns over whether \u201cborder and security provisions would be a reality.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Republicans have cited distrust in the President in order to stall on reform. In fact, it\u2019s the latest in a line of excuses Republicans have claimed are responsible for their failure to pass immigration reform. In 2010, it was because Obamacare passed and that there\u2019s an ongoing Mexican drug war. In 2012, it was because Obama used his executive order to give temporary work authorization and legal presence to non-criminal, undocumented youths. And in 2013, it was because of sequestration forced the Department of Homeland Security to release non-violent detainees, the Boston Marathon bomber was an immigrant, the Obamacare employer mandate was delayed, the Syrian intervention was taking too long, Obama refused to negotiate with Republicans during the shutdown, and healthcare.gov had technical difficulties.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A core House Republican leader who praised the release of a document outlining immigration policies, is already making excuses to prevent immigration legislation from passing by the end of the year.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A core House Republican leader who praised the release of a document outlining immigration policies, is already making excuses to prevent immigration legislation from passing by the end of the year.", "title": "House Republicans Predict They Won\u2019t Pass Their Own Law, Citing Distrust In Obama", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2014/02/03/3238651/house-republicans-legislation-distrust-president/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ap_paul_ryan_jef_120904_wg-1-e1387553853601.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A core House Republican leader who praised the release of a document outlining immigration policies, is already making excuses to prevent immigration legislation from passing by the end of the year.", "creator": "@EstherYuHsiLee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ap_paul_ryan_jef_120904_wg-1-319x213.jpg", "title": "House Republicans Predict They Won\u2019t Pass Their Own Law, Citing Distrust In Obama", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-immigration", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ap_paul_ryan_jef_120904_wg-1-e1387553853601.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ap_paul_ryan_jef_120904_wg-1-e1387553853601.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-03T16:45:08+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/estheryuhsilee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd41e5\"", "article_summary": "Immigration House Republicans Predict They Won\u2019t Pass Their Own Law, Citing Distrust In Obama CREDIT: APA core House Republican leader who praised the release of a document outlining immigration policies, is already making excuses to prevent reform legislation from passing by the end of the year.\nIn fact, it\u2019s the latest in a line of excuses Republicans have claimed are responsible for their failure to pass immigration reform.\nIn 2012, it was because Obama used his executive order to give temporary work authorization and legal presence to non-criminal, undocumented youths.\nIt depends on whether they\u2019re willing to actually secure the border, actually have interior enforcement and not \u2014 and agree to not having an amnesty.\nIn 2010, it was because Obamacare passed and that there\u2019s an ongoing Mexican drug war."}
