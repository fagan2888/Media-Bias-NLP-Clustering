Rice will visit China this weekend in preparation for Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit to the White House next month.\n\nAn NSC spokesman said Ms. Rice will visit Beijing on Friday and Saturday to meet with senior Chinese officials and \u201cunderscore the United States\u2019 commitment to building a more productive relationship between our two countries.\u201d She will also discuss \u201careas of difference\u201d ahead of Mr. Xi\u2019s visit to the White House late next month.\n\nAs the plummeting Chinese financial system has roiled global markets, Republican Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin called on President Obama Monday to cancel Mr. Xi\u2019s state visit. Mr. Walker, a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination, said the Chinese leader doesn\u2019t deserve the honor of a state visit.\n\n\u201cWhy would we be giving one of our highest things a president can do \u2014 and that is a state dinner for Xi Jinping, the head of China \u2014 at a time when all of these problems are pending out there?\u201d Mr. Walker told reporters in Spartanburg, South Carolina. \u201cWe should say those \u2026 honors should only be bestowed upon leaders and countries that are allies and supporters of the United States, not just for China, which is a strategic competitor. Part of our problem right now is that they don\u2019t respect us.\u201d\n\nChina is suspected to be behind a massive data hack of federal government employee data that was uncovered earlier this year. Administration officials say Mr. Obama intends to raise the issue of hacking with Mr. Xi.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid Republican criticism about provocations from Beijing, White House National Security Adviser Susan E.
