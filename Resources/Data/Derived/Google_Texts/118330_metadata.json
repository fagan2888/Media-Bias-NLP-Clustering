As Lt. Kevin Riley, a navigator aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise, he was memorable in both \u2014 \u201cThe Naked Time,\u201d especially, the episode in which he sang \u201cI\u2019ll Take You Home Again, Kathleen\u201d while declaring himself captain and cutting off the engines while under the influence of \u2026 well, sure, maybe you should just watch the whole thing.\n\nRegardless, he\u2019s beloved by Trek fans, who now mourn his death earlier this week from throat cancer at the age of 74. His death was first reported Friday by the St. Cloud Times in Minnesota, where he was professor emeritus of communication studies at St. Cloud State University. He taught there for the past 25 years.\n\nAccording to the family\u2019s official obituary, Hyde was born in Dallas on September 14, 1941. His mother Edna taught in Mesquite. His father Rufus was the head football coach at North Dallas High School, from which Bruce graduated in 1959 after attending Robert E. Lee Elementary in Lower Greenville.\n\nAfter high school, Hyde enrolled at Northwestern University, from which he got his Bachelor of Arts in 1963. Then, for a while, he became an actor. He got some small roles on stage and TV. Then came Trek and the small part he made big. And he didn\u2019t talk about it much. Just last year, in fact, he said he didn\u2019t think anyone would care. Besides, he was busy being a professor, a writer.\n\n\u201cThen somebody once told me, \u2018You know, you should be willing to talk about this with people. It\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s something you did that most people didn\u2019t do,\u2019\u201d Hyde said. \u201cAnd so I decided to lighten up about it.\u201d\n\nSo he made the rounds \u2014 doing the conventions, talking about working with Shatner, deciphering the reasons behind the show\u2019s lasting influence. He found the experience \u2026 odd, to say the least, especially when fans knew every detail about every scene into which he\u2019d put just a few weeks\u2019 work. But Riley remained a popular character \u2014 beloved enough to resurface as a major character in the 1991 novel A Flag Full of Stars, set shortly after the end of the Enterprise\u2018s five-year mission.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do very many [conventions] now, but I still enjoy them, still feel so privileged to have them in my life,\u201d he told StarTrek.com last year. \u201cAnd it\u2019s remarkable how different being a convention guest is from being a communications professor.\u201d\n\nTurns out, he wasn\u2019t much interested in acting. After Trek, he got a part in Hair in San Francisco \u2026 then decided to drop out.\n\n\u201cI played a hippie \u2014 and I decided I wanted to be a hippie instead of playing one,\u201d he told the Trek fanzine. \u201cI was going to get a Volkswagen bus and a big bag of brown rice and go find God. And that\u2019s what I did.\u201d He also spent time in Nashville, where he wrote music.\n\nHe then came home for a little while in the early 1980s, earning his master\u2019s degree in Communication Studies from North Texas State University in 1984. He never acted again.\n\n\u201cMr. Hyde was coauthor of a book that will be published posthumously,\u201d says his obituary. \u201cSpeaking Being emerged from Mr. Hyde\u2019s decades long commitment to the method of inquiry developed by Werner Erhard, first in EST and later in the Landmark Forum, and from his Ph.D. dissertation and several scholarly papers that examined Erhard\u2019s \u2018ontological\u2019 communication, which was marked by an effort to move beyond conceptual knowledge to an authentic inquiry into human being. Mr. Hyde incorporated his ideas about dialogue and ontological communication into his classes. He was an award winning teacher and a respected colleague.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzEwL2JydWNlLWh5ZGUtZGFsbGFzLW5hdGl2ZS1wcm9mZXNzb3ItYW5kLWJlbG92ZWQtc3Rhci10cmVrLWFjdG9yLWhhcy1kaWVkLWF0LTc0Lmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Bruce Hyde is a footnote in sci-fi pop-culture history, a man who appeared in two of the original Star Trek episodes: \"The Naked Time,\" which originally aired on Sept. 29,\u2026", "title": "Bruce Hyde \u2014 Dallas native, professor and beloved \u2018Star Trek\u2019 actor \u2014 has died at 74", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/10/bruce-hyde-dallas-native-professor-and-beloved-star-trek-actor-has-died-at-74.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2015/10/brucehydeinset3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-10-17T18:50:33Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "article_summary": "Cloud Times in Minnesota, where he was professor emeritus of communication studies at St.\nRegardless, he\u2019s beloved by Trek fans, who now mourn his death earlier this week from throat cancer at the age of 74.\nAnd he didn\u2019t talk about it much.\nHe then came home for a little while in the early 1980s, earning his master\u2019s degree in Communication Studies from North Texas State University in 1984.\n\u201cI played a hippie \u2014 and I decided I wanted to be a hippie instead of playing one,\u201d he told the Trek fanzine."}
