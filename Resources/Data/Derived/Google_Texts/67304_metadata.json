It has been below zero 42 times since 1946.\n\nHe said \"there are no jobs\" to be had. In fact, there were 5.4 million job openings recorded at the end of April, the most in 15 years.\n\nHe said the \"real\" unemployment rate is \"anywhere from 18 to 20%\" and \"maybe even 21%.\" We see no factual basis for this opinion.\n\nHe boasted he would have blocked new Ford plants in Mexico by threatening to impose a 35% tax on vehicles and parts made in Mexico and shipped to the U.S. But only Congress can impose taxes and such a tax would violate the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nTrump claimed the five Taliban leaders exchanged for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl \"are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.\" But all five remain in Qatar, where they continue to be monitored and are subject to a travel ban, according to the State Department.\n\nHe also made the misleading claim that health care premium costs are going \"up 29, 39, 49 and even 55%.\" He's talking about some proposed rate increases on the individual market that still need regulatory approval. There are also proposed rate decreases or single-digit increases that did not have to be submitted for review.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump's speech may have crossed several lines, according to one national publication.", "title": "USA TODAY Fact Checks Trump", "og": {"site_name": "KGAN", "description": "Donald Trump's speech may have crossed several lines, according to one national publication.", "title": "USA TODAY Fact Checks Trump", "url": "http://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/usa-today-fact-checks-trump", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/14672ef8-8022-4376-bd9b-b042e629e747-vGwa2Pw8.png?1440801814671", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@cbs2iowa", "image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/14672ef8-8022-4376-bd9b-b042e629e747-vGwa2Pw8.png?1440801814671", "description": "Donald Trump's speech may have crossed several lines, according to one national publication.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "USA TODAY Fact Checks Trump"}, "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "local,IA", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/kgancbs2", "published_time": "2015-06-17T12:22:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "article_summary": "There are also proposed rate decreases or single-digit increases that did not have to be submitted for review.\nHe's talking about some proposed rate increases on the individual market that still need regulatory approval.\nOn Wednesday USA TODAY published a piece fact checking Trump's claims.\nFrom USA TODAY:Trump claimed that economic growth has \"never\" been below zero until last quarter's drop, which is far from true.\nThe article says he made \"false and misleading statements on the economy, trade, health care and terrorism.\""}
