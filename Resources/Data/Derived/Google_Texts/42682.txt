Parkland Health and Hospital System will offer help Thursday and Friday to anyone still needing to enroll for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Sunday is the enrollment deadline.

Parkland said in a news release that it will have counselors available to answer questions about the ACA from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the hospital’s business office at 5201 Harry Hines Blvd.

Unless otherwise exempted, people not covered by an employer-sponsored health plan, Medicaid, Medicare or other public insurance program could be penalized if they don’t sign up for health insurance by Sunday.

On Friday, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell will visit an enrollment event at the Community Council of Greater Dallas, 1341 W. Mockingbird Lane. She will be joined by Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins and Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas.
