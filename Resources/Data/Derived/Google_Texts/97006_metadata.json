Obamacare fight breaks 'doc fix'\n\nA once-bipartisan proposal to finally reform the deeply flawed way that Medicare pays doctors succumbed Friday to the partisan politics of Obamacare, particularly the unpopular individual mandate.\n\nThe House voted 238-181 to replace the payment formula \u2014 the complicated equation that for more than a decade has required annual \u201cdoc fixes\u201d \u2014 and to pay for it by delaying Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate for five years.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA dozen House Democrats joined Republicans in the vote, but the bill is dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate .\n\nThe Senate plans to return a volley after next week\u2019s recess with a plan that appears just as unlikely to move in the House because it completely avoids the issue of how to pay for the reform proposal. However, newly minted Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden has said that he wants to see a bipartisan vote and could end up adding a pay-for \u2014 or the promise of one .\n\nThe underlying policy voted on Friday has been agreed to by the top Republicans and Democrats on the Finance Committee as well as the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees. And after years of bitter complaint about the Sustainable Growth Rate, lawmakers\u2019 bipartisan, bicameral consensus on a replacement has been widely applauded, especially by medical groups.\n\nThe bill would eliminate the SGR and replace it with a new formula that would drive physicians to meet quality metrics tied to their payments \u2014 a critical, fundamental shift. The goal is to pay providers for treating a person\u2019s disease or illness instead of focusing on the quantity of the tests or treatments they prescribed.\n\nBut when the six committee leaders failed to settle on a way to afford the $138 billion reform plan, the leadership of both chambers began pushing partisan pay-fors that stand little chance of becoming law.\n\nRepublicans argue that delaying the mandate until 2019 is nearly as long as the White House is allowing people with canceled plans to remain on their pre-Obamacare policies. Under the administration\u2019s latest announcement, people can retain their old insurance through 2017.\n\nRep. Charles Boustany (R-La.), a physician, blamed the Senate for refusing to negotiate on payment methods.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve agreed on the policy, but we have a problem coming up with the pay-fors,\u201d he said on the House floor Friday. \u201cBut the talks broke down in a divided government. Senate leadership has refused to negotiate in good faith. \u2026 We\u2019re going to pass this bill to get those discussions started.\u201d\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) accused Republicans of throwing the bipartisan talks away \u201cin order to score some really poor and cheap political points.\u201d\n\nThe bipartisan negotiators have not met since agreeing on the policy last month, before Max Baucus left his post as Finance chairman and was replaced by Wyden. It\u2019s unclear whether those talks will resume.\n\n\u201cThe breakthrough achieved by our committee would permanently replace the deeply flawed SGR formula,\u201d said Rep. Sander Levin (D-Mich.), the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cThe underlying policy agreement is broadly supported by both providers and beneficiaries, but today\u2019s exercise is opposed by groups representing seniors, doctors, health plans and others because it guts the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe existing Medicare formula calls for new cuts to providers as of April 1. The negotiators had hoped to be able to put the new formula in effect by then. But more likely than not, they\u2019ll have to institute a new patch \u2014 expected to be nine months or longer \u2014 to block the cuts from taking place.\n\nFriday\u2019s bill was the second vote against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate this month. In another measure unlikely to get any traction in the Senate, 27 Democrats joined Republicans to delay the mandate\u2019s penalties for 2014.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story listed Rep.
