But he just couldn\u2019t catch a break, as his press conference explanation was derailed by yet another stream of interruptions on this week\u2019s Saturday Night Live.\n\nFake POTUS \u2014 played by Jay Pharoah \u2014 held a presser to talk about the progress of HealthCare.gov. But first, he attempted to address the world leader selfie, his handshake with Ra\u00fal Castro and the fake sign language interpreter that had sparked so much controversy in the past few days.\n\n\u201cI felt like Lemony Snicket,\u201d Obama said of the service, \u201cbecause I experienced a series of unfortunate events.\u201d\n\nObama explained that he was roped into taking the selfie. He then clarified that he shook Castro\u2019s hand only because \u201che told me he was Edward James Olmos,\u201d the actor.\n\nThen, as the mock President transitioned to talking about the Obamacare website progress, he was hit with another series of unfortunate events.\n\nThe first time, he was interrupted by a smiley-faced sign language interpreter \u2014 played by Kenan Thompson \u2014 who signed gibberish as the President spoke. The obviously fake interpreter \u2018raised the roof\u2019 as the translation for \u201cconcerns are being raised,\u201d flung imaginary Spiderman webs for \u201chuge improvements in our website,\u201d and danced the Thriller dance for \u201cnot that thrilled with the results.\u201d\n\nThe President was then interrupted by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2014 played by Kate McKinnon. She wanted to get a selfie with him, and when the President refused, she played her trump card.\n\n\u201cI feel like you kind of owe me after ze whole wire tapping mine cell phone zing,\u201d she told him.\n\nAnd just when Merkel was dragged away by security \u2014 after snapping two selfies \u2014 the sign language interpreter reappeared.\n\nThe writers at SNL probably hope there\u2019s another large world event coming up soon for the President to go to \u2014 he\u2019s proving to be true comedy gold!\n\nWatch the cold open below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "President Barack Obama wanted to clear up the \"series of unfortunate events\" that occurred at the memorial service for South African leader Nelson Mandela.
