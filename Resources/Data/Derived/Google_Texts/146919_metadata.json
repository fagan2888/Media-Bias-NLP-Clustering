Sam Brownback.\n\nExpansion supporters had hoped that at least an expansion compromise could happen this year. But the governor\u2019s statement makes any expansion in the near future all but impossible, because the GOP controlled House has said they will only take up the issue at the governor's urging.\n\nStill, many in the state are pushing for some change to Medicaid, which was intended to be part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnder the ACA, people and families living between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level can get insurance subsidies. People below that level go on state Medicaid. That adds a lot of new people to Medicaid, so the federal government is offering to pay all of the added cost for states for three years, tapering down after that, but never to less than 90 percent of the additional costs.\n\nSupporters say it\u2019s a great deal, but opponents like Republican Rep. David Crum of Augusta support the Governor\u2019s decision to shut the door.\n\n\u201cWe have to consider what it will do to our budget in the long term. As legislators, we can\u2019t make decisions based on what\u2019s going to happen in the next three years,\u201d says Crum.\n\nMedicaid currently covers about 343,000 Kansans, and Crum estimates expansion would bring that number up to 450,000. That\u2019s about 20 percent of the state population. Crum says expansion would add more weight to an already massive state program.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already supporting a very important group of Kansans who need significant help,\u201d he says.\n\nKansas had been considered a \u201cmaybe\u201d on Medicaid expansion, but that changed with the Governor\u2019s statement Monday.\n\nRepublican Rep. Barbara Bollier from Mission Hills criticizes the Governor\u2019s decision. Unlike many in her party, she supports expansion and doesn\u2019t believe it inevitably means big future costs.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at a long-term costs of everything, I agree,\" she says. \"However, just expanding at this point doesn\u2019t mean we are locked into it.\u201d\n\nBollier points out that the state already receives lot of money from the federal government. And that by refusing federal money, Kansas is simply allowing it to go to other states.\n\n\u201cThat money belongs to the people of Kansas as much as it belongs to any other people of any state, and I hate to see us losing our money that we put into the federal government through our taxes,\u201d says Bollier.\n\nOne of the biggest stakeholders in an expansion is the Kansas Hospital Association. That\u2019s because the Affordable Care Act is funded in part by huge cuts to the money the federal government gives hospitals for treating people who can\u2019t pay.\n\nThe idea is that if Medicaid expands to include the uninsured, then this funding won\u2019t be needed because everyone will be covered. As it stands, Kansas hospitals face losing that federal funding while still having to serve many uninsured.\n\nTom Bell is President and CEO of the Kansas Hospital Association. He says they\u2019ll continue their expansion push, despite the Governor\u2019s recommendation.\n\n\u201cI think our strategy has been all along has been let\u2019s try to get the people that are involved \u2013 the policy makers and other stakeholders to sit down and have a conversation about whether we can come up with a plan that works uniquely for our state. And going to continue to try to do that,\u201d says Bell.\n\nBell says the Hospital Association would be satisfied with an expansion that breaks from the Affordable Care Act model, and Gov. Brownback has said he will remain open-minded.\n\nRep. Crum says legislators have considered alternate expansion models, like Iowa\u2019s premium assistance plan. But any change to Kansas Medicaid would need to be fundamentally different from what the Affordable Care Act prescribes.\n\n\u201cI think it would be difficult to come up with a tweak that would make a significant difference in the way Medicaid expansion would occur,\u201d says Crum.\n\nSome still hold out for the possibility of expansion this year. Rep. Jim Ward, a Wichita Democrat, has said he will attempt to introduce expansion as an amendment or proviso.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "The Kansas legislature is back in session this week but they probably won\u2019t be debating a Medicaid expansion, after a recommendation from Gov.
