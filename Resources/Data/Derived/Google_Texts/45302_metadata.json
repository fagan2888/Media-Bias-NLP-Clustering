And we trusted you to ensure that the education system in this country would do so. But Corinthian took advantage of our dreams and targeted us to make profit. You let it happen, and now you cash in,\u201d the students wrote in the letter published on the group\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cRepayment plans presented as a helping hand simply aren\u2019t good enough. The wrong done to us is deeper than that.\n\n\u201cWe are not alone in this fight. Corinthian\u2019s predatory empire pushed hundreds of thousands into a debt trap. But even beyond for-profit schools, tens of millions of students are in more debt than they can ever repay. And you are the debt collector, with powers beyond a payday lender\u2019s wildest dreams,\u201d the students wrote.\n\nAccording to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, students across the U.S. owe about $1.1 trillion in collective unpaid loan debt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of 15 students is refusing to pay back federal student loans taken out to attend schools owned by the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges Inc.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A group of 15 students is refusing to pay back federal student loans taken out to attend schools owned by the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges Inc.", "title": "\u2018Corinthian fifteen\u2019 refuse to pay \u2018forced\u2019 student loans", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/28/corinthian-fifteen-refuse-to-pay-forced-student-lo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/16/8435017e7cb3e2245f0f6a70670082ab.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/16/8435017e7cb3e2245f0f6a70670082ab.jpg", "description": "A group of 15 students is refusing to pay back federal student loans taken out to attend schools owned by the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges Inc.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Corinthian fifteen\u2019 refuse to pay \u2018forced\u2019 st"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Education, Corinthian Colleges Inc, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce98\"", "article_summary": "But the action did not forgive student loans owed by former Corinthian students, prompting the group of students, calling themselves the \u201cCorinthian fifteen\u201d to publish a letter to the Department of Education last week asking for loan forgiveness.\nAccording to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, students across the U.S. owe about $1.1 trillion in collective unpaid loan debt.\nBut even beyond for-profit schools, tens of millions of students are in more debt than they can ever repay.\nIn July, the Department of Education forced Corinthian to sell or close down its schools following a slew of conflicts with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and lawsuits from the states of Massachusetts and California.\nAnd you are the debt collector, with powers beyond a payday lender\u2019s wildest dreams,\u201d the students wrote."}
