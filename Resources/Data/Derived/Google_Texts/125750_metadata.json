Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a staunch conservative on defense and national security matters, offered a stinging critique of the GOP\u2019s environmental policies over the weekend.\n\nDuring an appearance Sunday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Graham blasted other Republican presidential candidates for sidestepping environmental issues or embracing dangerously narrow positions designed to protect business.\n\nRelated: Despite Reams of Evidence, Global Warming Ranks Low on Americans\u2019 Worry List\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a question you need to ask everybody running as a Republican,\u201d Graham told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. \u201cWhat is the environmental policy of the Republican Party? When I ask that question, I get a blank stare. We don\u2019t have an environmental policy. We have an energy policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m president of the United States, we are going to address climate change and carbon dioxide emissions in a business-friendly way,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find oil and gas that we own because we\u2019re going to use fossil fuels for a long time to come. But it\u2019s okay to get a lower carbon target. I do believe that climate change is real. I want a business solution to that problem.\u201d\n\nGraham told CNN that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d believes that climate change is partially man-made and ridiculed doubters who argue to the contrary. \u201cWhen 90 percent of the doctors tell you you got a problem, do you listen to the on [who disagrees]?\u201d he asked.\n\nFor now at least, Graham is the lone wolf among Republican presidential candidates in both acknowledging that the problem is manmade and signaling a willingness to consider effective counter-measures.\n\nRelated: Governments Promise to Fight Global Warming While Funding King Coal\n\nFor example, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) has voiced doubt as to whether \u201chuman activity\u201d is causing dramatic changes to the climate the way many scientists are portraying it. Rubio voted against an amendment introduced by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) earlier this year that expressed the sense of Congress that \u201cclimate change is real\u201d and \u201chuman activity significantly contributes\u201d to it.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has been a key figure in the Republicans\u2019 fight against President Obama\u2019s signature climate policy\u2014the proposed Environmental Protection Agency rules that are designed to reduce the carbon footprint of the nation's electricity sector 30 percent by 2030. Those rules will likely force states to retrofit or close down many of their coal-fired power plants. In a letter to the EPA last December, Walker complained that the plan would deliver a serious \u201cblow\u201d to Wisconsin\u2019s residents and business owners.\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush in the past has acknowledged that global warming \u201cmay be real\u201d although he was uncertain about how much industry has contributed to the problem. More recently, he has said that he is \u201cconcerned about\u201d climate change and encouraged cooperation among countries to \u201cnegotiate a way to reduce carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nRelated: Look Who\u2019s Worried About Global Warming Now\n\nGraham didn\u2019t offer any specific solutions to climate change, although he once flirted with backing a Democratic plan in the Senate to create a \u201ccap and trade\u201d program. That approach would gradually reduce industrial carbon emissions in part by allowing utilities and manufacturers that produce large quantities of carbon emission to purchase offsetting credits from other industries that have substantially reduced their emissions.\n\nAnother possibility would be to impose a carbon tax on industry to discourage the use of fossil fuels. A graduated carbon tax would boost the price of fossil fuels, with more taxes collected on fuels that generate more emissions, like coal. Many business leaders see the handwriting on the wall and realize that they eventually must come to terms with the fact that traditional reliance on fossil fuels for energy and production will gradually give way to a more balanced use of fossil fuels and alternative energy sources.\n\nJust last week, the senior executives of six large European oil and gas companies \u2013 the BG Group, BP, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil and Total \u2013 urged world leaders to call for a tax on carbon emissions, according to The New York Times. The company officials reportedly were seeking an efficient and predictable policy to limit greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Budget Boosts EPA to Fight Climate Change\n\nThis approach has been proposed in the past by scientists, economists, environmentalists and some political leaders. Meanwhile, public support for tough action has been growing. A New York Times-Stanford University poll released in January showed that an overwhelming majority of Americans, including half of Republicans, favor government action to curtail global warming.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In a sign that global warming and what to do about it will be on the agendas of both p", "title": "Graham Blasts His Own Party for Ignoring Global Warming Threats", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/08/Graham-Blasts-His-Own-Party-Ignoring-Global-Warming-Threats", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09152014_Lindsey_Graham.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/08/Graham-Blasts-His-Own-Party-Ignoring-Global-Warming-Threats", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09152014_Lindsey_Graham.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In a sign that global warming and what to do about it will be on the agendas of both p", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A New York Times-Stanford University poll released in January showed that an overwhelming majority of Americans, including half of Republicans, favor government action to curtail global warming.\nRelated: Despite Reams of Evidence, Global Warming Ranks Low on Americans\u2019 Worry List\u201cHere\u2019s a question you need to ask everybody running as a Republican,\u201d Graham told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash.\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush in the past has acknowledged that global warming \u201cmay be real\u201d although he was uncertain about how much industry has contributed to the problem.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to find oil and gas that we own because we\u2019re going to use fossil fuels for a long time to come.\nAnother possibility would be to impose a carbon tax on industry to discourage the use of fossil fuels."}
