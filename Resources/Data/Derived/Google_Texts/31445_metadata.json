The previous record holder is 2009\u2019s \u201cThe Twilight Saga: New Moon,\u201d which brought in $142 million. Analysts predict the \u201cHunger Games\u201d sequel will stick a landing at somewhere around $145 million. That is just short of the $152 million opening for the first \u201cHunger Games.\u201d\n\nMy colleague Christian Toto believes that in the age of Obama, the \u201cHunger Games\u201d film franchise, and popular novels upon which they are based, are reaching audiences in a way they might not have otherwise:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhen The Hunger Games hit theaters last year, Americans didn\u2019t know the extent of NSA domestic spying, that ObamaCare would wipe out health insurance plans for millions despite the president\u2019s solemn promise or that a weaponized IRS was targeting Tea Party groups.\n\nSo watching a dystopian future in which reality television distracts the masses, the government fears a popular rebellion and dissent must be wiped out at all costs is a tad more chilling than usual.\n\nThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire repeats these themes in new, darker shades, and while there\u2019s certainly no overt connection to current events it\u2019s impossible not to connect a dot or two while watching Fire. The diabolical President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is in no way a direct or indirect reference to President Barack Obama, nor are the more wicked deeds Snow commits connected to real events.\n\nHere are this weekend\u2019s top 5, per Deadline:\n\n1) The Hunger Games: Catching Fire \u2013 Weekend Total: $145.5 million.\n\n2) Thor: The Dark World \u2013 Total: $14.9 million. Total domestic gross: $168.7 million.\n\n3) The Best Man Holiday \u2013 Weekend Total: $11.7 million. Total domestic gross: $49.6 million.\n\n4) Delivery Man -Weekend Total: $8.9 million Total domestic gross: $8.9 million.\n\n5) Free Birds \u2013 Weekend Total: $5.3 million. Total domestic gross: $48.6 million.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Box Office: 'Hunger Games' on Pace to Break November Record", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Box Office: 'Hunger Games' on Pace to Break November Record", "title": "Box Office: 'Hunger Games' on Pace to Break November Record - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2013/11/21/hunger-games/hunger-games-catching-fire.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2013/11/23/box-office-hunger-games-break-november-record/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Box Office: 'Hunger Games' on Pace to Break November Record", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2013/11/21/hunger-games/hunger-games-catching-fire.jpg", "title": "Box Office: 'Hunger Games' on Pace to Break November Record - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Deadline, Twitter,Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2013-11-23T07:31:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad1c\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cHunger Games: Catching Fire\u201d is currently on pace to break the record for the biggest November opening of all-time.\n4) Delivery Man -Weekend Total: $8.9 million Total domestic gross: $8.9 million.\nHere are this weekend\u2019s top 5, per Deadline:1) The Hunger Games: Catching Fire \u2013 Weekend Total: $145.5 million.\nAnalysts predict the \u201cHunger Games\u201d sequel will stick a landing at somewhere around $145 million.\nTotal domestic gross: $48.6 million."}
