Mitch McConnell will be on \u201cThis Week,\u201d \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cState of the Union,\u201d and \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d to defend GOP opposition to Merrick Garland\u2019s confirmation and answer a tricky question: Why is it worth waiting a year to fill this vacancy when odds are very good it\u2019ll be either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump who fills it? How McConnell handles that will tell you something about how Senate Republicans are planning to cope with a Trump nomination. If he plays the good soldier, insisting that Trump will be a solid conservative in office, it\u2019ll suggest that Senate GOPers are willing to give him a shot to unite the party. If he says that Senate Republicans will exercise their advise-and-consent power scrupulously no matter who wins, that\u2019s a sign that they\u2019re already preparing to go their own way in congressional elections this fall.\n\nJohn Kasich will be on all five shows this morning to try to explain why helping Trump win delegates in Utah is a good idea for a guy whose chances at the nomination depend on a brokered convention. The most interesting interview this a.m., though, will probably be Lindsey Graham\u2019s chat with John Dickerson on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d This will be the first time, I believe, that he\u2019s spoken publicly about the fundraiser he\u2019s planning for Ted Cruz, and it comes just two days after Mitt Romney urged Republicans to vote for Cruz in Utah. If you\u2019re up for a bizarro-world segment in which one of the most prominent members of the GOP establishment tells the world that Ted Cruz is the last best hope of the party, here you go.\n\nReince Priebus will also be on \u201cThis Week\u201d and \u201cState of the Union\u201d to describe what it\u2019s like to hold the world\u2019s worst job. The full line-up is at the AP.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Standoff.", "title": "Sunday morning talking heads", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/03/20/sunday-morning-talking-heads-4/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-20T12:01:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-19T14:56:48+00:00"}, "keywords": "Donald Trump, GOP, John Kasich, Lindsey Graham, Mitch McConnell, nomination, republican, Sunday, talk shows,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "How McConnell handles that will tell you something about how Senate Republicans are planning to cope with a Trump nomination.\nSunday morning talking headsposted at 8:01 am on March 20, 2016 by AllahpunditA rare case this year when the star guest on the Sunday shows isn\u2019t a presidential candidate.\nIf he says that Senate Republicans will exercise their advise-and-consent power scrupulously no matter who wins, that\u2019s a sign that they\u2019re already preparing to go their own way in congressional elections this fall.\nReince Priebus will also be on \u201cThis Week\u201d and \u201cState of the Union\u201d to describe what it\u2019s like to hold the world\u2019s worst job.\nIf you\u2019re up for a bizarro-world segment in which one of the most prominent members of the GOP establishment tells the world that Ted Cruz is the last best hope of the party, here you go."}
