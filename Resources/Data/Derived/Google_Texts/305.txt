Trooper Bellamann Hee, who was injured Wednesday during a high-speed car chase, is recovering after a second successful surgery, the State Patrol announced Saturday.

“He would like everyone to know how much he appreciates the outpouring of support in the early stages of a long road back to duty,” the State Patrol stated in a news release.

Ryan Cole Stone, 28, is suspected in multiple carjackings and was jailed Thursday in Douglas County. His bail was set at $3.5 million.

Stone is accused of stealing a vehicle left running at a Longmont gas station Wednesday morning and leading state troopers and police on a high-speed chase that covered more than 50 miles. During the chase, he allegedly ran down a trooper, carjacked two more vehicles and plowed into several others.

Four-year-old Allan Chavarria-Rodriguez was in the back seat of the first stolen vehicle, a Ford Edge owned by the boy’s mother, Martha Rodriguez.

Stone faces charges of attempted murder, kidnapping, assault and motor-vehicle theft. His bail for Wednesday’s incidents is $2.5 million, but another $1 million in bail was added for Stone’s several outstanding warrants.

Hee was run down and injured while trying to end the car chase.
