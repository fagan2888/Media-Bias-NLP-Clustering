The Economist magazine recently suggested that even Obama\u2019s supporters are now concerned that he is a terrible manager.\n\nIt begs the question: Does good leadership require good management?\n\nWarren Bennis famously wrote \u201cgood managers do things right, while good leaders do the right things.\u201d This is more than a play on words.\n\nWhile some may argue that creating the Affordable Care Act in the first place was not the right thing, executing what was created and passed into law should be up to those responsible for managing things right.\n\nLeaders should be about creating strategy and managers should be about executing strategy.\n\nIn Obama\u2019s apology to the American people for the technical problems surrounding the website, he defended Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services. \u201cUltimately, the buck stops with me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m the president. This is my team. If it\u2019s not working, it\u2019s my job to get it fixed.\u201d\n\nTaking responsibility for the failures of those reporting to him is a sign of good leadership. Years to come, President Obama knows the ultimate success or failure of Obamacare will be attached to him regardless of how many other people work on it.\n\nThis responsibility is a huge component of leadership. That\u2019s why business leaders and sports coaches get huge salary increases with the success of their companies or teams, and why they get fired if these companies or teams fail.\n\nIn my experience, good managers don\u2019t necessarily make good leaders. Some of them, however, do become great managers. And we can\u2019t have too many of them. Great managers get results, execute strategy and fulfill the mission.\n\nGreat leaders, on the other hand, create and communicate a compelling vision others want to follow. They also ensure the right people are in the right place, and they engage them to bring out their best.\n\nAnd perhaps somewhat surprisingly, great leaders don\u2019t necessarily make great managers. That\u2019s because they require a different set of skills.\n\nThe best leaders are focused on strategy and looking at the big picture without getting mired in the execution of that strategy.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Steve Ballmer will soon step down from the CEO job because as he stated they needed to break a pattern and he\u2019s a pattern. His management style included requiring direct reports to provide a massive amount of data and details before decision making, an environment with corporate silos where colleagues competed with each other for resources, and the recently dropped rank order performance-appraisal practice that pitted people against each other for personal gain rather than encouraged collaboration and cooperation for the good of Microsoft.\n\nWhile Ballmer tripled Microsoft\u2019s revenue during his 13 years at the helm, this came from their existing markets and the company missed huge opportunities in Web-search engine advertising and the overall shift of consumers to mobile devices and social media.\n\nUltimately, Ballmer admitted he had created an environment where managers were so focused on trees instead of the forest that it was impossible for him to change their thinking. Trees, of course, should be the primary focus for managers and forests the primary focus of leaders. But neither can lose sight of the other.\n\nManagers should be laser-focused on day-to-day execution. They should be concerned with ensuring the strategy is executed as planned.\n\nIs it therefore really possible for anyone to be far-sighted for strategy and at the same time near-sighted for execution?\n\nIn my work as an executive coach, I try to help middle managers and directors build leadership skills so they can become more effective and advance their careers. I help them focus on competency areas that will enable them to grow their leadership capacity. But this doesn\u2019t mean they will all become great leaders.\n\nSome of us are better suited for vision, while others are more suited for process. Some more concerned with asking why and others with asking how.\n\nBeing able to shift back and forth between seeing the future vision and the day-to-day reality is extremely valuable, but there is a natural tendency to have a dominant perspective.\n\nBallmer\u2019s successor may very well need to be more a visionary like Bill Gates if Microsoft is to transition back to the dominate player it was previously.\n\nIf Obama is to be successful with the Affordable Care Act, he will ultimately need to ensure he does in fact have the right people in place to execute his vision. He will also need to do a better job communicating not only to these people, but also to the American people.\n\nAny leader can only be as great as the quality of the managers he or she leads.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Workplace Wrangler", "description": "President Obama\u2019s leadership has recently come into question due to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s website challenges.
