Mary Landrieu (D-LA) uses two different addresses.\n\nIn order to qualify for the Louisiana Senate race against Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) this November, Landrieu is claiming that she lives with her parents Moon and Verna Landrieu at their large-scale New Orleans bungalow on South Prieur Street. Landrieu has a $2.5 million home in Washington DC with her husband Frank Snellings that the two built together.\n\nBut, on her voter registration card, Landrieu lists Washington DC as her primary residence. Take a look at it here:\n\nLandrieu asserts that she still lives with her parents though, saying \u201cI have lived at my home on Prieur Street most of my life and I live there now, when not fulfilling my duties in Washington or serving constituents across the state.\u201d\n\nIn a report by the Washington Post, the Moon and Verna\u2019s neighbors say they haven\u2019t seen Mary in years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she lives there,\u201d said Fontaine Wells, 65, pointing at the Landrieu home. \u201cShe might come visit, but come on now \u2014 she lives in D.C. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen her.\u201d Michael Fitzgerald, 61, has lived around the corner from the Landrieus for three decades. He said he sees Moon and Verna Landrieu regularly, as well as Mitch Landrieu, Mary\u2019s younger brother and the city\u2019s current mayor, who lives in a home he owns nearby. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very good neighbors,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cOn Election Day, [Mary] is seen at our polling place accompanying her parents.\u201d He added, \u201cI have not seen her lately. . . . She\u2019s been in the Senate for \u2014 I\u2019ve lost count \u2014 16 years? 18 years?\u201d In the years since, the neighborhood has been rebuilt and is now a post-Katrina success story. Moon Landrieu was particularly active in the rebuilding efforts, said Kelli Wright, who has lived in Broadmoor since 1988 and is president of the Broadmoor Improvement Association. \u201cIs Mary\u2019s address the Landrieu\u2019s family home?\u201d Wright asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know where she lives. I\u2019ve never seen her around the neighborhood. It doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not here, but I haven\u2019t seen her. We see Moon, we see Verna, we see the mayor.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it would actually be easier for Landrieu to run for office in Washington DC than it would be to run in Louisiana.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Hayride", "description": "When it comes to running for public office and actually voting on voting day, Sen.
