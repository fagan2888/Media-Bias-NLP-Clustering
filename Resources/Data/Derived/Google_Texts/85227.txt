While trolling the Web, we found this health-related story from Canada’s National Post…..

The story says the flu vaccine used to inoculate people in the U.S. this past year may make a rare curtain call next season, according to officials from the Centers for Disease Control.

CDC officials at the World Health Organization conference in Geneva this week said there haven’t been any major changes in viruses collected from around the globe from those that hit flu sufferers this winter. So the same vaccine strain can be used next year, making it easier for drugmakers, who already know how to produce the medication.

The news isn’t all good, however, as officials warn it may be more difficult to develop a vaccine for the winter of 2015-16 as a number of components for this year’s virus could change drastically by that time.

If you’re wondering how the vaccine performed, the Post says it was 74% effective at avoiding flu severe enough to warrant medical treatment. But it wasn’t good enough to avoid having to get a shot again next year, CDC officials say.

Jason McDonald, CDC spokesman, says the antibodies that came with this year’s flu shot won’t live long enough to ward off the virus next year.

“We highly recommend that you do [get another shot],” McDonald said. “The immunity kind of wanes.”
