(Photo: Provided)\n\nHEBRON, Ky. \u2013 In what sounded like a kickoff of a 2019 challenge to Matt Bevin, former Democratic state Auditor Adam Edelen blasted the current governor during a speech to Northern Kentucky Democrats on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf you want to know how far Kentucky is retreating on the progress that we have made in the last couple of generations, I have three words for you: Governor. Matt. Bevin,\u201d Edelen told the crowd.\n\n\u201cNever in the history of Kentucky, has a governor made so many bad decisions in such a short period of time,\u201d said Edelen, of Lexington.\n\nEdelen lost his re-election bid in November as Bevin and the Republicans swept to victory, taking all but two of Kentucky\u2019s statewide offices. Despite outraising his opponent, former state Rep. Mike Harmon, by a 20-1 margin, he lost to Harmon by 36,320 votes.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d Edelen told the group of about 65 people. \u201cI am coming back.\u201d\n\nBevin's spokeswoman, Jessica Ditto, didn't respond to an email sent to her Thursday evening or a text message on Friday.\n\nBut state Rep. Jerry Miller, R-Middletown, defended Bevin, saying that he is trying to solve Kentucky's pension crisis, which he said was caused by Edelen's Democrats.\n\n\"Gov. Bevin was elected to fix this, and he is acting boldly to do something about it,\" he said.\n\nHe added that Edelen's criticism \"fits into the narrative that we've heard since the election.\"\n\nMiller discounted Edelen's threat as a potential threat to Bevin in 2019, saying, \"Adam Edelen couldn\u2019t even win a race against one of our least-funded candidates - Mike Harmon, who has a heart of gold but he is not a smooth political operator like Adam. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, and I\u2019m not sure he does either.\"\n\nSpeaking at the event, Edelen said Bevin\u2019s election was a \u201ctragedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a governor who wants to convince us that we can take a short-cut to prosperity by reducing workers\u2019 wages and protections, by kicking people off health care who work for a living, by raising the cost of college tuition,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFolks, that is not a vision for a new Kentucky. It is the agenda for a very old Mississippi,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the 28-minute speech, Edelen also trained his sights on the Democratic Party and \u2013 without mentioning him by name \u2013 former Attorney General Jack Conway, who was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe ran an idealess, people-less campaign, in the last governor\u2019s race out of Frankfort. We literally ran a campaign that encouraged people not to vote. We all know what happens in elections when Democrats don\u2019t vote. Democrats don\u2019t win,\u201d he said.\n\nHe called on the Democratic Party to reinvent itself, to reach out to independents and disaffected voters and to give them the opportunity to have a say in the issues the party champions.\n\n\u201cWhat we have got to do is build something different, build it around a set of values,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to find ways to reach out to people who may not be full-fledged Democrats but who share our values.\u201d\n\nHe called for running campaigns based on ideas rather than those based on opposition to Republican ideas and candidates.\n\n\u201cThe lesson of the last election is that bad ideas trump no ideas,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nReporter Joseph Gerth can be reached at (502) 875-5136 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1MXofKW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Former state Auditor Adam Edelen took on Gov.
