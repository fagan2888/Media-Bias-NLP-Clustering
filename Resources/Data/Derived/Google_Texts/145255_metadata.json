The town is in the fifth district, which first elected Republican Scott Garrett to Congress in 2002.\n\nBELVIDERE, N.J. \u2014 John Wyckoff was set to welcome a group of important customers to his tree farm here earlier this week. Then he was informed that the White House usher and three others scheduled to choose a prized blue spruce to adorn the presidential residence this Christmas were not coming.\n\nAdamant conservative Republicans, including Wyckoff\u2019s own representative, Scott Garrett, had dug in their heels and forced a government shutdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWyckoff, 47, representing the seventh generation to work his family\u2019s 172-acre farm in this rural swath of corn fields and rolling hills, says he is no fan of President Obama\u2019s politics and is a longtime supporter of Garrett, one of the most unbending House members in the budget stalemate.\n\nBut Wyckoff said the battle Garrett and his allies are waging to defund the Affordable Care Act, a quest even conservative pundits have likened to a kamikaze mission, is looking petty and counterproductive.\n\n\u201cTo see our country come to this, it is a shame,\u201d Wyckoff said outside his farmhouse on County Road 519 on Tuesday.\n\nAcross New Jersey\u2019s Fifth Congressional District \u2014 one of the most conservative in the Northeast \u2014 interviews with numerous voters show anger over the shutdown and growing dissatisfaction with Tea Party lawmakers, including Garrett, who participated in the founding moments of the Tea Party movement in 2009.\n\nThe backlash is part of a national trend in which the support for the Tea Party movement has waned even among its strongest base: conservative Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Gallup poll in late September showed that Republican support for the Tea Party had dropped from 65 percent to 38 percent since the height of the movement in November 2010. Among independent voters, support dropped from 30 percent to 25 percent over the same period.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 largely dim view of the Tea Party movement has remained fairly constant, according to Gallup.\n\nThe trends may help explain why House Republican leaders have begun downplaying their demands to defund what they call \u201cObamacare\u2019\u2019 and have begun seeking a compromise on raising the debt ceiling.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s hideous,\u201d Sidney Deutsch, 73, another Garrett supporter and proprietor of the Hotel Belvidere, said of the GOP\u2019s game plan so far. \u201cThey\u2019re beating a dead horse.\u201d\n\nHe, too, received a call late Monday canceling the four reservations the White House tree-picking party had made at the Victorian-style inn.\n\nDeutsch has his own window into the debates taking place in the nation\u2019s capital: His son is the chief of staff to Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington State, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.\n\nGarrett has enjoyed widespread popularity since he was first elected in 2002 from a district that hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat since the Great Depression in 1931. He has easily won reelection, even last year when 150,000 constituents were added from liberal northern New Jersey towns like Teaneck and Hackensack.\n\nIn 2012, voters in Warren and Sussex counties \u2014 which make up the bulk of Garrett\u2019s district \u2014 supported Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney over Obama 57 percent to 41 percent and 60 percent to 38 percent. Obama won the state.\n\nOver the past decade Garrett has staked out conservative positions on social and fiscal issues.\n\nOne of his first votes in Congress was against extending unemployment benefits. As a member of the Budget Committee, he has also pushed hard to curtail federal spending; for example, he voted against providing federal aid to 9/11 rescue workers and relief for victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nA self-described born-again Christian, the 54-year-old Garrett has more recently found common ground with members of Tea Party movement, who were ushered into the House in the Republican takeover in 2010 on a platform of reversing Obama\u2019s signature health care overhaul law.\n\nIn 2009, he met with supporters of the Tea Party movement who were demonstrating on the grounds of the US Capitol and lent his voice to the so-called birther movement demanding Obama produce a copy of his birth certificate.\n\n\u201cEven before the Tea Party was a thing, we had Scott Garrett,\u201d Erica Elliott, a former Garrett staffer who went to work for House majority whip Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, told the Bergen County Record last fall. \u201cThe rest of the caucus has caught up with him.\u201d\n\nGarrett\u2019s press secretary, Adam Rice, did not respond to repeated e-mails and phone calls from the Globe seeking an interview with Garrett, or requests for comment.\n\nMost Recently, Garrett has been couching his firm stance against funding the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and the decision to use it as leverage in deliberations over the nation\u2019s finances \u2014 in terms of what the people want.\n\n\u201cBy an overwhelming majority, my constituents have made it clear that they are concerned with Obamacare and do not believe it is ready for prime time,\u201d he said in a statement earlier this month. \u201cWhile President Obama has given waivers to his political backers, the American people are demanding fairness for all.\u201d\n\nBut while many of his constituents share Garrett\u2019s antipathy for the health care law, they have grown disenchanted with his tactics.\n\nIn the small downtown of Belvidere, the Warren County seat,many say they no longer see the point in holding everything else hostage to this one policy goal.\n\nIn George\u2019s Place, a bar on Greenwich Street where the inscription on one wall reads \u201c. . . the only place, at the end of the world, down town Belvidere,\u201d a small crowd of working-class patrons aired a deep anti-establishment sentiment along with a heavy dose of vitriol for the president.\n\nSteve Lake, 42, an unemployed father of three who says his house is now worth less than he owes on it, contended that the United States must substantially shrink the role of government.\n\n\u201cWe used to rely on family and town and neighbors to take care of each other,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the federal government.\u201d\n\nYet Lake, whose friends tease him for always talking politics, says he is also tired of the labels and what he considers the culprit of the government shutdown: partisan jockeying for its own sake.\n\n\u201cPut the personal aside and do what is best,\u201d he advises Congress.\n\nThe proprietor, George Triantafyllos, 67, said Congressman Garrett \u201cis very popular around here.\u201d\n\nWhy? \u201cHe is very rigid.\u201d\n\nYet Trianafyllos says many here believe what he is currently trying to do \u201cdoesn\u2019t work for New Jersey.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "2.1.4206570473", "eomportal-id": 1196142, "description": "BELVIDERE, N.J. \u2014 John Wyckoff was set to welcome a group of important customers to his tree farm here earlier this week.
