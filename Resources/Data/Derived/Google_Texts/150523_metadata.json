The use of the phrase has not been limited to foreign crises in Ukraine, Syria or Libya, but has also been bestowed upon domestic challenges such as the health care law and reducing the debt.\n\nThe Huffington Post compiled the other \"biggest tests\" of Obama's presidency, listed below in chronological order:\n\nThe financial crisis of 2007-08\n\nObama was confronted with his first \"biggest test\" before he even became president.

Stanley McChrystal, June 2010\n\nAlong with the BP oil spill came the rare simultaneous \"biggest test of [Obama's] presidency \u2026 surrounding the firing of his Afghanistan commander, General McChrystal, over a number of disrespectful remarks made about him and his national security team.\"\n\nWithstanding the 2010 midterm elections\n\n\"President Barack Obama faces the biggest test of his presidency to date today, as voters from across the United States go to the polls in the midterm elections that will likely see his Democratic Party lose control of the House of Representatives.\"\n\nDecision to invade Libya, March 2011\n\nCNN's Piers Morgan opened his primetime broadcast with the perennial declaration: \"Tonight, President Obama faces the biggest test of his presidency.\"\n\nThe debt ceiling standoff of 2011\n\nBob Woodword looked back at the previous year's debt ceiling standoff \"as Obama faced perhaps the biggest test of his presidency.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court challenge to Obamacare, November 2011\n\n\"Obama will face one of the biggest tests of his presidency in the middle of next year's election campaign, after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a legal challenge to his landmark healthcare reforms.\"\n\nThe demise of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il, December 2011\n\n\"How Obama handles it could prove the biggest test of his presidency.\"\n\nMaking a decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline during the 2012 election\n\nIn a letter to Obama, green groups described the pipeline as \"perhaps the biggest climate test you face between now and the election.\" (Obama is expected to make a decision on the pipeline this year.)\n\nObama's first visit to Israel, March 2013\n\n\"President Obama\u2019s visit to Israel will be seen by many as the biggest test of his presidency. The issue of Palestine and Iran\u2019s nuclear program are just too big to get wrong.\"\n\nWinning approval from Congress for airstrikes in Syria, September 2013\n\n\"President Obama raced home on Friday to confront one of the biggest tests of his presidency as he ramped up a campaign to persuade Congress to support airstrikes against Syria that many world leaders he had consulted declined to back.\"\n\nFixing the Obamacare website, December 2013\n\nNBC News declared that \"President Obama is facing one of the biggest tests of his presidency as his administration revives Healthcare.gov.\"\n\nMake-it-or-Break-It-Moments\n\nThe following were deemed serious enough to \"make or break\" Obama's presidency, but fell short of making it into the clearly exclusive \"biggest test\" club.
