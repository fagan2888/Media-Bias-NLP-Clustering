You may want to practice being a jerk.\n\nI know; I know. There\u2019s that old mantra that correlation isn\u2019t causation. But over time, an awful lot of correlation adds up to a pretty convincing pattern. And right now, the overlap between \u201cjerk\u201d and \u201cSilicon Valley success story\u201d is looking fairly large.\n\nThis week, it\u2019s Uber grabbing the headlines, for rather dramatic reasons. The high-flying ride-sharing company \u2014 estimated value $18 billion and, until this week, climbing by the day \u2014 has stirred plenty of controversy in the past. Now it\u2019s riled members of the media and tech worlds with comments made by Senior Vice President Emil Michael suggesting that Uber could wage an opposition-research campaign against journalists responsible for some critical coverage. Most notable among those journalists is Sarah Lacy of Pando.com, who wrote a scathing story explaining just why she had deleted the Uber app from her smartphone.\n\nRelated: An \u2018Uber\u2019 the Top Valuation Spells New Economic Risks\n\nInstead of adopting a smart, savvy marketing strategy, Michael spouted off at a dinner he thought was off the record, Buzzfeed\u2019s Ben Smith, who attended the dinner, reported. The Uber executive said the company could take $1 million (of shareholders\u2019 money) and invest it in a Watergate-style dirty tricks operation against journalists, hiring researchers and journalists to dig into their own lives. Note: not into the journalists\u2019 work methods or articles, but into their personal life.\n\nUSA Today columnist Michael Wolff on Wednesday criticized the Buzzfeed story for being presented in \u201cclickbait fashion\u201d and casually tossed off a mention that key Buzzfeed investors are also investors in Uber\u2019s rival, Lyft.\n\nRelated: Uber Revs Its Engines Against a Ride-Sharing Rival\n\nThose critiques may be true, but they don\u2019t really matter. There\u2019s a much bigger, broader issue here that venture capitalists and other investors in startup companies are going to have to wrestle with: Just how much boorishness are you willing to tolerate? And at what price?\n\nHigh-profile jerks are nothing new in the tech world. As Walter Isaacson\u2019s biography of Steve Jobs pointed out, he parked his Mercedes in handicapped parking spots and even denied paternity of his daughter for a period. Larry Ellison of Oracle is renowned for being brash, egotistical and cutthroat; former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has a hot temper, while that of Amazon.com\u2019s Jeff Bezos apparently can strip paint off metal.\n\nThe success of those leaders, particularly Jobs, may have inspired other young tech entrepreneurs to emulate them. One venture capitalist who had worked with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick described his pugnacious approach to Kara Swisher for a recent Vanity Fair piece: \u201cIt\u2019s douche as a tactic, not a strategy.\u201d\n\nEither way, it\u2019 nothing to be proud of, but investors might turn a blind eye \u2014 for as long as it works. But when being an asshole becomes part of the corporate culture, it can also undermine any advantages that aggressiveness has brought to a business. What happens when throwing temper tantrums and humiliating employees drives away some of your most creative employees, leaving the company in which you\u2019ve invested with \u201cyes men\u201d?\n\nRelated: Uber Snatches Up Former Obama Campaign Guru\n\nWhen companies look to win at all costs, nastiness can turn to ethical lapses. Google\u2019s IPO prospectus famously claimed that the company\u2019s mantra was \u201cdon\u2019t be evil,\u201d and in some pockets of the business and tech worlds that fairly low bar qualifies as a high standard. What happens when customers are turned off by stories of bad behavior, or when the corporate brand becomes inextricably linked to executive impropriety? At that point, investors must be concerned.\n\nIf you want to succeed in technology \u2014 which relies on being disruptive, on challenging conventional wisdom, breaking down barriers and forcing reluctant organizations to rewrite the rules of engagement \u2014 you need to be aggressive. You need to push people beyond their comfort zone. For instance, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has had to be creative in offering riders more and more reasons to use his service rather than hail a cab or use a rival like Lyft \u2014 and so was born the idea of enabling the customer to stream his or her own music as part of the ride experience. It has also meant challenging local licensing regulations and other restrictions and combatting protests by taxi owners.\n\nBut where is it written that a CEO and his senior executives \u2014 even if they are misfits best suited to the rough and tumble that is life in a startup \u2014 are exempt from all standards of normal behavior? The incident involving Sarah Lacy wasn\u2019t the only time that Uber has crossed the line with a female journalist recently; in another case, they tracked a journalist traveling in an Uber car that she had summoned and paid for, using an app known as \u201cGod View.\u201d\n\nThere are other stories, too, some involving alleged assaults and abductions by Uber drivers or dirty tricks to sabotage rivals. In some cases \u2014 such as the driver who responded to a canceled pickup request by texting the customer that she was an animal and deserved her cancer \u2014 Uber has acted promptly: they fired the driver.\n\nKalanick apologized for Emil\u2019s comments in a series of Twitter posts and the company said on Thursday that it has hired a law firm to audit the way it handles customer data. Even so, the calls are growing for Michael and/or Kalanick to go. The image of an arrogant company led by jerks \u2014 people who insist that they, and only they, have the secret for the way the world should unfold \u2014 has only grown. The company\u2019s leaders came off appearing eager to pocket the profits, but less so to shoulder the responsibilities associated with serving customers, including fielding criticism.\n\nRelated: The Sharing Economy Takes a Giant Step Forward\n\nThis is a particular issue in Silicon Valley, perhaps, which isn\u2019t just a hotbed of innovation but also the focal point of \u201cbro-grammer\u201d culture. It has become a vicious circle: With so many young men flocking to the area, it can be about as welcoming an environment to women as a fraternity house full of drunken undergraduates. Women fill only a fraction of the technical roles in Silicon Valley firms.\n\nAnd the jerks may be to blame.\n\nWill the Uber backlash lead to changes, or is the jerk gene inextricably linked with the gene for entrepreneurial success? Does the struggle have to be a Darwinian one, with the fiercest competitor \u2014 the one willing to draw the most blood, throw the biggest temper tantrums, cross the most ethical boundaries \u2014 walking away with the prize?\n\nIf it is, where does that leave us? We\u2019ve seen, time and time again, the consequences of pushing the envelope in the corporate sphere. The leaders of Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco did it. The investment banks did it in the years leading up to 2008. Rogue traders like Joseph Jett and Nick Leeson did it, and brought their financial institutions down with them. Jerks tend to be arrogant, and arrogance, too often, brings with it complacency. If you\u2019re an investor, those are characteristics you really don\u2019t want to see in a CEO.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Want to be a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur?", "title": "Man and Uber Man: Do Startup CEOs Have to Be Jerks?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/11/21/Man-and-Uber-Man-Do-Startup-CEOs-Have-Be-Jerks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01032014_Uber_Car.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/11/21/Man-and-Uber-Man-Do-Startup-CEOs-Have-Be-Jerks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01032014_Uber_Car.jpg", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Want to be a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "And right now, the overlap between \u201cjerk\u201d and \u201cSilicon Valley success story\u201d is looking fairly large.\nWomen fill only a fraction of the technical roles in Silicon Valley firms.\nWant to be a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur?\nRelated: Uber Revs Its Engines Against a Ride-Sharing RivalThose critiques may be true, but they don\u2019t really matter.\nRelated: The Sharing Economy Takes a Giant Step ForwardThis is a particular issue in Silicon Valley, perhaps, which isn\u2019t just a hotbed of innovation but also the focal point of \u201cbro-grammer\u201d culture."}
