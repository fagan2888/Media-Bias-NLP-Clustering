All of the affected babies so far have been hospitalized, but none of them have died. Currently, health officials in both Kansas and Missouri are investigating the cause of the infections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible we could see more cases. It\u2019s something we\u2019re looking closely at,\u201d spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE), Aimee Rosenow, said. \u201cIt\u2019s still pretty early on. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a common factor linking the cases.\u201d Kansas City, which rests on the Missouri side of the Kansas-Missouri border, sprawls between two states. Nine infected infants were reported in Kansas, and five were found in Missouri.\n\nKnown as Human Parechovirus (HPeV), this virus typically affects infants who are younger than 1 year old and is \u201cassociated with a wide variety of illnesses in children ranging from gastroenteritis, respiratory infections, sepsis-like illness and neurological disease particularly in neonates,\u201d a press release from Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital states.\n\nResearchers still aren\u2019t sure how the virus is spread, or whether it can be fatal. Thus far, all of the babies hospitalized have survived. \u201cIn one study out of Toronto, sick babies, 90 percent of those babies were completely normal as they grow up,\u201d Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children\u2019s Mercy, told KSHB local news. \u201cSo do we know all the answers about this virus at this point? Not yet.\u201d\n\nHowever, KDHE points out that the virus can be spread through public diaper changing tables. In order to prevent your infant from catching the virus, be sure to wipe down public changing tables with an antibacterial wipe.\n\nDr. John Fried, Infectious Disease Specialist at Shawnee Mission Medical Center, told KSHB that breastfeeding could also help in protecting babies from the virus. \u201cThe most severe illnesses mostly found in birth and six weeks old \u2026 around six weeks the baby can start making its own antibodies and has more protection. That first month the baby depends a lot on the antibodies from the mother through the birth process or the breast milk.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hpev3 virus, kansas city virus, infant illness", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Kansas City health officials are investigating a cluster of infections in babies caused by a rare virus.", "title": "Rare Virus Sickens And Hospitalizes 14 Babies In Kansas City Area", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rare-virus-hpev3-sickens-and-hospitalizes-14-babies-kansas-city-area-causing-inflammation-298168", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/sick-infant.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kansas City health officials are investigating a cluster of infections in babies caused by a rare virus.", "title": "Rare Virus Sickens And Hospitalizes 14 Babies In Kansas City Area", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rare-virus-hpev3-sickens-and-hospitalizes-14-babies-kansas-city-area-causing-inflammation-298168", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/sick-infant.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/sick-infant.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-14T16:26:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-14T16:26:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Kansas City health officials are investigating a cluster of infections in babies caused by a rare virus."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc8e\"", "article_summary": "Fourteen infants have been sickened and hospitalized after being infected with a rare virus known as HPeV3, which has struck the Kansas City area.\nThus far, all of the babies hospitalized have survived.\nThe virus may lead to meningitis and inflammatory problems in infants, among a slew of other health issues.\nIt\u2019s something we\u2019re looking closely at,\u201d spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE), Aimee Rosenow, said.\nIn order to prevent your infant from catching the virus, be sure to wipe down public changing tables with an antibacterial wipe."}
