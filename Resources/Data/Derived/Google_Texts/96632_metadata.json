The company makes intraocular lens implants for people suffering from presbyopia, a condition that impacts focus on close objects, and cataracts. \u201cI think [the device tax] can have an impact on the funding environment.\u201d\n\nPowerVision was founded in 2002 and remains in the clinical study phase. Since it\u2019s not yet commercial, the medical device tax does not apply.\n\nRight now, the company is looking to raise a fourth round of funding as it prepares for the FDA approval process. Frinzi said that, while ultimately he\u2019s not concerned about getting the money, this round of fundraising has been more arduous than it was in the past.\n\n\u201cThe venture capitalists that fund startup ventures like our company have a certain exit number in mind, which is driven by the larger companies looking to acquire,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now, those companies are all facing a hefty tax on top-line sales.\u201d\n\nThe 2.3 percent medical device tax was introduced in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act, with the hope that it would bring in about $30 billion over the next decade to help fund the expansion of health care in the U.S.\n\nThe tax went into effect earlier this year, applying to all medical devices sold in the U.S. (not foreign exports) after Dec. 31, 2012, with some exemptions \u2014 such as devices like eyeglasses or hearing aids that are generally purchased at retail.\n\nSince then, large medical device companies such as Minnesota-based Medtronic, Inc., have supported a repeal of the tax, with many in the industry stating it would result in job loss and drive manufacturers overseas.\n\nMore recently, it became a sticking point during the government shutdown, with House Republicans initially pushing for a two-year delay of the medical device tax. That was scrapped, as Congress eventually came to a deal with Senate leaders to end the shutdown.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much money has been collected from the tax to date. The Congressional Budget Office and IRS have not responded to requests for data or comment.\n\nThe theory that the medical device tax will result in job loss or a shift toward foreign manufacturing is still a hot topic of debate. Economist Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former assistant director at the Congressional Budget Office, has stated he does not believe the medical device tax should be repealed, refuting claims that the tax will impact innovation or production.\n\n\u201cThe notion behind the tax is that, basically, a wide range of industries are going to get more business as a part of health reform, and are being asked to pay for it in one way or another,\u201d said Van de Water. \u201cAnd that includes medical devices.\u201d\n\nHe cited a study by Wells Fargo Securities, which found that the new health care law will increase device sales by 1.5 percent next year and by 3.6 percent overall through 2022 \u2014 enough to sufficiently offset the tax for companies.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just repeal the tax and let it add to the deficit,\u201d Van de Water said.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, where companies large and small contribute to the $110 billion dollar med-tech sector, those in the industry express divergent views.\n\nThe chief executive officer of Palo Alto-based Varian Medical Systems, Tim Guertin, has been quoted as saying he believes the tax will give unfair advantage to manufacturers offshore. Varian, which makes large-scale oncology and X-ray equipment, employs around 6,300 workers, with more than half of those in North America.\n\nThe company\u2019s chief financial officer, Elisha Finney, said the medical device tax is costing Varian about $10 million per year.\n\nAbbott Labs in Santa Clara, one of the world\u2019s largest medical device companies and the largest in the Bay Area by fiscal-year revenue, declined a request for an interview. But a spokesperson did say that while the company has accounted for the tax in its 2013 expectations, it supports the position that the tax is \u201cadversely impacting patient care and innovation.\u201d\n\nIn startup land, the tax doesn\u2019t always apply, since many early-stage medical device companies aren\u2019t yet shipping their products.\n\nStill, confusion exists around the tax. Some products, such as DNA testing kits that are sold directly to consumers but could end up in the clinical realm, fall into murky territory.\n\nMountain View-based Scanadu, which makes a smartphone-linked medical \u201ctricorder\u201d called Scout, is another example.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a unique position, as we\u2019re selling to the consumer first and giving them a device that will put the experience of the emergency room in the palm of their hands,\u201d wrote chief executive officer Walter De Brouwer via email. He went on to note that Scanadu believes in the \u201cdemocratization\u201d of health care and health data.\n\nHowever, the company is still not clear on whether the medical device tax will apply to its tricorder or another product in development, an at-home urine test kit called Scanaflo. A spokeswoman for Scanadu said the company has hired consultants to help it navigate this unchartered territory.\n\nScanadu just secured $10 million in funding.\n\nBut others might not be so lucky.\n\nAccording to new data analyzed by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association, investments in the medical device industry are down 40 percent from 2007, dropping to $2.14 billion this year.\n\nThe number of medical device deals this year in Silicon Valley, specifically, dropped to 925 from 1,205 a year ago.\n\nMike Carusi \u2014 a venture capitalist at Advanced Technology Ventures, which is heavily invested in local health-tech companies, including PowerVision, GluMetrics and Second Genome \u2014 agrees that the tax is having a negative impact on the flow of capital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s problematic because the tax is on revenues, not profits,\u201d Carusi said. \u201cSo, even if these companies are still small, even if they\u2019re losing money, they\u2019re still paying the tax on sales.\u201d\n\nCarusi also cites the FDA approval process for new devices as a significant roadblock in the industry. \u201cThe tax is now just one more thing on top of a bunch of other challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nNot all feel that the tax or current environment for medical devices is a dire one. Krishna Yeshwant, a general partner at Google Ventures who is also a physician, said that while the tax is generally \u201cnot a great thing,\u201d it has the potential to spur innovation and \u201ctotally change the economics of treatment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at medical devices in the right way, they can really be a replacement for years and years of pharmaceutical therapy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can pay $40, $50, $60 a week for the rest of your life for a drug, or you can look to a new, completely innovative device that is possibly going to cure this problem. The overall dollar amount might work out in the future.\u201d\n\nEven Carusi is somewhat optimistic. \u201cIt\u2019s not all bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this sector was probably over-funded in the mid-2000s.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd if you look at the history of venture capital, the sectors that really thrive were usually in a bad place three or five years prior. So I think we\u2019ll shake out.\u201d\n\nA version of this article was previously published as part of a reporting project for Stanford University\u2019s Peninsula Press, as well as in the San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s SFGate blog.\n\nFeature photo courtesy of Lenore M.
