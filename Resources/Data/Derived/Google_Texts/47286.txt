With forecasts of up to 30 inches (76.2 cm) of snow, New York will also enforce a travel ban on all roads in the southern part of the state and Long Island, beginning at 2:30 p.m. (1930 GMT), the governor said at a press conference.

He also announced a halt on all "exterior routes" of the New York City subway system, as well as the Long Island and Metro-North rail systems.
