The President\u2019s statement notes that Congress has made over 50 attempts to repeal one of the administration\u2019s signature legislative achievements.\n\nObama said the bill would have increased the number of uninsured Americans by 22 million after 2017 and caused more than 10,000 additional deaths. \u201cThis legislation would cost millions of hard-working middle class Americans the security of affordable health coverage they deserve,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe bill goes back to Congress, where the law\u2019s opponents do not have the votes to override the veto.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The bill would have also defunded Planned Parenthood.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The bill would also have defunded Planned Parenthood", "title": "President Obama Vetoes Affordable Care Act Repeal", "url": "http://time.com/4173152/president-obama-vetoes-affordable-care-act-repeal/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/gettyimages-503939252.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/gettyimages-503939252.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The bill would also have defunded Planned Parenthood", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "President Obama Vetoes Affordable Care Act Repeal"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "obama veto, obama affordable care act, affordable care act repeal, planned parenthood, obamacare repeal, congress, barack obama,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obama Veto, Obama Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act repeal, Planned Parenthood, Obamacare repeal, Congress, Barack Obama,"}, "article_summary": "President Barack Obama vetoed legislation on Friday that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act, as well as effectively defunded Planned Parenthood.\n\u201cThis legislation would cost millions of hard-working middle class Americans the security of affordable health coverage they deserve,\u201d the statement read.\nThe President\u2019s statement notes that Congress has made over 50 attempts to repeal one of the administration\u2019s signature legislative achievements.\nThe bill goes back to Congress, where the law\u2019s opponents do not have the votes to override the veto.\n\u201cBecause of the harm this bill would cause to the health and financial security of millions of Americans, it has earned my veto.\u201dThe House of Representatives on Wednesday passed the bill repealing the health care law."}
