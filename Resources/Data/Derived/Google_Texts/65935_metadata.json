Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) said Wednesday.\n\nThe first path would be to override the president\u2019s veto of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and then pass a second bill to adjust the NDAA's funding level down $5 billion to match the budget deal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe second path would be to write a new bill that would be the same as the current NDAA, except with the budget deal's funding level.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure which [way] we'll go,\u201d said Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nThe House is set to vote Wednesday on the budget compromise between Republicans and the White House. It\u2019s expected to pass.\n\nThe deal raises budget caps for defense and nondefense spending by a total of $112 billion in fiscal years 2016 and 2017.\n\nIt also spreads $32 billion over two years into a war fund known as the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fund.\n\nPresident Obama vetoed the NDAA because it would have added $38 billion to the war fund.\n\nWith the budget still using the war fund, Thornberry said it was \u201cwrong and unhelpful\u201d for the president to veto the bill.\n\n\u201cIt does occur to me the president made a big deal out of using OCO for base requirements. Well the number has changed, but there\u2019s still OCO for base requirements in the deal,\u201d Thornberry said. \u201cIf you look at it, everything is basically the same, which is why it was wrong and unhelpful to veto our bill.\u201d\n\nThornberry said he did not know where the $5 billion will be cut from but that it will be from \u201cmuscle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not fat that you can just chip and say, \u2018OK, this doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll matter. It\u2019ll be significant.\u201d\n\nThe veto override vote in the House will go forward Nov. 5 as planned. Thornberry said he thinks the House is in the \u201cballpark\u201d of having enough votes to override the veto.\n\nThe final version of the bill passed the House by 270-156. That would not be enough to override a veto. But Thornberry said most of the 10 Republicans who voted against the bill have said they would switch their vote. He\u2019s also talked to some Democrats who will vote to override the veto, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are some people who want to use the override route followed by a second bill to adjust the tables,\u201d he said. \u201cI think an override is very possible.\u201d\n\nWhen vetoing the bill, Obama also voiced opposition to the provisions related to Guantanamo Bay. The bill would keep in place the ban on transferring detainees to the United States, effectively preventing the closure of the detention facility.\n\nThornberry reiterated that the language on transferring detainees to the United States is the same as every other year the president signed the bill, so he shouldn\u2019t continue opposing the bill because of Guantanamo.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you, obviously, what the president is going to do, but he has signed that exact language for the past five years,\u201d Thornberry said. \u201cIn addition, we have a provision that requires the administration give us a plan on moving ahead on Guantanamo.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure which [way] we'll go,\" Rep.
