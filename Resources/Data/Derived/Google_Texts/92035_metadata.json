Getty Images/ Alexander Koerner\n\nCan selfies give you lice ? That\u2019s how some experts are explaining a recent surge in lice among teens.\n\nPediatricians have been scratching their heads and wondering what the cause may be, since lice doesn\u2019t typically affect teens. These tiny, little white parasites are more often contracted by young kids at school or summer camp. So how has the tiny pest become rampant in high schools? Dr. Sharon Rink, a pediatrician based in Wisconsin, believes she has the answer: social media.\n\n\u201cTeenagers don\u2019t usually get lice because they\u2019re not sharing hats and things like that,\u201d she told ABC affiliate WBAY. \u201cAnd lice can\u2019t jump, so the only way they can transmit lice is touching their heads together, and that\u2019s happening with all these photos.\u201d That\u2019s right, teens are allegedly getting lice thanks to selfies.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most common way to get lice is through \u201chead-to-head contact.\u201d Teens who are taking selfies are usually pressing their heads together in order to fit in the frame and take the ideal photo. In doing so, those who unknowingly have lice could possibly be giving it to their friends when they are in such close proximity for their prized Instagram photo. Or at least that\u2019s the idea.\n\n\u201cPeople are doing selfies like every day, as opposed to going to photo booths years and years ago,\u201d continued Rink. \u201cSo you\u2019re probably having much more contact with other people\u2019s heads.\u201d\n\nThe CDC also says that lice outbreaks are common; they estimate that up to 12 million people between the ages of 3 and 11 are infected each year. Children's caretakers are the second population most likely to contract lice, as they are in frequent contact with kids.\n\nThe CDC warns that children be wary of sleepovers and camping during a lice outbreak, but they do not say anything about refraining from selfies. But unlike Rink, Katie Shepherd, of the research and education nonprofit Shepherd Institute of Lice Solutions, told Yahoo! Parenting that selfies are likely not the culprit.\n\n\u201cLice can move 9 inches in a minute\u2019s time,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cKids curl up on couches together and sit head-to-head looking at videos on someone\u2019s phone. That\u2019s a lot more contact than you get taking a selfie.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time teens\u2019 social media habits have been linked to lice. Last year, The Huffington Post reported that the tiny parasites spreading among a group of teens were dubbed \u201csocial media lice,\u201d but that idea was also rejected.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s impossible for young people and adults to contract lice. Deborah Altschuler of the National Pediculosis Association said teenagers have the potential to get lice, especially when in college. \u201cWe've always heard of older kids getting it, particularly when there are younger siblings bringing it home or outbreaks in college dorms,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s not new and it's not alarming. It just happens.\u201d\n\nAnd while selfies may not be the cause of many itchy, adolescent scalps, it is still a good idea to refrain from as much head-to-head contact as possible. The CDC recommends those who have contracted lice treat the parasites with lotions and medicated shampoos.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "recent, outbreak, lice, among, teens, has, many, blaming, selfies", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Selfies are not to blame for the recent lice outbreak among teens, so we should probably stop saying it is.", "title": "Do Selfies Cause Lice?
