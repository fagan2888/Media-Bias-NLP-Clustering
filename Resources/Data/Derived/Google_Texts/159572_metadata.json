They continued:\n\nMADAME L\u2019AMIC: What are the boundaries of design? CHARLES EAMES: What are the boundaries of problems?\n\nThis Eamesian understanding of design as a solution rather than a luxury\u2014as something that\u2019s about industry as much as art\u2014encapsulates the unique philosophy and vast influence of Charles and Ray Eames, a husband-and-wife team whose lightness of touch and Californian joie de vivre infuses contemporary offices and homes. Would Ikea be the same without the Eameses? Would Apple? Their work is best remembered via the molded-plywood and leather lounge chair that bears the Eames name, but their vision of design as something that could get \u201cthe best to the greatest number of people for the least\u201d lives on in less tangible ways. The Eameses, above all else, helped democratize the genre.\n\nEames Office\n\nThe couple are currently the subject of a major retrospective at London\u2019s Barbican Center. The World of Charles and Ray Eames incorporates the breadth of their influence, opening with the plywood nose cone they designed for a military aircraft during World War Two, and recreating \u201cThink,\u201d a mid-1960s immersive installation made for the IBM Pavilion at the New York World\u2019s Fair that draws parallels between human brains and computers. Although the Eameses were practical about their work, they were idealistic about the coming information age, seeing the ability to rapidly communicate with others all over the world as a powerful force for global change. \u201cBeyond the age of information,\u201d Charles Eames said in 1971, \u201cis the age of choices.\u201d\n\nEames Office\n\nCharles and Ray Eames arrived in Los Angeles in 1941, a year after they met at the Cranbrook Academy of Art. Charles was married to his first wife, Catherine at the time, but Ray began assisting him and Eero Saarinen in their designs for the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s Organic Design in Home Furnishings Competition, and soon he divorced Catherine and married Ray. Their early years in California were spent trying to mass-produce the molded-plywood furniture Charles and Saarinen had pioneered, but they began shaping their designs to aid the war effort instead, making splints, stretchers, and airplane parts with their new technique. This shift said as much about the Eameses\u2019 philosophy regarding their work as it did their patriotism. \u201cDesign,\u201d Charles said, \u201caddresses itself to the need.\u201d\n\nEames Office\n\nThe two brought numerous skill sets to their work\u2014both had an interest in film (Charles subsidized their studio in the early days by painting sets for MGM), and Ray was a visual artist who designed textiles and sketched covers for the journal Arts & Architecture. After the war they returned to their commercial efforts, completing the Eames House in Los Angeles in 1949 as part of a Case Study program for Arts & Architecture. The house was intended as an experiment to realize the design of a house for a young married couple needing a place to live and work. Like so many of their designs it became inextricable from the couple themselves, who lived there until their deaths (Charles in 1978, Ray 10 years later).\n\nEames Office\n\nThe Barbican exhibition offers countless examples of the chairs for which the Eameses are best known, and which encapsulate their spirit of \u201cway-it-should-be-ness\u201d\u2014when an object, through hard work and meticulous process, is finally realized in the incarnation of its ideal state. More than artists, the couple considered themselves to be tradesmen and engineers, combining ingenuity and technological progress to produce playful, practical, reliable designs. Their tandem sling seating, first installed in Washington\u2019s Dulles Airport and Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare, is now mimicked in waiting rooms all over the world. The sleek curvature and durability of their chairs has made them a staple in offices and homes, although the current $5,000 price tag for an Eames lounge chair at Herman Miller rather belies the idea of producing low-cost, stylish furniture for the masses.\n\nEames Office\n\nBut it\u2019s impossible not to sense the Eamesian influence in low-cost, flat-packed furniture sold at Ikea, or Crate and Barrel, or Target. The way-it-should-be-ness of their chairs so infuses modern design that their own works have inspired countless contemporary imitators\u2014something Charles himself might have appreciated. \u201cTo be realistic,\u201d Charles Eames once said, \u201cone must always admit the influence of those who have gone before.\u201d\n\nTristan Fewings / Getty Images\n\nMuch of their impact is harder to trace: The designer Dieter Rams, whose work for Braun is unmistakably felt in the work of Apple\u2019s chief designer, Jonathan Ive, has credited them as an influence, and certainly Apple\u2019s synergy of form and function, lightness of spirit, and commitment to process borrows heavily from the Eamesian model. Their belief that everyday objects can both define and provide meaning makes them one of the most enduring creative forces of the 20th century. They predicted the future even if they couldn\u2019t describe it. \u201cWhat is the future of design?\u201d Madame L\u2019Amic asked Charles Eames at the end of their Q&A. His response: a montage of images featuring fruit, plants, and flowers, as if to point at how the encapsulation of function and beauty has really been all around us, all along.\n\nIn Photos: The Eameses' Influence", "article_metadata": {"description": "How two designers from the 20th century influenced and predicted the way people would live in the 21st", "author": "Sophie Gilbert", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "How two designers from the 20th century influenced and predicted the way people would live in the 21st", "title": "The Vision of Charles and Ray Eames", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/11/14._The_World_of_Charles_and_Ray_Eames._Charles_Eames_in_the_plywood_Lounge_and_Ottoman_1956._Eames_Office_LLC/facebook.jpg?1447429608", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/11/charles-and-ray-eames-beyond-the-chair/415764/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBeyond the age of information,\u201d Charles Eames said in 1971, \u201cis the age of choices.\u201dEames OfficeCharles and Ray Eames arrived in Los Angeles in 1941, a year after they met at the Cranbrook Academy of Art.\nCHARLES EAMES: What are the boundaries of problems?\n\u201cWhat is the future of design?\u201d Madame L\u2019Amic asked Charles Eames at the end of their Q&A.\nIn Photos: The Eameses' Influence\nLike so many of their designs it became inextricable from the couple themselves, who lived there until their deaths (Charles in 1978, Ray 10 years later)."}
