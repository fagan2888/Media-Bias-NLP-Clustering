It\u2019s coming together. And for me, it\u2019s really kind of relieving because \u2026 it\u2019s stuff people should have been seeing for a long time. And I can finally it get out there. I just want people to think.\u201d\n\nRich Weinstein, the private citizen uncovering the secrets behind the sneaky foundations of Obamacare that professionals can't or won't , warns that there is more to come. And it is not good.\n\n\u201cRich, what is coming next?\u201d Beck asked. \u201cWhat is the one thing that you would say, \u2018America, you need to know this\u2019?\u201d Weinstein said Americans need to know that even if they survived the first wave of the Obamacare rollout with their insurance intact, there are measures built into the legislation that won\u2019t come into effect for ten or twenty years, and employer-based insurance will be next. \u201cThe Cadillac tax, people think is just for the high-end insurance plans,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the way Dr. Gruber describes it on video, within a certain period of time, I don\u2019t know if he said 10 or 20 years, it\u2019s going to hit everybody, and it\u2019s targeted at the employer sponsored insurance.\u201d Weinstein said the coming wave of higher premiums and lost plans are structured in a way that you blame the \u201cevil insurance companies,\u201d in Gruber\u2019s words, not the government that forced them to implement the policies. The administration and Gruber will deny that they are out to change employer-based health insurance, Weinstein asserted. But he also cautioned that you cannot rely on what they say in speeches \u2014 you must also listen to what they are saying at the universities, at economic forums, and among themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s all out there,\u201d he said.\n\nYes it is. David Steinberg of PJ Media links to Watchdog.org for yet another video \u2013 we're up to number 5 \u2013 of Gruber knocking those questioning his brilliance in government-mandated and sponsored health care insurance.\n\nIn the 2011 video shot by TrueNorthReports.com and sent to Watchdog.org on Thursday, Gruber appears before the Vermont House Health Care Committee to present recommendations for a universal, publicly financed health care program. The recommendations were part of the 2011 \u201cHsiao Report\u201d submitted to the Legislature by economist William C. Hsiao and co-written by Gruber. As Gruber sits listening, the committee chair reads a comment from a Vermonter who expresses concern that the economist\u2019s plan might lead to \u201cballooning costs, increased taxes and bureaucratic outrages,\u201d among other things. After hearing the Vermonter\u2019s worries, Gruber responds, \u201cWas this written by my adolescent children by any chance?\u201d The remark was met with uproarious laughter. Contrary to Gruber\u2019s snarky insult, the comment was not written by an adolescent. \u201cIt was actually written by a former senior policy adviser in the White House who knew something about health care systems,\u201d said John McClaughry, a two-term Vermont state senator and adviser to President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. McClaughry, who wrote the comment in an op-ed weeks before the 2011 committee meeting, told Vermont Watchdog he did not know Gruber made the condescending insult. However, he was aware of other videos discovered this week in which Gruber boasted of writing deceptive policies to trick \u201cstupid\u201d American voters. \u201cNo one should trust this man. \u2026 Based on the rest of the stuff that\u2019s come out on the videos, nobody can trust this guy. He has no use for transparency, he thinks people are stupid, and he\u2019ll do anything to get this thing through and pocket his $400,000. That\u2019s not in the interest of the people of Vermont,\u201d McClaughry said.\n\nYep, \"it's all out there.\" And it is up to us to stop condemning the professionals, the watchdogs for not finding it, but rather to go out there and find it ourselves, utilizing new technology, and publicize it wherever we can on all the social media. And then protest.\n\nThe MSM \u2013 \"Democratic operatives with bylines\" \u2013 aren't the news gatekeepers any longer. We are.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/11/private_obamacare_investigator_says_more_bad_news_coming.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Private Obamacare investigator says more bad news coming"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb21a\"", "article_summary": "The administration and Gruber will deny that they are out to change employer-based health insurance, Weinstein asserted.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of stuff that\u2019s coming out,\u201d Weinstein said.\nMcClaughry, who wrote the comment in an op-ed weeks before the 2011 committee meeting, told Vermont Watchdog he did not know Gruber made the condescending insult.\nI just want people to think.\u201dRich Weinstein, the private citizen uncovering the secrets behind the sneaky foundations of Obamacare that professionals can't or won't , warns that there is more to come.\nAnd for me, it\u2019s really kind of relieving because \u2026 it\u2019s stuff people should have been seeing for a long time."}
