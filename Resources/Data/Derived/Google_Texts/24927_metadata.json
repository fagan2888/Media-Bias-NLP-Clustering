Fourteen million Americans have found jobs since the Great Recession ended in June 2009, and economic output has risen consistently, if modestly, since then.\n\nBut how have Obama\u2019s signature policies affected the economy? From healthcare to financial reform, Republicans have endeavored to block virtually every policy Obama has put forward, often arguing that the economic impacts would be detrimental.\n\nAccordingly, the bulk of the president\u2019s policies \u2014 including the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill \u2014 occurred during his first term, before the Republicans took control of Congress. Yet it is still possible to trace the economic impact these policies have had.\n\nPhoto: Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images\n\nHere are three of Obama\u2019s landmark policies and how they affected the economy.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nStimulus and Austerity\n\nObama came to office in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression. Hundreds of thousands of Americans were losing employment every month, and the economy was in freefall.\n\nIn 2008, the Bush administration passed an economic stimulus bill the outgoing president called a \u201cbooster shot\u201d for the economy. But when Obama took office, he ordered a broader stimulus program of tax cuts, benefits extensions and government investments intended to stave off economic doom, which was signed in 2009.\n\nMany economists today say the bill helped reduce unemployment and lift the sinking economy. In 2014, the University of Chicago reported that 82 percent of leading economists surveyed agreed that Obama\u2019s stimulus reduced the unemployment rate. Only 2 percent disagreed.\n\nStimulus \u201cgreatly reduced the severity of the recession compared to what would have been the case in the absence of fiscal policy,\u201d said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies for the Brookings Institution.\n\nBut the expansion of federal spending was soon reversed. Newly elected Republicans in Congress sparred to the point of government shutdown over the growing national debt, eventually leading to sequestration, which forced the federal government to essentially cut tens of billions of dollars in planned spending.\n\nSuch a turnaround in post-recession spending was unprecedented in the modern era. In the three previous recessions, government spending continued to provide demand in the economy well after the downturn had passed. That was not the case after 2011.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has labeled government fiscal policy \u2014 namely sequestration \u2014 as a \u201cheadwind\u201d that kept the economy back after 2011. Compared to previous recoveries, gross domestic product growth has been muted, growing at roughly 2 percent a year compared to 3 percent over the 20 years before the recession.\n\n\u201cAt the federal level, the fiscal stimulus of 2008 and 2009 supported economic output, but the effects of that stimulus faded,\u201d Yellen said in a speech last year. \u201cBy 2011, federal fiscal policy actions became a drag on output growth when the recovery was still weak.\u201d\n\nBurtless agrees: \u201cThings would have improved much faster had we had more expansionary fiscal policy,\u201d he said. Government investments in roads, bridges, schools and other projects were minimal. \u201cThe constraints on fiscal policy means the government has not contributed as much to the economy as much as it could have,\u201d Burtless said.\n\nObamacare\n\nPolitically, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was a tipping point for the Obama administration, and it remains the policy the president says he\u2019s most proud of.\n\nEconomically, the results are less certain.\n\nWhat is clear: Far fewer Americans are uninsured today than before Obamacare passed, mandating that all working adults secure some form of health insurance. A study by the Centers for Disease Control found that the rate of uninsured has dropped from 15.7 percent before the ACA passed to 9.2 percent in 2015.\n\nThe economic knock-on effects have been varied. A recent analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found that repealing the bill would cost the federal government more than $100 billion over a decade. But repeal would also increase economic output by 0.7 percent, the CBO found, as Americans without healthcare subsidies worked more hours to pay for growing healthcare costs.\n\nAnother of the bill\u2019s central objectives \u2014 reducing healthcare spending \u2014 has also found apparent success, though not so clearly as in the uninsured numbers. After around a five years of declining year-over-year growth in federal spending on healthcare, the years after the passage of Obamacare saw healthcare expenditures grow around 4 percent annually, increasing to 5.3 percent in 2014 \u2014 largely the result of increased prescription drug costs.\n\nThe bill\u2019s detractors warned that the ACA might create unintended consequences. A requirement that employees who work more than 30 hours week be covered by their employers, critics said, might lead businesses to cut hours or hire more part-timers.\n\nFederal jobs data, however, show no increase in part-time employment. In fact, the spike in part-time workers that occurred between 2008 and 2010 has begun to recede ahead of the rule's phase-in during 2015 and 2016. \u201cThe evil expected or predicted effects have not materialized in the job market,\u201d Burtless said.\n\nFinancial Reform\n\nThe third of Obama\u2019s major policies did not aim explicitly to expand the economy. In fact, its intent was to rein in a major industry, one that had grown enormously in the preceding decades: finance.\n\nThe 2010 Dodd-Frank Act was crafted to reduce the risks posed to the economy by Wall Street, whose spectacular implosion in 2007-2008 precipitated the Great Recession. The sprawling bill forced banks to increase their financial cushions, retreat from riskier lines of business, deal more carefully with exotic financial products and open more of their business up to regulators.\n\nThe impact on the largest American banks has been clear. Revenues for the top five lenders \u2014 JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs \u2014 have dropped on average since 2010, in large part due to prohibitions on profitable, though risky, trading activities.\n\nBank of America has cut thousands of jobs since 2011, on a path to trim payrolls by 30,000 employees. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who estimated the cost of Dodd-Frank to his bank to be as high as $600 million annually, has said banks were \u201cunder assault\u201d from regulators.\n\nDespite shedding jobs, however, Wall Street has kept its employees well-paid. In 2014, the average salary, including bonuses, topped $400,000 \u2014 a new record in the industry.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "state of the union 2016: a closer look at obama\u2019s economy, state of the union, obama state of the union, obama economy, obama jobs, obama jobs economy, obama wages, wages economy, obama income inequality, economic recovery, how many jobs has obama added?", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "From the Affordable Care Act to Dodd-Frank financial reforms, here\u2019s how the president\u2019s landmark policies have affected the U.S. economy.", "title": "State Of The Union 2016: A Closer Look At Obama\u2019s Economy", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/state-union-2016-closer-look-obamas-economy-2262164", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/01/12/abill1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From the Affordable Care Act to Dodd-Frank financial reforms, here\u2019s how the president\u2019s landmark policies have affected the U.S. economy.", "title": "State Of The Union 2016: A Closer Look At Obama\u2019s Economy", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/state-union-2016-closer-look-obamas-economy-2262164", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/01/12/abill1.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/01/12/abill1.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2016-01-12T17:32:34-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-12T23:27:52-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "From the Affordable Care Act to Dodd-Frank financial reforms, here\u2019s how the president\u2019s landmark policies have affected the U.S. economy."}, "article_summary": "In 2008, the Bush administration passed an economic stimulus bill the outgoing president called a \u201cbooster shot\u201d for the economy.\n\u201cBy 2011, federal fiscal policy actions became a drag on output growth when the recovery was still weak.\u201dBurtless agrees: \u201cThings would have improved much faster had we had more expansionary fiscal policy,\u201d he said.\nPhoto: Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty ImagesHere are three of Obama\u2019s landmark policies and how they affected the economy.\nFederal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has labeled government fiscal policy \u2014 namely sequestration \u2014 as a \u201cheadwind\u201d that kept the economy back after 2011.\n\u201cThe constraints on fiscal policy means the government has not contributed as much to the economy as much as it could have,\u201d Burtless said."}
