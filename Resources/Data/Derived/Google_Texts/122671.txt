Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. will visit Japan in July at the invitation of his counterpart Chief Justice Itsuro Terada, the courts announced today.

Roberts will give a lecture at the University of Tokyo and teach a class at Kyoto University, the court said.

Supreme Court justices traditionally disperse around the world when their work is done at the end of June, usually for paid teaching gigs at overseas programs sponsored by American law schools. Roberts has done a number of those.

The end of the current term is expected to be an especially important — and likely contentious — one. The court has important cases on the Affordable Care Act and whether gay couples have a constitutional right to marry. The justices have joked in the past that it is sometimes good for their working relationships that they separate once divisive issues are settled.

After Roberts cast the deciding vote in 2012 to uphold the constitutionality of Obamacare, he noted that he was leaving to lecture in Malta.

“An impregnable island fortress,” Roberts told a conference of judges and lawyers just after the decision. “It seemed like a good idea.”
