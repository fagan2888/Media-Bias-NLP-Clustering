Escaped murderer David Sweat has been shot and is in custody, multiple law enforcement sources briefed on the investigation told CNN on Sunday.

He was taken into custody close to the Canadian border in New York, they said. The New York State Police department is the agency that encountered Sweat, a source briefed on his arrest said.

One law enforcement source said that Sweat was being taken to a hospital. His condition was not immediately clear. Nor was it clear exactly how he was caught.

The arrest wraps up a more than three-week hunt for Sweat and his prison-break partner, Richard Matt. Matt was shot dead Friday.

Sweat was imprisoned at the Clinton Correctional Facility for shooting dead an officer who pursued him after a robbery he committed.

Behind bars, Sweat and Matt cozied up to a prison tailor and a guard who allegedly brought them tools, which they used to cut their way through a labyrinth of multiple barriers and underground passageways. They emerged to freedom through a manhole in the middle of a street.

Guards discovered them missing on June 6, during a routine bed check.

Law enforcement experts stressed Sunday that it's crucial Sweat survive so that officials can learn exactly how he and Matt escaped, and who helped them.

"I'm sure he's getting critical care very rapidly," former Navy SEAL Jonathan Gilliam told CNN as the news of Sweat's shooting broke.
