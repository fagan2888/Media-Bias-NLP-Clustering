The Eagles finished the season 24-2. ( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nDENVER \u2014 For each and every blow the Eagles absorbed, the No. 1 team in the state was able to deliver one back.\n\nUntil the last one.\n\nFor that \u2014 Ghassan Nehme's 3-pointer that was accompanied by a trip to the free-throw line \u2014 Thompson Valley couldn't come up with the right counter. A turnover didn't help, especially when it gave Cheyenne Mountain two more free throws, and a last shot didn't deliver a good look, with Kevin Laws' final attempt an off-balance desperation shot that actually came inside the arc.\n\nThe 84-81 double-overtime loss was just the second of the season for the Eagles, but it also ended their campaign at 25-2, two steps short of what a senior-heavy roster had sought.\n\nThompson Valley senior Grant Rohrbouck (5) makes a shot to tie the score and force a second overtime. (Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\n\"There's no easy way around it,\" TVHS coach Josh Robinson said. \"In a situation like this, there's always a winner and a loser and unfortunately we were on the short end of the stick.\n\n\"We had an opportunity to get it done, and that's all I ask for them. We had our chances.\"\n\nWith an extra 8 minutes of play, there were 18 lead changes between the teams and 10 other times the game was tied. Thompson Valley played the final 9:30 with leading scorer Collin Smith on the bench with five fouls, and the final 10:05 without Estevan Garcia, one of the team's best defenders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, they were game for the chase. Down 58-54 with 50.1 seconds remaining in regulation, the Eagles found a way for force overtime as Mike Olivas, who would foul out in last overtime on the game's crucial play, hit two free throws with 26 seconds remaining. And Grant Rohrbouck, who led the team with 26 points, hit the layup with a just more than 2 seconds on the clock to force a second overtime.\n\nBut for the most part, the Eagles couldn't find an answer for Nehme, who scored 41 points in the game for the Indians (21-5), putting on a display with a 17-point third frame.\n\n\"He's probably the best player in 4A,\" Rohrbouck said. \"I have so much respect for his game.\"\n\nNehme was mostly quiet after the third, the result of Thompson Valley pushing him out further with it's man-to-man defense. That just opened up things for Christian Nehme, who scored 20 points for the Indians, 15 coming after halftime. But when his team was down 81-78 and time running out, Ghassan was the guy who needed to take the shot.\n\nAnd the Eagles gave him two looks. His first missed, but the offensive rebound gave him a second chance and Olivas was whistled for the foul after the ball left his hand.\n\nIt's one of the rarest of plays, but at that point, Nehme said all things should be considered.\n\n\"At that time, with this ... Two overtimes, you never know what's going to happen,\" he said. \"We were blessed and able to pull this one out, and we'll see you guys next week. You can never be stunned. You always have to be calm. That's why we play this game.\"\n\nNehme took 29 shots, hitting 12, including 7-of-14 from 3-point land, many of them deeper than required.\n\nWith the Eagles up 33-25 early in the third, Nehme went on a run, scoring 10 straight points and 13 of 15 for his team as the Indians took the lead at 40-36. And he wasn't done yet, hitting another 3 before the frame expired.\n\nHe added 10 more on the free-throw line, but the Indians also kept the door open for the Eagles there, making just 23-of-35 in the contest while the Eagles hit 22-of-23.\n\nCheyenne Mountain's Ghassan Nehme (23) puts up a shot in front of Thompson Valley's Taylor Mickelson (14) and Austin Dyer. Ghassan scored 41 points to lead the Indians to the double-overtime win. (Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nSmith had scored 17 points and grabbed 10 rebounds before exiting the game, and the Eagles needed to find other contributors. Enter sophomore Jake Hornick, who scored seven points in the final three frames to help keep his team in contention. He was good, and so was Laws, who scored nine and was perfect in four free-throw attempts. Austin Dyer scored 12 for the Eagles with nine rebounds.\n\n\"It was a very wild one, that's for sure,\" said Hornick, who finished with 12 points. \"I just wish it would have gone down different. You've just got to take it possession by possession. You can never predict what's going to happen and what's not, you've just got to be ready for anything that's thrown at you.\"\n\nBut in the final two possessions, with a chance to flip the lead one last time in their favor, the Eagles couldn't find the crisp pass or the clean look. And with that, a fantastic run for eight seniors left all of them in tears after the game and their coach a bit bewildered, but complimentary toward the opponent.\n\n\"They had guys come in and make big baskets for them; they really did when they needed it,\" Robinson said. \"Nehme had a fantastic game for them. We just couldn't quite get over the hump in the second half. I thought we had an opportunity there at the start of the third quarter, and our decision making went down a little bit.\"\n\nIt was two hours where just about any and every scenario came into play, making the unexpected commonplace.\n\nAll except for the final result.\n\n\"It's makes it heartbreaking,\" Rohrbouck said. \"I didn't expect any of this. I expected ... I don't really know. I expected Ghassan to have his game, but for our kids to have our game.\"\n\nContact Sports Editor Mike Brohard at 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/rhpreps\n\n4A State Tournament\n\nIndians 84, Eagles 81, 2 OT\n\nAt Denver Coliseum\n\nCHEYENNE MOUNTAIN (21-5)\n\nChristian Nehme 5 9-11 20, Christopher Garcia 2 0-0 6, ryan Ruppert 2 0-1 4, Cody McCurry 2 0-0 6, Ghassan Nehme 12 10-15 41, Nathan Resty 1 1-2 4, Reece Eddy 0 3-6 3, Benjamin Webster 0 0-0 0.
