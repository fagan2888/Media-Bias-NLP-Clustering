The problem is that he\u2019s planned a new residency only thirty minutes away in our nation\u2019s capital.\n\nWith Hillary on a downward spiral and the fact that many American women vote for the best looking candidate with no other considerations, conservatives have much to be frightened about. I realize that this is a blanket statement, however, there are few articles written by female journalists about O\u2019Malley that do not mention his good looks, at least once. This could pose a problem for a Republican candidate (less Ben Carson, another attractive Marylander- but well versed on Martin\u2019s follies) who may have to debate O\u2019Malley live. Remember the Kennedy vs. Nixon debate that helped turn the tide blue? I predict this could occur again with O\u2019Malley vs. any tired crusty republican that\u2019s been around too long.\n\nO\u2019Malley has the same, if not more charisma than our current president. And unlike Obama, who will curtly dismiss conservatives (and Bibi) without batting an eyelash, O\u2019Malley is entirely consumed with his own self-concept. He manages to gore even the middle class, all the while smiling, evoking saint-like devotion from the masses. O\u2019Malley is a sly operator: bewitching blue-dogs, centrist Dems, and unfortified conservatives with little effort. His success record, envied by liberal politicians everywhere.\n\nSo, in honor of O\u2019Malley\u2019s standing ovation in South Carolina on March 10th, I offer you twenty sobering reasons why O\u2019Malley may even be worse than Obama.\n\n1. The Flush Tax. Yes, it is exactly what it sounds like.\n\n2. The Rain Tax\u2026Because if you have a big house then it is absolutely your fault when a blue crab dies.\n\n3. The Gas Tax- Because having a job and driving there should cost more\u2026$.44 per gallon at tax fruition.\n\n4. New service fees on fledgling businesses such as tanning beds, gyms, nails, and even dating services. Because Martin wants to be prettier than you are and will tax you otherwise.\n\n5. Liquor Tax (10%) and additional Tobacco taxes and fees.\n\n6. His state pension \u201creforms\u201d are great except for the fact that they are still grossly underfunded.\n\n7. Energy rates in Maryland through BGE increased 72% during his tenure\u2026which he promised to fight, but lost miserably.\n\n8. O\u2019Malley used capitol debt to cover spending vs. the general fund.\n\n9. In-state tuition and driver\u2019s licenses offered to illegals.\n\n10. Increased sales tax.\n\n11. His own Lt. Governor (Mini Me Brown) didn\u2019t (couldn\u2019t) succeed him.\n\n12. Raised more taxes than even the deep blue Maryland electorate could stomach.\n\n13. Inmates ran his prisons Martin\u2019s more Thug-erina than a Jay-Z /Obama love child.\n\n14. O\u2019Malley raised the corporate tax rate. Only four Fortune 500 companies remain in Maryland, while Virginia has 22, some of whom left Maryland. Not to mention an estimated 6,500 small firms that left Maryland under O\u2019Malley.\n\n15. He can\u2019t add or subtract. O\u2019Malley claims responsibility for \u201c700,000 Maryland citizens now having health care insurance for the first time\u201d. Unlikely, since less than a year ago only 60,000 had enrolled through the online state healthcare insurance exchange (Obamacare). What O\u2019Malley failed to cite was that 73,000 had lost their current insurance because of Obamacare. The math doesn\u2019t work.\n\n16. He posts personal correspondence on his Facebook page (see #20 that he penned for his daughter, then posted).\n\n17. Democrats are comparing him to Kennedy. How ironic (or moronic?) since O\u2019Malley\u2019s essentially a socialist.\n\n18. Martin would insist that his own band, O\u2019Malley\u2019s March, play live on election night.\n\n19. The only guns he likes are his own\u2026.\n\n20. He\u2019s a terrible poet.\n\n\u201cGive the world the best you have, and it may never be enough;\n\nGive the world the best you\u2019ve got anyway.\u201d -Martin O\u2019Malley\n\nForget the hanky, somebody pass me a bucket.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "20 Reasons Why Former Maryland Governor O\u2019Malley Could Be Worse than Obama | PJ Media", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "From an informed native Marylander.", "title": "20 Reasons Why Former Maryland Governor O\u2019Malley Could Be Worse than Obama", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/20-reasons-why-former-maryland-governor-omalley-could-be-worse-than-obama/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2015/03/Omalley.jpg", "updated_time": 1464253753, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From an informed native Marylander.", "title": "20 Reasons Why Former Maryland Governor O\u2019Malley Could Be Worse than Obama", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/20-reasons-why-former-maryland-governor-omalley-could-be-worse-than-obama/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2015/03/Omalley.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "20 Reasons Why Former Maryland Governor O\u2019Malley Could Be Worse than Obama | PJ Media", "pinterestDescription": "20 Reasons Why Former Maryland Governor O\u2019Malley Could Be Worse than Obama", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9beb\"", "article_summary": "20 Reasons Why Former Maryland Governor O\u2019Malley Could Be Worse than Obama20 Reasons Why Former Maryland Governor O\u2019Malley Could Be Worse than ObamaMartin O\u2019 Malley has finally left the building--the governor\u2019s mansion that is, in Annapolis.\nOnly four Fortune 500 companies remain in Maryland, while Virginia has 22, some of whom left Maryland.\nI predict this could occur again with O\u2019Malley vs. any tired crusty republican that\u2019s been around too long.\nNot to mention an estimated 6,500 small firms that left Maryland under O\u2019Malley.\nSo, in honor of O\u2019Malley\u2019s standing ovation in South Carolina on March 10th, I offer you twenty sobering reasons why O\u2019Malley may even be worse than Obama."}
