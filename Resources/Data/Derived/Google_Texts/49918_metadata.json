School administrators in Texas were concerned it looked like a bomb, suspended the 14-year-old, but not after police placed him in handcuffs. It inevitably sparked controversy, where racism, Islamophobia, and profiling were drawn into this media firestorm. The White House has extended Ahmed an invitation over this matter. Attorneys are now fighting the school to get the clock back.\n\nSo, is this a serious case of anti-Muslim discrimination, or does this clock bring genuine concerns to the general public? It\u2019s probably the latter. Now, what about college students? They\u2019re young, liberal, and live in an environment where speech codes, safe spaces, and microaggressions would make them side with Ahmed, right?\n\nMRCTV\u2019s Dan Joseph ventured onto the hallowed ground of George Mason University and showed students a picture of the clock in question. Most students interviewed said it looked like a bomb.\n\n\u201cIt looks like a bomb,\u201d said one student caught by Joseph on the campus\u2019 free speech zone. His buddy agreed with him. Upon seeing the photo, one female student knew about the story, saying, \u201cit\u2019s the clock, but it looks like a bomb.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would probably assume that it looks something, like, that might explode,\u201d said another. One female interview said the photo looked like a lie detector test.\n\nJoseph then asked students if the picture looks like a clock to them?\n\n\u201cIt does not,\u201d said yet another student agreeing that this clock eerily resembles a bomb.\n\nWhen asked what they would do if they saw this in, say, a classroom, students said they were \u201cvery concerned.\u201d One said she \u201cwould probably report it if she had the chance.\u201d Another one said she would call the police.\n\nDan added, \u201cWhat kind of clock comes in a suitcase?\u201d\n\nRegardless, students at George Mason, overall, thought Ahmed\u2019s clock looked liked a bomb, it freaked everyone out, and they would call the police.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"It looks like a bomb\".05/26/2016 18:52:16PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"It looks like a bomb\"", "title": "Matt Vespa - Students on Ahmed's Clock: Dude, That Looks Like A Bomb", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/24/students-on-ahmeds-clock-dude-that-looks-like-a-bomb-n2056538", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/9/24/11.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"It looks like a bomb\"", "title": "Matt Vespa - Students on Ahmed's Clock: Dude, That Looks Like A Bomb", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/24/students-on-ahmeds-clock-dude-that-looks-like-a-bomb-n2056538", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/9/24/11.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Students on Ahmed's Clock: Dude, That Looks Like A Bomb, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Dan added, \u201cWhat kind of clock comes in a suitcase?\u201dRegardless, students at George Mason, overall, thought Ahmed\u2019s clock looked liked a bomb, it freaked everyone out, and they would call the police.\nJoseph then asked students if the picture looks like a clock to them?\n\u201cIt looks like a bomb,\u201d said one student caught by Joseph on the campus\u2019 free speech zone.\nSchool administrators in Texas were concerned it looked like a bomb, suspended the 14-year-old, but not after police placed him in handcuffs.\nMRCTV\u2019s Dan Joseph ventured onto the hallowed ground of George Mason University and showed students a picture of the clock in question."}
