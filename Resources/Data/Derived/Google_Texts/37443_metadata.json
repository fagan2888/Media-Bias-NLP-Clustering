Photo: Claudio Papapietro for The Wall Street Journal\n\nNicky Siano knows a good throbbing bass tone when he hears one. The DJ and party impresario has been behind the controls of some serious sound systems, running the music at Studio 54 and other legendary New York disco hot spots during their thumping, bumping 1970s heyday.\n\nThis New Year\u2019s Eve he will preside over an all-night disco-homage dance party in a setting with one of the best, and perhaps least-known, sound systems in New York City: a historic bumper-car ride in Coney Island.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really legendary, and they\u2019re nowhere else,\u201d Mr. Siano said of the four big speaker cabinets looming at the edge of the bumper-car track at Eldorado Auto Skooter, home to laser-lit bumper cars and an arcade filled with Skee-Ball and assorted carnival games.\n\nBuilt on location after the ride opened in 1973, the vintage, state-of-the-art system was created and installed by Richard Long, renowned in the \u201970s and \u201980s as the premier sound designer for some of the era\u2019s most popular nightclubs, including Studio 54, Paradise Garage, Club Zanzibar and the Palladium. He went on to design sound for clubs internationally before succumbing in 1986 to AIDS.\n\nScott Fitlin, operator of the family-owned bumper-car business then, was an audio aficionado and devoted disco fan, so he contracted Mr. Long to make the ride sound not just loud, but also discerning and highly refined.\n\n\u201cOur sound is extremely powerful yet very easy to listen to, it doesn\u2019t hurt the ear,\u201d he told the carnival blog Amusing the Zillion shortly before his death in 2010. \u201cOur bass is tremendous, and I play dance music, the sound that has energy and life.\u201d\n\nMr. Long\u2019s system at Eldorado, a rare relic from that era, features special \u201cJ-horn\u201d speakers, known for the way they curve at the bottom, sending sound through a scoop to rise up from the floor. The speakers are esteemed among connoisseurs of bass for their unusual range of sounds, with tones as low as 24 hertz. The threshold for human hearing generally stops at 20.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to hear\u2014you more feel the air moving,\u201d said Dan Prosseda, owner of Sound Control, an acoustical-consulting firm and operator of sound for other Coney Island rides such as the Polar Express.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t bother coming down this low,\u201d Mr. Siano said of most speakers these days, which tend toward tones measuring 50 hertz and above. \u201cBut there\u2019s sound out there, and it makes a difference.\u201d\n\nAnother component designed by Mr. Long was a bank of tweeter arrays hung from the ceiling, little silver speakers that emphasize the high-end sounds of drum cymbals splashing and clasping shut.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hear that anymore,\u201d Mr. Siano said of the hypnotic tszt-tszt-tszt effect when the sound system is cranked up in full.\n\nFor the New Year\u2019s party, which is open to the public, Mr. Siano will resume a role he has played in the New York nightlife scene since the early \u201970s, when he helped turn an underground dance movement based in tiny lofts and clubs into a global phenomenon.\n\nThe event follows another that Mr. Siano threw for his 60th birthday this summer, for 600 revelers who danced\u2014directly on the track with the bumper cars pulled off to the side\u2014to classics from a time before disco became vilified.\n\n\u201cThe term is often associated with a lot of cheesy records that came out en masse because record companies just wanted to make money off the disco experience,\u201d Mr. Siano said.\n\nHis specialty as a DJ, which he developed at his own storied proto-disco club the Gallery beginning in 1973, remains soaring R&B and soulful funk records of a sort that seeded disco from the start.\n\nSome songs\u2014such as \u201cLove Is the Message\u201d by MFSB and \u201cArmed and Extremely Dangerous\u201d by First Choice\u2014became anthems both downtown and at glitzy uptown clubs like Studio 54, where flair and showmanship ruled.\n\nRochelle Fleming, founder of First Choice and a solo singer set to perform at the party on New Year\u2019s Eve, remembered a night at Studio 54 during disco\u2019s heyday. In tribute to an equestrian theme on her group\u2019s then-current album sleeve, she said, a local radio personality rode into the club on a white horse.\n\n\u201cHe came in after we performed and it blew everybody\u2019s mind,\u201d Ms. Fleming said.\n\nFor those like Gordon Lee, owner of the bumper-car ride since taking it over from the Fitlin family, the setting for the New Year\u2019s party will likely channel some of the spirit of such storied party nights of yore.\n\n\u201cThe Eldorado at one point,\u201d he said, \u201cwas the disco palace of Coney Island.\u201d", "article_metadata":
