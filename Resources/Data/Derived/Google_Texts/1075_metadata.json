Ms. Milas, 23, was working as a swim instructor for the summer and had swum into the side of the pool, breaking three teeth.\n\nShaken, she accepted the ambulance ride to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, Calif. The paramedics applied a neck brace as a precaution.\n\nA week later she received a bill for the 15-minute trip: $1,772.42. Though her employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation will cover the bill, she still was stunned at the charge. \u201cWe only drove nine miles and it was a non-life-threatening injury,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cI needed absolutely no emergency treatment.\u201d\n\nThirty years ago ambulance rides were generally provided free of charge, underwritten by taxpayers as a municipal service or provided by volunteers. Today, like the rest of the health care system in the United States, most ambulance services operate as businesses and contribute to America\u2019s escalating medical bills. Often, they are a high-cost prequel to expensive emergency room visits.\n\nAlthough ambulances are often requested by a bystander or summoned by 911 dispatchers, they are almost always billed to the patient involved. And the charges, as well as insurance coverage, range widely, from zero to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere are a significant numbers of patients who have no coverage for this, and the number of self-pay patients has climbed\u201d since the recession, said Jay Fitch, president of Fitch and Associates, the largest emergency medical services consulting firm in the United States.\n\nWhat is more, since ambulances companies typically collect only 30 to 40 percent of the amount they bill, they often try to charge more for patients with insurance and those who can pay, Mr. Fitch said.\n\nPhoto\n\nPart of the inconsistency in pricing stems from the fact that ambulance services are variously run by fire departments, hospitals, private companies and volunteer groups. Some services are included in insurance networks, others not.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a saying that if you\u2019ve seen one emergency medical system, you\u2019ve seen one emergency medical system \u2014 no two are alike,\u201d said Dr. Robert E. O\u2019Connor, a vice president of the American College of Emergency Medicine and chairman of the department at the University of Virginia. Charges and payments, he said, \u201care all over the place.\u201d Fire departments, which don\u2019t charge for driving to fire alarms, do charge for ambulance runs.\n\nIn such a fragmented system, it is hard to know how much high-priced ambulance transport contributes nationally to America\u2019s $2.7 trillion health care bill. And total out-of-pocket expenditures by individuals are hard to tally.\n\nBut Medicare, the insurance program for the elderly, does tabulate its numbers and has become alarmed at its fast-rising expenditures for ambulance rides: nearly $6 billion a year, up from just $2 billion in 2002.\n\nThat is true even though Medicare\u2019s fixed payments for ambulance rides \u2014 ranging from $289 to $481 in 2011 \u2014 are far lower than commercial rates. Ambulance companies complain that Medicare rates do not meet the costs of running what are essentially mobile emergency rooms staffed by highly trained professionals.\n\nIn a recent study, the federal Health and Human Services Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General noted that the Medicare ambulance services were \u201cvulnerable to abuse and fraud,\u201d in part because there were lax standards on when an ambulance was needed and how the trip should be billed. The number of transports paid for by Medicare increased 69 percent between 2002 and 2011, while the number of Medicare patients increased only 7 percent during that period. In the last year, two ambulance companies have pleaded guilty or settled claims for overbilling Medicare.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires policies to include some coverage for emergency care as an essential benefit, including ambulance transport. But the ambulance ride and the care are billed separately. Many Silver plans \u2014 a lower-tier plan \u2014 require patients to pay an initial copay of $250 for the emergency room and $250 more for the transport, for example.\n\nPhoto\n\nEvery insurance plan evaluates ambulance rides differently for coverage, with many seeking to determine if the service was really needed \u2014 a true \u201cemergency.\u201d\n\nThat determination can be highly subjective. Some will grant coverage if the destination was an emergency room, regardless of the patient\u2019s status, but others may require admittance to the hospital as evidence that the condition was serious. \u201cInsurers will generally cover if you had good reason to believe there was a serious threat to your life or health,\u201d said Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group.\n\nBut when an ambulance arrives, sick patients or injured people like Ms. Milas, often feel they have little choice but to get in, unaware of the potential price tag.\n\nIf an emergency call comes to 911, dispatchers decide which ambulance to send, depending on proximity. Most ambulance companies bill according to the level of skill of the team on board, rather than the medical needs of the patients they collect. A team capable of administering Advanced Cardiac Life Support costs more than one with only basic first aid training.\n\nDistance rarely counts for much, although a small mileage charge is added to the fee. Some companies even charge hundreds of dollars extra if a friend or relative rides along with an injured patients.\n\nThis fall, Joanne Freedman went to an urgent care center near her home in New York City with a bad headache and a fever. The doctor recommended she go to a hospital for further evaluation and offered to call an ambulance.\n\n\u201cI could have walked, but I\u2019m feeling crummy so I think, ' OK, why not?\u2019 \u201d she recalled.\n\nThe two-block ride was billed at $900, and she has not yet learned what her insurer may ask her to pay.\n\n\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cAll they did was put a paper mask on me so I wouldn\u2019t infect anyone else.\u201d Ms. Freedman had a spinal tap at the hospital and was admitted for a few days. Nonetheless, she said, for $900, the next time, no matter how ill she will walk up the hill or take a cab.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131204115322, "twitter": {"description": "Ambulances, once free, are now generally run as businesses that contribute to America\u2019s escalating medical bills.", "title": "Think the E.R.
