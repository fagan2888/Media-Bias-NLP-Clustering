The noted atheist drew ire on Wednesday after he announced that it would be \u201cimmoral\u201d for a pregnant woman not to abort a fetus if she discovered that it had Down syndrome \u2014 ignoring the fact that when women have the right to choose an abortion, they also have the right not to choose an abortion.\n\nDuring a discussion with followers over the recent case of a suicidal woman in Ireland who was denied an abortion and forced to undergo a C-section at 25 weeks, Dawkins noted that \u201cscreening [for fetal abnormalities] offers a humane moral choice.\u201d But instead of leaving it at that, Dawkins also suggested that only one choice a woman could make in response to a Down syndrome diagnosis would be morally just:\n\n@InYourFaceNYer Abort it and try again. It would be immoral to bring it into the world if you have the choice. \u2014 Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) August 20, 2014\n\nDawkins went on to say that he \u201cOBVIOUSLY wouldn\u2019t TELL a woman what to do\u201d (emphasis original), because women\u2019s reproductive decisions should be up to women:\n\nWomen have a right to early abortion. Choice is theirs. Down Syndrome is 1 of the commonest & most moral reasons to exercise that right. \u2014 Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) August 21, 2014\n\nDawkins is right about one thing: Women do have a right to early abortion and the choice is theirs. But there is no such thing as a \u201cmost moral reason\u201d to have an abortion. The reasons that women choose to have abortions are varied and personal, as are the reasons women choose to carry pregnancies to term. Choice is responsive to individual needs, beliefs and circumstances. No woman should be attacked for the reproductive rights she chooses to exercise \u2014 whether it\u2019s the right to have an abortion, or the right not to.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The atheist thinker misconstrues the meaning of reproductive choice", "title": "Richard Dawkins: It would be \u201cimmoral\u201d not to abort a fetus with Down syndrome", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The atheist thinker misconstrues the meaning of reproductive choice", "title": "Richard Dawkins: It would be \u201cimmoral\u201d not to abort a fetus with Down syndrome", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/21/richard_dawkins_it_would_be_immoral_not_to_abort_a_fetus_with_down_syndrome/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/richard_dawkins3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The atheist thinker misconstrues the meaning of reproductive choice", "title": "Richard Dawkins: It would be \u201cimmoral\u201d not to abort a fetus with Down syndrome", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/richard_dawkins3.jpg", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenny Kutner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, down syndrome, fetal anomalies, fetal screening, morality, Pro-choice, Reproductive choice, reproductive health, Reproductive Rights, Richard Dawkins, twitter wars", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Abortion, down syndrome, fetal anomalies, fetal screening, morality, Pro-choice, Reproductive choice, reproductive health, Reproductive Rights, Richard Dawkins, twitter wars, Media News, Life News, NewsProminent evolutionary theorist Richard Dawkins seems to be confused about choices.\nThe reasons that women choose to have abortions are varied and personal, as are the reasons women choose to carry pregnancies to term.\n\u2014 Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) August 21, 2014Dawkins is right about one thing: Women do have a right to early abortion and the choice is theirs.\nIt would be immoral to bring it into the world if you have the choice.\nDown Syndrome is 1 of the commonest & most moral reasons to exercise that right."}
