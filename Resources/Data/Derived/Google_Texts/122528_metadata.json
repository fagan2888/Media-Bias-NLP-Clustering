Abraham Richardson and the 902nd built the first Ebola treatment unit, which opened on Dec. 21 in Buchanan, Liberia, in just 22 days, and 1st Sgt. Joseph Taylor of the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 36th Engineer Brigade, is the noncommissioned officer who leads the unit\u2019s mayor\u2019s cell.\n\nThe 36th, which is from Fort Hood, Texas, is tasked with building more Ebola treatment units, and Taylor\u2019s duties, as the head of the mayor\u2019s cell, include keeping things running smoothly.\n\n\u201cHis role is to provide everything we need on the base we are staying at, the National Police Training Center, which we share with the Liberian police,\u201d Capt. Eric Hudson, spokesman for the 36th, said Saturday by email from Paynesville, Liberia.\n\n\u201cWhen soldiers come here, the mayor\u2019s cell ensures those individuals are facilitated with lodging and safety,\u201d Taylor said in a story posted Saturday by Sgt. Ange Desinor of the 13th Public Affairs Detachment. \u201cThe welfare of soldiers and their safety is top priority.\u201d\n\nOperation United Assistance is a Department of Defense initiative in Liberia to provide logistics, training and engineering support to U.S. Agency for International Development-led efforts to contain the Ebola virus outbreak in western Africa, according to Desinor.\n\n\u201cWe are overseeing the building and sustainment of 10 Ebola treatment units,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cMost of them will be complete by the beginning of the year.\u201d\n\nThe first facility completed, named the Buchanan Ebola treatment unit, was handed over to the International Organization for Migration, which customized the facility for its needs before opening it to the public, Desinor said. The Buchanan Ebola treatment unit has 170 workers and 50 beds for patients. The engineering company received local support and equipment from the community to help build the treatment facility, Richardson said.\n\nIn addition to providing secure lodging and safety for the 36th, the mayor\u2019s cell also helps keep morale up by offering entertainment and enrichment programs, an air-conditioned gym with refreshments and a television, and a regular movie night, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cWe are here for the soldiers,\u201d Capt. Ashley Towns, the officer in charge of the mayor\u2019s cell, said. \u201cAll the things that happen throughout the day \u2014 whether it\u2019s a facility problem or cleanliness or security \u2014 you need the mayor\u2019s cell.\u201d\n\nSometimes, however, there is no easy fix to a problem, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite quotes is \u2018first-world problem in a third-world country,\u2019\u201d the Bingham native said. \u201cMeaning something that can be easily fixed back home is a tremendous event because of all the things you have to deal with to get it fixed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Mainer from Hartland, a platoon leader with the 902nd Engineer Company, helped build a 50-patient Ebola treatment unit in Liberia, and another from Bingham is the noncommissioned officer in charge of protection, lodging and logistics for the facility. 1st Lt.
