He met with members of Congress Wednesday in a closed-door meeting.\n\nKerry said the U.S. is prepared to increase the number of refugees it helps resettle. The U.S. currently has a worldwide quota of helping 70,000 people, but the Obama administration wants to help about 5,000 more refugees next year - Kerry said many of those would be from Syria.\n\nA local Mission organization has made the Middle Eastern refugee crisis a priority and sends in aid once a month; the president of the mission said the situation is one of the worst he\u2019s seen.\n\nWorld Compassion has been sending support to refugees for years and said, as the situation drags out, it makes things even direr for the people displaced from their homes.\n\nJason Law is the President of World Compassion - a Tulsa-based mission group that helps people in countries hostile towards Christians \u2013 and he\u2019s been helping people since before he can remember.\n\n\u201cIt's my family's ministry, so I've kind of grown up my whole life going to these,\" he said. \u201cBut I've been full time on staff with the organization for the last 12 years.\"\n\nHis most recent trip was a week in Iraq, helping with Syrian and Iraqi refugees.\n\nIt's a crisis at the forefront of the world stage, with more than 250,000 refugees in northern Iraq, and thousands flooding into Western Europe looking for asylum.\n\nWorld Compassion provides food, medical aid and relief once a month to at least 4,000 refugees.\n\nThey've been helping for two-and-a-half years in response to ISIS moving into Iraq and the Syrian civil war.\n\nLaw said, \"A lot of these people were doctors, lawyers, teachers, business owners, just like we were here in Tulsa. And their lives have been taken from them by militant groups and they have a burning desire to rebuild their families and educate their kids just like we do.\"\n\nOut of the thousands the mission helps, every refugee has a story.\n\n\"So, like, she has never been educated. If she's Syrian, she's been there for three years\u2026She's never been educated and her parents aren't thinking about putting her in school,\" Law said.\n\nHe said this is one of the worst humanitarian crises of our time, and one of the most lengthy and violent he has seen.\n\nLaw hopes, as the stories of the refugees continue to make international headlines, that more and more people are touched by the tragedy.\n\n\u201cI think we need to look inside of ourselves and say, \u2018OK, what would be required of me to reach them and help them?\u2019 Because if I was in that situation, what would I want people to do to me,\u201d he asked.\n\nTo learn more about World Compassion and their mission, you can visit their website.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A local Mission organization has made the Middle Eastern refugee crisis a priority and sends in aid once a month.", "author": "Erin Conrad", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/29994884/local-mission-stepping-up-to-help-middle-eastern-refugees", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8762535_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A local Mission organization has made the Middle Eastern refugee crisis a priority and sends in aid once a month.", "title": "Local Mission Stepping Up To Help Middle Eastern Refugees"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8762535_G.jpg", "description": "A local Mission organization has made the Middle Eastern refugee crisis a priority and sends in aid once a month.", "card": "summary", "title": "Local Mission Stepping Up To Help Middle Eastern Refugees"}, "wnreadableurl": "local-mission-stepping-up-to-help-middle-eastern-refugees", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/09/09", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS30", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc396\"", "article_summary": "Jason Law is the President of World Compassion, and he\u2019s been helping people since before he can remember.\nTo learn more about World Compassion and their mission, you can visit their website.\nWorld Compassion provides food, medical aid and relief once a month to at least 4,000 refugees.\nHis most recent trip was a week in Iraq, helping with Syrian and Iraqi refugees.\nWorld Compassion has been sending support to refugees for years and said, as the situation drags out, it makes things even direr for the people displaced from their homes."}
