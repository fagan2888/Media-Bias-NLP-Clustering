SOLANA BEACH, Calif. – President Barack Obama addressed the nation on his Affordable Care Act victory Tuesday and his first success story was about Sean Casey from Solana Beach.

After retiring as a software engineer, Casey spent roughly $32,000 on healthcare premiums because of his medical history. Casey said he was spending an estimated $2,600 each month for himself, his wife and two children.

“I won’t stand up and say [the Affordable Care Act] is a perfect law, but we needed something like it,” Casey said.

“This year, the Casey family’s premiums will fall from over $30,000 to under $9,000,” Obama said from the White House Rose Garden.

Casey was at the Vista Courthouse for jury duty when he received a voicemail from a White House representative informing him the President may use his story in his healthcare speech. In January of this year, Casey sent an e-mail to the White House, praising Obamacare for lowering his premiums.

“I said, ‘well somebody should say a good story [about Obamacare] because I consider it a good thing since it’s making a big difference for me,’” Casey said.

Casey originally thought the White House might use his e-mail as an example on the White House blog. So he had been checking until he got the voicemail Tuesday.

During his lunch break, he heard a portion of President Obama’s speech. “Well, when I heard my name, I said, ‘That’s me!’ There weren’t a whole lot of people in the jury room but they ignored me completely. So I got out my phone and started texting people saying the President just mentioned my name,” Casey said.

Casey’s friends and family have been contacting him since the speech, asking how the President got his name. Everyone, including his family were thrilled President Obama made an example out of them.

“It was kind of an interesting day. I’m not sure I want to have days like this every day,” Casey said.
