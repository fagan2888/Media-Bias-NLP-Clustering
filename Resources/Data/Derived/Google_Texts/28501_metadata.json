Businesses are leasing so much space that the county's biggest landlord is running out of offices to offer tenants.\n\n\u201cWe have customers that we can't accommodate, because we are so full,\u201d said Irvine Co. office executive Steven M. Case. \u201cThat is the premise of building this building.\u201d\n\nThe construction of 200 Spectrum Center, which will be the county's largest building, underscores a local economy that's finally revving into high gear, following a recession that decimated two of its leading industries: construction and the mortgage business. It took the state's third most populous county until March to regain all the jobs lost during the downturn.\n\nBut now, growth is outpacing many other areas. During the first half of the year, employment grew 3.3% compared with a year earlier, led by strong gains in the generally well-paying professional and business services sector, as well as healthcare and construction. Of the state's major job markets, only the Silicon Valley and the Inland Empire saw stronger growth.\n\nDon Bartletti / Los Angeles Times The Irvine Co.'s new 20-story glass and steel office building nears completion at 200 Spectrum Center Drive, Irvine.

(Don Bartletti / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe Affordable Care Act and an aging population are creating jobs in healthcare, while the national economic recovery is boosting demand for business services and local tourism, said Esmael Adibi, director of Chapman University's A. Gary Anderson Center for Economic Research.\n\nMeanwhile, real estate has turned from a drag into a positive, and overall job creation is gaining momentum.\n\n\u201cThe economy of Orange County is doing extremely well,\u201d Adibi said.\n\nOrange County's economy will continue to improve, given the area's potential, said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner at Beacon Economics.\n\n\u201cIt's a place that should be growing. It's a wealthy place. It's a highly educated place,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn't be surprised to see better numbers coming out of there the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nAmong the businesses expanding are Irvine direct lender Balboa Capital, which serves small businesses across the country.\n\nChief Executive Patrick Byrne said smaller firms are increasingly seeking loans as the economy improves, leading to a 77% jump in Balboa's business last quarter. To accommodate the surge, Balboa hired 155 employees in Irvine over the last year and nearly doubled the amount of square footage it has near John Wayne Airport.\n\n\u201cSmall businesses are doing better,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cWe are really busy.\u201d\n\nExpansions like Balboa's are transforming Orange County's office market into a top performer. So far this year, firms have absorbed more space than in the far larger Los Angeles County market, according to commercial real estate brokerage CBRE Group Inc.\n\nThe vacancy rate in Orange County stood at 9.2% during the second quarter, compared with 15.3% in Los Angeles County and 12.6% in San Diego County, according to CBRE.\n\nDemand is coming from multiple industries, making the area less reliant on real estate than it was during the housing bubble, said Kurt Strasmann, senior managing director of CBRE's\n\nOrange County region.\n\n\u201cIt's an amazingly diversified recovery,\u201d Strasmann said.\n\nTechnology is one of those sectors, he said.\n\nAcorns \u2014 a firm that enables consumers to invest small amounts through everyday debit and credit card transactions \u2014 launched its app about a year ago, then quickly outgrew its 10,000-square-foot office near John Wayne Airport. So in May it moved just down the road to a 33,000-square-foot space formerly occupied by a virtual reality headset maker that Facebook acquired last year.\n\n\u201cWe were on top of each other like ants at the old place,\u201d said Acorns co-founder Walter Cruttenden. \u201cThe app took off faster than we expected, so we just grew faster than we thought and had to hire people.\u201d\n\nThe rebounding economy has also boosted the real estate industry and revived long-stalled home projects, such as San Juan Capistrano's Pacifica San Juan. The construction industry, previously decimated by the recession, saw employment jump 6.8% last year, and job creation should climb an additional 4.4% this year, according to a forecast from Chapman University.\n\nTrilogy Plumbing in Anaheim has added about 40 workers in the last 18 months, President David Keefe said. The company\n\nnoticed an increase in new home jobs two years ago, but experienced a sizable jump in the second quarter of 2015.\n\n\u201cThe economy has definitely picked up the housing sector,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's really allowed us to invest in our infrastructure and our people.\u201d\n\nNew office projects are in the mix as well.\n\nDeveloper Trammell Crow Co., which is owned by CBRE, recently bought 7.5 acres near John Wayne Airport and plans to open a 545,000-square-foot office project there in 2017.\n\nAnd last month, Tustin entered into a negotiating agreement with Lincoln Property Co. to build a nearly 900,000-square-foot office campus at the former Marine Corps Air Station.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be a lot of new buildings coming out of the ground,\u201d said Jeff Ingham, senior managing director for JLL's Orange County office.\n\nOne is in the Irvine Spectrum. There, about 220 workers are preparing the Irvine Co.'s new office tower for a spring 2016 opening.\n\nWith high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows, it was designed by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, the firm behind the U.S. Bank Tower in downtown L.A., the expansion of the Louvre and the headquarters of Goldman Sachs in New York City. The top floors offer sweeping views of suburban Irvine and rolling golden hills.\n\nIn a testament to the Irvine Co.'s confidence in the Orange County economy, it's building the tower without tenants lined up, and it comes after the company opened two other office towers last year in nearby Newport Center.\n\nThere's more in the works. The master developer is seeking city approvals to build a 20-story office building down the block from the one now under construction.\n\nCase, executive vice president of office properties, said the Irvine Co. will see how 200 Spectrum Center leases before setting a groundbreaking date for its next building.\n\nBut if demand is as strong as expected, another tower may not be far off.\n\n\u201cWe could break ground as soon as next year,\u201d Case said.\n\nandrew.khouri@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @khouriandrew", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Orange County economic growth finally revving into high gear", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Off the 405 Freeway in Irvine, hundreds of workers are busy erecting a 20-story glass office tower, a stark symbol of Orange County's economic expansion.", "title": "Orange County economic growth finally revving into high gear", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-orange-county-economy-20150723-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55b0051d/turbine/la-fi-orange-county-economy-20150723", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Orange County, economy, jobs, real estate, employment, healthcare", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/84053775", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-07-23", "Description": "Off the 405 Freeway in Irvine, hundreds of workers are busy erecting a 20-story glass office tower, a stark symbol of Orange County's economic expansion.This year, the county is expected to add the most new jobs in 17 years, outpacing the growth rate of California and the nation.
