I\u2019ve discovered ten thousand ways that don\u2019t work.\u201d The quote, ascribed to celebrated inventor (and prolific patent holder) Thomas Edison, captures the innate optimism of those who engage in the exhausting, risk-laden work of innovation.\n\nWithout the promise of a patent, emulating Edison\u2019s level of dedication would often require limitless resources or irrational zealotry. The modern patent system was founded on the premise that making innovation viable for rational actors requires incentives substantial enough to offset the enormous risk of failure. Innovators will explore the frontiers of technology only if the cost of discovering ten thousand ways that don\u2019t work might be recouped by discovering one that does.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPatents have long served as a key currency of innovation, and the patent system has long endured attempts to devalue that currency. Articles published in the August 8 issue of The Economist continue this regrettable tradition, pairing conclusory pronouncements with outdated, selectively presented studies in an effort to prop up its misguided thesis: that the patent system is an obstacle to innovation.\n\nOpponents of patents suggest that incentives to innovate exist without patents, and the absence of the property right would make the fruits of innovation more accessible. Among the problems with this narrative is that it relies on a false assumption\u2014that in the absence of patents, innovation will simply occur in the open, freely available to all. This ignores the obvious alternative\u2014that innovative ideas will be kept secret, preventing copying by others while capturing the benefits of inventions solely for inventors themselves, in perpetuity. This approach has long prevailed in countries lacking effective patent protection. In fact, one of the reasons for adopting early patent systems was the shortcomings of the guilds, where secrets of industrial technology were closely guarded, both erecting insurmountable barriers to market entry and stunting technological advancement.\n\nThe same dangers exist today: if innovation could only be protected through secrecy, then the public domain would shrink and society would be deprived of knowledge necessary for follow-on innovation critical to fostering technological progress. This alternative reveals as hollow The Economist\u2019s complaint that patents \u201clast too long\u201d, as trade secrets are protected for as long as they remain secret. There are legitimate, pro-competitive reasons to keep secret certain innovations that need not be disclosed, but the patent system both encourages those innovations that would have less value if kept secret and provides an incentive to disclose inventions early. And where inventions cannot be protected through secrecy, history has shown that those countries lacking effective patent protection see little investment in innovation at all.\n\nThe articles also ignore the patent system\u2019s important role in facilitating collaboration among innovators, by providing participants with clear markers for the value of ideas brought to the collaboration and confidence to overcome any trust deficit between distinct (and sometimes competing) entities. Patent protection can even serve as critical leverage for smaller inventors\u2014 it enabled renowned British inventor Sir James Dyson to hold discussions with and license his early vacuum cleaner innovations to incumbents, building the financial and reputational strength to launch the famously innovative household products company that bears his name.\n\nIt is ironic to see a British publication imploring the United States to limit patent protection to breakthrough inventions, when in fact the American patent system was explicitly designed\u2014in reaction to the widely criticized pro-aristocratic 18th century British system\u2014to protect incremental inventions as well as major (often capital-intensive) breakthroughs. This approach worked so well that by the late 1800s, England and the other great colonial powers of Europe adopted it themselves.\n\nThe views expressed by The Economist also seem unaware of today's real world patent system. For instance, its warning of \u201csubmarine patents\u201d, a once-significant concern, was obviated some 20 years ago in the U.S. using a sensible limitation imported from Europe. And then there is the call for an inexpensive way to challenge granted patents outside of court\u2014a wise enough idea that the U.S. implemented such procedures in 2011 with the America Invents Act, which created a comprehensive, inexpensive and speedy system to challenge granted patents outside of court.\n\nAnd while bad patents surely exist (albeit more easily challenged today than ever before), no attempt is made by the articles to seriously discuss patent quality or the ongoing efforts to improve it, instead presenting facile, \u201csound bite\u201d judgments about what should or should not be patentable. Such judgments confuse inventions that make complicated systems simple with simple inventions, dismissively stating that \u201cTwitter does not deserve a patent on its pull-to-refresh feed.\u201d Why not? Anyone who has witnessed a toddler manipulate an iPad cannot dismiss the major advancements giving us wonderfully intuitive user interfaces in today\u2019s devices. Are such advances really unworthy of the investment that the promise of a patent incents?\n\nCharitably speaking, The Economist has found ten thousand ways to disparage the patent system that don\u2019t work.\n\nKappos, former head of the US Patent and Trademark Office, is senior adviser to the Partnership for American Innovation (PAI).", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Patents have long served as a key currency of innovation, and the patent system has long endured attempts to devalue that currency.", "description": "Patents have long served as a key currency of innovation, and the patent system has long endured attempts to devalue that currency.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Patents have long served as a key currency of innovation, and the patent system has long endured attempts to devalue that currency.", "title": "Strong patent system essential to strong innovation economy", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/251406-strong-patent-system-essential-to-strong-innovation-economy", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/251406-strong-patent-system-essential-to-strong-innovation-economy", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-20T08:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "David J.
