(AP Photo/Joe Skipper)\n\nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \u2013 Confetti cannons rained orange and white strips on the two auxiliary stages on the field at Sun Life Stadium. Players screamed, took photos, reveled in Clemson\u2019s 37-17 Orange Bowl victory over Oklahoma Thursday.\n\nSteering clear of the hubbub\u2019s epicenter, standing safely off to the side so as not to wrinkle his neatly-pressed polo shirt and khakis, was one of the men most responsible for the commotion he was watching with his arms crossed and without much facial expressions.\n\nBehind his black-rimmed glasses, the eyes of Tigers co-offensive coordinator Tony Elliott were transfixed on the scene he had helped accomplish.\n\n\u201cJust sit back and watch everybody else enjoy it,\u201d Elliott said later in the postgame locker room. \u201cI\u2019m hungry. I\u2019m tired. I didn\u2019t really have the energy to get in there because it was a back-and-forth game for a little while \u2013 and I\u2019ve never been an out-front kind of guy.\n\n\u201cObviously, my time to really reflect will come when the season\u2019s done. But I work so hard, and our coaches work so hard. We just want to see our young men enjoy this moment.\u201d\n\nElliott has become the quiet genius who prefers the tranquility of a coaches\u2019 box overlooking his offense, rather than the adrenaline-soaked sideline where co-coordinator Jeff Scott and other coaches prowl. The system was put in place 13 months ago when Chad Morris took his methods to SMU, causing Elliott and Scott to craft the mantra \u201cIt\u2019s a Clemson offense, not a Chad offense.\u201d\n\nSome listened. Some didn\u2019t. None doubt now, as Clemson has 15 wins and no losses with Elliott and Scott in charge. The Tigers have blasted away a school record with ten consecutive 500-yard total offense games; the previous long streak was four.\n\nHaving Deshaun Watson helps. With 301 passing yards against Alabama in the College Football Playoff championship Jan. 11 in Glendale, Ariz., Watson would become the first Division I player ever with 4,000 passing yards and 1,000 rushing yards in a season.\n\nBut look past Watson\u2019s numbers to find exactly what makes him special. If Watson has kryptonite, it is the Superman costume he\u2019ll insist on wearing in two particular game situations: when it\u2019s early, and when it\u2019s a big game. Both were on display Thursday, when Watson misfired on six of his first eight attempts and either made a poor decision or poor throw on his final play of the first half, forcing a throw to Jordan Leggett that was picked in the end zone by Zack Sanchez costing the Tigers what would have been a go-ahead field-goal attempt.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the balance you have to have with a great player,\u201d Scott said. \u201cDeshaun\u2019s a talented guy, and he\u2019s smart, he knows he\u2019ll make mistakes, but 95 percent of the time he\u2019ll do the right thing.\n\n\u201cThe big message to him: be yourself. Don\u2019t force things. Football is four quarters for a reason. It gives you enough time for the best team to win.\u201d\n\nAt halftime, Clemson owned 305 total yards, 15 first downs and a 17-16 deficit. Four trips to the red zone, and another drive ending on the Sooners\u2019 26-yard-line, resulted in one touchdown, three field goals and the Sanchez interception.\n\nThe math didn\u2019t add up for mad scientists Elliott and Scott, who in the locker room might have seen a cautious remember-me wave from tailback Wayne Gallman and recalled why the Tigers were undefeated in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing, was don\u2019t panic. We moved the ball really well. We just weren\u2019t getting touchdowns in the red zone,\u201d Scott said. \u201cAll we had to do was simplify the gameplan. Wayne was running the ball well; he\u2019d only had seven carries (for 39 yards.) We looked at that as an advantage because he was fresh for the second half.\u201d\n\nGallman noted he thought the Sooners started to wear down in the second quarter. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Gallman\u2019s first run went for 11 yards and his last went for a 1-yard touchdown, capping a 12-play, 75-yard drive that required only one third-down conversion and established a dominating running game. With Watson (332 yards and two TDs on 55 passes or rushes) deferring to his teammates and taking smarter chances, Gallman finished with 150 yards and two scores.\n\n\u201cWe just feed off each other. Whoever is carrying the ball, let\u2019s get four yards a play and move on from there, and sooner or later it\u2019s going to bust open,\u201d Watson said. \u201cHe had some big runs and I had some big runs and it started off on the offensive line. The first half we didn\u2019t finish drives off and we were down a point, but that still wasn\u2019t going to stop us regardless of the situation.\u201d\n\nThe final tally: 312 rushing yards (5.4 a carry), 218 passing yards (12.8 a completion.) That\u2019s six out of seven games with at least 200 yards of each variety.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a versatile offense. We have all the components,\u201d freshman left tackle Mitch Hyatt said. \u201cIf they take away the pass, we just run the ball. It\u2019s as easy as that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "The new Clemson way: Another win, another exercise in balanced offense, Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Clemson-Oklahoma,College Football Playoff,Deshaun Watson,Jeff Scott,Mitch Hyatt,Tony Elliott,Wayne Gallman", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \u2013 Confetti cannons rained orange and white strips on the two auxiliary stages on the field at Sun Life Stadium.
