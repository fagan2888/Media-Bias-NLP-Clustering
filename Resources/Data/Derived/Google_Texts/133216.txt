Elsewhere...

Donald Trump used Twitter to show off his compassionate conservatism.

Continuing his Twitter rant started on Friday, demanding that American healthcare workers infected with the Ebola virus not be allowed back into the country for treatment, bombastic businessman Donald Trump tweeted that healthcare workers "must suffer the consequences," for their humanitarian impulses. The U.S. cannot allow EBOLA infected people back. People that go to far away places to help out are great-but must suffer the consequences!

And he wasn't alone...

Christian crusader Ann Coulter joined Trump's lack-of-pity party.

In her syndicated column Wednesday, conservative columnist Ann Coulter called the American doctor infected with Ebola and now receiving treatment in Atlanta a prime example of "Christian narcissism." In the column, titled "Ebola Doc's Condition Downgraded To 'Idiotic,'" Coulter called Dr. Kent Brantly's humanitarian work in Liberia nothing more than the efforts of an ego-driven Christian and "the first real-world demonstration of the economics of Obamacare." [...] She suggested American Christians are simply tired of fighting the "culture war" in the U.S., which is why they "go on 'mission trips' to disease-ridden cesspools."

Meanwhile...

Dr. Ben Carson tried (read: failed) to inject some sanity into the discussion.

Carson said Americans should educate themselves on the virus but said government health policy should be to protect the country against a "worst-case scenario." An example of that scenario involved a hospital lab worker being bribed $1 million for access to urine that contains Ebola. "Someone comes up to a lab worker," Carson hypothesized, "He knows he's got the urine; 'How would you like to have a million dollars?' A little transaction thereâ€¦" "Such things have been known to happen," he said.

We're all gonna fucking die!
