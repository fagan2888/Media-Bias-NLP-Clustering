By the time the dust settled, 928 bills had been filed in the state House and Senate on Friday, setting the chambers up for a busy second half of the legislative session. \u201cNow, it\u2019s game on,\u201d longtime lobbyist Bill Miller said. In all, some 8,000 measures are now before the 84th Legislature, including 4,114 House bills, 1,993 Senate bills and 1,771 resolutions. [\u2026] The most high-profile bill filed Friday was an ethics reform package supported by Gov. Greg Abbott that long had been expected to be submitted by Sen. Van Taylor, R-Plano. Abbott had declared ethics reform a legislative emergency item during his State of the State address last month. Taylor\u2019s proposal, known as Senate Bill 19 and also backed by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, would require state officials to disclose contracts with governmental entities, prohibit lawmakers from serving as bond counsel for local and state governments and make departing legislators and statewide elected officials wait one legislative session before becoming lobbyists. \u201cThere is no more valuable bond in democracy than the trust the people have with their government,\u201d Taylor said in a statement. \u201cThe common-sense ethics reform outlined in Senate Bill 19 will strengthen that bond and send a clear message to the people of Texas that there is no place in government for those who betray the trust given to them by the voters.\u201d Tax policy also was a common theme, with [Rep. Dennis] Bonnen submitting his hotly anticipated proposal to cut business and sales taxes. The Senate, which in some ways has been moving faster than the House, already has debated several tax proposals, and the issue is expected to be a priority focus of the session.\n\nThe Trib highlights a few bills of interest.\n\n\u2014 House Ways and Means Chairman Dennis Bonnen, R-Angleton, filed his long-awaited proposals to cut the rates for both the margins tax paid by businesses and the broader state sales tax. The margins tax bill, House Bill 32, is identical to one filed by Senate Finance Chairwoman Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound. The measures should draw the House more into the tax cut debate this session, which until now has been focused more on the Senate, where Nelson has already held hearings on some high-profile measures. \u2014 Several measures filed Friday aimed at allowing Texas to change its approach to immigration, even as broader proposals stall in Washington. House Bill 3735 by state Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, seeks to establish a partnership with the federal government to establish a guest-worker program to bring skilled and unskilled labor to Texas. House Bill 3301 by state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez, D-Austin, would recognize undocumented Texans as \u201ccitizens\u201d of the state. It would allow them to apply for driver\u2019s licenses, occupational licenses and state IDs if they meet certain residency criteria and are can verify their identity. \u201cIt also opens the door for future conversations about the very real fact that these Texans without status are here, they are not leaving, and we should be doing everything we can to help them find employment, housing and opportunity,\u201d said Laura Stromberg Hoke, Rodriguez\u2019s chief of staff. \u2014 House Bill 3401 by state Rep. Matt Schaefer, R-Tyler, seeks to establish an interstate compact between interested states for the detection, apprehension and prosecution of undocumented immigrants. \u2014 Looking to add restrictions on abortion, state Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, R-Parker, filed House Bill 3765 to beef up the state\u2019s informed consent laws when it comes to minors. Texas law already requires patients seeking an abortion to go through the informed consent process, but Laubenberg\u2019s bill would require notarized consent from a minor and a minor\u2019s parent before an abortion is performed. \u2014 House Bill 3785 from Rep. Marisa Marquez, D-El Paso, would permit patients with cancer, seizure disorders, PTSD and other conditions to medical marijuana. The measure is broader than other bills filed this session that would only allow low-level THC oils to be used on intractable seizure patients. \u2014 The National Security Agency might have some trouble in Texas if Rep. Jonathan Stickland, R-Bedford, gets his way. House Bill 3916 would make it illegal for any public entities to provide water or electric utility services to NSA data collection centers in the state. \u2014 State Rep. Joe Deshotel, D-Port Arthur, filed a pair of measures, House Bill 3839 and House Joint Resolution 142, which would ask voters to approve the creation of as many as nine casinos. Under Deshotel\u2019s plan, most of the casinos would be built near the Texas coast, and a large portion of the tax revenue would go toward shoring up the troubled Texas Windstorm Insurance Association, the insurer of last resort for coastal Texans. \u2014 In an effort to pave the way for a Medicaid expansion solution that would get the support of conservatives, state Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, filed House Bill 3845 to request a block grant from the federal government to reform the program and expand health care coverage for low-income Texans. Though GOP leaders have said they won\u2019t expand Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act, they\u2019ve asked the feds for more flexibility to administer the program. Coleman\u2019s proposal, titled the \u201cThe Texas Way,\u201d intends to give the state more wiggle room while still drawing some Republican support.\n\nHere\u2019s a Statesman story about the casino bills. There\u2019s been a distinct lack of noise around gambling expansion this session, which is change from other recent sessions. I suspect Rep. Deshotel\u2019s proposals will go the way of those previous ones, but at least there\u2019s a new angle this time.\n\nHere\u2019s a press release from Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition (RAMP) in favor of the medical marijuana bill from Rep. Marquez; there is a not-yet-numbered companion bill to HB3785 in the Senate, filed by Sen. Jose Menendez, as well. Two other, more limited, medical marijuana bills, the so-called \u201cTexas Compassionate Use Act\u201d, were filed in February. I don\u2019t know which, if any, will have a chance of passage. I will note that RAMP has been admirably bipartisan in its praise of bills that loosen marijuana laws. Kudos to them for that.\n\nIf you\u2019re annoyed at Jodie Laubenberg going after reproductive choice again, it might help a little to know that Rep. Jessica Farrar filed HB 3966 to require some accountability for so-called \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers\u2019. Her press release is here.\n\nI am particularly interested in Rep. Coleman\u2019s \u201cTexas Way\u201d Medicaid expansion bill. (A companion bill, SB 1039, was filed by Sen. Jose Rodriguez.) I have long considered \u201cblock grant\u201d to be dirty words in connection with Medicaid, so to say the least I was a little surprised to receive Rep. Coleman\u2019s press release. I have complete faith in Rep. Coleman, so I\u2019m sure this bill will move things in the direction he\u2019s been pushing all along, but at this point I don\u2019t understand the details well enough to explain what makes this bill different from earlier block grant proposals. I\u2019ve sent an email to his office asking for more information. In the meantime, you can read Sen. Rodriguez\u2019s press release and this Legislative Study Group coverage expansion policy paper for more.\n\nFinally, one more bill worth highlighting:\n\nThe proposal introduced by out lesbian Rep. Celia Israel (D-Austin) would prohibit mental health providers in Texas from attempting to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of people under 18. Those who violate the law would face disciplinary action from state licensing boards.\n\nIsrael acknowledged that House Bill 3495 has little chance of passing the Republican-dominated Legislature, and it wouldn\u2019t apply to faith-based practitioners, but she said it\u2019s an important response to the Texas GOP\u2019s 2014 platform plank endorsing reparative therapy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that they recognize how hurtful these kinds of things can be,\u201d Israel told the Observer. \u201cTo suggest that some young kid that happens to be gay is less than normal is very hurtful and harmful and dangerous, and I think I put myself back in those years when I was first discovering who I was. \u2026 I felt strongly about introducing a bill that was a counter to that, to say, \u2018We don\u2019t need fixing. We just need your love.\u2019\u201d\n\nVirtually all of the major medical and mental health organizations have come out against reparative therapy, from the American Psychological Association to the American Medical Association and the American Counseling Association.\n\nI agree that this bill isn\u2019t going anywhere, but as I\u2019ve been saying, that doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t have been filed. Good on Rep. Israel for doing what\u2019s right.
