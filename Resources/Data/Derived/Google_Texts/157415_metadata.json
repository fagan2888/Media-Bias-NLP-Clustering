Nationally we find that 42% of voters support it to 40% who are opposed. Those numbers are in line with what we\u2019ve found in most swing states where we\u2019ve polled on it over the course of this year. It\u2019s a far cry from when we used to consistently find voters opposed to it by a 10-15 point margin nationally and in key states. One big reason for the change is that Democrats (73%) are more unified in their support of it than Republicans (70%) are in their opposition to it.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that as more Americans have gained first-hand experience with the health care law, they have liked the results. Obamacare as a term has been demonized by years of Republican lies and smears, but the law itself is not the political anchor that Republicans had hoped it would be.\n\nThe worse news for Republicans is that approval of the law has been steady since people started experiencing the benefits of the ACA. Obamacare is closer to becoming a political asset than it is to being a liability for Democrats.\n\nAs more people gain coverage, it is going to be difficult to impossible for Republicans to be able to repeal the law. What makes 2016 so urgent for Obamacare critics is that if they fail to win the White House, it is likely that the ACA will be the law of the land for a very long time.\n\nThe public is finally catching up to what Democrats have known for a long time. Obamacare is a good thing for our country and the calls of hands off my Obamacare will only grow in the months and years to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to the latest PPP Poll, more Americans support Obamacare than oppose it as Democrats have become unified in their support of the ACA.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "According to the latest PPP Poll, more Americans support Obamacare than oppose it as Democrats have become unified in their support of the ACA.", "title": "Americans Fall In Love With Obamacare As New Poll Shows Growing ACA Support", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/10/07/americans-fall-love-obamacare-poll-shows-growing-aca-support.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/obamacare.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-07T16:05:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,ACA,affordable care act,Obamacare,obamacare popularity,Poll,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-10-07T16:05:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-07T16:05:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA, affordable care act, Obamacare, obamacare popularity, Poll"}, "article_summary": "According to the latest PPP Poll, more Americans support Obamacare than oppose it as Democrats have become unified in their support of the ACA.\nNationally we find that 42% of voters support it to 40% who are opposed.\nPPP discussed the results, \u201cEvidence continues to mount that the Affordable Care Act is just not a liability for Democrats anymore.\nObamacare is a good thing for our country and the calls of hands off my Obamacare will only grow in the months and years to come.\nThose numbers are in line with what we\u2019ve found in most swing states where we\u2019ve polled on it over the course of this year."}
