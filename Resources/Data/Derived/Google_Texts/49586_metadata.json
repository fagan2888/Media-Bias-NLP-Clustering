Baden and Candida Moss, Special to CNN\n\n(CNN) - The destructive force of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the militant Sunni movement, is epitomized in a video released Thursday of ISIS members smashing a tomb in Mosul, Iraq.\n\nThe tomb is traditionally thought to be the burial place of the prophet Jonah, a holy site for Christians and many Muslims.\n\nMosul, the second-largest city in Iraq, is built on and adjacent to the ancient Assyrian city of Nineveh, the setting for the biblical book of Jonah and once the most powerful capital of the ancient world.\n\nIndeed, for most people familiar with the Bible, Nineveh is inseparable from the figure of Jonah.\n\nIn Christian tradition, the story of Jonah is an important one. Jonah\u2019s descent into the depths in the belly of the great fish and subsequent triumphant prophetic mission to Nineveh is seen as a reference to and prototype of the death and resurrection of Jesus.\n\nThe destruction of his tomb in Mosul is therefore a direct assault on Christian faith, and on one of the few physical traces of that faith remaining in Iraq.\n\nDespite its acknowledged antiquity, however, it is a virtual certainty that the tomb destroyed by ISIS was not that of the biblical prophet.\n\nHis purported tomb was in a mosque dating back to the time of the Muslim conquest in the middle of the first millennium. The mosque, known as the Mosque of the Prophet Yunus (Arabic for Jonah), was built on an even earlier Christian church that stood on the spot.\n\nOfficials: ISIS blows up Jonah's tomb in Iraq\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the association of the site with Jonah\u2019s burial goes back to the early Christian period when the practice of linking geographical features with biblical figures was all the rage. (See: Rachel\u2019s Tomb in Bethlehem, David\u2019s Tomb in Jerusalem, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, etc.)\n\nJewish tradition suggests that Jonah returned to his hometown of Gath-Hepher after his mission to Nineveh (as we read in the book 3 Maccabees, from around the first century B.C.).\n\nThis was certainly the belief held by the church father Jerome, and was local tradition in Gath-Hepher in the 12th century and remains so today.\n\n(Perhaps less likely is the rabbinic claim that his experience in the belly of the great fish was so terrible that God granted Jonah a rare exemption from the travails of death and he went up to heaven alive.)\n\nIn the end, speculations about the actual location of Jonah\u2019s burial are probably moot, as virtually all scholars agree that the book is a work of pure fiction - is perhaps even a comedic novella of sorts - and that it is quite likely to have been written around the fifth century B.C., around 200 years after the city of Nineveh was destroyed.\n\nBut it is not the historical reality that is at stake in Mosul today.\n\nThe destruction of Jonah\u2019s tomb was not an attack on archaeology. It was an attack on both those Christians living in Iraq today and on the rich, if little-known, Christian heritage of the region.\n\nWhen people think of ancient Christianity, they don\u2019t ordinarily think of Iraq. But the Christian communities there are among the oldest in the world.\n\nAccording to church tradition, Christianity was introduced to the region by the Apostles Thomas and Thaddeus. These stories may be legendary, but by the second century we have references to Christian converts with names associated with the region and later histories refer to the persecution of Christians in Iraq in the fourth century. The Mar Behnam Monastery, for example, is believed to go back to the fourth century.\n\nIn the past two millennia, Iraq has been a center for Christian theological enquiry, learning and devotion. Important monasteries were built there in the sixth and seventh centuries, and various forms of ancient Christianity that had died out elsewhere persisted in Iraq into the 21st century.\n\nMar Mattai, which is to the southeast of Mosul and is maintained by the Syriac Orthodox Church, became one of the most important Christian monasteries by the eighth century, and was particularly renowned for its library.\n\nThe significance of Christianity in Iraq extends beyond even religion.\n\nIt is likely that Syriac monks were partly responsible for the preservation of Greek philosophical, medical and scientific texts by translating them into Syriac and Arabic. A ninth-century Syriac patriarch named Timothy wrote that the best Syriac manuscripts of Greek writers were to be found at Mar Mattai.\n\nAll that has been erased in a matter of days.\n\nLast week, ISIS reportedly issued an ultimatum to Christians that they must convert to Islam, flee or face the sword. Earlier this month ISIS had allowed Christians to pay a non-Muslim tax known as jizya. On July 17, Christians were notified that jizya was no longer an option. They must now convert, flee or die.\n\nAmong the last Christians to leave the city were monks - residents of the ancient Mar Behnam Monastery - who left behind them 1,400 years of rich Christian tradition, as ISIS refused to let the monks take any of their precious relics with them.\n\nDespite its antiquity and rich tradition, Christianity in Iraq is on the brink of eradication.\n\nThe heirs to those who first discovered the tomb of Jonah, and those who helped to keep Greek philosophy alive in the medieval period, are being ejected from their homes and from a land they have held sacred for centuries. This is the face and reality of Christian persecution.\n\nJonah was one of the earliest symbols of the resurrection for Christians. Will Christianity ever rise again in Iraq?\n\nJoel S.
