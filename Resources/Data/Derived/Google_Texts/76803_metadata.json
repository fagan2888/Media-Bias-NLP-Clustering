The bill\u2019s detractors are concerned the bill doesn't restrict the government from collecting personal data on Americans.\n\nIndustry groups and the National Security Agency (NSA) have been major proponents of the proposal, and may find a more receptive audience in the next Congress.\n\n\u201cWe would anticipate that [an info sharing bill] would be able to move through the Senate more easily now than before,\u201d said Paul Martino, senior policy counsel at the National Retail Federation, one of many industry groups supporting a cyber information sharing measure.\n\nStill, unknowns remain. The Senate committees that have driven cyber legislation will have new leaders with opaque and minimal cyber policy backgrounds.\n\nSen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) will likely replace Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the upper chamber\u2019s main proponent of CISA. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is likely assuming leadership of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, which manages the bulk of cyber funding.\n\nThough the senators helped sponsor a 2012 Republican bill to facilitate cyber threat information sharing between the government and private sector, neither has a robust cyber policy history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in their wheelhouse,\u201d Cattanach said.\n\nBut fears that the new leaders may abandon cyber legislation appear overblown. Neither is seen as a strong opponent of the intelligence community and both are closely affiliated with private industry groups, two groups that see CISA as the top priority on cybersecurity.\n\nBurr once told reporters, \u201cIf I had my way, with the exception of nominees, there would never be a public intelligence hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd Johnson is \u201cpretty hawkish on the NSA,\u201d Cattanach said. The Wisconsin lawmaker has shown concern about the lack of NSA oversight, but defended the agency\u2019s electronic surveillance program.\n\nBurr is expected to build off of Feinstein's framework instead of forging his own bill.\n\n\u201cWhy start from scratch, why reinvent the wheel?\u201d said one cybersecurity policy expert with close contacts on Capitol Hill and in President Obama's administration.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any indication that Burr would take a different tact,\u201d said Melvin Dubee, vice president of government relations at defense manufacturer Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe White House, civil liberties-focused senators and privacy groups have pushed for NSA reform before passing any cyber information sharing bill, a potential stumbling block to passing cyber legislation.\n\nFormer NSA contractor Edward Snowden's disclosures about U.S. surveillance programs have essentially stopped the bill from moving the last 18 months, cyber advocates contend.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a sequencing problem,\u201d said Matt Rhoades, director of the cyberspace and security program at the Truman National Security Project. \u201cOtherwise, I think we would have had information sharing last year.\u201d\n\nWhile the party switch in the Senate has gained the most attention, the House Intelligence Committee is also losing its cyber-oriented chairman, Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) to retirement.\n\nRogers and Committee Ranking Member Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) \u201chave been the primary driers for information sharing,\u201d said Dubee. \u201cI\u2019m probably more interested in seeing who gets those jobs.\"\n\nWithout a clear line of succession in the House, the next leader\u2019s priorities become another uncertainty that could alter any cyber bill\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cThings can be done that couldn\u2019t be done before,\u201d Cattanach said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean they will be done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Republican control might be the kickstart needed for perpetually stalled legislation.", "description": "Republican control might be the kickstart needed for perpetually stalled legislation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Republican control might be the kickstart needed for perpetually stalled legislation.", "title": "Cyber bill advocates pin hopes on GOP Congress", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/223442-cyber-bill-advocates-pin-hopes-on-gop-congress", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-09T08:29:51-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-11-09T08:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/223442-cyber-bill-advocates-pin-hopes-on-gop-congress", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-09T08:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "cybersecurity,Robert Cattanach,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-09T08:00:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-09T08:29:51-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/223442-cyber-bill-advocates-pin-hopes-on-gop-congress", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Republican control might be the kickstart needed for perpetually stalled legislation.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cyber bill advocates pin hopes on GOP Congress"}, "dcterms.title": "Cyber bill advocates pin hopes on GOP Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3e90\"", "article_summary": "Policy experts say a united Republican Congress will be more receptive to voices backing a cyber information sharing bill during the lame duck session.\nThe Senate committees that have driven cyber legislation will have new leaders with opaque and minimal cyber policy backgrounds.\nThough the senators helped sponsor a 2012 Republican bill to facilitate cyber threat information sharing between the government and private sector, neither has a robust cyber policy history.\nThe White House, civil liberties-focused senators and privacy groups have pushed for NSA reform before passing any cyber information sharing bill, a potential stumbling block to passing cyber legislation.\nFormer NSA contractor Edward Snowden's disclosures about U.S. surveillance programs have essentially stopped the bill from moving the last 18 months, cyber advocates contend."}
