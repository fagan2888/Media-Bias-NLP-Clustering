Back-to-back Super Bowl wins. Only five losing seasons in almost 32 years.\n\n\u201cForgive me, I\u2019m not quite done yet,\u201d she said amid a roar of applause.\n\nThe owner to achieve 300 wins fastest. And one who competed in the Ironman Triathlon.\n\n\u201cIf anyone knows my dad,\u201d Beth said, \u201cyou know he likes to go fast. And be first.\u201d\n\nThe feats were known but still impressive, and they offered reminders of Pat Bowlen in his prime.\n\nBut on Saturday, the gathering of more than 800 people at the Broncos\u2019 field house at Dove Valley, was an acknowledgment of Pat\u2019s current fight.\n\nThe team hosted the Alzheimer\u2019s Association of Colorado\u2019s annual Memories in the Making Art Auction, with all proceeds going to the support of Alzheimer\u2019s patients and research for a cure.\n\nPat, Beth\u2019s father and the longtime owner of the Broncos, wasn\u2019t physically among the hundreds in attendance as he continues to deal with the disease.\n\nBut he was there.\n\n\n\nBeth, the event chair and the Broncos\u2019 director of special projects and events, and team president and CEO Joe Ellis made sure of it.\n\nEllis sat at a table in front of the stage where 11 pieces by professional artists, each paired with a watercolor painting by an artist living with Alzheimer\u2019s or some form of dementia, were auctioned off. When \u201cItem No. 10\u201d \u2014 a painting called \u201cCow\u201d by William Matthews that was matched with \u201cGrazing\u201d by Susan Olson \u2014 came up, Ellis raised his yellow bidding card.\n\n\u201c$10,000.\u201d Sold. Tied for the highest bid of night.\n\nBeth purchased a limited edition cartoon by Drew Litton of Pat sitting at a canvas, painting the Broncos logo. Pat signed the cartoon, a symbol of what he created over that last three decades-plus. Beth bought it for $7,000.\n\nForty professional artists donated their works for the cause, and each were matched with a piece of Alzheimer\u2019s art. More than 100 Alzheimer\u2019s paintings were auctioned off.\n\nLast year\u2019s events, held in Denver and Fort Collins, together raised more than $400,000. Saturday\u2019s live auction \u2014 including two special additions: the Bowlen cartoon and an autographed Peyton Manning jersey \u2014 reeled in $88,000 alone.\n\nBy night\u2019s end, the amount generated by the many works hanging throughout the field house for the silent auction, hadn\u2019t been tallied. But the final number was perhaps the event\u2019s biggest yet.\n\nWhat else would you expect for an event coordinated and hosted by Bowlen\u2019s Broncos?\n\n(For more information about the Alzheimer\u2019s Association of Colorado, visit www.alz.org/co.)", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Beth Bowlen and the Broncos hosted the Alzheimer's Association of Colorado's annual Memories in the Making Art Auction at the team's field house.", "title": "Broncos host Alzheimer's Association art auction to help fund research, support", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/06/14/broncos-host-alzheimers-association-art-auction-to-help-fund-research-support/34282/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/06/bowlentribute-550x308-1-495x277.gif", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Beth Bowlen and the Broncos hosted the Alzheimer's Association of Colorado's annual Memories in the Making Art Auction at the team's field house.", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/06/14/broncos-host-alzheimers-association-art-auction-to-help-fund-research-support/34282/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/06/bowlentribute-550x308-1-495x277.gif", "title": "Broncos host Alzheimer\u2019s Association art auction to help fund research, support", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "news_keywords": "Colorado,Joe Ellis,Pat Bowlen,Peyton Manning", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Beth Bowlen and the Broncos hosted the Alzheimer's Association of Colorado's annual Memories in the Making Art Auction at the team's field house."}, "article_summary": "The team hosted the Alzheimer\u2019s Association of Colorado\u2019s annual Memories in the Making Art Auction, with all proceeds going to the support of Alzheimer\u2019s patients and research for a cure.\nBeth purchased a limited edition cartoon by Drew Litton of Pat sitting at a canvas, painting the Broncos logo.\nForty professional artists donated their works for the cause, and each were matched with a piece of Alzheimer\u2019s art.\nSaturday\u2019s live auction \u2014 including two special additions: the Bowlen cartoon and an autographed Peyton Manning jersey \u2014 reeled in $88,000 alone.\nBy night\u2019s end, the amount generated by the many works hanging throughout the field house for the silent auction, hadn\u2019t been tallied."}
