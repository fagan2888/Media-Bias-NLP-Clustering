Jeff Gordon said, according to the paper.\n\n\u201cThe trooper was out of the car,\u201d Gordon continued. \u201cHe was actually trying to get the tractor to back up so he could attempt a second left turn.\u201d\n\nThe Amtrak train that derailed was traveling 69 miles per hour at the time of the crash, according to the report. The train was on a trip from Charlotte to New York City on the company\u2019s Carolinian route.\n\nAbout 50 passengers were injured in the accident, but Amtrak has said that none of the injuries thus far have been life threatening.\n\nThe North Carolina accident was similar to incidents involving collisions between trains and vehicles on New York\u2019s Metro-North and California\u2019s Metrolink commuter railways that have raised questions about the safety of U.S. railroad crossing intersections.\n\nThe Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has responded to the spate of accidents by increasing its effort to warn drivers about the dangers of being hit by trains.\n\nFRA Associate Administrator Kevin Thompson told the Charlotte newspaper that trucking companies normally report when their vehicles become stranded on train tracks.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it is a good practice, and transporters should call the toll-free number on a railroad crossing,\u201d he said, according to the report.\n\nThe FRA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have launched investigations of the North Carolina Amtrak accident.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Derailed Amtrak train hit stalled truck", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Derailed Amtrak train hit stalled truck", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/235315-derailed-amtrak-train-hit-stalled-truck", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/amtrackcrash_abcnews.png", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/235315-derailed-amtrak-train-hit-stalled-truck", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-11T10:18-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Amtrak, Carolinian, Amtrak crash, Federal Railroad Administration,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-11T10:18:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/235315-derailed-amtrak-train-hit-stalled-truck", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Derailed Amtrak train hit stalled truck"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd856f\"", "article_summary": "The FRA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have launched investigations of the North Carolina Amtrak accident.\nAn Amtrak train that derailed in North Carolina on Monday struck a 164-footlong tractor trailer that had been stalled on its tracks for as long as 20 minutes, The Charlotte Observer reports.\nNorth Carolina Highway Patrol officials said there was no communication between themselves and Amtrak officials about the impending arrival of the train, according to the report.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cThere was no indication a train was coming,\u201d North Carolina Highway Patrol spokesman Lt.
