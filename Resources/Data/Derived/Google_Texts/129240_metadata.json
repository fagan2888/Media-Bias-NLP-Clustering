Consider the consequences of your actions before you choose to act,\" Fullerton police Sgt. Jeff Stuart said in a news release.\n\nA July 2010 FBI study found that 20 percent of teenagers sent or posted a nude or semi-nude photo online. While sexting is not a new phenomenon, officials said they\u2019ve noticed a trend upwards among younger teens and are seeking to prevent situations that sometimes end in tragedy, such as suicide.\n\nThe department is urging parents and families to speak with their children to reinforce the message. Stuart said that parents shouldn\u2019t be afraid to monitor their child\u2019s technology and noted that it is a crime to send or receive explicit photos of a minor via text, email or social media.\n\n\"There have been occasions where if parents had been monitoring their child\u2019s technology, they might have seen an inappropriate relationship developing before the actual abuse occurred,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After the third \"sexting\" incident in a month, a Southern California police department is warning parents of young teens about the dangers of sending sexually explicit photos or messages over their phones.", "title": "Police Warn Parents of &quot;Sexting&quot; Among Young Teens", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Southern California", "description": "After the third 'sexting' incident in a month, a Southern California police department is warning parents of young teens about the dangers of sending sexually explicit photos or messages over their phones.", "title": "Police Warn Parents of \"Sexting\" Teens", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/sexting-technology-media-children-police-fullerton-249872441.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/cellphone-generic.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After the third 'sexting' incident in a month, a Southern California police department is warning parents of young teens about the dangers of sending sexually explicit photos or messages over their phones.", "title": "Police Warn Parents of \"Sexting\" Teens", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/sexting-technology-media-children-police-fullerton-249872441.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/cellphone-generic.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcla", "site": "@nbcla", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "keywords": "sexting, technology, media, children, police, fullerton", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "sexting, technology, media, children, police, fullerton"}, "article_summary": "After the third \"sexting\" incident in a month, a Southern California police department is warning parents of young teens about the dangers of sending sexually explicit photos or messages over their phones.\nSexual photos were found on the cellphones of three underage boys in Fullerton in the past month, police said.\nIn a separate incident, nude photos of an underage girl were discovered on a 12-year-old boy\u2019s phone, authorities said.\nThe department is urging parents and families to speak with their children to reinforce the message.\nWhile sexting is not a new phenomenon, officials said they\u2019ve noticed a trend upwards among younger teens and are seeking to prevent situations that sometimes end in tragedy, such as suicide."}
