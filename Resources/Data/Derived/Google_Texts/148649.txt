A five-year run of experimental spinal surgeries performed at Florida Hospital has ended, with the hospital sending letters advising patients that the neurosurgeon didn’t follow all protocols, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

The letter came into public purview following a news conference by Orlando personal injury attorney John Morgan. His law firm has has several clients who say their back problems either continued or were aggravated after they had the procedure, according to the Sentinel.

The letter, signed by two of the hospital’s chief medical officers, did not specify which protocols were not followed. The neurosurgeon, Dr. William Lu, is no longer seeing patients at Florida Hospital, the Sentinel reports.
