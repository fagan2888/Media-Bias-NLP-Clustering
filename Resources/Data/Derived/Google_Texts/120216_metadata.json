Yet somehow, he has managed to embrace the law in every possible way. He wanted to implement an Exchange, even if it was clearly unconstitutional under Ohio law. He denounced the Medicaid expansion\u2019s \u201clarge and unsustainable costs,\u201d which \u201cwill just rack up higher deficits\u2026leaving future generations to pick up the tab.\u201d Then he went ahead and implemented it anyway. Worse, he did so unilaterally, after the Ohio legislature passed legislation prohibiting him from doing so (which he vetoed). When Republican legislators and pro-life groups filed suit to stop him, Kasich defended his power-grab all the way to the Ohio Supreme Court.\n\nKasich\u2019s defense of his record on ObamaCare has been\u2026less than honest. Just one example: in a town hall meeting in South Carolina last night, Kasich railed against how ObamaCare increases the cost of health care at the same time he boasted he has constrained Medicaid spending in Ohio. In fact, Kasich\u2019s unilateral Medicaid expansion not only increased the cost of Medicaid to taxpayers nationwide, but according to Jonathan Ingram of the Foundation for Government Accountability, it \u201chas run $2.7 billion over budget so far [and] is set to run $8 billion over budget by 2017.\u201d\n\nFor more examples of Kasich\u2019s ObamaCare duplicity, see my new four-part (yet highly readable!) series at DarwinsFool.com:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kasich has embraced ObamaCare in every possible way, and his defense of his record on ObamaCare has been\u2026less than honest.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "Kasich has embraced ObamaCare in every possible way, and his defense of his record on ObamaCare has been...less than honest.", "title": "John Kasich's ObamaCare Duplicity", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/john-kasichs-obamacare-duplicity", "image": "https://frinkiac.com/meme/S03E13/1137807.jpg?b64lines=ICBJIGhhdmUgdGFrZW4gYSBsb3Qgb2YgaGVhdCwKIHNvIEkgYW0gZmxpcC1mbG9wcGluZyE=", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/john-kasichs-obamacare-duplicity", "title": "John Kasich's ObamaCare Duplicity", "description": "Kasich has embraced ObamaCare in every possible way, and his defense of his record on ObamaCare has been...less than honest.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2016/2/19", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-19T11:17:00-05:00"}, "publication_date": "2016/2/19", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He wanted to implement an Exchange, even if it was clearly unconstitutional under Ohio law.\nOhio governor and GOP presidential hopeful John Kasich says he opposes ObamaCare.\nKasich\u2019s defense of his record on ObamaCare has been\u2026less than honest.\nWhen Republican legislators and pro-life groups filed suit to stop him, Kasich defended his power-grab all the way to the Ohio Supreme Court.\nYet somehow, he has managed to embrace the law in every possible way."}
