Reuters\n\nEvery wave, no matter how big, no matter how beautiful, crashes on the shore. And so, Dr. J. Craig Venter, co-founder of Human Longevity Inc., admitted to feeling disappointed following his historic mapping of the human genome over 15 years ago.\n\n\u201cI think we all thought a lot more was going to fall out of having the first genomes and how it was going to change medicine,\u201d Venter told Maria Bartiromo, news anchor for the Fox Business Network, at the American Heart Association innovation investment forum Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s changed the pharmaceutical industry\u2026 but it hasn\u2019t done as much as most people anticipated.\u201d\n\nVenter, the former surfer dude (and general bad boy) of science who now resembles a fit Santa Claus with a white beard and twinkling eyes, is far from gloom and doom, though.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an exciting ride in the next 10 years,\u201d he said. Because technology has changed so dramatically since the genome was first mapped, he and other scientists now have previously unavailable machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computational tools to do the kind of experiments and analysis they first imagined all those years ago.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be more breakthroughs in the next decade than in the past 100 years,\u201d he added.\n\nStrangely, the AHA forum itself contained the same two threads of disappointment and excitement, as well. While it seems nearly everyone has created a new health care app, for example, most seemed unnecessary, convoluted, or why-would-anyone-ever-want-that to Medical Daily ... and apparently to some of the others attending the AHA forum.\n\n\"I live in Silicon Valley and there are so many health applications and guess what? It\u2019s all engineers, software developeers, and designers,\" Dr. Ivana Schnur, co-founder of SENSE.LY, a virtual nurse platform to provide monitoring and follow-up care to patients, told Medical Daily. \"And they do an incredible amount of work, and I look at [their app] and go, 'It\u2019s never going to do anything because the doctors are not going to like this this and this and you\u2019re going about it the wrong way.'\"\n\nWhile Schnur sees inadequacies from a doctor's perspective, many of the new apps seem to lack patient appeal. One possible exception might be Moving Analytics Inc.\u2019s mobile app, which guides patients through an evidence-based care plan consisting of supervised exercise, educational materials, and vital signs monitoring. The product came in second place during the Open Innovation Challenge, a game show-like competition among four products vying for funding from the AHA. (Is it Shark Tank, where so-called renowned venture capitalists vet products before the rolling cameras and a live studio audience?) Importantly, Moving Analytics\u2019 platform is based on a program already in place at USC, a home-based cardiac rehab program that already works. Their product portal not only enables case-managers to track patient progress, but it also allows for reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nAnd there\u2019s the rub \u2014 or at least the money.\n\nMedicare Big Bucks\n\nEssentially, apps that can be prescribed by doctors and which feed data and vital health information directly into a patient\u2019s medical record, may be (in some instances) reimbursed by CMS. While one of the app makers suggested his product would be an automatic win-win, with app makers and doctors sharing the profits, Medical Daily wonders if everything would shake out so simply. More importantly, where is the patient, ahem, in all this happy money-making?\n\nThere are some vast and deeply nuanced gray areas, from both an ethical and regulatory point-of-view, arising at the intersection of tech and health care. And this gray area is populated, naturally enough, by gray apps. By now, many of us are familiar with the general health and wellness apps, such as the ever present step-counters (pedometers) or pulse measurement products, which offer, essentially, health information lite to consumers. But then there's a whole 'nother kind of product.\n\nAlong with the everyday wellness apps, tech types based in Silicon Valley also are creating apps that provide crucial support to doctors, such that they might really be seen as clinical decision support software. In other words, your doctor will be diagnosing you or treating you based on app-generated data\u2026 and recommendations. In the words of Janet Trunzo, a senior executive vice president, technology and regulatory affairs at AdvaMed \u2014 the medical device trade association: \u201cWhen does the medical mobile application become a medical device and therefore be regulated?\u201d\n\nAnd, more importantly to you, the patient and tax-paying citizen, which of these apps will be receiving money from CMS? Which of these apps are worthy of potentially becoming institutionalized, at least for a time, throughout our health care system? Seemingly, once they prove themselves worthy of reimbursement, with money flowing directly to prescribing doctors, that\u2019s what they very well may become.\n\nSynthetic Genomics\n\nAnd in some strange way this all leads us back to Venter. Turns out the very first grant he ever received, way back in 1976, came his way by way of the American Heart Association, he tells the loving audience. Discussing his current research, he speaks of tweaking the genes of a pig in order to, in his words, humanize the creature and so grow organs (hearts, kidneys, livers, and most especially, lungs) that might be used while testing drugs and other health care products and also someday be used for transplants.\n\nHe\u2019s also taking \u201c30,000 unique measurements for somebody\u2019s face\u201d and then applying machine learning algorithms in order to generate a good picture of someone's face straight from their genetic code. This is intended to show people how personal genetic information is and that \u201cyou cannot de-identify your genetic code\u201d since it truly describes you physically and structurally. More importantly, these measurements and experiments all lead back to the brain. One of the teams he works with takes complex 2D MRI brain images and converts them by way of some \u201cnice quantitative algorithms\u201d into precise measurements of the different brain regions so that, \u201cbetter than any pathologist,\u201d each and every minor change in the brain can be tracked and identified.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re developing dementia, we can take brain scans as soon as three months apart and see differences\u201d he says, but more importantly, this precise vision inside someone\u2019s head gives scientists \u201cthe ability to find the genetic association between, for example, hippocampal size and these slight changes.\u201d Naturally, once the genetics are known, the precision medicine to cure what ails us will be next. After all, his end-game currently is longevity science, where the goal is not living to be, say 149, but \u201ca normal lifespan without disease.\u201d\n\nJoking with Bartiromo that even he has trouble keeping up with all the advances he's talking about, he concluded, \u201cOur biggest challenge right now is trying to cope with all the data in a way that we can interpret it.\u201d Though briefly caught in a riptide of data, he's clearly ready to stand on his board and ride his (newest) wave onto the shore of healthy longevity.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "craig venter, aha, apps, medicare, technology, human genome", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Craig Venter tells an American Heart Association forum the next decade will be an \"exciting ride,\" while entrepreneurs present new apps and clinical decision support software.", "title": "There May Be More Health Breakthroughs In Next Decade Than Past 100 Years", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/aha-forum-craig-venter-predicts-decade-record-health-breakthroughs-plus-apps-apps-and-330430", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/23/craig-venter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Craig Venter tells an American Heart Association forum the next decade will be an \"exciting ride,\" while entrepreneurs present new apps and clinical decision support software.", "title": "There May Be More Health Breakthroughs In Next Decade Than Past 100 Years", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/aha-forum-craig-venter-predicts-decade-record-health-breakthroughs-plus-apps-apps-and-330430", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/23/craig-venter.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/23/craig-venter.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-04-23T11:56:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-23T13:53:58-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Craig Venter tells an American Heart Association forum the next decade will be an \"exciting ride,\" while entrepreneurs present new apps and clinical decision support software."}, "article_summary": "Which of these apps are worthy of potentially becoming institutionalized, at least for a time, throughout our health care system?\nThere are some vast and deeply nuanced gray areas, from both an ethical and regulatory point-of-view, arising at the intersection of tech and health care.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be more breakthroughs in the next decade than in the past 100 years,\u201d he added.\nWhile it seems nearly everyone has created a new health care app, for example, most seemed unnecessary, convoluted, or why-would-anyone-ever-want-that to Medical Daily ... and apparently to some of the others attending the AHA forum.\nAnd so, Dr. J.
