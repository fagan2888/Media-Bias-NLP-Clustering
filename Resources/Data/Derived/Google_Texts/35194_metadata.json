Only Oregon ranked lower than Arizona.\n\nIn some ways, Arizona is on the right track, said Michael Shafer, president of Mental Health America\u2019s Arizona chapter.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re really, really poor or really, really mentally ill, the services are regarded as some of the better in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong behavioral health professionals, Arizona\u2019s robust Medicaid program is considered a model for its integration of mental health and substance-abuse services. For those who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid and have severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, following decades of litigation, Arizona agreed in 2104 to increase services, including offering employment and housing support.\n\nBut when it comes to people with less severe \u2014 more common \u2014 conditions (like depression or anxiety), services still are poor, Shafer said. Challenges are similar, he said, for those whose mental illness or addiction hasn\u2019t \u201cgotten so bad they\u2019ve lost their family, lost their job, and become indigent.\u201d\n\nOne problem, he said, is that not enough primary-care physicians are screening for mental illness and referring patients to specialists until the disease has progressed much too far. Often, people with low-level mental-health or substance-abuse issues go without a diagnosis for nearly a decade. The disease progressively worsens and, by the time it\u2019s caught, \u201cit has gotten so bad it is equivalent to cancer that has metastasized,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs an advocate, our hope over the next 10 to 15 years is to see referrals for early, low-level mental-health issues becoming just as normal, just as routine as getting a referral to see an oncologist, an OBGYN, or a proctologist,\u201d he said.\n\nBut even if physicians referred patients more frequently, there still are hurdles.\n\nFor one: There aren\u2019t enough people trained to provide mental-health services.\n\nArizona has more than 100 mental-health-professional shortage areas, which means the federal government officially has declared there are not enough providers to treat the population. In these areas, there is just one psychiatrist for every 30,000 people.\n\nThis means people who are actively suicidal are often forced to wait months before they can get treatment, said Theresa Nguyen, director of policy and programming for Mental Health America.\n\n\u201cSometimes, depending on the time of the year, it\u2019s more than three months. Sometimes it\u2019s: \u2018We can\u2019t even put you on a waiting list because it\u2019s too long, but maybe you can call back,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not OK.\u201d\n\nCost also remains a barrier.\n\nMore than 45 percent of U.S. adults who needed mental healthcare in 2014 but did not get it listed \u201ccould not afford cost\u201d as the primary reason, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. By comparison, just 7.2 percent were concerned about the stigma of people finding out they had a mental illness.\n\nMental disorders was the third most costly condition among adults in 2012, states the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, following trauma-related care and cancer.\n\nWhile Arizona saw dramatic improvements in the number of people enrolled in health insurance following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, state residents still are less likely to have coverage than every other state except Nevada and Texas.\n\nMost private insurance providers also don\u2019t cover as many different types of therapies as public insurance, Nguyen said. Many times, the only help available is the \u201cstandard 50-minute therapy session,\u201d she said \u2014 but this might not be the best treatment.\n\n\u201cNow, most of the specialty care we have is oriented toward the very rich, who can self pay, or the very, very poor who qualify for Medicaid,\u201d she said. \u201cFor a lot of people in the middle, it\u2019s a struggle.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nonprofit Mental Health American ranked Arizona 50 out of 51 states for access to mental healthcare.", "author": "Elizabeth Stuart", "og": {"site_name": "Phoenix New Times", "description": "Arizona is the second worst state in the country at addressing mental-health issues, according to a new study from the nonprofit Mental Health America.
