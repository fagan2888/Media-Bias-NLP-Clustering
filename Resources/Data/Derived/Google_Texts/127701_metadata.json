Despite healthy living advocates touting a decline in obesity among preschoolers, that CDC claim of a 43 percent decline in a decade might not be at all true.\n\nIn fact, the data is so vague that the obesity rate may actually have increased, according to Reuters. ABC and CBS praised the statistic as a victory for Obama\u2019s healthy living campaign when it came out, but failed to mention on news programming the evening of March 16 or the morning of March 17 that the statistic was called into question.\n\nA Reuters article gave the bad news on March 16: \u201cIf the news last month that the prevalence of obesity among American preschoolers had plunged 43 percent in a decade sounded too good to be true, that's because it probably was.\u201d That 43 percent number was based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from Feb. 25.\n\nObama\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d campaign was among the groups that celebrated the original statistic. In a statement on behalf of her campaign, she said that this decline was a result of \u201chealthy habits\u201d becoming \u201cthe new norm for our kids.\u201d\n\nBroadcast networks were quick to jump on this bandwagon. On March 2, \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d co-host Vinita Nair cited the statistic without question, even offering as an explanation that \u201cresearchers say kids are eating more nutritious food and getting more exercise in day care and they\u2019re consuming fewer sugary drinks.\u201d\n\nThe First Lady also made an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on March 6 to promote the Affordable Care Act. During that interview anchor Robin Roberts cited the statistic as an example of a victory for Obama.\n\n\u201c I think the first interview I did with you as first lady was for your Let\u2019s Move campaign. And there\u2019s now some actual data that is showing that childhood obesity, for the first time, is on the decline,\u201d Roberts said. Obama responded that her campaign had helped to create a \u201cnew norm for what a healthy environment looks like.\u201d \"the journalists who originally praised the study results have failed to acknowledge questions about the CDC data as of yet.\"\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time that the networks have promoted Michelle Obama\u2019s Let\u2019s Move campaign without question. On Aug. 26 , NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d backed the program as possibly helping people to think \u201cdifferently about food.\u201d\n\nIn August 2013, when school districts across the country began dropping a government imposed lunch program due to children refusing to eat the food, the networks ignored the fact that the Let\u2019s Move campaign had fought for the program\u2019s adoption. However, the networks had noted that connection in February 2013 before the program was implemented.\n\nOther media outlets embraced the CDC data, not just the networks. The Washington Post, on Feb. 25, promoted the study, and credited the Let\u2019s Move campaign with having a part to play in making that happen. Forbes , however, provided a comprehensive breakdown of the data on Feb. 27, showing that the data was vague enough that it could be interpreted several different ways.\n\nReuters explained that the 43 percent number is in question because of large margin of error rates acknowledged by the CDC, as well as the CDC\u2019s admission that \u201cthere have been no significant changes in obesity prevalence in youth or adults between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters, \u201ceven an increase [in preschool obesity] is a statistical possibility.\u201d\n\nThe CDC has released inaccurate obesity studies before. In 2005 , the government agency announced that 365,000 deaths annually could be blamed on obesity. It later revised that number down to 112,000 and then down to 26,000. Despite the media promoting that study as illustrating the dangers of obesity, the CDC also said that 34,000 people died from being underweight.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "Michelle Obama\u2019s highly touted \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d campaign might not have its first victory after all.
