Abler is one woman's quest to rectify this.\n\nWithout technology, the human body is a pretty limited instrument. We cannot write without a pen or pencil, nor eat hot soup without a bowl and, perhaps, a spoon. And yet, only certain technologies are labeled \"assistive technologies\": hearing aids, prostheses, wheelchairs. But surely our pens and pencils, bowls and spoons assist us as well. The human body is not very able all on its own. My curiosity about how we think about these camps of \"normal\" and \"assistive\" technologies brought me to Sara Hendren, a leading thinker and writer on adaptive technologies and prosthetics. Her wonderful site, Abler, was recently syndicated by Gizmodo. I talked to her about why crutches don't look cool, where the idea of \"normal\" comes from, and whether the 21st century might bring greater understanding of human diversity. You have written and spoken extensively about the idea that \u201call technology is assistive technology.\u201d What do you mean?\n\nScholars working in disability studies have called attention to this as a redundancy in technical terminology before me, and I\u2019m trying to bring it to tech journalism: What technology would not be called assistive? And yet that term stands for a set of devices that are seen as set apart. \u201cAssistive technologies\u201d have largely taken their points of departure from medical aids, primarily because in industrialized cultures, people with atypical bodies and minds have been thought of as medical \u201ccases,\u201d not as people with an expanded set of both capacities and needs. So a lot of the design attention to things like crutches, wheelchairs, hearing aids, and the like have followed the material look and structure of hospital gear. And accordingly, designers and people working in tech have \u201cread\u201d them as a branch of medical technologies and, usually, uninteresting. Scholars and people who are activists for disability rights have spent a lot of energy in the last decades showing that disability is not about the state of a human body; it\u2019s about the built environment, structures, and institutions that make life possible and meaningful\u2014or conversely, impossible and meager\u2014for certain kinds of bodies and minds. In other words, disability studies has worked to transition an understanding of disability from a \u201cmedical model\u201d to a \u201csocial model.\u201d A social model of disability opens up the discussion to consider how design and technologies might be re-imagined for all kinds of bodies, not \u201cassigned\u201d to those with medicalized conditions. By returning \u201cassistive technology\u201d to its rightful place as just \u201ctechnology\u201d\u2014no more, no less\u2014we start to understand that all bodies are getting assistance, all the time. And then design for everyone becomes much more interesting. I think what stands out to me about rethinking technology in this way is not so much what it says about disability and how we think about people with unusual needs, but how it pushes us to rethink \u201cnormal\u201d abilities. Right. It\u2019s a myth that there\u2019s a normative set of capacities anyway! What I want people to see is that starting with design and disability actually opens up interesting design questions with many, many bodies and uses in mind.\n\nTell me more about that myth. The \u201cnormal curve\u201d is a very recent historical way of measuring human capacity\u2014it dates to the early 19th century, with the invention of social sciences, meaning methods for measuring humans as populations, people\u2019s qualities relative to one another. So \u201cnormal\u201d capacities are statistical averages, but of course those change over every single person\u2019s lifetime. So even if at some age you occupy a normative, able-bodied way of hearing, seeing, etc., your body over the lifespan will move in and out of relatively independent and much more interdependent stages. Aging being the profound universal, of course\u2014but also temporary injury, an unexpected change in capacities, and so on. Beyond that, though, it\u2019s useful to consider all the many, subtle, unvoiced \u201cneeds\u201d that all of us are meeting via our technologies and extensions. Social needs, political needs, all kinds of things. Using your phone to avoid an awkward lull in a conversation. Using your headphones to create a kind of sphere of anonymity on the subway. Technology is nothing if not assistive! Its designed assistance is integral to its very coming into being. What I\u2019m interested in is seeing technologies that have thus far been labeled for \u201cspecial needs\u201d get the kind of design attention that mainstream technologies do; I\u2019m also interested in designers and technology developers seeing needs\u2014interdependence\u2014as a fundamentally human social state on a universal continuum. Consider the case of eyeglasses. Graham Pullin, in his book \u201cDesign Meets Disability,\u201d shows how eyeglasses have moved culturally from being a medical aid to a fashion accessory. People who use them are getting \u201cassistance\u201d in a very dependent way, but their cultural register has no stigma attached to it, the way that hearing aids still do. One idea I return to a lot is that the 20th century saw a sort of consolidation of a variety of institutions, which meant in some ways that the needs of the \u201cmainstream\u201d were more easily met than those of people who for whatever reason preferred or needed something more particular. It was an age of \u201cbigs\u201d: big business, big religion, big government, big journalism (even though we don\u2019t call it that). Today we see smaller, niche markets and projects flourishing, both online and off. Do you think that we are changing our attitudes about \u201cnormalness\u201d? Are we getting any better at meeting the needs of people who don\u2019t fit those statistical averages you mentioned before?", "article_metadata": {"description": "All bodies are getting assistance from technology all the time, yet some are stigmatized.
