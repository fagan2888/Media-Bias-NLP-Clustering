Roger Oxendale led Nemours Children\u2019s Hospital through construction of the $400 million hospital, which opened in late 2012.\n\nOxendale is retiring at the end of the year to spend more time with his new grandchild, he said in a statement. Dana Nicholson Bledsoe will take over as president in July.\n\nSee below for the full announcement:\n\nRoger Oxendale, the person who led Nemours Children\u2019s Hospital (NCH) for the past five years, will be retiring at the end of the year. Oxendale and his wife made the decision after welcoming their first grandchild.\n\n\u201cMy personal goal has always been to stay healthy and to have the time and flexibility to enjoy spending time with my family and friends,\u201d Oxendale said. \u201cAs those of you who are grandparents can attest, the arrival of our grandchild has simply sped up our personal retirement timeline.\u201d\n\nDana Nicholson Bledsoe, FACHE, will become the next hospital president and will assume leadership in July. Bledsoe served as president of the 174-bed Children\u2019s and Women\u2019s Hospital, part of the Sacred Heart Health System in Pensacola, Fla. from 2011 to 2013. More recently she helped Nemours develop strategic plans to guide the health system\u2019s operations in both North and Central Florida.\n\nOxendale joined Nemours in April 2010 and oversaw the construction of the $400 million hospital which opened in Lake Nona Medical City in October, 2012. He also helped to recruit many of the world-class pediatric specialists serving at the hospital.\n\n\u201cRoger leaves behind a strong legacy in the team and the facility he helped to create at NCH,\u201d said Robert Bridges, Chief Executive Officer of Nemours Florida Operations. \u201cOver the course of his five years with Nemours, Roger showed great leadership in helping us realize our vision of improving access to world-class pediatric care for the families of Central Florida\u201d.\n\nIn December 2014, NCH was one of just nine children\u2019s hospitals in the country to make the annual Top Hospital List from the Leapfrog Group. This elite distinction is awarded to hospitals nationwide for demonstrating excellence in hospital safety and quality through the Leapfrog Hospital Survey. In April 2015, Becker\u2019s Hospital Review also named NCH as one of \u201c100 Great Hospitals in America\u201d.\n\nNemours has grown significantly in Central Florida since NCH opened. The health system now owns and operates 12 Nemours Children\u2019s Primary Care centers, six Nemours Children\u2019s Urgent Care centers and three Nemours Children\u2019s Specialty Care centers in the region.\n\nBefore working in Pensacola, Bledsoe served as vice president of Patient Care Services and Chief Nursing Officer at Children\u2019s Hospital of Orange County, a 238-bed facility in California. Earlier in her career, Dana held nursing leadership roles at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, University of Massachusetts Medical Center and The Children\u2019s Hospital, Denver. Dana holds a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Loretto Heights College (now Regis University) in Denver; a Master of Science in Nursing Administration from University of Colorado Health Sciences Center; and a Master of Business Administration from University of Colorado at Denver.\n\n\u201cI believe Dana will not only continue the great work already underway in Central Florida but she has the vision and passion to lead us to even greater heights,\u201d said Bridges.\n\nThrough the end of the year, Oxendale will continue to serve as a senior vice president with Nemours, assisting the health system with its plans to grow further in Florida and supporting Bledsoe during the transition. After retirement, Oxendale and his wife will continue to live in Orlando and stay involved in the community.\n\nIn 2014 he served as the corporate chair of the JDRF Walk to Cure Diabetes and the chair of the Golden Eagle Dinner which supports the Central Florida Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Mr. Oxendale serves on the board of the Boy Scouts. In 2013 he served as the chair of the March for Babies, the largest annual fundraising event for the March of Dimes.\n\n-----\n\nWMFE is a partner with Health News Florida, which receives support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The president of Nemours Children\u2019s Hospital in Medical City is retiring this year, the hospital announced today.
