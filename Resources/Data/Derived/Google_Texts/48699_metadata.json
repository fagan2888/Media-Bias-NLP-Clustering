Give your self a laugh and read it below.\n\nThe U.S. government has just passed a new law called: \u201cThe affordable boat act\u201d declaring that every citizen MUST purchase a new boat, by April 2014. These \u201caffordable\u201d boats will cost an average of $54,000-$155,000 each. This does not include taxes, trailers, towing fees, licensing and registration fees, fuel, docking and storage fees, maintenance or repair costs.\n\nThis law has been passed, because until now, typically only wealthy and financially responsible people have been able to purchase boats. This new law ensures that every American can now have a \u201caffordable\u201d boat of their own, because everyone is \u201centitled\u201d to a new boat. If you purchase your boat before the end of the year, you will receive 4 \u201cfree\u201d life jackets; not including monthly usage fees.\n\nIn order to make sure everyone purchases an affordable boat, the costs of owning a boat will increase on average of 250-400% per year. This way, wealthy people will pay more for something that other people don\u2019t want or can\u2019t afford to maintain. But to be fair, people who cant afford to maintain their boat will be regularly fined and children (under the age of 26) can use their parents boats to party on until they turn 27; then must purchase their own boat.\n\nIf you already have a boat, you can keep yours (just kidding; no you can\u2019t). If you don\u2019t want or don\u2019t need a boat, you are required to buy one anyhow. If you refuse to buy one or cant afford one, you will be regularly fined $800 until you purchase one or face imprisonment.\n\nFailure to use the boat will also result in fines. People living in the desert; ghettos; inner cities or areas with no access to lakes are not exempt. Age, motion sickness, experience, knowledge nor lack of desire are acceptable excuses for not using your boat.\n\nA government review board (that doesn\u2019t know the difference between the port, starboard or stern of a boat) will decide everything, including; when, where, how often and for what purposes you can use your boat along with how many people can ride your boat and determine if one is too old or healthy enough to be able to use their boat. They will also decide if your boat has out lived its usefulness or if you must purchase specific accessories,(like a $500 compass) or a newer and more expensive boat.\n\nThose that can afford yachts will be required to do so\u2026its only fair. The government will also decide the name for each boat. Failure to comply with these rules will result in fines and possible imprisonment.\n\nGovernment officials are exempt from this new law. If they want a boat, they and their families can obtain boats free, at the expense of tax payers. Unions, bankers and mega companies with large political affiliations ($$$) are also exempt.\n\nIf the government can force you to buy health care, they can force you to buy a boat\u2026.or ANYTHING else..", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/nj1015.com/files/2012/11/Boats.jpg", "sailthru.author": "irenelenhart", "description": "Jim had this email sent to him from a listener and wanted to share it because it's hysterical and sad, all at the same time.
