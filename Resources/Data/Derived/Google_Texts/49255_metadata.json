Alex Collins, 9, desperately wanted to go hunting, but as he lives alone with his mother who is ill, it seemed like his dream would never come true. When Alex saw an online contest with a prize of a hunting trip with the sheriff of Chester County, he was ecstatic and immediately entered. However, there was one problem. The contest was actually being held 600 miles away in Chester County, South Carolina, not in Pennsylvania as the boy had thought.\n\nAccording to the Herald, Alex wrote a letter to the sheriff holding the contest, Sheriff Underwood, asking for consideration for the hunting trip. Alex noted that he lived at home with his mother and that his mother was ill. Due to her illness, his mother would never be able to take him hunting or fishing and he feared he would never get the chance to live out his small dream.\n\n\u201cI hope you pick me to go. I don\u2019t have anyone to teach me. It\u2019s just me and my mom, and she\u2019s too sick to do stuff.\u201d\n\nNot only did Alex write a letter, but his mom and Alex\u2019s teacher also penned a letter, noting what a spectacular kid Alex really is and why he deserved the special trip. Alex was so excited about the opportunity he hand-delivered the letter to the Chester County Sheriff\u2019s Office in West Chester, Penna., himself. However, Alex\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know that he son would be \u201cheartbroken\u201d and leave the sheriff\u2019s office in tears.\n\n\u201cBut nobody ever heard of Sheriff Underwood when I went to the police station.\u201d\n\nWhen the Collins arrived at the police station to deliver the letter, deputies informed the pair that there was no Sheriff Underwood. Instead the boy spoke to Sheriff Carolyn B. Welsh, who was the county sheriff and had never heard of the hunting contest. Alex\u2019s mother says her son left the station highly upset.\n\n\u201cAlex was heartbroken. He left crying.\u201d\n\nFortunately for the determined little boy, Chief Deputy George March was not to keen on sending a crying kid and his sick mother home without resolve. March contacted Underwood\u2019s office in South Carolina and asked if there was any way that they could work Alex in. Sheriff Underwood said he would be happy to take the little boy hunting and fishing if he could get to South Carolina.\n\nPolice from both South Carolina and Pennsylvania were so moved by the boy\u2019s story that they decided to pitch in and help purchase the boy a plane ticket so that he could have his \u201ctrip of a lifetime.\u201d In fact, Chief Deputy March put the plane ticket on his personal credit card to ensure the boy\u2019s spot would be held.\n\nDuring Christmas break, Alex Collins\u2019 dream came true and he was flown to South Carolina to meet Sheriff \u201cBig A\u201d Underwood and have his big two-day excursion. \u201cBig A\u201d and \u201cLittle A\u201d had quite the adventure and Sheriff Underwood had a soft spot for the child. The sheriff ended up purchasing much of the boy\u2019s hunting and fishing supplies with his own money.\n\nAlex returned from his \u201ctrip of a lifetime\u201d with a new nickname \u201cLittle A,\u201d a bucket of fish, and an even bigger bucket of memories.\n\n[Image Credit: Chester County Sheriff\u2019s Department Facebook]", "article_metadata": {"description": "A little boy from Chester County, Pennsylvania, was excited when he saw an online contest that offered a prize close to his heart.
