Republican primary candidate Ben Carson is changing venues for a Tuesday rally in Arizona in order to accommodate a surge in interest, according to azcentral.com.

Senior campaign strategist Ed Brookover said the retired neurosurgeon has been drawing larger and larger crowds on his campaign stops.

“We think that’s partly because since the debate a lot more people have become aware of Dr. Carson and his message,” Brookover said, referring to the Aug. 6 event on Fox News.

The original site for the rally was Grace Community Church in Tempe, which seats 2,300. The new location is the Phoenix Convention Center, which can hold more than 6,000.

Carson will also make campaign stops on the Mexico border and in Durango, Colo., where the Environmental Protection Agency recently accidentally spilled mining waste into the Colorado River.

A CNN/ORC poll released Wednesday has Carson drawing 14 percent support in Iowa, trailing only Donald Trump Donald TrumpTrump aide: 'Hillary is the one who’s got a gender gap' Trump aide: Picking a woman or minority as VP would be 'pandering' Trump adviser: He will 'soften' on Muslim ban MORE, at 22 percent.
