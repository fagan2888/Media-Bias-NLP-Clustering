They watched their eldest son, Drew, make his debut with the Calgary Flames on Jan. 15 in Glendale, Ariz. Four nights later, Drew\u2019s younger bother, Nick, made his NHL debut with the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 opponents that night were the Flames \u2014 Drew\u2019s Flames. David and Sarah were thrilled to see their boys come out for warm-ups at the Staples Center, even though they knew Drew was going to be scratched for the game.\n\nDrew, who was traded from Florida to Calgary earlier that week, was \u201cbag\u201d skated by new coach Bob Hartley the day before in a \u201ctoughness test\u201d and was still regaining the feeling in his legs.\n\n\u201cWe knew he wouldn\u2019t play. But we\u2019re really fortunate to watch Drew\u2019s first game as a Flame and Nick\u2019s first game as a King,\u201d David Shore said. \u201cThat would have been awesome if both played in the game, but the Flames and Kings play each other a lot. It\u2019s tremendously exciting to see Nick start his career.\u201d\n\nNick began his NHL career in style, centering a line with Jeff Carter and Dwight King for the defending Stanley Cup champions \u2014 on the night of the jersey retirement ceremony for Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Rob Blake.\n\n\u201cIt was crazy out there,\u201d David Shore said. \u201cAnd they knew everything about Nick.\u201d\n\nDrew, 23, and Nick, 22, never have played against each other because they\u2019ve always played on different levels or on the same team. They both went through the U.S. national development program in Ann Arbor, Mich., before joining the University of Denver in consecutive years, in 2009 and 2010.\n\nDrew has 68 NHL games under his belt since signing with the Panthers in 2012 after his junior year at DU. Nick signed with the Kings in 2013, also after his junior year in Denver, and spent his entire first pro season with the Kings\u2019 American Hockey League affiliate in New Hampshire, the Manchester Monarchs.\n\nIf Drew had not been traded to Calgary and Nick not been called up by the Kings, the brothers would have reunited at Monday\u2019s AHL All-Star Game in Utica, N.Y. Drew was selected an all-star for the San Antonio Rampage, the Panthers\u2019 affiliate, and Nick for Manchester.\n\nNick is the AHL\u2019s second- leading scorer with 41 points (20 goals) in 37 games. Drew amassed 30 points (nine goals) in 35 games for San Antonio.\n\nNeither is bound for New York because both are expected to be recalled by their NHL teams Monday. Drew and Nick, both on two-way contracts, were reassigned to their AHL teams for the NHL all-star break in cost-cutting measures. The Avalanche made similar temporary moves with forward Dennis Everberg and goalie Calvin Pickard.\n\nDrew, the oldest of four hockey-playing Shore boys \u2014 Quentin is a junior at DU and Baker is 15 \u2014 was happy to get out of Florida\u2019s organization, which has stockpiled first round-drafted forwards. Drew played 43-of-48 games in the lockout-shortened season of 2013, but only 24-of-82 last season and none this season.\n\n\u201cChange of scenery is going to be awesome for Drew,\u201d David Shore said. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t fit into Florida\u2019s plans. He just wants to be in an environment where he can prove himself and earn his ice.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chambers: Parents of the Shore boys thrilled to share special trip", "title": "Chambers: Parents of the Shore boys thrilled to share special trip", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/24/chambers-parents-of-the-shore-boys-thrilled-to-share-special-trip/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150124__BN20150125_Z00_BNSP25HKNCHAMBERSp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150124__BN20150125_Z00_BNSP25HKNCHAMBERSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-24T16:44:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:56:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cChange of scenery is going to be awesome for Drew,\u201d David Shore said.\nBut we\u2019re really fortunate to watch Drew\u2019s first game as a Flame and Nick\u2019s first game as a King,\u201d David Shore said.\nDrew played 43-of-48 games in the lockout-shortened season of 2013, but only 24-of-82 last season and none this season.\n\u201cIt was crazy out there,\u201d David Shore said.\nDrew has 68 NHL games under his belt since signing with the Panthers in 2012 after his junior year at DU."}
