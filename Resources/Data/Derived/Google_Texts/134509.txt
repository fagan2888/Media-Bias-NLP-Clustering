A private Jesuit university in New York City has come out in support of its theology department chair after he wed his gay partner last month.

Patrick Hornbeck, Fordham University’s chair of theology, and his partner Patrick Bergquist, an Episcopalian youth minister, got married June 27 at St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church in Manhattan, the day after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage across the country, Campus Reform reported.

Fordham said in a statement that while Catholic teachings do not support same-sex marriage, the university wished Mr. Hornbeck and his spouse “a rich life filled with many blessings on the occasion of their wedding in the Episcopal Church.”

“Professor Hornbeck is a member of the Fordham community, and like all University employees, students and alumni, is entitled to human dignity without regard to race, creed, gender, and sexual orientation,” the statement said.
