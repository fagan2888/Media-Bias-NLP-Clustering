The Wall Street Journal said the agency was taking \u201cbroad measures,\u201d while Politico called it a \u201ccrack down.\u201d\n\nSounds serious. So what strong-arm regulations can we look forward to? Well, the FDA has asked pharmaceutical companies if they would pretty-please stop selling antibiotics to help enhance the growth of livestock. You know, voluntarily.\n\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t the drug companies comply? It\u2019s not like 80 percent of the antibiotics sold in this country are pumped into farm animals. Oh, wait.\n\nThe use of antibiotics in agriculture has grown greatly in recent decades (see \u201cYou Want Superbugs With That?\u201d) as Big Ag tries to keep up with the demand for bigger and cheaper steaks, pork chops, and chicken wings. Factory farming leads to overcrowding and the potential spread of disease, which many meat producers attempt to control by giving antibiotics to animals before they get sick. It doesn\u2019t hurt the bottom line that those same antibiotics can also promote growth.\n\nBut bacteria evolve rapidly in the gut of a pig, cow, or chicken, becoming resistant to drugs that are applied over and over. That creates strains of superbugs, which are now escaping the farm and infecting humans. At least 2 million Americans fall victim to antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year, and 23,000 die as a result of them, the government says. This fall, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report concluded that soon, if we\u2019re not careful, we may not have any drugs left that can combat resistant bacteria.
