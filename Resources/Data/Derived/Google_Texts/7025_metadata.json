And even for those Apple customers who have no intention to dabble in wearables, the HealthKit suite was a major point of emphasis during the build-up to the release of iOS 8. Clearly, Apple sees an opportunity in health and fitness apps.\n\nBut someone else might see some benefit in users gathering a lot more info about their health via iOS apps: insurance companies. As CNN explains, health insurance companies aren\u2019t permitted to vary their rates or policies based on pre-existing conditions thanks to the Affordable Care Act, but life insurance companies are free to use whatever data they can gather to determine which of their customers are higher risks to have their families cash in.\n\nIn other words, if your life insurance company sees that you\u2019re in lousy shape thanks to data generated by your iPhone, it might decide to act on that information. No one is coming right out and saying that, of course, but it\u2019s not hard to read between the lines of what a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurers told CNN:\n\nWe don\u2019t traffic in hypotheticals. We have to underwrite using reliable information and sound actuarial principles.\n\nAnd what information about customers could be more reliable than that generated by health apps on their own personal devices? It\u2019s just another example of how all of the data generated by this latest generation of health apps can come with some potential downsides hidden among a wealth of possible benefits.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "App Trigger", "twitter": {"domain": "http://apptrigger.com", "description": "One of the big new pushes during the iPhone 6 launch earlier this month was in the area of health apps, particularly ones that would work in conjunction wi...", "title": "A Possible Downside To Those New Health Apps: Your Insurance Rates", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/333/files/2014/09/HealthKit-logo.png"}, "creator": "@App_Trigger", "site": "@App_Trigger", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "FanSided", "iphone": "FanSided", "googleplay": "FanSided"}, "id": {"ipad": 553311886, "iphone": 553311886, "googleplay": "com.noticesoftware.FanSided"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://apptrigger.com/2014/09/27/possible-downside-new-health-apps-insurance-rates/"}, "android": {"url": "fansided://fansidedblogs.net/app/v2/?id=333&post_id=5904", "app_name": "FanSided", "package": "com.noticesoftware.FanSided"}, "ios": {"url": "fansided://fansidedblogs.net/app/v2/?id=333&post_id=5904", "app_store_id": 553311886, "app_name": "FanSided"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#29aae3", "description": "Apple has been making a big push in the area of health apps, which promise a range of potential benefits.
