Tennessee\u2019s largest city, which for years has failed to save enough to support promised retirement checks, plans to make up that sum by eliminating retirees\u2019 health insurance, which has fewer legal protections. At one point, 558 police officers stayed home, one fourth of the force, in a city that had the sixth-highest incidence of violent crime in the U.S. last year. At the end of last week, 131 were out.\n\nThe workers say Memphis should find money to shore up their pensions by rolling back business-tax breaks, which cost more than the city pays for their insurance each year. It\u2019s an argument unions want to advance nationally to parry challenges to their benefits by cash-strapped governments.\n\n\u201cMemphis is the place where we are trying to change the debate,\u201d said Scott Treibitz, spokesman for the International Association of Firefighters in Washington.\n\nPublic-worker retirement benefits have been a target of politicians since the recession. As investment losses forced state and local governments to deal with a $1.4 trillion shortfall in their pension funds, officials from California to New York rolled back promised benefits they said taxpayers couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nLosing Jobs\n\nMemphis, a majority-black city of 653,000 on the eastern bluffs of the Mississippi River, is the former home of rock and roll legend Elvis Presley and where civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968 during a municipal sanitation worker strike.\n\nThe city has lost 35,700 jobs in the past seven years and loses 2,000 people annually to other cities, according to figures from Greater Memphis Chamber. Now, it\u2019s under pressure to increase retirement contributions after a law passed in April requiring cities to fully fund their annual portions within six years or risk losing state aid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely difficult decision but it\u2019s a necessary decision,\u201d said David Lillard, the state treasurer who championed the measure.\n\n\u201cA hallmark of virtually every distressed plan is that at some point in time they made the decision to skip payments or to underfund payments to the pension plan,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then, once you spend that money in your budget for something else, it gets hard to replace that income back up to 100 percent payment of the annual funded amount. And that\u2019s what\u2019s playing out in Memphis.\u201d\n\nConsequences Delayed\n\nThe city scrimped on contributions before with no immediate consequences. In 2008, it paid about three-quarters of the $21 million that actuaries recommended and the pension was still 104 percent funded.\n\nThe pension was hurt by a drop in stock prices in 2008, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index fell 38 percent. That tripled the size of the contribution the city needed to pay the next year. Memphis continued to underpay. By 2013, the requirement had snowballed to $95 million, of which it paid just 20 percent.\n\n\u201cDelayed payments are always, always going to cost you,\u201d said Adam Tatum, research director for California Common Sense, a nonpartisan fiscal research group in Mountain View.\n\nTax Cut Race\n\nThe Memphis City Council further eroded its financial wherewithal by cutting property taxes to be more competitive with adjacent Arkansas and Mississippi. It threw finances into crisis, said George Little, the chief administrative officer.\n\n\u201cOur expenditures were out of line with our revenues, structurally,\u201d he said.\n\nThe city gave blandishments to business, offering property-tax breaks of as much as 90 percent for as long as 15 years for companies willing to locate in, expand in or simply not leave Memphis. That\u2019s curbing tax growth, state Comptroller of the Treasury Justin Wilson said in a letter to Mayor A.C. Wharton last year.\n\nPolice and firefighter unions have run ads decrying the tax breaks. The argument has resonated with workers and retirees.\n\n\u201cThey kicked us under the bus for their own mixed-up priorities,\u201d said Jim Music, 74, who retired from the police force in 1994 and whose insurance premiums will more than quadruple. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about too much being promised. It\u2019s about mismanagement.\u201d\n\nMillions Foregone\n\nIn a union-commissioned report in June, Good Jobs First, a Washington research group that tracks economic-development subsidies, said the city was losing $42 million a year, or about 14 percent of its property-tax base, through tax breaks for business. The report recommended that the city re-evaluate the incentives, and council members have said they will.\n\nThe Greater Memphis Chamber has pushed back. It released a video defending breaks as a way to counter competition in a market dominated by site-selection consultants who give heavy weight to incentives. The chamber has lobbied to shore up the retirement system by cutting benefits.\n\nThe pension \u201cis cannibalizing our city\u2019s budget,\u201d said Phil Trenary, the chamber\u2019s president and chief executive. \u201cThe only alternative is higher taxes, and we already have the highest taxes in the state. To keep the businesses we have, we have to stop the bleeding.\u201d\n\nWorkers Pay\n\nFor now, the cost is set to fall on the roughly 4,000 retirees, 1,100 of whom are older than 65 and have no Medicare, according to Mike Lee, a spokesman for retirees. The council voted June 17 to stop paying toward their health insurance at year-end and use the money for the pension.\n\nThirteen days later, city police began calling in sick. The protest peaked July 9, when one of every four officers didn\u2019t show up.\n\nWharton declared a crisis. He canceled all scheduled days off for the remaining officers, reassigned specialists to patrol the streets and got help from neighboring Shelby County in policing Beale Street, the downtown blues and restaurant mecca.\n\nThe number of absent officers has dropped since.\n\nPremiums Soar\n\nFor Danny Parris, 54, a policeman who retired last year after 29 years, his monthly insurance premium will rise to almost $1,650 from $350. The cost is more than half his retirement income. The average Memphis pension is about $30,000 a year. Retirees do not get Social Security.\n\nAfter suffering spine injuries on the job, once while diving into a flooded culvert where two children were reported trapped, Parris requires regular medical care. Comparable insurance under the Affordable Care Act is prohibitively expensive, he said.\n\n\u201cMy kids will tell you, I always had a plan,\u201d he said. \u201cI taught them that you had to set a goal and work toward your future. I had reached my goal only to be cast aside.\u201d\n\nWorkers say they hope the council will reconsider its decision this week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying not to panic,\u201d said Richard Walker, 64, a retired firefighter, who said the cost of staying on the city plan will take all but $600 of his monthly pension check.\n\n\u201cThey are just pulling the rug out from under a bunch of old folks who have served years and years,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Margaret Newkirk", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/memphis-cops-call-in-sick-in-new-tactic-to-stop-cuts", "description": "Police and firefighters in Memphis are calling in sick by the scores as a new Tennessee law kicks in requiring cities to stop shortchanging workers\u2019 pensions.", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "title": "Memphis Cops Call in Sick in New Tactic to Stop Cuts"}, "parsely-author": "Margaret Newkirk", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Retirement,Law,Cities,Pension Plan,Tennessee,Memphis", "news_keywords": "Retirement,Law,Cities,Pension Plan,Tennessee,Memphis", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/memphis-cops-call-in-sick-in-new-tactic-to-stop-cuts", "parsely-title": "Memphis Cops Call in Sick in New Tactic to Stop Cuts", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-28T04:01:00.013Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Police and firefighters in Memphis are calling in sick by the scores as a new Tennessee law kicks in requiring cities to stop shortchanging workers\u2019 pensions.", "parsely-tags": "Retirement,Law,Cities,Pension Plan,Tennessee,Memphis,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-07-28T04:01:00.013Z", "parsely-section": "industries", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/memphis-cops-call-in-sick-in-new-tactic-to-stop-cuts", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "type": "website", "description": "Police and firefighters in Memphis are calling in sick by the scores as a new Tennessee law kicks in requiring cities to stop shortchanging workers\u2019 pensions.", "title": "Memphis Cops Call in Sick in New Tactic to Stop Cuts"}, "fb": {"status": "Police and firefighters in Memphis are calling in sick by the scores as a new Tennessee law kicks in requiring cities to stop shortchanging workers\u2019 pensions."}, "parsely-post-id": "N98CUE6KLVS901", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17bc\"", "article_summary": "Tax Cut RaceThe Memphis City Council further eroded its financial wherewithal by cutting property taxes to be more competitive with adjacent Arkansas and Mississippi.\nThe average Memphis pension is about $30,000 a year.\nPolice and firefighters in Memphis are calling in sick by the scores as a new Tennessee law kicks in requiring cities to stop shortchanging workers\u2019 pensions.\n\u201cA hallmark of virtually every distressed plan is that at some point in time they made the decision to skip payments or to underfund payments to the pension plan,\u201d he said.\nThe council voted June 17 to stop paying toward their health insurance at year-end and use the money for the pension."}
