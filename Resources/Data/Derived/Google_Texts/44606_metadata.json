It\u2019s Match Day \u2014 the day they find out where they\u2019re going for residency programs \u2014 the training years between medical school and practice.\n\nIn California, there are 140 residency slots every year in the family practice specialty. That number may diminish, given the pending loss of four funding sources designed to encourage California medical students to join family-practice residencies, particularly in underserved areas of the state.\n\nAccording to Del Morris, president of the California Academy of Family Physicians, California faces a loss of $50 million from the end of these four programs:\n\nThe federal government\u2019s Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education grant program is set to expire this year\n\nAnother federal program \u2014 the Primary Care Residency Expansion is also ending. It awarded about $18 million in grants in California last year to create new resident positions in primary care residency programs\n\nA California Endowment grant supporting the California workforce training program known as Song-Brown \u2014 providing $21 million over the past three years \u2014 ends in 2016\n\n$4 million appropriated last year by the Legislature to add into the Song-Brown fund was a one-time infusion of funds.\n\nThose programs helped fund residency slots and encouraged California medical school graduates to remain in the state for residency. Many people set up practices near their residency program, Morris said.\n\nNo one knows how many residency slots in California might be lost because of dried-up funding, but the Sierra Vista Family Medicine Residency Program in Fresno won\u2019t be enrolling a class of residents this year because they can\u2019t afford it, given that federal funding is expected to end.\n\nAccording to Norma Forbes, executive director of Fresno Healthy Communities Access Partners, \u201cit is estimated 66 percent (of California\u2019s Teaching Health Center programs) are unlikely to be able to support current residency positions in the future without continued federal funding.\u201d That statistic came from a survey of 60 THC residency programs.\n\nEven the status quo of 140 residency slots won\u2019t nearly approach the need for primary care physicians in California, Morris said, especially in rural and urban underserved areas.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not enough,\u201d Morris said. \u201cOne-third of physicians in the state will retire by 2030, our population is growing and millions more Californians have gained coverage under health care reform.\u201d\n\nCalifornia can\u2019t afford to lose more medical students to other states, he said.\n\nOn the state level, Morris said his association is working with the Legislature on budget language that could appropriate an additional $8 million to put into the Song-Brown Fund.\n\nOn the national front, California Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Redding) is leading a bipartisan effort to fund the Teaching Health Center program.\n\n\u201cCalifornians\u2019 health depends in part on a sufficient number of primary care physicians to treat them,\u201d Morris said. \u201cOur state must increase its family medicine training capacity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even the status quo of 140 residency slots won't fill the need for primary care doctors in California.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"California Needs More Primary Care Docs, But Residency Slots Threatened\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/03\\/20\\/california-needs-more-primary-care-docs-but-residency-slots-threatened\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-03-20 10:18:20\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-03-25 10:41:34\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":24651,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Physician Workforce\",\"Primary Care\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/03\\/counties1-e1426527264272.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Even the status quo of 140 residency slots won't fill the need for primary care doctors in California.", "title": "California Needs More Primary Care Docs, But Residency Slots Threatened", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/03/20/california-needs-more-primary-care-docs-but-residency-slots-threatened/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2013/02/PlevinPhoto-e1426871743106.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "physician workforce,primary care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd63\"", "article_summary": "California Needs More Primary Care Docs, But Residency Slots ThreatenedBy David Gorn, California HealthlineToday is a huge day for graduating medical students.\nThose programs helped fund residency slots and encouraged California medical school graduates to remain in the state for residency.\nEven the status quo of 140 residency slots won\u2019t nearly approach the need for primary care physicians in California, Morris said, especially in rural and urban underserved areas.\nIn California, there are 140 residency slots every year in the family practice specialty.\nMany people set up practices near their residency program, Morris said."}
