Hamm's Continental is expected to post a quarterly loss next month.\n\nHamm's endorsement followed President Barack Obama's meeting with Saudi Arabia's King Salman in Riyadh this week.\n\nBy endorsing Trump, Hamm has parted ways with former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican candidate for the White House, who has vigorously opposed Trump's candidacy.\n\n(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder and Sneha Johny in Bengaluru; editing by Terry Wade and Tom Brown)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Harold Hamm, chief executive of shale oil producer Continental Res", "title": "U.S. oil baron Harold Hamm endorses Trump for president", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/22/US-oil-baron-Harold-Hamm-endorses-Trump-president", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ceraweek_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/22/US-oil-baron-Harold-Hamm-endorses-Trump-president", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ceraweek_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Harold Hamm, chief executive of shale oil producer Continental Res", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe047c\"", "article_summary": "\"Such an honor to get the endorsement of Harold Hamm, one of the great men in the history of the oil and energy business,\" Trump said in a statement to Reuters.\nBy endorsing Trump, Hamm has parted ways with former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican candidate for the White House, who has vigorously opposed Trump's candidacy.\nHOUSTON (Reuters) - Harold Hamm, chief executive of shale oil producer Continental Resources Inc and Mitt Romney's 2012 energy adviser, endorsed U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday, saying he has the \"fortitude to make tough decisions.\"\n\"The next president of the United States must have the courage, determination and intelligence to disrupt politics as usual,\" Hamm wrote in a public letter.\nHamm's endorsement followed President Barack Obama's meeting with Saudi Arabia's King Salman in Riyadh this week."}
