She now lives in Denver, Colorado, with her husband.\n\nIn 2016, Hadley was named to Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in Law and Policy. In 2015, the Republican National Committee honored Hadley as a Rising Star, and in 2014, she was named to the Red Alert Politics \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list. Hadley has also completed the National Review Institute\u2019s Washington Fellowship, class of 2012-2013.\n\nHadley appears frequently in radio and TV outlets across the country, including Fox Business' Stossel Show and Cavuto on Business, and Fox News\u2019 Bulls and Bears. Her work has been featured in publications including the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, POLITICO, Roll Call, Real Clear Policy, the Tampa Tribune, National Review Online and Huffington Post.\n\nHadley Heath Manning is a senior policy analyst and director of healthcare policy at the Independent Women's Forum and the Independent Women's Voice. She frequently comments on health care, entitlements and economic policy.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs has 41,500 job openings, according to a recent report from USA Today.\n\nWhile the figure is shocking, the concept is not. Sadly this is just one in a series of stories of dysfunction within the VA, and yet another indictment against government-run health care in general.\n\nInstead of remaining trapped in a broken system, veterans \u2013 and all Americans \u2013 should be free to access quality, affordable healthcare of their own choosing.\n\nThe problems at the VA are a mismatch of supply and demand: There\u2019s a shortage. But this problem isn\u2019t unique to the VA. In fact, a shortage of medical professionals plagues our entire health system, largely because of government meddling in the market.\n\nOn the supply side, government controls how many medical residency positions are funded. On the demand side, the government infuses money into programs (the VA, Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare) that increase demand for healthcare services.\n\nPolicymakers who favored Obamacare\u2019s coverage expansion seemingly ignored this mismatch in slow-growing supply and exploding demand, making a shortage all but inevitable.\n\nThe same market realities are behind the VA\u2019s constant inability to serve veterans well. The VA can say all veterans are covered; but actually providing veterans with care is a different matter altogether.\n\nPart of the problem is that the VA pays medical professionals less than other hospital systems do, and it takes longer to approve and start staff in new positions.\n\nVeterans deserve the very best healthcare services our country has to offer, but instead they are getting second-class care.\n\nLast summer, whistleblowers at the VA came forward with information about \u201csecret waiting lists\u201d that had been manipulated to hide deaths of veterans who were unable to access timely care. Of course, Americans were appalled to learn that such a cover-up took place. Waiting lists are one way that shortages manifest; they are common in countries with \u201cuniversal health care.\u201d\n\nSimilar to the VA, other public plans, like Medicare and Medicaid, reimburse providers at below-market rates, and these programs take more time to process claims than private insurance companies do. Obamacare plans are also mimicking these trends.\n\nThis discourages providers from seeing these patients, making it harder for them to get timely care. It also limits their choice in doctors and hospitals (again, similar to the VA).\n\nVeterans, along with those enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare, should be allowed to take their healthcare dollars into the better, freer, private market.\n\nAmericans \u2013 particularly veterans \u2013 know how giving individuals power over the resources that will be spent on them can create better options. For two long, our education system (similar to health care) has been bifurcated into public and private options.\n\nBut we\u2019ve seen how when education consumers are allowed to make choices for themselves and their families, such as through the GI Bill for military personnel or voucher programs for lower-income families, schools respond by offering better services that make sense for those individual students.\n\nJust as this \u201cschool choice\u201d movement has improved education opportunities for millions, a \u201chealthcare choice\u201d policy could allow vets, seniors, and low-income people to choose a private insurance plan and let the dollars follow the patient.\n\nNo one, especially not veterans, should be trapped inside an inefficient, government-run system with thousands of unfilled jobs, long waiting times, and cover-ups to hide death and dysfunction.\n\nOur broader healthcare policy should be a 180-degree pivot from this bureaucratic single-payer approach. Policymakers would be wise to stop ignoring the realities of the market in health care, and start allowing it to work.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
