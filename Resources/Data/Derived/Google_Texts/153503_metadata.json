Night shift workers also sleep less, which can cause metabolic and cardiovascular problems, the authors point out.\n\nThe new study included 1,478 airline employees in an airline screening and prevention program for chronic diseases from 2006 to 2009. A little over half were men. Some were day workers, some were shift workers who did not work on aircraft, and some were in-flight employees.\n\nHealth check-ups at the beginning of the study included diabetes risk screening, lab tests, physical measurements and a questionnaire on lifestyle, work and sleeping habits. Those at risk for diabetes also completed a 16-item questionnaire on how many and what types of meals they ate daily and were offered lifestyle counseling.\n\nHealth check-ups were repeated two and a half years later, when all participants completed the questionnaire again.\n\nThe male employees who worked shifts during the study period, mainly doing aircraft or customer service, were less likely to eat at least one portion of vegetables per day than either day or in-flight shift workers.\n\nWomen shift workers got 12.6 percent of their daily calories from saturated fat, compared to day workers\u2019 12.2 percent. Female in-flight and non-flight shift workers also used more high-fat milk products than day workers.\n\nMale shift workers consumed more calories from fat (33 percent) and saturated fat (12 percent) than the other two groups. In-flight male workers consumed the lowest proportion of fat calories (31.7 percent) and saturated fat calories (11.6 percent).\n\nMore in-flight and day workers had academic or polytechnic degrees than the shift workers, the study authors note.\n\n\u201cOne result surprised us . . . we found that education level did not affect the results,\u201d Hemio told Reuters Health. \u201cIt seems that shift work itself strongly affects workers\u2019 eating habits.\u201d\n\nThe female shift workers also felt more stressed and led a more sedentary lifestyle than the other women employees. The in-flight workers had healthier metabolisms, according to the lab tests.\n\n\u201cThe most important message to other shift workers is that they should be aware of increased risk for chronic diseases and that healthy nutrition may lower the risk,\u201d Hemio said.\n\nTeresa Fung, a nutritional epidemiologist at Simmons College and Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, who has also worked as a dietician, called the study \u201cstimulating,\u201d but said it brought up more questions than answers.\n\n\u201cThe instrument they used to find out what they\u2019re eating assesses food intake all day long . . . not only what they\u2019re eating at work, but also what they\u2019re eating at home,\u201d Fung said. \u201cSo I would be very curious to find out what they are eating when they are not at work.\u201d\n\nFung said workplace vending machines should offer healthier food for workers, refrigerators should be available for healthier foods brought from home and employees should be educated on healthy diets.\n\n\u201cPeople do a fair amount of eating while at work, so availability is an issue,\u201d Fung said.\n\nSOURCE: http://bmj.co/1OXYytZ Occupational and Environmental Medicine, online April 20, 2015.\n\n(By Janice Neumann)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "shift, work, may, promote, unhealthy, lifestyle", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People who work overnight shifts or changing hours may be more prone to poor dieting and little exercise.", "title": "Shift Work May Promote Unhealthy Lifestyle", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/shift-work-may-promote-unhealthy-lifestyle-333680", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/16/shutterstock3006765.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People who work overnight shifts or changing hours may be more prone to poor dieting and little exercise.", "title": "Shift Work May Promote Unhealthy Lifestyle", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/shift-work-may-promote-unhealthy-lifestyle-333680", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/16/shutterstock3006765.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/16/shutterstock3006765.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-16T10:19:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-16T10:15:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People who work overnight shifts or changing hours may be more prone to poor dieting and little exercise."}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt seems that shift work itself strongly affects workers\u2019 eating habits.\u201dThe female shift workers also felt more stressed and led a more sedentary lifestyle than the other women employees.\n\u201cThis makes the population vulnerable to the potential risks of shift work and also very suitable for studying (the) risks,\u201d Hemio said.\nSome were day workers, some were shift workers who did not work on aircraft, and some were in-flight employees.\nWomen shift workers got 12.6 percent of their daily calories from saturated fat, compared to day workers\u2019 12.2 percent.\nNight shift workers also sleep less, which can cause metabolic and cardiovascular problems, the authors point out."}
