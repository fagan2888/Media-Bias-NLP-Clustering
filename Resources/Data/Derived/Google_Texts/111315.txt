More on this House Bill 102: Utility Vehicles/Move-Over Changes

â€” The state Senate voted unanimously Monday night to apply North Carolina's move-over law to garbage trucks.

State law already requires motorists to move over (on a four-lane road) or slow down (on a two-lane road) for police, fire, ambulance, towing and utility company vehicles if their lights are flashing. The Senate version of House Bill 102 adds garbage and recycling collection trucks to that list.

The bill originally added off-road "utility vehicles" such as maintenance or farm carts to the list of all-terrain vehicles that emergency personnel and city and county employees can operate on streets and highways with a speed limit of 35 mph or less.

The bill passed unanimously with no debate, 49-0, and now goes back to the House for final approval of the Senate's changes.
