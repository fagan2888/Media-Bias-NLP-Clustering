While this figure is a decline from 2013's record high of 20 percent, it is still one of the highest rates in 15 years, and represents an increase from both 2012's 17 percent, and 2010 and 2011's 16 percent.\n\nThe rate has hovered between 14 and 18 percent over the last 10 years, indicating the elevated number may be the new status quo, ACHE President and CEO Deborah J.
