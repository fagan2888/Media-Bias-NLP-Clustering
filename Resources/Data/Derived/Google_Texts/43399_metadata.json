But it could be a big boost for the Buffaloes as they head to the offseason.\n\nCU (4-8, 1-7 Pac-12) plays its season finale Saturday at Utah (8-3, 5-3), seeking to give its 15 seniors a career-capping victory and trying to send its underclassmen into the offseason with momentum.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, I want to be able to go home to my family and friends and just know that we ended the season with a win and we didn\u2019t back down,\u201d said junior defensive lineman Jordan Carrell. \u201cThey\u2019re going to talk about this game leading into next year, so we have to end on a good note and I know we can.\u201d\n\nJunior tight end Sean Irwin came to Boulder with many of the seniors and said it means a lot to him to send them out on a winning note. The seniors who have been with the Buffs four years are just 11-37, and those that have been in Boulder for five years are 14-47.\n\n\u201cI feel for them,\u201d Irwin said. \u201cWe need this win, need it bad.\u201d\n\nA win might mean more to CU\u2019s underclassmen than it would to the seniors, though.\n\nThis was a season that started with so much hope for the Buffs, and yet they come to Utah riding a four-game losing streak.\n\nThe Buffs probably face a bowl-or-bust season in 2016, and taking a win into the offseason could be the boost they need.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been intense,\u201d Irwin said of the team\u2019s mind-set this week. \u201cIt\u2019s all about coming out to practice and winning the game today, and trying to do what we were supposed to do all year.\u201d\n\nConsidering their bowl hopes coming into the season, the Buffs underachieved in their minds. Yet several players said they still believe coach Mike MacIntyre and his staff can build the Buffs into a winning program.\n\n\u201cYeah, absolutely,\u201d senior defensive tackle Justin Solis said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been close to beating a lot of good teams and being in a lot of games, and people are really buying into what he\u2019s saying. You can tell with how people practice, how they\u2019re playing.\n\n\u201cWe thought this was going to be the year that things were going to get turned around. Unfortunately it hasn\u2019t, but I feel like with the guys they\u2019re bringing in and the guys that are already here, they\u2019re going to have a good senior class next year. They\u2019re definitely on the upward.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s area college games:\n\nNoon UNLV at Wyoming, ROOT\n\n12:30 p.m. Colorado at Utah, PAC-12\n\n7 p.m. Colorado State at Fresno State, CBSSN\n\n8:15 p.m. Air Force at New Mexico, ESPNU", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado football trying to bow out of season with win over Utah", "title": "Colorado football trying to bow out of season with win over Utah", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/27/colorado-football-trying-to-bow-out-of-season-with-win-over-utah/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__CU_USCFball110p1.jpg", "height": 504}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__CU_USCFball110p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T18:43:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T04:32:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "A victory in Salt Lake City isn\u2019t going to extend the season for the Colorado football team.\nUnfortunately it hasn\u2019t, but I feel like with the guys they\u2019re bringing in and the guys that are already here, they\u2019re going to have a good senior class next year.\n\u201cWe need this win, need it bad.\u201dA win might mean more to CU\u2019s underclassmen than it would to the seniors, though.\nThe Buffs probably face a bowl-or-bust season in 2016, and taking a win into the offseason could be the boost they need.\nThis was a season that started with so much hope for the Buffs, and yet they come to Utah riding a four-game losing streak."}
