Lahren acknowledged that most \u201cMillennial\u201d voters, who are between 18 and 33 years old, lean left politically and on social issues. But she wanted to reassure the folks at CPAC that not everyone in their 20s was a liberal Democrat in the making. But rather than describe what she said, it\u2019s probably best just to let her speak for herself. Here\u2019s what she said\u2026\n\n\n\nAccording to those on the outside we are the party of old, rich, white males. But I have a little bit of a problem with that, because I don\u2019t really fit into that narrow box.\n\nLet\u2019s see, one: Old. Well, I\u2019m 22 years old.\n\nAnd rich, which almost makes me laugh out loud. I grew up in South Dakota, so that\u2019s smack dab in the middle class in middle America.\n\nAnd white? OK, you got me there.\n\nBut unlike my friends on the left, I\u2019m not going to stand up here and apologize for being white, because I am what I am, and I\u2019m sorry, you can keep your white guilt.\n\nAnd lastly, male. Hm. The so-called \u2018War on Women\u2019 is somewhat problematic for someone like me, because last time I checked I don\u2019t hate myself and I\u2019m not at war with myself. Ladies, can we agree on that? Anyone?\n\nSee, women like Sandra Fluke will have you believe the only way to be pro-woman is to lobby for free birth control. But, sorry, hun, I\u2019m a Republican, and I can take care of myself. And besides that, I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t really want the government anywhere near my body or my health choices, because have any of you seen how Obamacare or \u2018healthcare dot dud\u2019 has been working out?\n\nSo, I think we\u2019ve gone through this: Old, rich, white males. I want to remind you, let\u2019s look at the top three Democrats for 2016. You\u2019ve got Hillary, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden? Old, rich, white, and if the pantsuit fits, male too?\n\nI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s an interesting lineup, what do you guys think?\n\n\n\nWatch the video of Tomi Lahren here\u2026\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tomi_Lahren-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "CPAC speaker calls Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren \u2018old, rich, white, males\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42f6\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s what she said\u2026According to those on the outside we are the party of old, rich, white males.\nSo, I think we\u2019ve gone through this: Old, rich, white males.\nOld, rich, white, and if the pantsuit fits, male too?\nSouth Dakota conservative Tomi Lahren at CPAC 2015CPAC saved for Saturday morning one of its rising stars, 22-year-old South Dakota TV host Tomi Lahren, who spent part of her speech addressing complaints about the lack of diversity on America\u2019s right.\nI grew up in South Dakota, so that\u2019s smack dab in the middle class in middle America."}
