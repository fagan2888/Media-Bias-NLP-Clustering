Now that she's gone after a week of suffering, he says shock turned to hatred.\n\n\"I want him dead,\" says Bell. \"That's real talk, that's how I feel.\"\n\nBell tells KAKE News he talked with his fianc\u00e9 on the phone right after she left her friends house a few blocks away from Fairmount Park last Friday night. A short time later she was assaulted and found in flames near the tennis courts at the park.\n\n\"That's somebody's momma, says Bell. \"How could you do somebody like that? It's more than raping her or beating her, but burn her up too? What kind of human being are you?\"\n\nBell was with her at the hospital every day for the past week. She was unconscious almost the entire time until infection took over her body.\n\nHe says the mother of four is in a better place now. She will be remembered as a loving person who had a smile on her face no matter what.\n\n\"She was a kind and beautiful person and she'd do anything for anybody that's why I can't understand why anyone would do her like that,\" says Bell.\n\nBell says the only thing keeping him sane is knowing the suspect is caught, and if found guilty, will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars.\n\n\"That's justice to me. Really, he needs to be put in an electric chair. You don't have to reason to live. You don't.\"\n\nA vigil for the victim is planned for 5 p.m. Sunday at Fairmount Park.\n\nAlso, If you would like to donate to the victim's family, you can drop off donations at any Credit Union of America branch, under the name \"A Loving Mother.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The victim's fianc\u00e9 Marty Bell says hearing about the crime left him in shock.
