Now he\u2019s running for the presidency\u201d in an interview broadcast on Friday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nJeb said, [relevant remarks begin around 2:00] \u201cI\u2019m not all in to this coronation stuff for a guy who came in third in Iowa, who has no proven record, who\u2019s a charismatic guy, but we\u2019re going to elect a nominee that\u2019s going to get the bark scraped off of him by the Hillary Clinton hit machine. I think there ought to be a little time to test all this out.\u201d\n\nThe discussion then turned to the fact that he thought Rubio was experienced enough to recommend him to be Mitt Romney\u2019s vice president. Jeb said, \u201cYeah, except he doesn\u2019t have the experience to make a tough decision.\u201d\n\nAnchor Bret Baier followed up, \u201cBut why recommend him for vice president then, if he didn\u2019t have the experience back then?\u201d Jeb answered, \u201cBecause he would have earned it. Now he\u2019s running for the presidency. Does he have the experience? Name one thing that he\u2019s done. Rick Santorum had a tough time. He ended up coming back with doubling the sanctions against Hezbollah. That\u2019s great. Except he didn\u2019t even show up for the vote. That was it. Or the the risk corridor vote to amend Obamacare. great idea. I\u2019m totally supportive of it. Except he took credit for something he didn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nJeb added, after Baier pressed why he would recommend someone who\u2019s inexperienced to be next in line to be president, Jeb stated, \u201cI\u2019m running for president of the United States right now. I\u2019m comparing myself to Marco Rubio. I\u2019m not comparing Marco Rubio to other candidates, who are perhaps going to be vice presidential candidates. And that\u2019s the point I\u2019m making. I have a proven record. You can look at what did, and get some insurance that I have the ability to make a tough decision, that I won\u2019t cut and run, that I can forge consensus. I have the toughness necessary to be president of the United States.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb: Rubio 'Would Have Earned It' As Mitt's VP, Now He's Running for POTUS, His Claims On Hezbollah, Obamacare Aren't True", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jeb: Rubio 'Would Have Earned It' As Mitt's VP, Now He's Running for POTUS, His Claims On Hezbollah, Obamacare Aren't True", "title": "Jeb: Rubio 'Would Have Earned It' As Mitt's VP, Now He's Running for POTUS, His Claims On Hezbollah, Obamacare Aren't True - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Jeb-25-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/02/05/jeb-rubio-would-have-earned-it-as-mitts-vp-now-hes-running-for-potus-his-claims-on-hezbollah-obamacare-arent-true/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeb: Rubio 'Would Have Earned It' As Mitt's VP, Now He's Running for POTUS, His Claims On Hezbollah, Obamacare Aren't True", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Jeb-25-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Jeb: Rubio 'Would Have Earned It' As Mitt's VP, Now He's Running for POTUS, His Claims On Hezbollah, Obamacare Aren't True - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Jeb", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Marco Rubio", "published_time": "2016-02-05T18:26:57-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Now he\u2019s running for the presidency\u201d in an interview broadcast on Friday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\nI\u2019m not comparing Marco Rubio to other candidates, who are perhaps going to be vice presidential candidates.\nI have the toughness necessary to be president of the United States.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\nExcept he took credit for something he didn\u2019t do.\u201dJeb added, after Baier pressed why he would recommend someone who\u2019s inexperienced to be next in line to be president, Jeb stated, \u201cI\u2019m running for president of the United States right now.\nI think there ought to be a little time to test all this out.\u201dThe discussion then turned to the fact that he thought Rubio was experienced enough to recommend him to be Mitt Romney\u2019s vice president."}
