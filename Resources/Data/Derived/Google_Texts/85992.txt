In what passes for campaign humor, Hillary Clinton mocked New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's sluggishness in endorsing her, and her own difficulty using a subway MetroCard, late Saturday night.

She and the mayor both appeared at the Inner Circle, an annual black-tie dinner attended by New York City media and government types.

Clinton walked on stage as Mayor de Blasio was performing his portion of the show, which also featured Leslie Odom Jr., from the cast of the Broadway smash "Hamilton."



"Thanks for the endorsement, Bill," she said. "Took you long enough."

"Sorry, Hillary," De Blasio said. "I run on C.P. time."

"Cautious politician time," she said. "OK, there are a lot of things I could ask you of international, national, city and state importance," she said.



"Will you just fix those MetroCard slots? It took me like five swipes," she said. "Fix the turnstiles."

"We'll get right on it," de Blasio said. "Absolutely."

Neither mentioned that the only reason Clinton was in the subway was because Bernie Sanders, her rival for the Democratic nomination, mistakenly said in a Daily News interview that he used a token to ride a subway last year. Tokens were discontinued in 2003.



"Well, you are my second-favorite guy named Bill," Clinton told the mayor.



"Thank you very much. I got your back," he said.

Then Odom spoke up: "Do not forget to vote in the New York State primary."

"Thanks so much," Clinton said. "But please can somebody get me tickets to 'Hamilton'?"

Sanders already has bested her on the "Hamilton" front. He took his wife, Jane, to see the musical on Friday night.
