Tom Coburn (R-OK), who served 10 years in the Senate and 6 years in the House of Representatives before retiring in January 2015, offered up candidly negative comments about the 2016 Republican presidential field.\n\nIn an interview with conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow last week, Coburn trashed nearly every GOPer running for president, calling them \u201cnot ready for primetime,\u201d lacking \u201cintegrity,\u201d not \u201ccapable,\u201d and saying he wouldn\u2019t support one of them even if he won the nomination. Wilkow acknowledged the impact of Coburn\u2019s words, noting that \u201conce you retire, you can speak your mind in a way that might be different than if you were still sitting in the Senate.\u201d\n\nListen to the interview, with the relevant portion beginning at 5:43:\n\nHere are Coburn\u2019s individual takes on the Republican presidential candidates (emphases added):\n\nRand Paul: \u201cScares me to death on international foreign policy. Know him well, very smart. Think he was totally wrong on NSA. Didn\u2019t speak truthfully about what was actually the facts. Would not vote for him for president.\u201d Marco Rubio: \u201cOf all that are out there right now, probably my favorite.\u201d Scott Walker: \u201cNot ready for primetime, in my opinion. You look at what happened in Wisconsin in terms of him beating the recall and everything else, he didn\u2019t do that. The Republicans around the country did it for him. They pulled him out of the fire. I just don\u2019t think he\u2019s quite ready for primetime, in my opinion.\u201d Ben Carson: \u201cI have a personal bone to pick with him on integrity that I witnessed. He made a commitment at the Prayer Breakfast not to attack the president. The speech was nothing but an attack on the president. The people who organized the Prayer Breakfast asked him not to do that. He said he would not, and then he went out and did it.\u201d George Pataki: \u201cProbably smart enough, but would never encounter the votes. Nor does he have the conservative fiscal credentials or other credentials he would need to have a coalition behind him, in my opinion.\u201d Rick Perry: \u201cGood guy. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s capable at that level.\u201d Lindsey Graham: \u201cLove him, but he\u2019s right in the middle, so I don\u2019t see how he builds a coalition. I think his effort is try to talk about foreign policy and that\u2019s what he ought to stick to.\u201d Carly Fiorina: \u201cSmart lady. I helped her in her Senate campaign of which she was ultimately unsuccessful, but it\u2019s because she could never get into good debates. Smart, savvy, experienced. Knows the issues that I\u2019ve been talking about. Presents well. Doesn\u2019t have a voting record. They\u2019ll trash her bigtime because of her Hewlett-Packard experience.\u201d Ted Cruz: \u201cNot ready for primetime.\u201d Mike Huckabee: \u201cPossibility. Good guy, well-rounded. Could fit in the middle and could attract votes from both sides.\u201d Rick Santorum: \u201cLove him as a man. I think he feels called to try to do this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s within his reach.\u201d Chris Christie: \u201cDon\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t followed him well. I saw his tollgate problems. I like the fact that he answers questions correctly, which very few candidates do. I like the fact that he\u2019ll take a risk and give you an answer that\u2019s not politically popular.\u201d Jeb Bush: \u201cI don\u2019t think America will elect another Bush president. I talk to a lot of liberals all the time. They still loathe George Bush. And so you shut out 47 percent of the electorate with that nomination. So you only get to lose three or four percent. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a possibility.\u201d\n\nCoburn has also called out his own party for its relentless quest to defund Obamacare, saying it took them \u201caway from the larger picture.\u201d He also dismissed 2013 legislation designed to defund health care reform as \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201chype.\u201d Said Coburn, \u201cIt\u2019s a terribly dangerous and not successful strategy.\u201d\n\nStill, lest he come off as a milquetoast conservative, Coburn is still the same man who warned of \u201crampant lesbianism\u201d in Oklahoma schools, said that breaching the debt ceiling wouldn\u2019t result in a default, believed doctors who perform abortions should be executed, and thought the Second Amendment should allow people to buy bazookas.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "He trashed most of the Republican presidential contenders in a surprisingly blunt interview.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "He trashed most of the Republican presidential contenders in a surprisingly blunt interview.", "title": "Former GOP Senator Trashes Party\u2019s Presidential Field: \u2018Scares Me To Death,\u2019 \u2018Not Ready For Primetime\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/06/09/3667555/coburn-gop-presidential-candidates/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tom-Coburn-2010-1024x844.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He trashed most of the Republican presidential contenders in a surprisingly blunt interview.", "title": "Former GOP Senator Trashes Party\u2019s Presidential Field: \u2018Scares Me To Death,\u2019 \u2018Not Ready For Primetime\u2019", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tom-Coburn-2010-1024x844-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@smkeyes", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tom-Coburn-2010-1024x844.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tom-Coburn-2010-1024x844.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-09T11:51:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s capable at that level.\u201d Lindsey Graham: \u201cLove him, but he\u2019s right in the middle, so I don\u2019t see how he builds a coalition.\nPolitics Former GOP Senator Trashes Party\u2019s Presidential Field: \u2018Scares Me To Death,\u2019 \u2018Not Ready For Primetime\u2019 CREDIT: APRegardless of their actual feelings, politicians tend to praise their colleagues in public as a matter of decorum, especially those in the same political party.\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s within his reach.\u201d Chris Christie: \u201cDon\u2019t know.\nI just don\u2019t think he\u2019s quite ready for primetime, in my opinion.\u201d Ben Carson: \u201cI have a personal bone to pick with him on integrity that I witnessed.\nThey\u2019ll trash her bigtime because of her Hewlett-Packard experience.\u201d Ted Cruz: \u201cNot ready for primetime.\u201d Mike Huckabee: \u201cPossibility."}
