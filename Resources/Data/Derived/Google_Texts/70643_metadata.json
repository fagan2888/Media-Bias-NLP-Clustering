The people I represent have no confidence in this leadership.\u201d\n\nThis cardboard @50cent arrived in my office shortly after the conclusion of reading his book in the Senate chamber. pic.twitter.com/c9ua9HeXbX \u2014 MariaChappelleNadal (@MariaChappelleN) April 26, 2016\n\nThe senator took to the streets of Ferguson following Brown\u2019s death and was teargassed by police on multiple occasions.\n\n\u201cI felt violated in every single way,\u201d she said after the event.\n\nRead more\n\nSt Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar previously told a House committee that if there had been two police officers in the car when Michael Brown was killed, he believes Brown would not have died.\n\n\u201cTwo officers can do a job much more safely than one,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD MORE: Beyond Ferguson - The reality of Black persecution & colonization in 2016\n\n\n\nSenator Dave Schatz urged the senator to allow the legislation to move forward, saying voters could decide if they agreed with the tax structure, but when she refused, he removed the measure from the floor, bringing an end her 40-minute filibuster.\n\nLater the same day, the state\u2019s House of Representatives passed a similar bill, which goes to the Senate for a vote.\n\nBrown was shot by police officer Darren Wilson in 2014. The grand jury found that the incident took 90 seconds, from Wilson seeing Brown until the final shot was fired.\n\nWilson shot at the 18 year old 12 times with seven shots hitting him.\n\nMichael Brown's family officially confirms lawsuit against Darren Wilson http://t.co/B07fY31mnFpic.twitter.com/MktpKdZrb1 \u2014 RT (@RT_com) March 6, 2015\n\nThe US Justice Department's report about the shooting ruled that Ferguson police practices \"are shaped by revenue rather than by public safety needs\u201d, which both reflects and exacerbates \u201cexisting racial bias, including racial stereotypes.\u201d\n\nRacist emails sent by police and the use of arrest warrants to take money away from citizens, particularly those who are poor, were cited as examples of that bias.\n\nJim Crow just got sneakier over the years. Housing segregation, police profiling, taxes disguised as fines. #Racismhttps://t.co/oNVySUuQdT \u2014 Sacul Sacul (@SaculSacul) May 26, 2015\n\nThe report also featured the story of an African-American woman who parked illegally and got hit with a fine and fees. She was later charged with failure to appear offenses, leading to an arrest warrant and new fines. The court refused to take payments until she had the full amount. She ended up spending six days in jail and paid more than $500, all for a parking violation.\n\nSome 67 percent of African Americans accounted for up to 93 percent of arrests made between 2012 and 2014.\n\nAmerica's Longest Filibusters\n\nWhile Chappelle-Nadal\u2019s 40 minute filibuster is believed to be the first featuring a 50 Cent book, it was relatively short compared to some of the longest ones in history.\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders gave an eight-and-a-half-hour filibuster in 2010 against the extension of Bush tax cuts, which he said benefited the wealthy.\n\nHe railed against Wall Street and the national debt, and read letters from constituents who were affected by the recession during his speech.\n\nRand Paul\n\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul talked for close to 13 hours three years ago, speaking out against CIA director nominee John Brennan. Paul was attempting to draw attention to the Obama administration\u2019s refusal to rule out the possibility of using drone strikes on US citizens, even though they already had as early as 2011.\n\nAt one stage, he asked if they would take out Vietnam war activist Jane Fonda.\n\nTed Cruz\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is a filibuster fan. The self-proclaimed \u2018outsider\u2019 talked for more than 20 hours in 2013 to protest Obamacare.\n\nAshton Kutcher, White Castle burgers, and Duck Dynasty were all mentioned during the course of his speech. He even did an impression of Darth Vader.\n\nStrom Thurmond\n\nThe longest-ever filibuster came from South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond in 1957 to block the Civil Rights Act. The segregationist politician talked for more than 24 hours to prevent passing the act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Missouri state senator used a book by rapper 50 Cent during her Monday filibuster of a sales tax proposal that\u2019s being pushed as a reaction to the US Justice Department\u2019s report on police violence in Ferguson.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "A Missouri state senator used a book by rapper 50 Cent during her Monday filibuster of a sales tax proposal that\u2019s being pushed as a reaction to the US Justice Department\u2019s report on police violence in Ferguson.", "title": "50 Cent filibuster: Rapper\u2019s self-help book used to thwart post-Ferguson sales tax hike", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/2016.04/article/571f8c8cc36188960a8b45af.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/341015-50-cent-filibuster-ferguson/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "A Missouri state senator used a book by rapper 50 Cent during her Monday filibuster of a sales tax proposal that\u2019s being pushed as a reaction to the US Justice Department\u2019s report on police violence in Ferguson.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/2016.04/article/571f8c8cc36188960a8b45af.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Wilson shot at the 18 year old 12 times with seven shots hitting him.\nThe grand jury found that the incident took 90 seconds, from Wilson seeing Brown until the final shot was fired.\nStrom ThurmondThe longest-ever filibuster came from South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond in 1957 to block the Civil Rights Act.\nA Missouri state senator used a book by rapper 50 Cent during her Monday filibuster of a sales tax proposal that\u2019s being pushed as a reaction to the US Justice Department\u2019s report on police violence in Ferguson.\npic.twitter.com/c9ua9HeXbX \u2014 MariaChappelleNadal (@MariaChappelleN) April 26, 2016The senator took to the streets of Ferguson following Brown\u2019s death and was teargassed by police on multiple occasions."}
