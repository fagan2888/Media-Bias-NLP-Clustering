Seattle — The 12th-seeded Wisconsin women's volleyball team was the lowest seed ever to make it the NCAA Division I championship match, but the scrappy Badgers weren't happy just to be there Saturday night.

So a four-set loss to Big Ten rival Penn State was tough to swallow.

"Everybody out there saw out there that as a team, we weren't just happy to be playing in this match," UW first-year coach Kelly Sheffield said. "A lot of emotions in the locker room. They expected to win, they played to win. Not a whole lot of people thought we had a chance to do that, but our players did."

Micha Hancock hit two straight aces to pave the way for Deja McClendon's match point, a soft hit over the net that fell unanswered as second-seeded Penn State claimed its sixth crown with a 25-19, 26-24, 20-25, 25-23 victory.

"People say you can't put it into words," said Hancock, who helped the Nittany Lions rally from a 23-20 deficit in the decisive set. "And you really can't."

The Nittany Lions (34-3) piled up as streamers rained down at KeyArena before a crowd of 14,779, the third-most ever for the title match. During the celebration, UW's players returned to applaud the champions.

UW (28-10) won the third set and strung together a four-point run to go up, 17-15, in the fourth. Ellen Chapman's ace made it 22-19, but a missed serve by Annemarie Hickey — who had injured her shoulder earlier in the set — hurt the Badgers. Hancock's ace narrowed it to 23-22, and Katie Slay's kill evened it.

Hancock had another ace before McClendon's tap arced over the net and dropped untouched.

The Nittany Lions beat UW twice in straight sets during the regular season. Overall, Penn State has a 43-7 advantage, including 3-0 in postseason play.

"I thought it was a great match," Penn State coach Russ Rose said. "All three times we played Wisconsin was a battle. They play great defense, play really hard, passionate kids.

"It's hard to advance through the tournament. Texas was defending champion; they ran into a real hot team. We knew that was the case."
