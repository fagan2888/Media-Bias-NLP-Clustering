Amino, as a company with a mission to give the clearest picture of health care for all Americans, has surpassed these guidelines and will be receiving data, totaling around 3 billion Medicare claims data under parts A, B, and D per year since 2009, in early 2016.\n\nIn order to achieve QE status, Amino is implementing the highest levels of data security and patient privacy, while also providing consumers with meaningful information to help them make informed decisions. With sensitive handling of both de-identified and identified patient data at a national level, Amino is able to track health care longitudinally to shed light on health conditions and procedures over time and across providers.\n\nIn addition to making valuable health care insights more accessible to everyone, Amino recognizes a huge opportunity to help define what quality care means for consumers with the newfound Medicare data. As such, it has convened a committee of prominent stakeholders representing patients, providers, payers, employers, and suppliers, which is under review to become one of the nation\u2019s first Consensus Based Entities (CBE) authorized to review and endorse quality-of-care measures using Amino\u2019s unprecedented commercial and Medicare data.\n\nAmino launched in October 2015 to help people make confident, data-driven health care decisions. Its first service, available at Amino.com, helps people find doctors experienced with their needs and suitable to their preferences. The company will soon provide answers to a wider range of health care questions, including procedures, treatment options, and costs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Digital health startup Amino Continues to Expand its Free, Data-Driven Service to Help Consumers Make More Confident Decisions about Their Health Care", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"description": "Digital health startup Amino Continues to Expand its Free, Data-Driven Service to Help Consumers Make More Confident Decisions about Their Health Care", "title": "CMS Awards Startup Amino Access to Physician-Level Medicare Claims Data", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 901, "identifier": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital-health-startup-amino.png", "height": 646}, "updated_time": "2015-12-16T02:02:31-04:00", "url": "http://hitconsultant.net/2015/12/16/30865/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Digital health startup Amino Continues to Expand its Free, Data-Driven Service to Help Consumers Make More Confident Decisions about Their Health Care", "creator": "@hitconsultant", "image": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital-health-startup-amino.png", "title": "CMS Awards Startup Amino Access to Physician-Level Medicare Claims Data", "site": "@hitconsultant", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "google-site-verification": "ZfA9TYzJhTo4Qq5hZKk2GVBYHj0-7Bu73PO0P5jbDaI", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/HIT-Consultant-Media/302199219847409", "section": "Health IT", "tag": "Amino", "published_time": "2015-12-16T09:00:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-16T02:02:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The company will soon provide answers to a wider range of health care questions, including procedures, treatment options, and costs.\nAmino launched in October 2015 to help people make confident, data-driven health care decisions.\nIn addition to making valuable health care insights more accessible to everyone, Amino recognizes a huge opportunity to help define what quality care means for consumers with the newfound Medicare data.\nWith sensitive handling of both de-identified and identified patient data at a national level, Amino is able to track health care longitudinally to shed light on health conditions and procedures over time and across providers.\nIn order to achieve QE status, Amino is implementing the highest levels of data security and patient privacy, while also providing consumers with meaningful information to help them make informed decisions."}
