Justices agree to review another ObamaCare challenge\n\nThe Supreme Court is wading back into the battle over ObamaCare. The high court, which upheld the law's individual mandate to buy insurance last year, agreed on Tuesday to review a provision requiring private companies to offer coverage of birth control and other reproductive health benefits with no co-pay. Appeals courts have sided with employers who say some treatments, such as morning-after pills designed to prevent embryos from implanting, violate their religious beliefs.

The U.S. and Japan defy China's new airspace claims\n\nThe U.S. sent two unarmed B-52 bombers on a training mission over disputed islands in the East China Sea on Tuesday in defiance of China's newly declared airspace defense zone. Japanese airlines also ignored Beijing's claim to the airspace and flew through on Wednesday, without notifying Beijing. The provocative moves intensified a standoff between China and Japan over which country controls the area, and experts in U.S.-China relations said Beijing would be forced to respond if the flights continue.

Government moves to limit non-profits' political spending\n\nThe Obama administration is proposing new rules to curb the political activities of tax-exempt non-profit groups. The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service want to spell out more clearly what constitutes political spending \u2014 such as TV ads or get-out-the-vote drives \u2014 and put limits on how much of it non-profits can do. The move threatens to drag the IRS deeper into partisan politics, as some Republicans complain it will encourage attacks on free speech by administration opponents.

Storm fouls up Thanksgiving plans\n\nThe deadly and messy winter storm that is fouling up Thanksgiving travel plans on the East Coast is threatening to disrupt another holiday tradition \u2014 the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. The sloppy mix of snow, rain, and winds gusting to 36 miles per hour has already forced the cancelation of hundreds of airline flights. Parade organizers say if the nasty conditions continue through Thursday they could also force the grounding of the parade's giant flying balloons depicting Snoopy, SpongeBob, and other cartoon favorites.

Pope Francis attacks the \"tyranny\" of unchecked capitalism\n\nPope Francis, in a statement outlining his papacy's mission, called unchecked capitalism a \"new tyranny\" plaguing the world's poor. \"We... have to say thou shalt not to an economy of exclusion and inequality. Such an economy kills,\" said the Pope, who has drawn admirers in and out of the church for his modest ways and defense of the poor. He called on world leaders to fight poverty and overhaul the global financial system to share the world's wealth more evenly. \"Money must serve,\" he said, \"not rule!\" [Associated Press]\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n6. CBS News star Lara Logan is put on leave\n\nLara Logan, a high-profile CBS News correspondent, has been placed on leave for using a discredited source in 60 Minutes' October report on the Benghazi attack. Logan told an account of the attack, which left ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans dead, by security contractor Dylan Davies, even though he had told his employer he was not at the scene. CBS didn't say whether Logan \u2014 or producer Max McClellan, who was also suspended \u2014 would be out, or whether she would still be paid.

A once-distant comet zooms close to the sun\n\nComet ISON, which soared far out on the edge of the solar system for 4.5 billion years, will make a spectacular fly-by past the sun on Thursday. Some scientists believe the comet will burn up as it nearly grazes the sun, but they are also pretty sure that it will provide a never-before-seen glimpse of some of the building blocks that formed planets. If the comet survives, it could provide an impressive light show in the early December night sky.
