Dina Titus, a Democrat who is running for re-election in the 1st Congressional District.\n\n\u201cThere are only 18 physicians in Congress,\u201d said Teijeiro, \u201cbut there are 173 lawyers.\u201d\n\nThat is worrisome, Teijeiro says, at a time when the United States is faced with its first cases of Ebola, with possibly more to emerge in the near future, perhaps because of missteps.\n\n\u201cWe have a major disease that has entered our borders,\u201d Teijeiro says. \u201cYet Congress will not suspend its [election] activities to take care of the people of this nation. They should be bringing attention to all that needs to be done to prevent an outbreak.\u201d\n\nTeijeiro says that members of Congress should learning about the disease, methods of dealing with it, and allocating funding to it.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t need to be dying,\u201d she says, adding that on the campaign trail and in media interviews she has been speaking about Ebola and precautions that Americans should take.\n\nThere was a misperception, she says, that Ebola was a third world problem, something that proliferates there because of a lack of resources and knowledge about fighting diseases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not Africa, but the virus doesn\u2019t care whether it\u2019s in the United States, or Liberia or the Sudan,\u201d Teijeiro says. \u201cIt\u2019s a virus, it has one single purpose \u2013 to reproduce itself, and killing the host in the process doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Teijeiro defeated lawyer Jose Padilla in a competitive GOP primary.\n\nBut Teijeiro faces a tough challenge in the general election.\n\nDemocrats have a 2-to-1 registration advantage, and the only Republican to ever hold the seat was former U.S. Rep. and Sen. John Ensign.\n\nTeijeiro says she\u2019s also running because she feels Nevada\u2019s congressional delegation needs ethnic diversity. She has accused Titus of and Democrats in general of not being sincere when they say they care about Latinos and immigration reform.\n\nThe Democrats, and President Barack Obama, prioritized passing the Affordable Care Act over reforming immigration, Teijeiro says. Immigration reform, Teijeiro argues, is more urgently needed, and will affect many more people, than the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Las Vegas Review-Journal said that if she succeeds, Teijeiro would be Nevada\u2019s first Hispanic congressional representative.\n\nTeijeiro says that she supports a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants who work, have not committed crimes, and who want to continue to contribute.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "article_metadata": {"classification": "LANGUAGES/English", "dcterms.modified": "2014-10-15 15:49:53 EDT", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/FNL/Politics/0/0/annette%20teijeiro.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Nevada doctor running for Congress says Ebola cases highlight need for health experts in D.C\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/10/15/nevada-doctor-running-for-congress-says-ebola-mishandling-highlights-need-for/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/FNL/Politics/0/0/annette%20teijeiro.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"d65fddf884519410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-10-15T19:49:53Z\",\"tags\":[\"LANGUAGES/English\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "front", "keywords": "United States,Las Vegas,immigration reform,the host,health insurance,Barack Obama,Affordable Care Act,Dina Titus,Rep Dina Titus,John Ensign,Nevada,U S", "description": "Con respecto a los veh\u00edculos el\u00e9ctricos asequibles que te puedan hoy llevar m\u00e1s lejos con una carga, existen ahora mismo dos jugadores muy importantes en la contienda: Tesla y General Motors.
