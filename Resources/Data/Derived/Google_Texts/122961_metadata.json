REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n4262158\n\nFlorida\u2019s largest health insurer is likely requesting rate hikes for Obamacare plans in 2015 due to \u201ctremendous financial pressure\u201d in the health care exchange, the company\u2019s CEO said Monday.\n\n\u201cWe will be under tremendous financial pressure initially, given the age, risk profile, and high utilization of the new membership,\u201d Florida Blue CEO Patrick Geraghty told Kaiser Health News. \u201cIt is far from clear that large enrollment in the marketplace is a financially beneficial place to be.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s Obamacare exchange has unsurprisingly attracted an older, less healthy customer based than the company expected. Florida Blue, the state\u2019s Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliate, has signed up a third of Florida\u2019s Obamacare exchange customers, but only 23 percent of them were \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d between the ages of 18 and 34. That\u2019s even less than the national average in Obamacare exchanges, 28 percent \u2014 which falls far below the Obama administration\u2019s goal of 40 percent being young, healthy adults.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a concern certainly, as any market would want lower-age healthier individuals\u2026 because it balances the risk pool,\u201d Geraghty said.\n\nFlorida Blue hasn\u2019t released its premium proposals for 2015, but it has submitted a rate request to state regulators for approval. Humana proposed a 14.1 percent average hike for its Obamacare customers in HMO plans, while its PPO plans should expect a 2.2 percent average rate increase; Molina requested an 11.6 percent average decrease. (RELATED: Michigan: Obamacare Premium Hikes Up To 20 Percent)\n\nPart of the reason for Florida Blue\u2019s increased financial struggles is the Obama administration\u2019s decision to allow an extension for health insurance plans that weren\u2019t compliant with the health care law, Geraghty told Kaiser Health News. (RELATED: Tennessee, Louisiana Added To The List Of States Getting Double-Digit Obamacare Premium Hikes)\n\nClose to 300,000 customers were allowed to keep their original health insurance under the extension, and 90 percent did keep them. The pool of customers who may have opted to purchase health plans on the exchange is likely healthier than any previously uninsured customers because they don\u2019t have a pent-up need for medical care.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s current extension was sparked by a national outcry against President Barack Obama\u2019s broken promise that if you liked your health care plan, you could keep it. In states that approved the extension, it will allow customers to keep their noncompliant coverage through October 2016 \u2014 right before the next presidential election. But Geraghty said the last-minute change meant that Florida Blue underpriced their first year\u2019s offerings of health care plans, because they were expecting a larger, healthier group of potential customers.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Obamacare plans are under 'tremendous financial pressure'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Florida's largest health insurer is likely requesting rate hikes for Obamacare plans in 2015 due to \"tremendous financial pressure\" in the health care exchange, the company's CEO said Monday.    \"We w", "title": "Florida\u2019s Largest Obamacare Insurer: Rate Hikes Coming In 2015", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/21/floridas-largest-obamacare-insurer-rate-hikes-coming-in-2015/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2014-07-19T164831Z_1_LYNXMPEA6I0AX_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-e1405975620607.jpg", "height": 269}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare plans are under 'tremendous financial pressure'", "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/21/floridas-largest-obamacare-insurer-rate-hikes-coming-in-2015/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2014-07-19T164831Z_1_LYNXMPEA6I0AX_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-e1405975620607.jpg"}, "title": "Florida\u2019s Largest Obamacare Insurer: Rate Hikes Coming In 2015 Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-21 17:43:53", "sailthru.title": "Florida's Largest Obamacare Insurer: Rate Hikes Coming In 2015", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "florida,obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "florida,obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "sailthru.description": "Florida's largest health insurer is likely requesting rate hikes for Obamacare plans in 2015 due to \"tremendous financial pressure\" in the health care exchange, the company's CEO said Monday.    \"We w", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2014-07-19T164831Z_1_LYNXMPEA6I0AX_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-e1405975620607.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe042b\"", "article_summary": "REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst4262158Florida\u2019s largest health insurer is likely requesting rate hikes for Obamacare plans in 2015 due to \u201ctremendous financial pressure\u201d in the health care exchange, the company\u2019s CEO said Monday.\nFlorida Blue hasn\u2019t released its premium proposals for 2015, but it has submitted a rate request to state regulators for approval.\nFlorida Blue, the state\u2019s Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliate, has signed up a third of Florida\u2019s Obamacare exchange customers, but only 23 percent of them were \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d between the ages of 18 and 34.\n\u201cIt is far from clear that large enrollment in the marketplace is a financially beneficial place to be.\u201dFlorida\u2019s Obamacare exchange has unsurprisingly attracted an older, less healthy customer based than the company expected.\nHumana proposed a 14.1 percent average hike for its Obamacare customers in HMO plans, while its PPO plans should expect a 2.2 percent average rate increase; Molina requested an 11.6 percent average decrease."}
