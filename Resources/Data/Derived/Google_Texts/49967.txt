It's been five years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. Is it working, and how will it impact your health care in the future? Cleveland Clinic CEO Dr. Toby Cosgrove shares his diagnosis.

In boosting his signature domestic policy achievement, President Obama once cited the Cleveland Clinic as a health care model to emulate.

Now, five years since the Affordable Care Act became law, how does that prestigious hospital's CEO think Obamacare is going? In an interview with CNBC's "On the Money," Dr. Toby Cosgrove says he sees some positive change.

"Health-care inflation has come down," Cosgrove tells CNBC. "We've seen quality metrics go up, and we've seen 13 million new people enrolled with coverage. So I think from those three standpoints, we've certainly seen a success."

Since assuming leadership in 2004, the former cardiovascular surgeon has built the Cleveland Clinic into one of the largest hospital organizations in the country. Last year, more than 5.5 million patients visited the clinic and its member hospitals.

Still, all the news hasn't been good for the clinic. The health-care powerhouse has retrenched financially, slashing part of its more than $6 billion annual budget, in what some observers linked to Obamacare reforms.

While Cosgrove declined to give the Affordable Care Act a letter grade, he calls it a "long-term project."

He added: "One of the things we have to do is keep costs down, and we have to sustain it. As more and more people come in and we have an older population, it's going to be more difficult to do."

Cosgrove said that as Obamacare continues, "we will see the effectiveness of maintaining cost controls in health care."
