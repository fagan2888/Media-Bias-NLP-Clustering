The Department of Energy’s (DOE) new deputy secretary Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall has been sworn in.

DOE said Monday that Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz swore in Sherwood-Randall Sunday afternoon at her home.

She is the second in command at the department, replacing Dan Poneman, who had served since 2009.

The Senate confirmed Sherwood-Randall last month after an easy hearing process.

She brings experience in the defense and nuclear weapons side of DOE’s responsibilities, having served most recently as an adviser to President Obama on defense policy.

DOE said one of Sherwood-Randall’s first responsibilities will be a town hall with Moniz for employees and contractors next week.
