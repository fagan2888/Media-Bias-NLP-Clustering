A man charged with three marijuana crimes receives three different verdicts.\n\nAlan Witt, a 27-year-old dispensary worker from Gaylord, Michigan, was charged with delivery of marijuana, possession with intent to deliver marijuana, and maintaining or keeping a drug house. It took the jury less than 5 hours to return with a different verdict on each charge.\n\nWhile Alan was found guilty of the first count \u2013 delivery \u2013 the jury hung on the second count of possession with intent to deliver. So they could decide if he delivered it, but couldn\u2019t decide if he meant to or if he knew it was marijuana? The jury also found him not guilty of maintaining a drug house. In other words, the jury found that the Gaylord Provisions medical marijuana dispensary was not a \u201cdrug house.\u201d\n\nThe case revolved around a confidential informant who said that Witt sold him marijuana at Gaylord Provisions even though he was not his registered caregiver. So the \u201cdelivery\u201d of the marijuana in this case would be Witt allegedly handing the marijuana to the informant. But again, the jury couldn\u2019t decide if Witt possessed the marijuana he handed to the informant.\n\nConfusing verdicts usually come from compromises within the jury. They are not meant to make sense but to find some kind of \u201cmiddle path\u201d between totally guilty and totally not guilty. The jurors could have been torn on just how much they wanted to punish Witt, so they compromised and split the charges down the middle.\n\nBeyond all this is the obvious absurdity of the whole case. A legal medical cannabis patient went into a legal medical dispensary and bought weed, yet under Michigan\u2019s convoluted medical marijuana law, this is not legal because Witt was not the police informant\u2019s registered caregiver.\n\nOne day an adult will be able to walk into a cannabis retailer and buy weed for any reason they want. Medical marijuana will cease to exist, except for minors under the care of their parents and doctor. One day, trials like this one will be a thing of the past.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A man charged with three marijuana crimes receives three different verdicts.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "A man charged with three marijuana crimes receives three different verdicts.", "title": "Man Charged with Marijuana Crimes Gets Three Different Verdicts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/marijuana-reviewer.jpg", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/man-charged-with-marijuana-crimes-gets-three-different-verdicts/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/marijuana-reviewer.jpg", "description": "A man charged with three marijuana crimes receives three different verdicts.", "site": "@thelibrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Man Charged with Marijuana Crimes Gets Three Different Verdicts"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "section": "The War on Drugs", "tag": "weed", "published_time": "2016-02-01T11:07:26+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/Joseph.Klare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a32\"", "article_summary": "Man Charged with Marijuana Crimes Gets Three Different VerdictsBehold: a convoluted waste of time paid for, as always, by the taxpayers.\nA man charged with three marijuana crimes receives three different verdicts.\nMedical marijuana will cease to exist, except for minors under the care of their parents and doctor.\nA legal medical cannabis patient went into a legal medical dispensary and bought weed, yet under Michigan\u2019s convoluted medical marijuana law, this is not legal because Witt was not the police informant\u2019s registered caregiver.\nAlan Witt, a 27-year-old dispensary worker from Gaylord, Michigan, was charged with delivery of marijuana, possession with intent to deliver marijuana, and maintaining or keeping a drug house."}
