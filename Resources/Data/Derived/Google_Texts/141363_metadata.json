David Ake\n\nObamacare\u2019s second open enrollment period is currently underway, but the Americans shopping for insurance plans probably aren\u2019t enjoying it, according to a new survey from financial research group Bankrate.\n\nNearly two-thirds of the participants said that selecting a new health insurance plan is at least as bad as having a cavity filled at the dentist. And more than 70 percent of the people surveyed said that the process is as unenjoyable as doing their own taxes or sitting in the middle seat on an airplane.\n\nCREDIT: Bankrate\n\nIt makes sense that filling out an application for health care isn\u2019t necessarily a thrilling prospect. Like filing taxes, enrolling in health insurance is often an overly complicated process that most Americans don\u2019t understand very well. Previous surveys have found that the majority of Americans don\u2019t understand the most common terms related to insurance, like \u201cco-pay,\u201d \u201cdeductible,\u201d and \u201cpremium.\u201d Even when they think they know how those health care concepts work, they\u2019re often wrong.\n\nPlus, people\u2019s frustrations in this area have likely been exacerbated by Obamacare\u2019s first enrollment period, which was plagued with website glitches that made it difficult for Americans to enroll. The rocky rollout for Obamacare\u2019s new state-level marketplaces \u2014 as well as a constant barrage of bad press for the health law \u2014 has ensured that the Affordable Care Act remains unpopular with the American public.\n\nIndeed, Bankrate\u2019s survey found that the people who have recently shopped for insurance are more likely to rate the experience negatively. For instance, 82 percent of the Americans who selected a plan within the past two years said the process was as bad as doing their own taxes.\n\nBut administration officials are counting on the fact that the marketplaces will run more smoothly this year and consumers will be more satisfied with the enrollment process moving forward. So far, HealthCare.gov doesn\u2019t appear to be having nearly as many technological issues, and people have reported being able to sign up within minutes compared to the hours that it took last year.\n\nPlus, there are people available to help Americans through the maze of insurance jargon. Across the country, so-called \u201cnavigators\u201d \u2014 the people who help guide customers enrolling in Obamacare plans \u2014 are available at retail stores, pharmacies, and enrollment centers. Peter Kochenburger, a professor of insurance and consumer law at the University of Connecticut School of Law, told Bankrate that\u2019s what should make health care enrollment at least a little better than a dentist visit.\n\n\u201cAfter all, you\u2019re not going to fill your own tooth \u2014 there\u2019s help out there,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cIt may not be the most enjoyable 20 minutes, but it\u2019s sort of painless.\u201d\n\nRegardless of where the process ranks among cavities and airplane seats, the people who signed up for Obamacare aren\u2019t done shopping yet. Because of the increased competition in the marketplaces, experts are urging Americans to shop around to make sure they\u2019re getting the best deal, rather than simply automatically renewing last year\u2019s coverage.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Or getting the middle seat on an airplane.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Or getting the middle seat on an airplane.", "title": "Americans Think Shopping For Health Care Is About As Fun As Getting A Cavity Filled", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/12/02/3598360/shopping-health-care-survey/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ACA_application-e1384530142743.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Or getting the middle seat on an airplane.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ACA_application-e1384268027311-321x214.jpg", "title": "Americans Think Shopping For Health Care Is About As Fun As Getting A Cavity Filled", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ACA_application-e1384530142743.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ACA_application-e1384530142743.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-02T14:48:16+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Americans Think Shopping For Health Care Is About As Fun As Getting A Cavity Filled CREDIT: AP Photo/J.\nNearly two-thirds of the participants said that selecting a new health insurance plan is at least as bad as having a cavity filled at the dentist.\nCREDIT: BankrateIt makes sense that filling out an application for health care isn\u2019t necessarily a thrilling prospect.\nLike filing taxes, enrolling in health insurance is often an overly complicated process that most Americans don\u2019t understand very well.\nPlus, there are people available to help Americans through the maze of insurance jargon."}
