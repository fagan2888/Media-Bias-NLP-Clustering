The incident sent me into a frenzied state of paranoia that had me up all night and found me and my partner bleary-eyed early the next morning at the university emergency clinic in my town, in desperate need of some emergency contraception. This was during the days of the Bush administration, before Plan B \u2014 more popularly known back then as the \u201cmorning after pill\u201d \u2014 was available over the counter. To get it required a prescription and to get a prescription usually required a medical appointment and examination.\n\nIn order for me to get Plan B, I had to have a pelvic exam and then sit there while a well-meaning but patronizing nurse subjected me to a speech on how to properly use a condom, complete with a step-by-step demonstration involving a plastic speculum. I was well into my 20s and had used condoms countless times without any problem (as I told the nurse before she launched on her lecture). But sometimes condoms break, which is when Plan B comes in handy. That is, if you can actually get your hands on it.\n\nEven though it was first approved for prescription use in the United States in 1999, Plan B did not become available over the counter until 2006 for women 18 and older. The age requirement was then dropped to 17 in 2009. Age restrictions were finally dropped altogether this past July as mandated by a U.S. District Court Judge \u2014 despite much resistance and an appeal by the Obama administration\u2019s Department of Justice. However, as part of a compromise reached by the court and the DOJ, this ruling only applied to Plan B One Step. Generic brands \u2014 which are often cheaper\u2013would still only be for sale at pharmacies without a prescription for those over 17 and with a government-issued ID.\n\nBut even before age restrictions for Plan B One Step were dropped, research has indicated that pharmacists were misinforming teenagers about the rules regarding its access. At least, those are the findings of a study published in December in the Journal of Adolescent Health.\n\nIn the study, researchers called pharmacies in several different cities around the country posing as teenage girls seeking emergency contraception. Approximately 20 percent of the pharmacy staff they contacted wrongfully informed the callers that because they were teenagers they could not legally have access to emergency contraception at all. Of the remaining 80 percent of respondents, only about half of them got the exact age requirements for Plan B correct.\n\nEven more interesting were some of the other things pharmacy staff told the callers. Many cited ethical reasons or personal religious beliefs for not offering the medication. Other pharmacists inaccurately told the callers that a parent or guardian would have to come with them to pick up the medication (even if they had a prescription) or that an older friend or boyfriend above the age restriction could not buy Plan B over the counter for them. In fact, some callers were even told Plan B wasn\u2019t sold to men, which also isn\u2019t true.\n\nThough this study was conducted before age restrictions for over-the-counter Plan B One Step were dropped, its implications are still current.\n\n\u201cOur society is pretty uncomfortable about sex and very little healthy sexual decision making is portrayed in the media, so there seems to be a lot of judgment in these situations along with all these rules and restrictions,\u201d said Dr. Tracey Wilkinson, a pediatrician at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Los Angeles and lead author of the study.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Emergency contraception is supposed to be available to teens, but pharmacists are telling them they're too young", "author": "Laura Kiesel", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Emergency contraception is supposed to be available to teens, but pharmacists are telling them they're too young", "title": "America\u2019s Plan B problem: The contraception misinformation epidemic", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/09/americas_plan_b_problem_the_contraception_misinformation_epidemic/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/plan_b_shelf.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Emergency contraception is supposed to be available to teens, but pharmacists are telling them they're too young", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/plan_b_shelf.jpg", "title": "America\u2019s Plan B problem: The contraception misinformation epidemic", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "America\u2019s Plan B problem: The contraception misinformation epidemic", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Birth Control, Contraception, Editor's Picks, emergency contraception, Plan B", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9917\"", "article_summary": "In fact, some callers were even told Plan B wasn\u2019t sold to men, which also isn\u2019t true.\nHowever, as part of a compromise reached by the court and the DOJ, this ruling only applied to Plan B One Step.\nTopics: Birth Control, Contraception, Editor's Picks, emergency contraception, Plan B, Life NewsIn spring 2005, at the not-so-tender age of 26, I was on the receiving end of my first (and only) condom malfunction.\nThis was during the days of the Bush administration, before Plan B \u2014 more popularly known back then as the \u201cmorning after pill\u201d \u2014 was available over the counter.\nThough this study was conducted before age restrictions for over-the-counter Plan B One Step were dropped, its implications are still current."}
