A prominent senior advocacy group is urging Medicare not to impose cuts on Medicare Advantage, the private alternative to traditional Medicare.



The Coalition for Medicare Choices, affiliated with America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), launched a new video ad campaign featuring individuals who benefit from the program.



"I have kidney disease. I like to be able to control whatâ€™s going on in my life. I like to make the choices. Medicare Advantage helps me make those choices on my own," said Paula Ercolini, a member of the group, in one clip.



The administration is preparing to propose new payment levels for Medicare Advantage plans this month, and insurance lobbyists fear that the program might see cuts.



The coalition is engaging in a full-court press to discourage that outcome, including meeting with members of Congress, writing letters and holding events around the country.



Some Democrats support cuts to Medicare Advantage, which is paid more per-person on average than traditional Medicare and sometimes includes perks like free eyeglasses.



Critics say the program is taking resources from seniors on the main program and should be cut.



AHIP, meanwhile, argues that any further reductions will hurt seniors by raising costs and lowering benefits.



The payment levels are expected to be proposed on Feb. 20 and finalized in early April, the coalition said.
