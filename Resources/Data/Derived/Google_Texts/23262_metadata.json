It will likely pass the House, but it has no chance of being signed into law by President Obama.\n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski spoke in favor of repealing the ACA on the Senate floor Thursday morning:\n\n\u201cFor whom is the Affordable Care Act actually affordable?\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not the average hard working Alaskan, being forced to shell out thousands of dollars for their premiums each month.\u201d\n\nInsurance premium rates in Alaska on healthcare.gov are among the most expensive in the country. But most people buying insurance on the exchange receive large subsidies to offset the cost. The average subsidy amount for 2015 plans in Alaska was more than $500 a month.\n\nIn the past, Senator Murkowski has said she doesn\u2019t believe federal funds should be cut off to all of Planned Parenthood.
