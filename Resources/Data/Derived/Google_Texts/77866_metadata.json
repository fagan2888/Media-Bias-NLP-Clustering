It allows patients who pay for a treatment out of pocket to limit access to the medical record of it \u2014 and that includes barring your health insurer from seeing it, if you choose.\n\n\n\nNow, this may not excite you if you don\u2019t expect to need treatment for a sexually transmitted disease any time soon. But some people feel deeply protective of their medical records \u2014 and may not have warm and trusting feelings toward their insurers or employers. For an explanation of the new privacy provision, I spoke with Matt Fisher, chair of the Health Law Group at Mirick O\u2019Connell, a law firm with offices in Worcester, Boston and Westborough. Our conversation, lightly edited:\n\n\n\nSo this new HIPAA rule that takes effect on Sept. 23 basically says that if the patient pays for their care, they can keep it from the knowledge of their health plan?\n\n\n\nThe patient can request that services or items provided, that they paid for out of pocket in full, that access to that information be restricted to specific individuals or providers. So that means that they can say, \u2018Don\u2019t share it with this insurance company,\u2019 which request previously could be ignored by a provider. This change modifies the existing rule that a patient can ask for information to be restricted, but doing so is at the provider\u2019s discretion. It is now not optional with regard to health plans.\n\nSo how does this differ from what we already had?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou already had protection from just general disclosure of the information, but there were permitted disclosures that can be made between what are called covered entities: a physician, a hospital or an insurance company. So absent the request that the information not be shared if the services are paid for out of pocket, that information can be shared with insurers without the patient\u2019s authorization, if it\u2019s for payment or health care operations. Those three broad categories allow providers and insurers to interact and each perform their functions. So it makes sense you wouldn\u2019t require authorization for that type of sharing.\n\nBut the new provision says that if the patient has paid for it out of pocket, now you can say, \u2018Don\u2019t share it with my insurer \u2014 they don\u2019t need to know about it because they\u2019re not paying for it.\u2019 Or there could be some other reason you don\u2019t want it shared.\n\nCan you paint a couple of scenarios of how you expect this to be used once people know about it?\n\n\n\nOne example I\u2019ve heard about a lot is if an individual goes in for a treatment of a sexually transmitted disease \u2014 so there might be a feeling of some type of social stigma or some other instance where you might have the feeling of not wanting it shared.\n\nSo anything with stigma?\n\n\n\nYes, if you go in for mental health services \u2014 although there are going to be more restrictions when you deal with those types of records anyway \u2014 but going back to the stigma or fear of someone learning something about an issue you\u2019re seeking help with, you might not want that shared around.\n\nAnd even though Obamacare prohibits denying insurance for pre-existing conditions, mightn\u2019t it, for example, hurt someone\u2019s chances of getting a job if the employer could see treatment for certain conditions on a health record?\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s something that might be feared, that if an employer somehow got that information, although unless the employer is self-sponsoring the insurance plan, or they ask to receive your health record and you give them authorization, it would be hard for them to get the information. Though there are a number of jobs out there where you do have to give authorization, or if you\u2019re applying for life insurance, you have to sign a HIPAA authorization to see your medical record.\n\nSo this new provision would allow you to actually keep treatment you received off your medical record?\n\n\n\nIt would be on your record but I visualize it as a line in a medical record: to the left side is information that will shared with anybody with a valid claim to disclosure, and to the right side is information that can only be shared with XYZ, or this information cannot be shared with XYZ. So it\u2019s still all part of your medical record, but it\u2019s a matter of when and where can that info be shared.\n\nSo you could put on the right side of the line that this treatment you received cannot be shared with your insurer or anyone but the actual treating health care team?\n\nYes, you can restrict it so the insurer can\u2019t see the information, but when you\u2019re filing applications for your insurance you can\u2019t intentionally mislead or you can\u2019t lie about it, because otherwise that opens another door full of issues. If you\u2019re defrauding the insurance company to get the coverage you\u2019re not going to be protected from them being able to rescind the policy at that point.\n\nSo how do you expect this to mostly be used?\n\n\n\nI could see it being used when a patient needs a special test and worries about potentially adverse insurance consequences, such as increased premiums if a result comes out a certain way. Additionally, someone can always ask that a provider not share certain treatment information with others, such as a family member, but the provider will be able to decide if they will comply with the request in that circumstance. The requirement to comply with a request is limited to insurers.\n\nSome people also just feel very, very private about their medical information, so this offers additional gates to get past to get at it\u2026\n\n\n\nYes, but again, while it sounds very attractive, I don\u2019t think it will come into play very quickly. It goes to the general problem that no one can figure out how much anything cost in health care, so how likely are you to pay for something out of pocket? And why pay for insurance and then pay for care out of pocket?\n\nAny other concerns about this?\n\n\n\nOne concern is how capable the records are of doing the segregation. On paper, you can imagine creating say, a red folder that says \u201cDo not share this information.\u2019 But with an electronic medical record, how easily can you create that division?\n\nHaven\u2019t people been doing this anyway? Say, going anonymously to a clinic for STD treatment?\n\n\n\nIf you go to a different provider than your typical primary care provider, there could be some question of whether the record is actually shared, which is a different issue. You also always hear anecdotes from physicians that they\u2019re not always getting the full picture from the patient. So I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been going on to some extent, but maybe this is a way of not trying to find those alternative providers but feeling more comfortable going to your main provider. Though that doesn\u2019t solve the problem of maybe you don\u2019t want to share that information with your main provider. It\u2019s probably always helpful to give your primary care provider the full picture of your health, but I know that\u2019s not always how it goes. I had an extended family member who\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, well, my doctor doesn\u2019t need to know that\u2026\u201d\n\nReaders, thoughts?
