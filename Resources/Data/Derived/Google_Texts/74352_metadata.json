There\u2019s a strong current of denialism among Republicans and conservative pundits as they struggle to explain the rise of Trumpism while begging off culpability for nurturing and enabling the xenophobia and nationalism that power the Trump movement. It\u2019s much less traumatic for them to push blame off onto an external actor, someone who managed to corrupt the movement from without. The outside agitator they\u2019ve settled on is, predictably, Barack Obama.\n\nYou see it everywhere \u2013 Trump is a reaction to Obama\u2019s weakness and detachment, Trump was spawned by Obamacare\u2019s party-line passage, Trump is the product of Obama\u2019s liberal politics, etc. The moderately liberal Democratic president is presented as the most influential figure in conservative and Republican politics, while the actual leaders of the movement and the party are little more than witnesses to its collapse.\n\nIt\u2019s fanciful nonsense that has been debunked more times than should be necessary, but this ridiculous theory managed to bubble up all the way to Obama himself this week. At a press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the president was asked by a reporter about this idea that he bears ultimate responsibility for Trump. Obama rightly dismissed the idea as laughable and placed blame where it belongs: on the Republican leaders who prioritized obstruction over governance and surrendered their agenda to extremists within the party. But he also made a sharp observation about how Trumpism fits in with mainstream Republican politics.\n\nHere\u2019s what Obama said about Trump and the rest of the GOP field, highlighted for emphasis:\n\nOBAMA: He\u2019s just doing more of what has been done for the last seven and a half years. And, in fact, in terms of his positions on a whole range of issues, they\u2019re not very different from any of the other candidates. I mean, it\u2019s not as if there\u2019s a massive difference between Mr. Trump\u2019s position on immigration and Mr. Cruz\u2019s position on immigration. Mr. Trump might just be more provocative in terms of how he says it, but the actual positions aren\u2019t that different. For that matter they\u2019re not that different from Mr. Rubio\u2019s positions on immigration, despite the fact that both Mr. Cruz, Mr. Rubio, their own families are the products of immigration and the openness of our society.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barack Obama makes the wild and crazy argument that maybe, somehow, Republicans are to blame for Trumpism", "title": "Obama diagnoses Trumpism: The president swats down the notion that Trump is somehow his fault", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Barack Obama makes the wild and crazy argument that maybe, somehow, Republicans are to blame for Trumpism", "title": "Obama diagnoses Trumpism: The president swats down the notion that Trump is somehow his fault", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/11/obama_diagnoses_trumpism_the_president_swats_down_the_notion_that_trump_is_somehow_his_fault/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/obama_trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Barack Obama makes the wild and crazy argument that maybe, somehow, Republicans are to blame for Trumpism", "title": "Obama diagnoses Trumpism: The president swats down the notion that Trump is somehow his fault", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/obama_trump.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 GOP primary, 2016 Republican primary, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Elections 2016, Immigration, Islam, Marco Rubio, Terrorism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But he also made a sharp observation about how Trumpism fits in with mainstream Republican politics.\nMr. Trump might just be more provocative in terms of how he says it, but the actual positions aren\u2019t that different.\nThere\u2019s a strong current of denialism among Republicans and conservative pundits as they struggle to explain the rise of Trumpism while begging off culpability for nurturing and enabling the xenophobia and nationalism that power the Trump movement.\nI mean, it\u2019s not as if there\u2019s a massive difference between Mr. Trump\u2019s position on immigration and Mr. Cruz\u2019s position on immigration.\nYou see it everywhere \u2013 Trump is a reaction to Obama\u2019s weakness and detachment, Trump was spawned by Obamacare\u2019s party-line passage, Trump is the product of Obama\u2019s liberal politics, etc."}
