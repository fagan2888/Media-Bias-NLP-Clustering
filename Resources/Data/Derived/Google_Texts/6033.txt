SARASOTA — It was a battle to the last race, and Christopher Alexander came out the victor at the VX One Midwinter Championship, hosted by Sarasota Sailing Squadron. After 10 races, Alexander’s Isabelita Con Queso bested 26 other teams, and added this title to his 2014 North American Championship from last July. Finishing with 34 points and a line of (11),4,2,6,1,4,2,2,6,7, Alexander won by just one point over John Potter, whose 3,5,3 on Sunday fell just short of capturing the victory. Ched Proctor’s Flash Rider placed in the show position with 37 points.

With temperatures in the mid-70s and winds at 10-12 knots with gusts to 16, Proctor took the gun in Sunday’s opening race, with Alexander keeping pace in second and Potter just behind. Bill Griffin’s Kill Bill won the next contest, followed by Jeff Eiber and then Phip Hallowell on Chuck Wagon. The final duel was taken by Donovan Brennan’s Island Smuggler, as Proctor and Potter rounded out the top three.
