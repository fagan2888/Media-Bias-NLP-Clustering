It would\u2019ve been a good segment on Frontline, 20/20, or 60 Minutes \u2013 but asking people to see a piece that tells us how flawed the medical field can be\u2026\n\nThe cameras role at the Los Angeles County General Hospital, and the place is crowded. It also gets bloody. A few of the scenes I couldn\u2019t handle.\n\nRyan McGarry is a doctor/filmmaker that had access while he was a resident here and sure, there\u2019s some compelling footage. Yet when they talk about how crowded the waiting room gets (they call that \u201ccode black\u201d), it\u2019s not something you hadn\u2019t already considered. So when the movie talks about the flaws in the system, you\u2019re preaching to the choir.\n\nThe film worked better when we hear from the doctors and see photos of them growing up, and what brought them into this field. One Asian kid would be spanked by his father if he didn\u2019t get A\u2019s in school. The dad was rather happy when he chose the medical field. The spankings stopped and encouragement began. Another doctor lost his best friend in a car accident. The stories are all fascinating and we can see how these doctors slowly lose their passion for working in this field. There\u2019s talk about how extensive the paperwork is. Not necessarily because you want to make sure the patient is as well taken care of, but they\u2019re trying to cover their butts in case of a lawsuit.\n\nThere are some brief discussions about Obamacare, and idealistic doctors telling us how it\u2019s about doing what is right. When one doctor explains how if we aren\u2019t giving a poor person healthcare because \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to pay for it,\u201d we end up paying for it when he gets into the ER, and it\u2019s a lot more expensive than preventative measures. Again, this is all stuff we knew.\n\nThe director can claim this isn\u2019t a political film, but it kind of is. I have no problem with that. My problem is that they\u2019re asking me to sit through an 80 minute documentary that sheds very little light on anything. The fly on the wall aspects of being in the hospital only takes me so far on the enjoyment scale. I would\u2019ve rather heard more back stories on the doctors. They should\u2019ve also cut out every scene showing them sitting at a table laughing at Applebee\u2019s. That added nothing and felt amateurish.\n\nThis is a documentary that will only appeal to a small portion of the population. If you want to catch it, it may only be at the Gaslamp Reading for a week, so head down there.\n\nIt gets 2 stars out of 5.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I\u2019m not so sure what the distributors are thinking in releasing this documentary into theatres.
