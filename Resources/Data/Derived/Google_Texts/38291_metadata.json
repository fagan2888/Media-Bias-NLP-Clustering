Burwell centered around a single clause in the Affordable Care Act, which said subsidies given in the form of tax credits to help people puchase health insurance should be available to those who purchase on \"an exchange established by the state.\u201d\n\nA literal interpretation of that clause would mean the more than six million Americans who purchased insurance from the federal exchange would not be eligible for subsidies.\n\nThe Obama administration had argued Congress could not have intended that outcome and in cases where the textual meaning of a law is unclear, it should be left to the executive agency, in this case the Internal Revenue Service, to decide how to interpret and execute the law.\n\nThat precedent was established in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, a 1984 Supreme Court case.\n\nIt's the reasoning the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals used in ruling for the Obama administration last year.\n\nBut in affirming the lower court's opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the four liberals on the court and Justice Anthony Kennedy, eschewed that argument.\n\n\u201cChevron does not provide the appropriate framework here,\u201d Roberts wrote.\n\nInstead, Roberts said that because the question before the court is of \u201cdeep economic and political significance,\u201d the court must play umpire and determine Congress' intent.\n\nIn essence, Roberts went out of his way to narrow the scope of the Chevron decision, and five other justices went along with him.\n\n\u201cChevron created tremendous judicial deference to the executive,\u201d said Ted Frank, founder of the Center for Class Action Fairness, a nonprofit law firm. \u201cThat they discarded it here is a very significant constraint on the executive.\u201d\n\nThe most immediate consequence is that the next president may not order the I.R.S. to deny subsidies to participants of a federal exchange. The authority to interpret this section of the law belongs to the courts, not to the executive, Roberts ruled.\n\n\u201cA key aspect [of this ruling] is that it leaves no wiggle room for a future administration,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nBut the implications could be even broader if Roberts is hinting at his desire to rebalance executive authority.\n\nBecause plenty of cases that reach the high court can be construed to have \u201cdeep economic and political significance,\u201d Roberts' decision puts the onus on Congress to specifically delegate authority to the executive branch.\n\nWithout such a declaration, the justices will decide what Congress intended, not the president.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that Congress, if it wants to delegate crucial questions to an agency, they\u2019re just going to have to be clearer about it in the statute itself,\u201d said Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine and an election law expert.\n\nRoberts has been critical of agency authority in the past.\n\nIn City of Arlington v. F.C.C., Roberts, in a dissenting opinion, worried over the growing trend of agencies amassing more power, and questioned \u201cwhether the authority of administrative agencies should be augmented even further ... to decide when Congress has given them the power.\u201d\n\nRoberts thought the answer was no and now, writing for the majority, has curtailed that administrative role.\n\nThis amounts to a small, but significant, win for conservatives looking for a check on the executive branch and for those who felt Chevron has been applied too broadly.\n\nIt may also mean a future headache for the Obama, or a future Democratic administration.\n\nFrank cited a case working its way through the courts related to the president's immigration policy. The Obama administration has argued its agencies have the authority to enact a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nFollowing Roberts' line of thinking, that would be a step too far for the executive branch.\n\nIt won't just be immigration. The Environmental Protection Agency, Securities and Exchange Commission and National Labor Relations Board all take cues from the White House and often choose to interpret acts of Congress in their own way.\n\nRoberts, who served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that oversees federal agencies, would understand better than most the implications of narrowing Chevron, and what it might do to future challenges of executive authority.\n\n\u201cThis has enormous reach in the way agency decisions have been reviewed in other areas,\u201d said Jim Copland, a senior fellow with the Manhattan Institute's Center for Legal Policy. \u201cIt is clearly going to result in further litigation and potentially less scope for administrative law rulings.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: This story initially misquoted Rick Hasen.
