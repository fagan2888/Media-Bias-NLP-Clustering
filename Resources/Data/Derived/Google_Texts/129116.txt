A self-proclaimed “science nerd” and third year Colorado Mesa University student spent her winter break differently than most — having the Antarctic expedition of a lifetime.

Olivia Sayer, of Littleton, said she heard about the Students on Ice program four years ago and has dreamed of setting sail with the ship full of educators, students and scientists ever since.

When she learned the program was accepting university students, Sayer eagerly applied and was accepted.

“All of the science opportunities definitely were a huge draw,” she said. “It’s been a lifelong dream of mine to see the research stations in Antarctica, and we’ve gotten to see two. I couldn’t imagine a better place to nerd out for science.”

The two-week expedition takes place aboard a vessel where 66 students and 23 expert staff learn, live and leave to explore their Antarctic surroundings.

Highlights of the trip include whale watching, glacier climbing, ice coring and touring research facilities, said Geoff Green, Students on Ice founder and expedition leader.

“Antarctica is such a powerful place,” Green said. “It humbles people and helps put things in perspective in many ways. It’s like going to a different planet and looking back at Earth.”

Sayer said her eyes have been opened during the journey. Aside from seeing her first whale, learning firsthand from esteemed researchers and exploring glaciers, she said her future plans have changed, too.

“I was unsure whether or not I would want to do research after college or medical school, but after seeing all this, I’m strongly considering going into polar research because I can see myself here,” Sayer said.
