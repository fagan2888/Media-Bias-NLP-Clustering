Two local women jump into business after seeing a need for more Christmas tree lots.

Kristi Stokes and Trinity Mixon started "Two Blondes and a Christmas Tree Lot" in Pier Park this year after noticing there were only a handful of lots around Bay County.

They officially opened for business Saturday, and in the first few hours they sold 20 trees.

The trees range anywhere from $20 to $150.

The owners say customers are enjoying their wide selection.

Tree Lot Owner Kristi Stokes, "We are really the only hometown tree really that is selling them fresh, local to the community. We've had a steady stream all day and have been very pleased with the area."

"Two Blondes and a Tree Lot" is across the street from Target.

The lot is open seven days a week up until Christmas.
