Earlier this year they had to show why former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee \u201cFair Tax\u201d plan would be neither fair nor much of a plan. In the 2012 cycle, they had to address the problematic elements of Herman Cain\u2019s infamous 9-9-9 plan and Newt Gingrich\u2019s scheme to gut federal revenues.\n\nThis week, at the group\u2019s TaxVox blog, resident fellow Howard Gleckman looked into the implications of Carly Fiorina\u2019s promise to reduce the bloated U.S. tax code to a document three pages in length.\n\nRelated: Carly Fiorina \u2013 I Don\u2019t Do Policy Details\n\nFiorina has been resistant to providing details about her plan, but in advance of the GOP debate on Tuesday she linked to a Hoover Institution paper laying out a three-page re-write of the U.S. tax code.\n\nThe program is essentially a flat tax, a style of taxation in which everybody pays the same fixed percentage of their income to fund the government. Flat tax programs have enjoyed considerable public appeal for decades, largely on the strength of their simplicity and the prima facie impression that they are fair. However, there are ample reasons to believe that a flat tax program is neither simple nor fair.\n\nThe fairness issue has been addressed countless times and in countless places. Is asking someone who earns $20,000 a year to pay $3,000 in taxes while someone who earns $200,000 pays $30,000 actually fair in a sense that the majority of the American people are comfortable with? No, not really.\n\nGleckman, though, goes to a different and more complicated point. A three-page tax system may seem simple, but it achieves that simplicity by delegating enormous amounts of authority to the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department -- something that Fiorina and her supporters might not like very much.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Problem with the GOP\u2019s Flat Tax Proposals\n\n\u201cTheir tax is certainly simple,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut it is simple because it has no individual and few business deductions. Would voters be willing to swap their deductions for mortgage interest, charitable giving, state and local taxes, etc. for a three-page tax code they'd never read? I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\nGleckman uses as an example sections 103 and 105 of the Hoover Institution tax plan, which applies to business income.\n\nSection 103 defines the \u201ccost of business inputs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn general. The cost of business inputs is the actual cost of purchases of goods, services, and materials required for business purposes.\u201d\n\nAnd section 105 defines business\u2019s taxable income.\n\nRelated: Fact Checkers Working Overtime \u2013 Top Whoppers from the GOP Debate\n\n\u201cBusiness taxable income is business receipts less the cost of business inputs, less compensation paid to employees, and less the cost of capital equipment, structures, and land.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeems straight-forward enough,\u201d Gleckman observes. \u201cBut here\u2019s a question that might be familiar to Mrs. Fiorina from her CEO days: What does \u2018actual\u2019 cost mean? Is it market price? Or some artificially high price paid to a related party in order to maximize the deduction?\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t hard to imagine the disputes between companies and the tax collector over that one six-letter word. If it is not defined in the law (bye-bye three page code) it will inevitably be defined by regulation, litigation, and other interpretations. Indeed, firms and the IRS have been battling over this very issue, called transfer pricing, for decades.\u201d\n\nAs Gleckman points out, those questions would ultimately have to be decided via rulings from the IRS and by federal courts.\n\nRelated: How Trump Carson and Cruz Turned Republican Voters Against the GOP\n\nIn the end, after regulatory rulemaking and court challenges, Gleckman notes, \u201cIt would take thousands of pages of [regulations] for the IRS to enforce a short -- but vague \u2014 statute, for compliant taxpayers to understand their obligations, and to prevent abuse by those who would cheat.\n\n\u201cFiorina might keep her pristine three-page tax code. But the price she\u2019d pay is granting vast new power to regulators and judges. I\u2019m not sure she, or many GOP voters, would think that\u2019s such a great idea.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Carly Fiorina\u2019s proposed three-page tax plan may sound good in theory, says the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, but there is a real price to a lack of specificity.", "title": "Fiorina\u2019s 3-Page Tax Code Could Get Awfully Complicated", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/13/Fiorina-s-3-Page-Tax-Code-Could-Get-Awfully-Complicated", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08102015_Carly_Fiorina.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/13/Fiorina-s-3-Page-Tax-Code-Could-Get-Awfully-Complicated", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08102015_Carly_Fiorina.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Carly Fiorina\u2019s proposed three-page tax plan may sound good in theory, says the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, but there is a real price to a lack of specificity.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFiorina might keep her pristine three-page tax code.\nEarlier this year they had to show why former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee \u201cFair Tax\u201d plan would be neither fair nor much of a plan.\nfor a three-page tax code they'd never read?\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Problem with the GOP\u2019s Flat Tax Proposals\u201cTheir tax is certainly simple,\u201d he writes.\nThe program is essentially a flat tax, a style of taxation in which everybody pays the same fixed percentage of their income to fund the government."}
