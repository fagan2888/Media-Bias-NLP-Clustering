It took ten surgeries and the removal of her colon and part of her rectum but she beat it. Then, five years ago, at 23, she got thyroid cancer. But on top of the struggle with cancer, there was the $700 monthly premium for insurance that never felt secure.\n\n\u201cIs the insurance gonna refuse the surgery? Approve this medication? You have to call this person and that person, constantly stressing about when am I going to have health insurance or if I was going to lose it. You don\u2019t realize you\u2019re kind of carrying this big burden.\u201d\n\nThat was until she signed up for a plan through Healthcare.gov last year and cut her premium by more than half.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if I have a second lease on life. When somebody tells you that you\u2019re never, ever for the rest of your life going to have to worry about having insurance, it\u2019s a huge relief. You can actually focus on the important things and not have to constantly wait for the rug to be pulled out from under you.\u201d\n\nMoran says she\u2019s now embracing things she put off or couldn\u2019t afford, including a wedding.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, I was putting off planning a wedding because I felt it wasn\u2019t fair to my fiancee to give him that burden, but because of (the Affordable Care Act) I\u2019m able to focus on him and our life together.\u201d\n\nMoran says the change has been so overwhelming, she felt moved to email the President, even though she didn\u2019t really think he\u2019d ever see it.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to thank the President and everyone else who worked on it. He doesn\u2019t get a whole lot of positive response a lot of times so I wanted him to know that he really altered my life.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019d forgotten about the email until last week, when a White House staffer called to ask if she would come meet the President and Vice-President on Tuesday.\n\nIt was a thrill, she says, but she still counts the ACA itself as the third-best thing in her life, after remission and her fiancee.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m able to really just enjoy my future.\u201d\n\nA trip to the White House for a Philadelphia woman who says health care reform changed her life\u2026", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Philadelphia woman's letter to the President landed her an invitation to the White House last Tuesday and she told him that the Affordable Care Act had changed her life.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2015/02/07/philadelphia-woman-who-says-health-care-reform-changed-her-life-invited-to-white-house/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/untitled10.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/untitled10.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "A Philadelphia woman's letter to the President landed her an invitation to the White House last Tuesday and she told him that the Affordable Care Act had changed her life.", "title": "Philadelphia Woman, Who Says Health Care Reform Changed Her Life, Invited To White House"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/untitled10.jpg?w=625", "description": "A Philadelphia woman's letter to the President landed her an invitation to the White House last Tuesday and she told him that the Affordable Care Act had changed her life.", "site": "CBSphilly", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Philadelphia Woman, Who Says Health Care Reform Changed Her Life, Invited To White House"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "keywords": "affordable care act, government, local, national, news, philadelphia, affordable care act, cancer, insurance, pat loeb, philadelphia, regina moran, white house", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, cancer, insurance, pat loeb, philadelphia, regina moran, white house"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8663\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBecause I\u2019m able to really just enjoy my future.\u201dA trip to the White House for a Philadelphia woman who says health care reform changed her life\u2026\nBy Pat LoebPHILADELPHIA (CBS) \u2014 A Philadelphia woman\u2019s letter to the President landed her an invitation to the White House last Tuesday and she told him that the Affordable Care Act had changed her life.\nWhen somebody tells you that you\u2019re never, ever for the rest of your life going to have to worry about having insurance, it\u2019s a huge relief.\nBut on top of the struggle with cancer, there was the $700 monthly premium for insurance that never felt secure.\nIt took ten surgeries and the removal of her colon and part of her rectum but she beat it."}
