To see why some women make less than some men, look no further than the Geller Law Group, described in a front page New York Times Sunday Business section article by reporter Noam Scheiber. The women-owned Geller Law Group, based in Fairfax, Virginia, is a small family-friendly law firm that allows women time to be with their children. The firm's credo: women should not be judged by "face time" in the office. Partners Maria Simon and Rebecca Geller "have a near-evangelical determination to show that parents can nurture their professional ambitions while being fully present in their children's lives," writes Scheiber.
