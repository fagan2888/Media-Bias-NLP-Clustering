RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — If Miroslav Klose does retire now, it’ll be with a couple of very big achievements.

The Germany striker won the World Cup on Sunday, just days after becoming the tournament’s leading all-time scorer.

Those two prizes meant that Klose being substituted late in the 1-0 win over Argentina in the final at Maracana Stadium didn’t bother him. Klose came off for Mario Goetze, who scored Germany’s title-clinching goal in extra time.

Klose, a veteran of four World Cups, really didn’t mind leaving early as he got to lift the World Cup. He said “this was icing on the cake.”

Klose is 36 but coach Joachim Loew warned everyone not to jump to conclusions about retirement: “Perhaps he will also be playing in four years’ time. Everything is possible with him.”
