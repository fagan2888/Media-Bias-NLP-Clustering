For years, Hirsi Ali has labeled Islam as a religion of violence and intolerance, pointing to her personal story as proof.\n\nSo, I picked up her book, hopeful that if Hirsi Ali believes a reformation is possible, then maybe she also has a new starting point. I did find a more nuanced argument by the author. Hirsi Ali\u2019s fundamental problem is not that she\u2019s asking for a reformation. Many Muslims, too, are troubled by the rise of fanaticism; they want to halt the rise of ISIS and to limit the appeal of such groups to Muslim youth. But Hirsi Ali\u2019s language and preconditions will stall a debate about reformation from the get-go.\n\nHirsi Ali begins her book by dividing Muslims into three categories. She describes the \u201cMedina Muslims\u201d as intolerant and prone to violence\u2014those more universally described as Salafis. The \u201cMeccan Muslims\u201d are the majority of peace-loving Muslims who she says are mostly at odds with modernity. She defines \u201cdissident Muslims\u201d as both unbelievers and believers who believe that Muslims and/or Islam must change.\n\nHirsi Ali then says that for a reformation to happen, Muslims must strip the prophet of his \u201cinfallible\u201d nature and declare the Qur\u2019an a man-made document. Muslims must re-prioritize this life over the afterlife in order to remove the appeal of martyrdom. They must embrace secular laws over \u201canachronistic\u201d shariah laws and rid themselves of \u201creligious police\u201d or \u201cpolitically empowered clerics.\u201d Finally, Muslims must reject the use of the sword and become a true religion of peace.\n\nHer argument has evolved. And she even makes points that I believe many Muslims would agree with. For example, on various talk shows, she has said that theological reform must come from within the religion itself (something that seems to run counter to her argument in her book) and that the West must align themselves with the reformers and those that respect democratic change, rather than despotic regimes like Saudi Arabia, which exports a harmful version of Islam.\n\nBut her requirements ask Muslims to denounce a religion they love, and in essence, declare themselves atheists. \u201cIslam is not a religion of peace,\u201d Hirsi Ali declares. Such derisive language makes it difficult to take her seriously as a reformer who wants peace. Instead, it only attracts other \u201cwarriors\u201d\u2014those who both hate Islam and those who want to fight in the name of Islam\u2014while alienating the \u201creformers\u201d out there who have been working towards change within their own communities for decades.\n\nIf she really wanted to \u201creform\u201d Islam to be a \u201cpeaceful\u201d religion, she might start by looking to others who are challenging the status quo. But the \u201creformers\u201d include people who believe that shariah can be a part of our modern world, if interpreted correctly. They are people who believe that Islam can flourish under secular governments, that Islam can be a source of justice and peace simultaneously.\n\nI grew up with hearing the words of one such person. Dr. Maher Hathout believed in Islam, he lived Islam, and he also believed in modern principles of democracy, tolerance and love. He constantly repeated phrases like, \u201cthere is no compulsion in Islam.\u201d Even though he found Salman Rushdie\u2019s book The Satanic Versus insulting, he condemned the fatwa against him and defended his right to free speech. (He faced death threats from Muslims because of his stance.)\n\nHathout called on Muslims to interpret the Qur\u2019an for themselves\u2014to study, to use reason and to question those in robes. There is no Islam without thinking, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Heretic\" author divides all of Islam into three basic categories.
