It\u2019s something else entirely to exempt these group members from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandated shared responsibility to carry essential minimum insurance coverage.\n\nConsider whose \u201cburdens\u201d are shared. Health care sharing ministries share expenses among vetted members, a group of religious believers who can afford to pay the monthly \u201cshares.\u201d The health law, on the other hand, mandates that we (most of us) share the medical financial risks of a much larger group, including those who cannot afford coverage.\n\nWe can\u2019t forget, too, that sharing ministries rely heavily on publicly funded insurance like Medicare, on charity programs and on steeply discounted provider bills to pay first dollar for their members\u2019 care, leaving ministry members to (potentially) pay last dollar.\n\nHealth care sharing ministry members should not be exempt from sharing the burdens of all people, especially not in the name of religion.\n\nCHARLENE GALARNEAU\n\nWellesley, Mass.\n\nThe writer, an assistant professor of women\u2019s and gender studies at Wellesley College, is the author of a forthcoming book, \u201cCommunities of Health Care Justice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160321031903, "twitter": {"description": "A Wellesley professor writes that \u201chealth care sharing ministry members should not be exempt from sharing the burdens of all people.\u201d", "title": "Christian Health Care", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/opinion/christian-health-care.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004270362"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/opinion/christian-health-care.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004270362", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/opinion/christian-health-care.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Christian Health Care", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 21, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A Wellesley professor writes that \u201chealth care sharing ministry members should not be exempt from sharing the burdens of all people.\u201d", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A Wellesley professor writes that \u201chealth care sharing ministry members should not be exempt from sharing the burdens of all people.\u201d", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 21, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-03-21", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "published": "2016-03-21", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "21Lhealth", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160321032104, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/opinion/christian-health-care.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A Wellesley professor writes that \u201chealth care sharing ministry members should not be exempt from sharing the burdens of all people.\u201d", "title": "Christian Health Care"}, "pdate": 20160321, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000004270362, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Christian Health Care", "col": "Letter", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "Health care sharing ministry members should not be exempt from sharing the burdens of all people, especially not in the name of religion.\nThe writer, an assistant professor of women\u2019s and gender studies at Wellesley College, is the author of a forthcoming book, \u201cCommunities of Health Care Justice.\u201d\nTo the Editor:Re \u201cChristians Flock to Shared Care\u201d (front page, March 11):It\u2019s praiseworthy for individuals and families to form groups to share medical expenses.\nIt\u2019s something else entirely to exempt these group members from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandated shared responsibility to carry essential minimum insurance coverage.\nHealth care sharing ministries share expenses among vetted members, a group of religious believers who can afford to pay the monthly \u201cshares.\u201d The health law, on the other hand, mandates that we (most of us) share the medical financial risks of a much larger group, including those who cannot afford coverage."}
