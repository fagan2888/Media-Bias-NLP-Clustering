Sunday, the owner held a meeting to dispel rumors that something fishy could be going on with those donations.

Larry Wendt said there was no theft or wrongdoing when it comes to the thousands of dollars that were donated to his employees.

"Everything is an open book," he said.

Wendt said he wants to shoot down rumors after a few employees claimed they were not getting money they should have received from the donations.

"If I missed you on the first distribution, if my understanding of your circumstances were wrong from the limited amount that I know of 100 employees, please please contact me," Wendt said.

Wendt said the first distribution was given to people who helped with the fundraiser and held the staff together, single parents, full-time employees, people who hadn't found another job, and those who were working to salvage the saloon.

"I did not receive a check, but when I met with him the other day to ask him questions, he said everybody needed to be signed up at the food bank so that they can have a paper trail of the money, which is totally not off-kilter to anything," Michele Griffin, a bartender at Buffalo Chip Saloon, said.

"The second disbursement we did just last week when the money came in from the fundraiser, and we had the money to disburse," Wendt said. "We disbursed $200 to everybody at that time."

Wendt said after the last $11,000 is distributed, he's closing the account.

As for the saloon, Wendt said it could take at least six months to rebuild.
