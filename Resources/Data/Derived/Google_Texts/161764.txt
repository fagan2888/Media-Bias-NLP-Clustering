Eastern Iowans are trying to decide who should be their next president, and Ted Cruz is trying to gain their support.

"This is the time for the men and women in Iowa to make a decision, that frankly the whole country is looking for you to make," he said.

The Republican Texas Senator addressed a full room of supporters at Manchester's Fireside Pub and Steakhouse.

Cruz says if elected president -- his two main goals will be repealing Obamacare and pushing tax reform.

But not everyone here has decided whether to vote for him or not. "I'd like to hear him talk about the ethanol. That seems to be where a lot of the media and people are pushing him hard on -- I don't think what they say is actually what he has said," said Charles Akron of Masonville.

And before Cruz's campaign event -- he addressed the media and KWWL's Shirley Descorbeth asked him about this. "Senator...last week Governor Terry Branstad said Iowans shouldn't vote for you...you're against mandates. What's your response to this?"

Cruz said, "I'll tell you what I'm hearing from the women and men of Iowa. It's not that we need a deal maker to surrender more on our principles...its rather we want and deserve a consistent conservative."

While addressing supporters -- he was more direct. "So , I think there should be no subsidies, no mandates...no nothing. It should be a fair and level playing field."

Cruz ended with his plea asking for everyone's support. Even cracking a joke -- saying vote for him 10 times, as in bring out nine other people to vote on caucus night.

Cruz also made campaign stops Monday in Maquoketa and Independence.

Just today -- former Texas Governor Rick Perry today came out with his endorsement of Cruz. Glenn Beck also endorsed Cruz over the weekend.
