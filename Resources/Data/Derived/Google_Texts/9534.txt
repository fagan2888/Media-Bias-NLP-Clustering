Ideally, New Year's resolutions are a way for us to reflect on the past year to see what we can do to better ourselves.

From saving money, to going to the gym more, eating healthy and cutting down things that are bad for us, most people seem to want to start a new year off on the right foot.

The old saying, you get out what you put in could not be anymore true than in these cases.

NewsChannel 7 caught up with Cathy Barrios walking down the Panama City pier.

"I usually set up a few. I usually try to think about them and spend more time doing things I enjoy," she said. "I just get busy throughout the year and I like to make time for them."

Experts from the University of Scranton, Journal of Clinical Psychology say 45 percent of Americans make a New Year's resolution, but only about 8 percent are successful at sticking to them.

"I personally have had to give up on a couple before. No one is perfect but I like to think people would give it their best shot," beach goer, Jacob Leffler said.

Those in their twenties have a much higher success rate at 39 percent, according to the survey, whereas only 14 percent of those over 50 achieve their resolution each year.

"Peer pressure. A lot of your friends don't think you can do it, or maybe it's a competition or maybe it's a bet or something like that," Kyle Mullins explained.

Experts say success rates drastically drop midway through the year, with less than half of people still keeping to their resolution.

Molly Geschwindt admitted, "I don't know if its always successful or not but I'm going to try."
