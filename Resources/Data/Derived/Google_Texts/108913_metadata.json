Republicans believe their core voters strongly support their decision and the issue will unify them in the fall election.\n\nOf course, Mr. Reid is certain he will win.\n\nIn some respects, he said, the court fight is easier than others. On Social Security, Democrats were battling a popular president. On health care, they had to explain highly complex legislation to a skeptical public. A Supreme Court vacancy, by comparison, is easy to understand.\n\n\u201cMcConnell and the Republicans think this is going to go away,\u201d Mr. Reid said in an interview in his office. \u201cIt is not going to go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to keep the pressure on,\u201d he added. \u201cI, frankly, don\u2019t think McConnell can withstand the pressure, ultimately. I think it\u2019s going to get much more intense than it is right now.\u201d\n\nSince making that prediction, Mr. Reid has repeatedly accused Mr. McConnell of shirking his responsibilities and blasted Mr. Grassley for diminishing the stature of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSenate Republicans are known \u2014 and have been for some time now \u2014 as a set of human brake pads, obstructing, filibustering virtually everything President Obama has had on his agenda,\u201d Mr. Reid said in a characteristic floor speech on Feb. 25. \u201cBut this raises obstruction to a new level never seen before in this country \u2014 the Supreme Court: no hearings, no vote.\u201d\n\nHe ended with what has become a frequently repeated exhortation: \u201cOnce again I tell my Republican friends: Don\u2019t run away from your responsibilities, just do your job. Do your job.\u201d\n\nRepublicans accuse Mr. Reid and Democrats of hypocrisy, citing statements by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. when he was Judiciary Committee chairman in the early 1990s, to say that Democrats would do the same thing to a Republican president\u2019s nominee if circumstances were reversed.\n\nIn many ways, the night of Justice Scalia\u2019s death on Feb. 13 highlighted the extent to which various burdens of the Democratic Party often fall on Mr. Reid\u2019s slender shoulders. Mr. Reid was home, ahead of the Nevada presidential caucuses, which had taken on urgency after Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss in New Hampshire.\n\nMr. Reid did not formally endorse Mrs. Clinton until after the Nevada vote, but his position was well known and his public appearances, ostensibly for a get-out-the-vote effort, were clearly orchestrated to secure her victory. She won, and her campaign was widely viewed as being back on track.\n\n\u201cHe got the job done,\u201d said the House minority leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California.\n\nMs. Pelosi called the Republican position on the court opening \u201cso disdainful and so contemptible\u201d and said that Mr. Reid was the person to fight it.\n\n\u201cNobody is more up to the task than Harry Reid,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Reid views Mr. McConnell as his chief rival, and after Senate Republicans racked up a series of legislative accomplishments last year, including a transportation infrastructure bill, a major education bill and the two-year budget deal, Mr. Reid clearly savors the court fight as a way to portray Mr. McConnell as the face of obstruction.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the court fight, however, Mr. Reid\u2019s primary target has been Mr. Grassley, who is up for re-election and, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has the power to convene confirmation hearings. The other prong in Mr. Reid\u2019s strategy is to tie the Republicans\u2019 position to the rise of Donald J. Trump.\n\nLast week, Mr. Reid stood on the Senate floor with a huge poster bearing a quote from an op-ed in The Des Moines Register: \u201cThis isn\u2019t the Chuck Grassley we thought we knew.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree with these Iowans,\u201d Mr. Reid began, before launching into a taunting critique. \u201cHe is allowing himself and his committee to be manipulated by the Republican leader for narrow, partisan warfare,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cHe is taking his orders from the Republican leader and, sadly, Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nMr. Reid, a onetime amateur boxer who later worked nights as a Capitol Hill police officer during law school, relishes a fight, so much so that aides have warned him not to enjoy the court clash too much, or at least not to show it.\n\nMr. Reid\u2019s oratorical style, which tends toward mumbling, helps create the impression that he is not particularly having much fun. Still, his words are designed to stab like daggers.\n\n\u201cHe started his tenure proclaiming that he would rather dance than fight, and since then he has managed to do both,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former senior communications aide to Mr. Reid. \u201cHowever, it looks like he\u2019s going to go out fighting.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160313184716, "twitter": {"description": "Supporters of the senator, who is retiring this year, say he is prepared for an intense fight with Republicans over a new member of the court.", "creator": "herszenhorn", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/14/us/politics/for-harry-reid-thesupreme-court-vacancy-offers-one-lastfight.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004267213"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "For Harry Reid, the Supreme Court Vacancy Offers One Last Fight", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/14/us/14reid-web/14reid-web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/14/us/politics/for-harry-reid-thesupreme-court-vacancy-offers-one-lastfight.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004267213", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/14/us/politics/for-harry-reid-thesupreme-court-vacancy-offers-one-lastfight.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "For Reid, Supreme Court Vacancy Offers a Final Fight Before Retirement", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 13, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/david_m_herszenhorn/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/section/us", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2016-04-04", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Senate Committee on the Judiciary", "published": "2016-03-13", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "keywords": "Reid  Harry,United States,Supreme Court (US),United States Politics and Government,Senate,Republican Party,Appointments and Executive Changes,Scalia  Antonin,Grassley  Charles E,Democratic Party,Senate Committee on the Judiciary,Congress", "description": "Supporters of the senator, who is retiring this year, say he is prepared for an intense fight with Republicans over a new member of the court.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "David M.
