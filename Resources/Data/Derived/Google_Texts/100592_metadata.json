But in Venezuela, where five people have now died in political unrest over soaring inflation, widespread crime, and chronic shortages, Twitter is undeniably serving as a parallel platform for protest. Its dueling hashtags echo the dueling demonstrations in the streets. In a country with one of the highest Twitter adoption rates in the world, and at a time when independent Venezuelan news outlets have been muffled, the social network has become a critical forum for political activism. For evidence, just compare the timeline of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's handpicked successor, with that of opposition leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, the primary organizer of the student-led protests. Maduro's Twitter feed is a frenetic mix of threats to his \"fascist\" rivals, exhortations to carry out Ch\u00e1vez's Bolivarian Revolution, and retweets of messages from sympathizers (including, eerily, a series of tweets written by Ch\u00e1vez shortly before his death last year). L\u00f3pez's is more spartan\u2014informing supporters about the logistics for marches and urging them to fight non-violently for human rights.\n\nIn a dramatic showdown on Tuesday, L\u00f3pez led a rally in Caracas before handing himself over to authorities to face terrorism charges. Mash up the two Twitter feeds in the days before the arrest, and you get the impression of two camps approaching one another for an epic clash\u2014a kind of West Side Story rumble. I've included translations in bold above each tweet. Maduro: \"Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, coward, fascist surrender because we are looking for you!\" @NicolasMaduro: Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, cobarde, fascista \u00a1Entr\u00e9gate que te estamos buscando! pic.twitter.com/9xKv4f6rXC \u2014 Delcy Rodr\u00edguez (@DrodriguezMinci) February 15, 2014 L\u00f3pez: \"I tell you Maduro, you are a coward. You are going to break neither me nor my family. To my family: strength, I love them.\" Te lo digo Maduro, eres un cobarde. Ni a mi familia ni a mi nos vas a doblegar. A mi famila: fuerza, los amo. \u2014 Leopoldo L\u00f3pez (@leopoldolopez) February 16, 2014 Maduro: \"Tomorrow we will have a work day in the Federal Council of Government to implement the actions of the National Plan for Peace and Coexistence.\" Ma\u00f1ana tenemos jornada de trabajo en el Consejo Federal de Gobierno para implementar las acciones del Plan Nacional de Paz y Convivencia.. \u2014 Nicol\u00e1s Maduro (@NicolasMaduro) February 18, 2014 L\u00f3pez: \"The government is increasing repression to sow fear.
