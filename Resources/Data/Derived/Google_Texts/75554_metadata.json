(Photo: The Register )Buy Photo\n\nThe number of hospitalized Iowans lacking health insurance dropped by nearly half in the first six months of the year, mainly because the state decided to expand its Medicaid program, hospital leaders said Wednesday.\n\nThe Iowa Hospital Association said about 4,445 patients lacking health insurance were hospitalized in Iowa from January through June of 2014. That was a 46 percent decline from the 8,181 uninsured patients hospitalized during the same period in 2013.\n\nThe association strongly supported expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program, using federal money provided under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Most states with Republican governors declined to do so, but Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad agreed to a modified version of an expanded Medicaid program, called the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan.\n\n\u201cThis analysis provides further evidence that Medicaid expansion is doing what it was intended to do \u2013 making health care more accessible and affordable for the 110,000 Iowans who have gained eligibility and coverage,\u201d Hospital Association President Kirk Norris said.\n\nHospital leaders pushed for the Medicaid expansion, contending that when their facilities treat people who can\u2019t pay, the cost winds up being borne by other patients. Such cost-shifting drives up premiums of privately insured people.\n\nA study done earlier this year for the state found that only about a quarter of Iowa\u2019s uninsured had gained coverage because of the Affordable Care Act. Norris said Wednesday that the percentage of those hospitalized who have gained coverage likely is higher because hospital staff members help uninsured patients sign up for programs. Uninsured people might not realize they qualify until they seek care.\n\nUnder the Medicaid expansion, working-age adults qualify for public coverage if they make less than about $16,200 per year. In the past, most childless adults didn\u2019t qualify for such coverage.\n\nA skeptic of the Affordable Care Act said Wednesday that the decline in hospitals\u2019 charity care burden doesn\u2019t prove expanding Medicaid is an efficient way to improve health care. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s happening, and that\u2019s fine for the hospitals, but the question is, is that how you should cover this population?\u201d said Ed Haislmaier, a health-policy researcher for the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nHaislmaier said working-age, able-bodied adults should be required to have jobs in order to obtain coverage, and they should face co-pays and other measures to encourage them to use primary care clinics instead of hospitals for most health care. Iowa\u2019s version of Medicaid expansion includes some measures to encourage proper use of the system, but Haislmaier said they\u2019re not enough.\n\nThe hospital association report found that Iowa hospitals\u2019 charity care costs fell 18.5 percent, or $32.5 million, in the first six months of this year. Overall hospital admissions in Iowa dropped 4.4 percent during the time period studied.\n\nThe report also found that emergency room visits increased less than 1 percent. The association said the finding should ease fears that hospital rooms would be crammed with new patients once more people had health insurance.\n\nA national study earlier this fall estimated that the percent of uninsured patients at hospitals in Medicaid-expansion states fell by half, according to Modern Healthcare.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1qEcuZo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The number of hospitalized Iowans dropped by nearly half in first six months of 2014.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "The number of hospitalized Iowans dropped by nearly half in first six months of 2014.", "title": "Medicaid expansion slashes hospitals\u2019 uninsured burden", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2014/11/12/obamacare-medicaid-expansion-uninsured-iowans/18917987/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The number of hospitalized Iowans dropped by nearly half in first six months of 2014.", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/12/-mercymedicalcenter.jpg20141022.jpg", "title": "Medicaid expansion slashes hospitals\u2019 uninsured burden", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Health insurance", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Health insurance", "title": "Medicaid expansion slashes hospitals\u2019 uninsured burden", "author": "Tony Leys", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06ba27a0362a386e9000c02e5ad114cc3f2d85e9/c=714-0-2550-2448/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/12/-mercymedicalcenter.jpg20141022.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70261845367a788a3f907a9f1f073a9c7298db27/c=408-0-2856-2448/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/12/-mercymedicalcenter.jpg20141022.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/209496ef8e15ec974055f2b972cb017799a2d254/c=0-0-3264-2448/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/12/-mercymedicalcenter.jpg20141022.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5366816a2be01ce320de9a1b7d4fcd3d9671846/c=0-306-3264-2142&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/12/-mercymedicalcenter.jpg20141022.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-11-12T12:55:49-06:00", "shorthed": "Obamacare eases hospitals\u2019 burdens", "articleid": 18917987, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd81f7b80aef18fc9ff3cd911b276728a9998bb7/c=0-306-3264-2142/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/12/-mercymedicalcenter.jpg20141022.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4ddfec6da1e1c49c540a50418fed8521c9471641/c=944-0-2321-2448/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/12/-mercymedicalcenter.jpg20141022.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf671\"", "article_summary": "That was a 46 percent decline from the 8,181 uninsured patients hospitalized during the same period in 2013.\nA national study earlier this fall estimated that the percent of uninsured patients at hospitals in Medicaid-expansion states fell by half, according to Modern Healthcare.\nTerry Branstad agreed to a modified version of an expanded Medicaid program, called the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan.\nThe Iowa Hospital Association said about 4,445 patients lacking health insurance were hospitalized in Iowa from January through June of 2014.\nA skeptic of the Affordable Care Act said Wednesday that the decline in hospitals\u2019 charity care burden doesn\u2019t prove expanding Medicaid is an efficient way to improve health care."}
