Tim Neville\n\nTim Neville officially launched his U.S. Senate run Tuesday night, blasting Planned Parenthood, Obamacare and the EPA.\n\nIf you love unregulated guns, want to destroy Planned Parenthood and kick immigrants out of the United States, you should have been at state Sen. Tim Neville\u2019s kick-off party.\n\nAt his campaign headquarters in suburban Ken Caryl, Colorado, Neville pledged he would beat Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and bring freedom lovin\u2019 conservative values to Washington D.C.\n\nNeville touted his record voting for gun rights and militarized borders, and against Obamacare, \u201cillegal immigrants,\u201d national common core education standards and the Environmental Protection Agency in the wake of the Gold King Mine spill. He also took aim at Planned Parenthood.\n\nNeville is a member of the Republican Study Committee of Colorado that held a daylong hearing in November on the Planned Parenthood videos produced by the Center for Medical Progress. That video claimed the women\u2019s health organization was trafficking fetal tissue.\n\nLess than three weeks after the Republican Study Committee hearing, Robert Dear opened fire on the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, killing a police officer and two others. He reportedly cited \u201cno more baby parts,\u201d a possible reference to the video, as his reason for the attack.\n\nAt his kickoff, Neville, who has made no public statement about the murders, railed against the women\u2019s health organization: \u201cPlanned Parenthood ignores the law, kills the unborn and sells their body parts for profit, and when both parties can\u2019t come together to end this tragedy, we have an issue with leadership.\u201d\n\nHe went on to promise to gut all funding to abortion providers and support legislation like the \u201cLife at Conception\u201d act. Colorado voters have three times rejected similar efforts.\n\n\u201cI will be the next great Republican senator from Colorado,\u201d Neville said, to the crowd\u2019s cheers. He blasted Bennet, whom Neville said is a puppet of President Barack Obama. Neville also attacked Bennet for his recent vote in favor of the Iran nuclear agreement, which Neville said hurts Israel and supports the religious leaders of Iran.\n\nThe event was a who\u2019s who of Colorado\u2019s far right. Neville family friend and head of the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners Dudley Brown showed up, alongside state Sen. Laura Woods, former state Sen. Ted Harvey and state Reps. Justin Everett of Littleton, Lori Saine of Firestone, Steve Humphrey of Severance and Kim Ransom of Littleton.\n\nThe Neville family, which includes his wife and business partner Barbara, son and state Rep. Patrick Neville of Castle Rock and Barbara\u2019s sister Julie Williams, an ousted member of the Jefferson County Board of Education, joined in the festivities. Sen. Neville\u2019s campaign will be managed by his son, Joe, a former lobbyist for RMGO.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anyone else being more conservative than Tim,\u201d said Rep. Humphrey, who pointed to Neville\u2019s ability to communicate, coupled with a strong pulled-myself-up-by-my-bootstraps story that Humphrey said will resonate with voters of all persuasions, not just the conservative base.\n\nSen. Neville, in an interview with The Colorado Independent, addressed one of the big challenges for 2016: winning a Senate seat in a presidential election year. Wayne Allard, in 1996, was the last Republican to do so.\n\nWhy does Neville think he can win? \u201cWe have a proven track record on the issues\u201d and aren\u2019t shy about that record, he said. \u201cPeople can count on that consistency.\u201d\n\nNeville also pointed to his 2014 state Senate win against incumbent Democrat (then-Sen. Jeanne Nicholson of Blackhawk), in a district that Neville says mirrors the state\u2019s voting demographics, split almost equally between Republicans, Democrats and unaffiliated voters. \u201cWe know how to run tough races and how to win.\u201d\n\nNeville shrugs off the suggestion that he won\u2019t appeal to Democrats and independents \u2014 at least the latter of which he would need to sway in a general election. Unaffiliated voters, and many Democrats, are looking for \u201cleadership and someone who will represent them, tell the truth and stick to it. All Americans are looking for control over their lives,\u201d he said.\n\nNeville refused to criticize fellow Republican candidates. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about what other folks are doing,\u201d Neville told The Colorado Independent. \u201cI run on my record and will defend it, and will talk about the issues, and that\u2019s what the people deserve.\u201d\n\nRep. Everett picked up the sword against Neville\u2019s GOP rivals without hesitation, swiping at Neville\u2019s biggest Republican rival \u2014 Rep. Jon Keyser, who has been touted by Party insiders as an electable candidate and the likely recipient of national Republican establishment money.\n\nKeyser was \u201cmediocre at best in his legislative record,\u201d Everett told The Colorado Independent. \u201cHe\u2019s not the second coming of Cory Gardner, and that\u2019s how he\u2019s being billed.\u201d\n\nEverett said Gardner\u2019s years of political experience, both at the State Capitol and in the U.S. House, is a striking difference between Gardner and Keyser. \u201cCory spent years building up his base and his legislative record.\u201d\n\nAs to whether Keyser is Gardner 2.0, Everett said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that message will fly with voters.\u201d\n\nEverett noted two votes in Keyser\u2019s record that will trouble the conservative base: He joined Democrats to kill an amendment that would have brought a gun rights bill to the House floor and voted against a budget amendment to defund a state agency that tracks parents who vaccinate their kids.\n\nNeville could win the nomination, but because of his intractable, far-right voting record, Dems say he would have little chance of actually beating Bennet.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee today said Neville is little more than a second- or third-tier candidate. His \u201creckless, far right-wing positions show that he is totally out of touch with Colorado families.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: Marianne Goodland\n\nCorrection: story corrected 1/8/16 to identify event location and to a correct quote by Rep.
