Through war, depression, market panics and crashes, and raging bull markets, the Fed has been tasked with keeping the nation on an even keel.\n\nWilliam McChesney Martin, Federal Reserve Chairman from 1951-1970. Corbis\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been the easiest of jobs. The Fed itself was a reaction to the panic of 1907, and faced its first real test (and failed, in the eyes of many, including the current Fed chairman) in the crash of 1929. It is still in the midst of working through its latest test.\n\nThroughout its long history, though, one of the best defenses of the Fed, and best descriptions of its job, came from the 1955 \u201cpunch-bowl\u201d speech by William McChesney Martin, who ran the central bank for a record 19 years (1951-1970).\n\nThere are several things that are striking about the speech, reading it today. For one thing, Mr. Martin was delivering it to a group of New York investment bankers, and he was basically telling them not to count on the Fed making their lives easy with cheap money.\n\nBut the speech also touches on so many issues that are at the crux of today\u2019s economy. Is a jobs market built on \u201ccreeping inflation\u201d desirable, or a sign of maladjustment? Can monetary policy be the sole underpinning of a healthy economy? In free markets, must failure be allowed to flourish as well as success? Is there a difference between free and rigged markets? What\u2019s the proper role of government and sound budgeting? What responsibility do we have toward one another, not just as businesspeople and investors, but as citizens?\n\nIt\u2019s a brilliant, thought-provoking speech, for Mr. Martin ultimately isn\u2019t talking about just the Federal Reserve, but the responsibility that the Fed, the government, and the business sector all have in producing a healthy, sound, growing economy. They must, in fact, all work together, he says. It\u2019s not a sentiment heard often enough today.\n\nSo in honor of the central bank\u2019s birthday, we present the \u201cpunch-bowl speech.\u201d (In case you want to skip ahead, the metaphor is in the second-to-last paragraph.) Happy birthday, Federal Reserve. May you have many more.\n\n******\n\nAddress of Wm. McC. Martin, Jr.\n\nChairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nbefore the New York Group of the Investment Bankers Association of America\n\nWaldorf Astoria Hotel\n\nNew York City\n\nOct. 19, 1955, 7:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an apocryphal story about a professor of economics that sums up in a way the theme of what I would like to talk about this evening. In final examinations the professor always posed the same questions. When he was asked how his students could possibly fail the test, he replied simply, \u201cWell, it\u2019s true that the questions don\u2019t change, but the answers do.\n\n\u201cIn our economic affairs, the major questions confronting us are large measure hardy perennials: How do we attain and retain prosperity? How do we achieve normal healthy growth? How do we preserve the purchasing power of our money? The answers to these interrelated questions in the 1950\u2032s thus far differ in important respects from those of earlier decades.\n\n\u201cMy purpose tonight is to explore with you some of the main currents and undercurrents of thought which have colored and shaped these differing answers.\n\n\u201cIt is, of course, unorthodox, if not downright poor form, to reach your conclusion in the course of your introductory remarks. But, as a matter of emphasis, I would like to state it now.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of war, or serious conflict among our people over political or social aims, the road to a substantially higher standard of living lies ahead of us as clear and as smooth as our modern turnpikes. We have passed through the turnstiles and are , in my judgment, out on the open road. This position has been achieved after a good many ups and downs false starts, adaptations to war and preparations for war, false turns, and poor directions.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the machine we are driving is adequate and capable of traversing the grades, curves, crossroads, and danger points, provided only that the drivers observe the speed laws, are alert and responsible, and sufficiently trained and experienced in the art of driving to understand the nature of the principles of propulsion, and the goals of the journey they are making. Our ability to travel this road safely depends upon a community of drivers who understand and utilize the time-tested principles which are derived from our inheritance.\n\n\u201cIt seems rather striking that one of the ideas now firmly embedded in our articles of material faith, the concept of governmental responsibility for moderating economic gyrations, is almost entirely a product of our own Twentieth Century.\n\n\u201cThis concept, which is steadily being brought into sharper focus, has evolved from general reaction to a succession of material crises heavy in human hardship. It grew from mass desperation and demand for protection from economic disasters beyond individual control.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve System, which I have the honor to represent, was our earliest institutional response to such a demand. It emerged out of the urgent need to prevent recurrences of such disasters as the money panic of 1907, and out of the thought that the government had a definite responsibility to prevent financial crises and should utilize all its powers to do so.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, 42 years ago Congress entrusted to the Federal Reserve System responsibility for managing the money supply. This was an historic and revolutionary step. In framing the Federal Reserve Act great care was taken to safeguard this money management from improper interference by either private or political interests. That is why we talk about the overriding importance of maintaining our independence. Hence we have our system of regional banks headed up by a coordinating Board in Washington intended to have only that degree of centralized authority required to discharge effectively a national policy. This constitutes, as those of you in this audience recognize, a blending of public interest and private enterprise uniquely American in character. Too few of us adequately recognize or adequately salute the genius of the framers of our central banking system in providing this organizational bulwark of private banking and business.\n\n\u201cSince the Federal Reserve System came into being, the problems of inelasticity of currency and immobility of bank reserves \u2014 which so often showed up as shortages of currency or credit in times of critical need \u2014 have been eliminated, and money panics have largely disappeared.\n\n\u201cIn this specialized respect there can be no doubt that the System has made notable progress, but in the more fundamental role of stabilizing the economy the record is not so clear. All of us in the System are bending our best efforts to capitalize on the experience of the past, and our current knowledge of money, so as to make as large a contribution as possible in this direction. But a note should be made here that, while money policy can do a great deal, it is by no means all powerful. In other words, we should not place too heavy a burden on monetary policy. It must be accompanied by appropriate fiscal and budgetary measures if we are to achieve our aim of stable progress. If we ask too much of monetary policy we will not only fail but we will also discredit this useful, and indeed\n\nindispensable, tool for shaping our economic development.\n\n\u201cThe answers we sought to the massive problems of the 1930\u2032s increasingly emphasized an enlarging role for government in our economic life. That role was greatly extended again in the 1940\u2032s when the emergency of World War II led to direct controls over wages, prices, and the distribution of goods ranging from sugar to steel.\n\n\u201cThat experience led to growing concern over the effect of a strait-jacket of controls on the economy\u2019s productive capacity, and the price that would be exacted in terms of individual liberty if the harness of wartime economic controls were carried over into the postwar years.\n\n\u201cSuch a strait-jacketing of the economy is wholly inconsistent with our political institutions and our private enterprise system. The history of despotic rule, of authoritarian rule, not merely in this century but throughout the ages is acutely repugnant to us. It has taken a frightful toll in human misery and degradation.\n\n\u201cThe transformation of this country from a wilderness to a highly developed civilization demonstrates the results that can be obtained through a system which is directed toward releasing, not shackling, energies and abilities. The fruits of these energies and labors are shared in growing abundance, not by primitive barter, but by the processes of the market place.\n\n\u201cThe advantages of a system where supply capacities and demand wants and needs are matched in open markets cannot be measured in economic terms alone. In addition to the advantages of efficiency in the use of economic resources, there are vast gains in terms of personal liberty. Powers of decision are dispersed among the millions affected instead of being centralized in a few persons in authority.\n\n\u201cThe basic concept of the market system has remained with us since the founding of the nation. It has remained the cornerstone of our society to this day, although we have done some extensive remodeling of the structure as a whole from time to time.\n\n\u201cWe have in the past done some remodeling for the admirable purpose of correcting structural defects and distortions. Competitive, freely functioning markets are one thing, and rigged markets are another. Rules and regulations to prevent rigging are necessary and essential to a sound structure.\n\n\u201cOther remodeling has come about because the American people have refused to accept economic goals as their sole objective. That was true in older generations, as well as our own. Our family inheritances have, I am glad to say, usually included the beliefs that man cannot live by bread alone, and that in a properly equipped home library the Bible should occupy a more important place than a manual of arms or a mail order catalog. Let it be said, to our credit, that American economic action has often been determined by balancing material advance against other human objectives.\n\n\u201cFor these reasons, and perhaps others, our market system has been modified continuously throughout this country\u2019s history. Ideas of market places functioning with no rules or regulations except the \u201claw of the jungle\u201d have, quite justly, gone the way of the great buffalo herds. When we speak today of \u201cfree markets\u201d we of course mean markets that are only relatively free, as the freedom of speech we enjoy is itself only a relative freedom. The essential characteristics of free markets have nevertheless been retained.\n\n\u201cIt is true that in a great emergency we have been willing to make a departure from our market structure, but our mood has been that of the man who has to leave home for the confines of a bomb shelter. When a war comes on, we are willing to put up with all sorts of economic controls and dictation of even small details of our economic life. The dignity of the individual gets submerged in the necessity to win the war. The law of supply and demand is suspended temporarily, but it cannot be permanently repealed. It is always with us just as is the law of gravity.\n\n\u201cWhen peace is restored we do not continue to ignore it. We cannot substitute the judgment of a few in authority for the free and independent judgments of the community as they are expressed in the market place. We cannot do so, that is , and retain our concept of freedom in a competitive, private enterprise economy.\n\n\u201cI am not unaware that freedom entails certain hardships on the nervous constitution. It gives us opportunity to choose, but it also requires the making of choices. The pleasure of having a choice to make is counterbalanced by not only the necessity for making a choice, but also the responsibility for accepting the consequences of that choice, whether good or bad. Naturally we like the consequences only when our choice proves right. That\u2019s one reason it is easier to make a mistake than to admit one. It requires no strain on my imagination to suppose that there might be some, even in this audience, who occasionally feel a nostalgia for the pegged money market that came into existence during the war and continued until the Treasury-Federal Reserve accord of March 1951 turned us back in the direction of a freer market.\n\n\u201cFree markets, like free economies, have a way of going down as well as up, and thus reminding us that our system is one of profit and loss, entailing penalties as well as rewards. During the last four and a half years the Federal Reserve has pursued a monetary policy characterized by flexibility, or prompt adaptation to the sharply changing needs of a dynamic economy. It has been necessary in this period to combat both the forces of inflation and of deflation.\n\n\u201cThere are some who contend that a little inflation \u2014 a creeping inflation \u2014 is necessary and desirable in promoting our goal of maximum employment. My able associate, Allan Sproul, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, put his finger on the fallacy in this contention in testifying before a Congressional committee earlier this year when he said:\n\n\u201cThose who would seek to promote \u2018full employment\u2019 by creeping inflation, induced by credit policy, are trying to correct structural maladjustments, which are inevitable in a highly dynamic economy, by debasing the savings of the people. If their advocacy of this course is motivated by concern for the \u2018little fellow\u2019, if they should explain to the holders of savings bonds, savings deposits, building and loan shares, life insurance policies and pension rights, just how and why a rise in prices of, say, 3 percent a year is a small price to pay for achieving \u2018full employment\u2019, they should also explain to all of us \u2014 little, big, and just plain ordinary Americans \u2014 what becomes of our whole system of long-term contracts, on which so much of our economic activity depends, if it is to be accepted in advance that repayment of long term debt will surely be in badly depreciated coin.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf inflation would in fact make jobs, no reasonable man would be against it. But as I have frequently emphasized, inflation seems to be putting money into our pockets when in fact it is robbing the saver, the pensioner, the retired workman, the aged \u2014 those least able to defend themselves. And when the inevitable aftermath of deflation sets in, businessman, banker, worker, all suffer. That doesn\u2019t mean jobs. It means just the opposite.\n\n\u201cThere have been some rather wide swings in attitudes toward monetary policy during recent years. In the depression, a great number came to the conclusion that monetary policy was ineffective as an instrument for promoting recovery from economic decline. Following World War II, some were troubled by the move from direct controls to restoration of the general control involved in monetary policy because they feared it could not restrain the inflation then prevalent \u2014 not, that is, without being so drastically exerted as to plunge us into a devastating depression.\n\n\u201cNowadays, there is perhaps a tendency to exaggerate the effectiveness of monetary policy in both directions. Recently, opinion has been voiced that the country\u2019 s main danger comes from a roseate belief that monetary policy, backed by flexible tax and debt management policies and aided by a host of built-in stabilizers, has completely conquered the problem of major economic fluctuations and relegated them to ancient history. This, of course, is not so because we are dealing with human beings and human nature.\n\n\u201cWhile the pendulum swings between too little or too much reliance upon credit and monetary policy, there is an emerging realization more and more widely held and expressed by business, labor and farm organizations that ruinous depressions are not inevitable, that something can be done about moderating excessive swings of the business cycle. The idea that the business cycle can be altogether abolished seems to me as fanciful as the notion that the law of supply and demand can be repealed. It is hardly necessary to go that far in order to approach the problems of healthy economic growth sensibly and constructively. Laissez faire concepts, the idea that deep depressions are divinely guided retribution for man\u2019s economic follies, the idea that money should be the master instead of the servant, have been discarded because they are no longer valid, if they ever were.\n\n\u201cNor does the discarding of old ideas and the substitution of new ones mean that we are throwing basic laws or principles overboard. It is the return to first principles in many parts of the free world that is the most significant aspect of world-wide recovery and progress outside of the iron curtain. And that, in turn, vastly brightens the hope of lasting peace.\n\n\u201cBy first principles I mean time-tested basic concepts of the market place and the development of competitive private enterprise, with only that degree of government interference or regulation necessary to prevent abuses and excesses. We see a return to these concepts here and abroad because other concepts have failed, and where there has not yet been a revival of these concepts economic troubles are acute.\n\n\u201cAs I suggested at the outset, the basic problems, the questions, remain pretty much the same always. The answers are different \u2014 and no one would be so rash as to say that we have ultimate solutions for all of our problems. We can say confidently, I think, that we have discarded some wrong answers \u2014 that we have returned to some of those fundamental principles under which our society, our institutions, have flourished with incomparable benefits, benefits not merely material.\n\n\u201cThere will always be some, of course, who think we must go through the wringer periodically to purge the economy. There will always be cynics and defeatists, no doubt, who say that because there have always been disastrous depressions and more disastrous wars, we must accept these visitations as inevitable. If there are enough hopeless Jeremiahs, enough defeatists and cynics, those calamities are indeed inevitable. If we do nothing about it, if we do nothing to prevent inflation and thus avoid the inevitable aftermath of deflation, then of course we are defeated. Today\u2019s generations will accept no such fatalistic philosophy.\n\n\u201cIf we fail to apply the brakes sufficiently and in time, of course, we shall go over the cliff. If businessmen, bankers, your contemporaries in the business and financial world, stay on the sidelines, concerned only with making profits, letting the government bear all of the responsibility and the burden of guidance of the economy, we shall surely fail. I am as weary as you are of pious platitudes and after-dinner preachments about leadership and financial statesmanship. But the fact is that the government isn\u2019t something apart and remote from you. It is you \u2014 all of us. If those responsible for major decisions in business, finance, labor, agriculture, are irresponsible, government can\u2019t compel you, short of moving in the direction of dictatorship, to be reasonable, or moderate, or prudent.\n\n\u201cIn the field of monetary and credit policy, precautionary action to prevent inflationary excesses is bound to have some onerous effects \u2014 if it did not it would be ineffective and futile. Those who have the task of making such policy don\u2019t expect you to applaud. The Federal Reserve, as one writer put it, after the recent increase in the discount rate, is in the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up.\n\n\u201cBut unless the business community, leaders in all walks, exhibit moderation, prudence, and understanding, then we will fail and deserve to fail. I cannot believe we will be so blind. I have a deep and abiding faith in that undefinable yet meaningful phrase we frequently use \u2014 \u201cthe American Way of Life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve, we are presenting the famous \"punch bowl speech\" from 1955.", "title": "Happy Birthday, Federal Reserve!
