Margaret. Bob. Greg. Olivia. Mary. Mom. Dad. Nana.\n\nAnd the more than 2,900 skiers and snowboarders who blanketed Vail\u2019s slopes in a sea of pink tutus and tights on Saturday raised almost $700,000 for the Shaw Regional Cancer Center.\n\nIn five years, the festooned fundraisers, who every spring paint Vail pink on a sunny Saturday, have raised $2.4 million for the cancer center\u2019s Spirit of Survival program, which delivers free fitness classes, nutrition courses, acupuncture, family counseling, emotional support programs and regular outings and events for those who have lived in cancer\u2019s shadow.\n\n\u201cAll the things we need that insurance doesn\u2019t cover,\u201d said Robin Specthrie, who personally raised $19,106 in her fifth year of fundraising for Pink Vail, helping her 80-plus teammates on team \u201cDouble Stuffed\u201d top $40,000 to lead this year\u2019s 224 Pink Vail teams. (Runner up team \u201cSaving Second Base\u201d harvested more than $38,000.)\n\nSpecthrie, dazzling in head-to-boot pink frill, feathers and fur, was the top fundraiser of this year\u2019s Pink Vail party, which draws thousands to Colorado\u2019s largest ski area for what is billed as the \u201cbiggest ski day to conquer cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis money takes care of the people who need it,\u201d said Specthrie, who was diagnosed with breast cancer almost 15 years ago.\n\nAcross Vail Mountain, the pink party raged. It was the biggest Pink Vail ever, with the number of participants, donations, volunteers and dollars raised reaching all-time highs. Like spawning salmon, the pink-hued masses skied across the hill\u2019s vast network of decks and restaurants, where bands kept everyone dancing. A country hoedown raged at the Two Elk eatery atop China Bowl. A circus theme took over the 11,000-foot Wildwood Smokehouse. Mid-Vail hosted a colorful luau. At the end of the day, the party peaked at the mountaintop Eagle\u2019s Nest complex. Thousands of festive revelers skied down at the same time to end the day, wearing bibs custom-painted with the names of survivors and loved ones.\n\nThe costumes were crazy. Pink wedding dresses were popular, especially with the fellas. Ben Kullman wore pink tights and skied in vintage rear-entry boots and long, skinny skis, all painted neon pink He won third place in the costume contest.\n\n\u201cDressing up, having fun, raising money. What a great event,\u201d said Kullman, his pink mohawk almost standing as tall as his old-school skis. \u201cIt\u2019s a good cause, too. Everything stays here in the valley.\u201d\n\nTom Kleinhardt dyed his beard pink and wore an oversized T-shirt that read \u201cI\u2019m Skiing For My Wife.\u201d His wife Janet spent a lot of time at the Shaw Regional Cancer Center a few years ago. A cancer survivor, she still goes to Pilates there every Monday.\n\n\u201cNowhere else in the world can you see something like this,\u201d said Kleinhardt, sipping a beer amid a sea of pink atop the mountain. \u201cThis event is not duplicated anywhere. People in this valley are dedicated and committed to sharing. This is the Vail Valley at its best right here.\u201d\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or @jasonblevins\n\nPink Vail 2016 by the numbers:\n\nParticipants: 2,926\n\nVolunteers: 344\n\nDonations: 5,291\n\nTeams: 224\n\nAge range: infant to 88\n\nCancer survivors: 211\n\nStates participating: 46\n\nDollars raised: $698,117\n\nFive-year total dollars raised: $2,398,117", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pink Vail event raises $700,000 to conquer cancer", "title": "Pink Vail event raises $700,000 to conquer cancer", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/02/pink-vail-event-raises-700000-to-conquer-cancer/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160402__Pink_vailp1.jpg", "height": 419}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160402__Pink_vailp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-02T18:14:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T22:04:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It was the biggest Pink Vail ever, with the number of participants, donations, volunteers and dollars raised reaching all-time highs.\n\u201cAll the things we need that insurance doesn\u2019t cover,\u201d said Robin Specthrie, who personally raised $19,106 in her fifth year of fundraising for Pink Vail, helping her 80-plus teammates on team \u201cDouble Stuffed\u201d top $40,000 to lead this year\u2019s 224 Pink Vail teams.\nAcross Vail Mountain, the pink party raged.\nBen Kullman wore pink tights and skied in vintage rear-entry boots and long, skinny skis, all painted neon pink He won third place in the costume contest.\nWhat a great event,\u201d said Kullman, his pink mohawk almost standing as tall as his old-school skis."}
