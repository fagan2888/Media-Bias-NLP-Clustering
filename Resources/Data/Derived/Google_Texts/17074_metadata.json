Doctors can determine risk by studying a patient\u2019s medical history as well as monitoring real-time data during surgery, such as how much blood a patient has lost.\n\nFrom a data pool of 1,600 patients, the university built its predictive model.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to take information from electronic medical records (EMRs) and other enterprise sources, including real-time data from the operating room, to determine whether patients are likely to get a surgical site infection,\u201d Cromwell said.\n\n\u201cThis allows us to modify and individualize the type of care that we\u2019re delivering in the operating room.\u201d\n\nGenomic data and cancer research\n\nGenomic research could be the biggest area of focus for big data in health care.\n\nOrganizations such as the National Cancer Institute are using high-performance computing to research the makeup of cancers and other illnesses. The Dell Genomic Analysis Platform, which is used by NCI and incorporates HPC technology, can process up to 37 genomes a day.\n\n\u201cNowhere in health care has big data been more pronounced and effective than in the field of genomics,\u201d Joseph said.\n\n\u201cNew gene therapies that can cure tissue cancers, blood cancers, diabetes and other diseases will be derived from this genetic information to create the era of precision medicine,\u201d he added.\n\nIn another case, the University of Michigan Health System used advanced analytics tools to reduce the number of blood transfusions by 31 percent. The school saved $200,000 in expenses by using a predictive algorithm to determine when blood transfusions are necessary.\n\nBig data and interoperability\n\nAlthough health care is making strides toward compatibility between multiple data standards, a lack of interoperability has been a huge barrier.\n\nStill, the industry is \u201cgetting better at it,\u201d Burghard said. \u201cWork needs to be done to make it useful for analytics. Right now there aren\u2019t real standards.\u201d\n\nData is coming from numerous places, whether it\u2019s a Fitbit device, many doctors\u2019 offices, labs and pharmacies. Big data analytics platforms like Apache Spark, which is incorporated in the Dell In-Memory Appliance for Cloudera Enterprise, can help to collect and integrate all of this structured and unstructured data.\n\nAdditionally, under the Affordable Care Act, doctors will be reimbursed according to the value of service they provide rather than per visit. To keep track of that value, big data analytics will be essential, Joseph said.\n\nHe added that a key area of focus is identifying high-cost and high-risk patients.\n\nWith technology enabling doctors and health insurance professionals to use data in new ways, health care is experiencing a breakthrough in using big data. There has been a proliferation of information among EHRs, claims, accounting data, devices, sensors and patient-generated data, Joseph noted.\n\n\u201cBig data tools are now going mainstream and allow you to bring the most relevant information and more context to each patient encounter, adding a whole new dimension to clinical decision support,\u201d he said.\n\nThe key to greater adoption of big data analytics in health care is keeping the data clean and secure as well as ensuring that doctors understand how the data gets to them.\n\nAccording to IDC, 70 percent of health care organizations will invest in mobile apps, wearable computing, remote health monitoring and virtual care by 2018, resulting in a significant increase in demand for big data and analytics. Population health management will require this access to big data and analytics.\n\n\u201cThe justification for adopting a big data strategy in health care is warranted now,\u201d Joseph added. \u201cThe data is there, the tools are there and the opportunities are there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "big data, ehr, health care, in-memory, remote monitoring", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "Power More", "description": "The health care industry is slowly adopting big data analytics to help monitor the quality of care and search for cures for diseases.", "title": "Health care industry recognizes the value of big data", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://powermore.dell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ambulance3000x11201.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-23T10:34:20+00:00", "url": "https://powermore.dell.com/business/health-care-industry-recognizes-the-value-of-big-data/", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "health care,in-memory,big data,remote monitoring,EHR", "article": {"section": "Big Data", "tag": "big data,EHR,health care,in-memory,remote monitoring", "published_time": "2015-07-16T08:00:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-23T10:34:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The health care industry is slowly adopting big data analytics to help monitor the quality of care and search for cures for diseases."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2db\"", "article_summary": "With technology enabling doctors and health insurance professionals to use data in new ways, health care is experiencing a breakthrough in using big data.\nBig data and interoperabilityAlthough health care is making strides toward compatibility between multiple data standards, a lack of interoperability has been a huge barrier.\n\u201cNowhere in health care has big data been more pronounced and effective than in the field of genomics,\u201d Joseph said.\n\u201cThe justification for adopting a big data strategy in health care is warranted now,\u201d Joseph added.\nThe key to greater adoption of big data analytics in health care is keeping the data clean and secure as well as ensuring that doctors understand how the data gets to them."}
