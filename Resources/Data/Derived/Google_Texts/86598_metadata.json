This rendered the proposal meaningless and raised serious questions about the CCMA\u2019s capacity to achieve a settlement.\n\nBasic entry-level pay at the mines is R5,700. Amcu demanded R12,500, an increase of 120%. In effect, the CCMA was saying to the platinum companies: \u201cTell you what, go halfway, aim for R8,500. Never mind the economic circumstances, it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nMs Strydom, 56, a world-class negotiator, has been sitting in the employer caucus advising the companies because Amcu objected to her sitting in the plenary, where the leadership, shop stewards, negotiators and facilitators sit together in one room. She was horrified by the CCMA facilitators\u2019 proposal.\n\n\u201cIt showed an absolute lack of economic acumen, an absolute lack of understanding and appreciation of where the platinum industry is, where the mining industry is.\n\n\u201cSenior commissioners of the CCMA need to understand economics, otherwise you cannot be a negotiator, let alone a facilitator or mediator.\u201d\n\nThey also need a certain level of expertise in the industry in which they are mediating.\n\nThe CCMA facilitators do not have this knowledge, she says. This has made it \u201cincredibly frustrating\u201d for those negotiating on behalf of the companies.\n\nShe experienced the same frustration in last year\u2019s gold miners\u2019 wage negotiations with Amcu. \u201cTo have to start explaining to someone that travelling time underground in a gold mine is an hour and a half before you start to work is just, during wage negotiations, too much.\u201d\n\nThe chamber invited Amcu to be part of the central-level negotiations, although it represents only 19% of employees in the gold mining sector.\n\n\u201cI quickly realised that their negotiator had no knowledge of the industry. You have to talk about a rock drill operator, winding-engine drivers and why they\u2019re paid what they\u2019re paid, and you see the non-comprehension in the eyes of the negotiator of the union.\u201d\n\nIn her bilateral caucuses with Amcu, the rock drill operators would ask their own negotiator for permission to ask Ms Strydom questions directly.\n\n\u201cThey can see that I can answer the questions that they have, but they can\u2019t leave it to their negotiator to ask the right questions because he doesn\u2019t have the requisite knowledge or understanding.\u201d\n\nBut it is only in bilaterals, that shop stewards have the opportunity to do this. In the all-important plenary sessions, the Amcu negotiator, with his limited knowledge of the industry, is on his own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d says Ms Strydom. \u201cI\u2019d rather sit opposite someone who gives me a really hard time but based on facts, experience, knowledge and logic.\u201d\n\nIn response to Amcu\u2019s refusal to budge on the R12,500 demand it made at Marikana in 2012, which helped it to become the majority union in the platinum mining sector, the CCMA facilitators told the companies they should not expect anything from the union and would have to make the first move themselves. \u201cThey told us be brave, be responsible, make a move,\u201d says Ms Strydom. \u201cSo we did.\u201d\n\nOn January 27, four days after the strike began, the companies revised their offer from an 8.5% to 9% increase at entry level for year one, 8% in year two and 7.5% in year three. It had zero effect on Amcu. \u201cWe spent a long time producing overheads with schedules on a screen in the plenary with all the shop stewards there, showing them graphically what a 9% increase would mean.\u201d\n\nAmcu\u2019s response was a \u201cunited sullenness\u201d. There was no sense it was interested \u201ceven in engaging on that offer\u201d.\n\nMs Strydom says if Amcu, which she feels has been \u201cable to hide behind the CCMA process\u201d, refuses to take the offer to its members, she will advise the companies to \u201cmove towards unilateral implementation\u201d \u2014 to go to their employees and say that as far as they are concerned \u201cthe negotiations are over\u201d.\n\nIf \u201ca critical mass\u201d of the employees signal that they are prepared to accept the 9% offer, they will be invited to return to work and \u201cregard the issue as settled\u201d, she says.\n\nIt may have been this possible outcome that persuaded Amcu this week to announce it would allow the mines to implement its R12,500 demand over three years, instead of at once. Despite this first sign of movement from Amcu, the gulf between the sides remains unbridgeable, prompting the CCMA to announce it was shelving the mediation process.\n\nMs Strydom says although she will advise going the unilateral route, it will \u201crepresent a failure\u201d for her.\n\n\u201cI would much rather negotiate with a union that is well organised, professional and representing all its members than have to go straight to employees. These are desperate times and this would be a desperate measure.\n\n\u201cYou want unions that are strong, professional, understand economics and truly care about their members. You want strong leadership from the companies, where you negotiate hard but in the end you settle, come to an agreement that strikes a balance between the demands and what is affordable. In gold, we managed to achieve this. The National Union of Mineworkers and Solidarity are up to standard \u2014 Amcu not. So in platinum this is a long way off.\u201d\n\nLike everyone else except the unions, Ms Strydom wants strike balloting to be made law. Workers must be able to vote in privacy as a precondition for a protected strike, she says. \u201cHow can it be a fair decision for people to go on strike when 5,000 people in a stadium are asked: \u2018Do you support this strike?\u2019 You don\u2019t put up your hand, and people look at you and say: \u2018We know where you live and tonight we\u2019re coming for you.\u2019 What fairness is there in that?\u201d\n\nShe was involved in 18 months of negotiations in the National Economic Development and Labour Council to win the agreement of the Department of Labour to strike balloting. But the government gave in to pressure by the unions and backtracked. \u201cIt was in the proposed labour law amendment, and it was taken out as a political deal between the ANC and Cosatu.\u201d\n\nNedlac is a \u201ccharade\u201d, she says, and she \u201cwasted\u201d her time there. \u201cBut it is the only body where we still have some semblance of social dialogue.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article was first published in Sunday Times: Business Times", "article_metadata": {"description": "BDlive covers economics, business and politics as the website of Business Day, the South African national daily newspaper, including Business Times", "application-name": "Business Day Live", "og": {"site_name": "Business Day Live", "description": "Negotiator slams poor standard of mediation and lack of expertise by union representatives", "title": "CCMA bungles platinum mine wage talks", "url": "http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/labour/2014/03/09/ccma-bungles-platinum-mine-wage-talks", "image": "http://www.bdlive.co.za/incoming/2013/04/16/elize-strydom-xxx-high-res/ALTERNATES/crop_100x100/Elize+Strydom+XXX+high+res", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-09 11:22:50.0", "author": "Chris Barron"}}, "msvalidate.01": "7FB4BFB7072B95663F9D473B86922BB1", "Keywords": "Business Day, Times, Media, Markets, Companies, Stock exchange, finance, economics, investment, Wanted, Peter Bruce, World, Africa, South Africa, news", "google-site-verification": "EzCi3Aoap8anKQL71BTkyxoJIAcfLuVnfQ1mtwy5sU4", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "labour", "image": "http://www.bdlive.co.za/incoming/2013/04/16/elize-strydom-xxx-high-res/ALTERNATES/crop_258x180/Elize+Strydom+XXX+high+res", "articleid": 303539, "publishtime": "2014-03-09 11:22:50.0"}, "author": "Chris Barron", "title": "CCMA bungles platinum mine wage talks"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd03f5\"", "article_summary": "In effect, the CCMA was saying to the platinum companies: \u201cTell you what, go halfway, aim for R8,500.\n\u201cIt showed an absolute lack of economic acumen, an absolute lack of understanding and appreciation of where the platinum industry is, where the mining industry is.\nShe was horrified by the CCMA facilitators\u2019 proposal.\nThe CCMA facilitators do not have this knowledge, she says.\nChris BarronCCMA bungles platinum mine wage talksTHE Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) decided this week that its efforts to mediate an end to the strike that has all but closed South Africa\u2019s platinum mining industry were going nowhere."}
