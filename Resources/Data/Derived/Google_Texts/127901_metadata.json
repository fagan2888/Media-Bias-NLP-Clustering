This is the lowest number the Census has seen in its entire history of collecting voter activity which began in 1978. While the numbers alone are an unfortunate case, the realities behind them are even more so.\n\nBetween the 2012 presidential election and the 2014 midterm election the decline in voter turnout was the strongest among minorities and low-income citizens. And yes, politics are at play here.\n\nThe 2014 midterm election is the first election to take place since the Supreme Court ruled against an important provision in the Voting Rights Act, which led conservatives to push the passing of discriminatory laws with the purpose to do just what the 2014 election did \u2013 suppress turnout.\n\nEvidence shows that when the process of voting is easier and there are less barriers to the polls, more people turnout but the recent rise in voter suppression laws have affected people of color and the poor the most.\n\nThe Census Bureau found the 2014 numbers to be extreme.\n\nLess than 1 in 4 citizens in the lowest income bracket and of voting age turned out to vote, with only half being registered to vote. This is a 48 percent drop since the presidential election. In the highest income bracket, 80 percent were registered and 57 percent voted \u2013 a 29 percent decline since the presidential election.\n\nWhile the highest income bracket noticed a drop another source that analyzes the wealthiest one percent found that in 2008, 99 percent voted, which shows that the very peak of wealth controls most of what happens in America.\n\nSean McElwee, a research associate at Demos, examined the ways in which a reduced turnout among people of color would effect policy. McElwee used the American National Election Studies of 2012 to examine the differences in opinion between white and non-white voters.\n\n\u201d I focus on four questions about fundamental disputes about the role of government: whether government should increase service, boost spending on the poor, guarantee jobs and reduce inequality. I examine net support, meaning I subtracted the percentage of people in support of the law from the percent in favor,\u201d wrote McElwee in a article for Salon.\n\nHere\u2019s what he found:\n\n\n\nThe chart further detailed what many minorities already assumed: the preferences of white voters are extremely different than those of non-white nonvoters.\n\nWhile voter turnout will not fix all the problems in America, it would reduce the bias found across the voting public if the poor and people of color didn\u2019t run into barriers they now face at the polls such as registration. McElwee writes that many political scientists believe that placing the responsibility of registration on voters instead of the government enforcing automatic renewal reduces turnout. Other ways that could boost voter turnout include turning Election Day into a holiday as well as offering non-partisan voter registration drives.\n\nIn North Carolina conservatives worked to eliminate same day registration, pre-registration and early voting while passing a strict voter ID law. Also, in Wisconsin, Governor and Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker pushed for voter IDs and laws that disenfranchised 300,000 voters.\n\nToday\u2019s reality shows us we have not gone as far as hoped and politicians are quickly looking to change policy to suppress votes in any way they can.\n\nShould the state be held accountable for automatic voter renewal? Do you think another movement is needed to make sure the work of past voting rights activists is not uprooted?", "article_metadata": {"description": "See how the acts of politicians dramatically decreased the numbers of voters mostly poor and people of color from the 2014 midterm election.", "og": {"site_name": "MadameNoire", "description": "See how the acts of politicians dramatically decreased the numbers of voters mostly poor and people of color from the 2014 midterm election.", "title": "Voting Drops Nearly 50 Percent As Politicians Suppress Voters", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 594, "identifier": "http://d236bkdxj385sg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/481271854.jpg", "height": 396}, "url": "http://madamenoire.com/548405/voters-turnout-drop/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@MadameNoire", "image": {"src": "http://d236bkdxj385sg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/481271854.jpg"}, "description": "We've seen a dramatic drop in the number of low-income and minority voters, which is impacting policy.", "card": "summary", "title": "Selma Is Now: Voting Dropped Nearly 50 Percent As New Policy Keeps The Poor From The Polls"}, "ob": {"title": "Voter Suppression Drops Turnout 50 Percent"}, "robots": "noodp", "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"admins": 100006356380901}, "article": {"section": "MN Business", "tag": "voting rights", "published_time": "2015-07-21T12:36:47-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "89cYy4uYOnrle-D3H3SPnHJySu32IytBEKjsv1_skZo", "y_key": "637ec967f3cf29ad"}, "article_summary": "Between the 2012 presidential election and the 2014 midterm election the decline in voter turnout was the strongest among minorities and low-income citizens.\nIn the highest income bracket, 80 percent were registered and 57 percent voted \u2013 a 29 percent decline since the presidential election.\nOther ways that could boost voter turnout include turning Election Day into a holiday as well as offering non-partisan voter registration drives.\nThis is a 48 percent drop since the presidential election.\nAlso, in Wisconsin, Governor and Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker pushed for voter IDs and laws that disenfranchised 300,000 voters."}
