Following closely behind were the nonstop rumors on social media.\u201d\n\nSo said the St. Louis County prosecutor, Robert McCulloch, in his statement Monday night, explaining that Officer Darren Wilson would not be indicted in the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown. His argument that social media had somehow hampered efforts to find out the truth about Michael Brown\u2019s death rang false to many, who felt that social media had in fact been a crucial tool for standing up to a justice system that seemed to be failing its citizens.\n\n\u201cIn Ferguson and the St. Louis area,\u201d writes Sarah Seltzer at Flavorwire, \u201csocial media has been there to document outrageous moments, large and small, from awful press conferences to terrifying nights of tear gas arrests and guns pointed at protesters. Social media brought the \u2018mainstream media\u2019 to town, kept the nation\u2019s eye on their city, and rightly turned this story into one with national, even global, symbolism and ramifications.\u201d\n\nAnd she argues that social media has given people a voice when those in power prefer to ignore them:\n\n\u201cSocial media has shifted the focus on a number of other pressing issues, essentially creating a pipeline between localized instances of injustice on the ground and the national dialogue. Thus, Mike Brown\u2019s killing and the ensuing protests became a national story. Wendy Davis and grassroots activists fighting the closure of abortion clinics became a national story. Campus rape\u2019s persistence became a national story. As they all deserve to be, because each local outrage is an example of a disturbing macro trend. Yet such genuine outpourings contrast with the stalwart refusal of actual authority figures to listen to people\u2019s demands and hear their testimonies.\u201d\n\nAt Bustle, Lulu Chang writes that \u201cthe decision to point the finger at the masses of Americans who have fought for justice through their own mediums is ludicrous at best, and cruel at worst.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media,\u201d she adds, \u201cas tweeters have pointed out, did not kill Mike Brown. If anything, social media immortalized him, and allowed his name to live on beyond his untimely death.\u201d And, she concludes, \u201cthe conversations that we should be having following the decision in the Mike Brown case is not how social media hurt, but how social media has, can, and should continue to help prove that all lives matter in the United States, no matter how much our justice system says they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnd social media users have indeed been continuing their work in the wake of Mr. McCulloch\u2019s announcement. Editors at Racialicious have posted a selection of images from Twitter, depicting peaceful protests. \u201cDemonstrators marched \u2014 peacefully \u2014 both in Ferguson and around the country,\u201d they write. \u201cThese activists were not alone, and they will not be the last. This space is to recognize their presence, despite the insistence of certain narratives that they were not.\u201d\n\nThe Ferguson National Response Network\u2019s Tumblr lists demonstrations, rallies and vigils around the world in the coming days.\n\nOthers have used Twitter to recommend donations to the Ferguson Municipal Public Library, which Lauren Walker of Newsweek reports will remain open Tuesday although Ferguson schools are closed.\n\nAt The Butter, Roxane Gay writes, \u201con Twitter last night, Ashley Ford shared that she donated to the Ferguson Public Library, which inspired me and many others to do the same. I hope you can donate, too. We have words and we can make sure the people of Ferguson have them too.\u201d\n\nAt Time, James Poniewozik (whom Ms. Seltzer cites in her piece) points out that those in authority may have good reason to fear social media \u2014 because its users can hold them to account. He writes:\n\n\u201cI suspect part of what\u2019s behind the frustration of people like McCulloch is that social media makes everyone a critic. Thousands and thousands of people are watching over your shoulder to see if you slip up, checking what you missed, judging whether you were thorough enough, questioning your agenda. Good. Having everyone watch you do your job, or not do it, may be a pain, it may be stressful, but in an imperfect justice system, it\u2019s not exactly a bad thing.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just law enforcement that\u2019s now subject to the potential check of online scrutiny: \u201cWhile McCulloch argued that social media made it harder to get to the truth in Ferguson, it was often social media that first got out the truth on the ground \u2014 and that raised questions that reporters on site were not always asking first. If prosecutors and police now have to deal with the public surveilling them on social media, so does that 24-hour news media that McCulloch described.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prying, judging eyes of social media may be a hassle for authorities \u2014 for lawyers, for law enforcement and for the media itself,\u201d Mr. Poniewozik writes. \u201cBut we\u2019re all better off for it.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, Mr. McCulloch isn\u2019t alone in taking social media to task. Earlier this year, Brittney Cooper looked at criticism of social media on the left \u2014 specifically, at the journalist Michelle Goldberg\u2019s critique of the activist Suey Park\u2019s #CancelColbert Twitter campaign and at the claim that online feminism had become \u201ctoxic.\u201d Ms. Cooper wrote at Salon that \u201cit is the very expansion of the number of voices that has white liberals so shook.\u201d And, she added:\n\n\u201cThe various social media and activist campaigns taken up by radical people of color on the left are not about censoring white folks\u2019 speech. They are not about calling white liberals racist. They are about forcing an acknowledgment that racism is painful, harmful and unacceptable. These campaigns force white folks to actually listen to people of color.\u201d\n\nAlso on criticisms of Suey Park and #CancelColbert, Julia Carrie Wong wrote at The Nation, \u201cI think that the real problem most people have with Park is that she has power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe power to direct thousands of people on social media and drive a narrative without permission from any editor, publication or other form of traditional media gatekeeper is one that many in journalism wish they had and (I suspect) believe they deserve more than Park,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are not used to women of color, and especially supposedly submissive Asian women, acting with such brash disregard of their elders and \u2018betters.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. McCulloch\u2019s argument that social media use was a \u201cchallenge\u201d to the investigation may be telling. To some, what anti-social media arguments reveal is a fear of challenge, a fear that Twitter and other platforms may provide marginalized people with new tools for standing up to authority, new ways of speaking up.\n\nIn his essay on Ferguson at Today in Tabs, Bijan Stephen doesn\u2019t talk about social media. But he does talk, arguably, about challenge, in his account of what happened to him and a friend at a nightclub:\n\n\u201cThe bouncer looked at her ID \u2014 she\u2019s black like me \u2014 deemed it fake, and, for some reason, rendered it unusable. He broke it in half. We called the manager and I was angry, trying and failing to explain to him why this was not okay. He told me I was too drunk \u2014 I wasn\u2019t \u2014 and told me to take a walk to cool off. I walked to a bodega and walked back. He wouldn\u2019t let me in. I wasn\u2019t a writer then, or I didn\u2019t see myself as one, though I was writing for places that people might have heard of. I finally threatened him with words. I told him I\u2019d write about him, and that was when he became as angry as me. He finally saw me.\u201d\n\nMr. McCulloch may not think much of the contributions of social media to the Ferguson investigation \u2014 but, it appears, he has seen them.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141125162829, "twitter": {"description": "The St. Louis County prosecutor, Robert McCulloch, called social media a \u201cchallenge\u201d to the investigation in Ferguson, Mo.
