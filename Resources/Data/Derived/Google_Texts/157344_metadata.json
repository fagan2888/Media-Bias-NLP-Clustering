Health Secretary Sylvia Burwell warns, \u201cwe will have things that won\u2019t go right. We will have outages, we will have downtime.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a safe bet, since the glitches have already started.\n\nFor instance, the administration was supposed to mail notices to some 7.1 million Americans by Nov. 1, notifying them that they may be eligible for subsidies next year. Fewer than a million notices went out on time.\n\nAnd testing still isn\u2019t finished for parts of the small-business exchange program, known as SHOP \u2014 a program that was supposed to be ready last year, but never got off the ground.\n\nThe administration thinks the consumer part of the SHOP system will be fully operational by Saturday. But other parts, such as the ability to relay premium information back to employers, need up to a month more testing.\n\nThe enrollment process has been simplified. Where an applicant had to navigate 76 separate computer screens last year, it\u2019s now down to 16 for most people.\n\nStill, expect delays and problems. For one thing, this year\u2019s open-enrollment period lasts only three months, half as long as last year\u2019s. That means the number of people trying to access healthcare.gov each day will be much higher than the number that repeatedly crashed the site last time.\n\nRoughly 7.1 million Americans bought insurance though the exchanges last year. Many had been uninsured, but even more had simply been forced to change plans, because their previous insurance didn\u2019t meet all ObamaCare\u2019s requirements.\n\nThe administration has lowered its estimates for how many new people will sign up this year from 6 million to just 2 million to 3 million. That\u2019s bad news for the promised universal coverage, but it might take some of the pressure off the system.\n\nUnfortunately, more folks will have to change plans this year. Some people managed to lock in noncompliant plans early enough last year to avoid cancelation, but the reprieve was temporary: Cancelation notices are on their way.\n\nIn the last couple of months, as many as 250,000 people in Virginia got notice that their plans will be canceled, plus 30,000 in New Mexico, 14,000 in Kentucky and more than 6,000 in Colorado, among others.\n\nEven in states that have granted an extension for noncompliant plans, some insurers are opting to discontinue those plans. If your plan is canceled, you\u2019ll have to find an alternative on the exchange.\n\nAnd even if you bought insurance through the exchange last year, you\u2019ll have to renew this year. In New York and most other states, you can automatically re-enroll in the same plan. (A few state-run exchanges, such as Massachusetts and Rhode Island, force all enrollees to reapply.)\n\nBut it\u2019s risky to just let the computer automatically sign you up for the same plan you had this year. For technical reasons, premiums and subsidies for the \u201csame\u201d plan can change drastically, so your coverage could suddenly cost you a lot more.\n\nThe plan can also change its network of providers: You need to check if your current doctors and hospitals will still be covered.\n\nActually, your premium is probably going up anyway. Reports have been leaking for months that consumers can generally expect an average rate hike of 8.4 percent in the most popular plans, with double-digit increases in some states.\n\nAnd your subsidies could go poof.\n\nThe Supreme Court just agreed to hear a case challenging subsidies in the 37 states where the federal government operates the exchange.\n\nYou\u2019re safe in states such as New York and Connecticut that run their own exchanges, but New Jerseyans and many others could find themselves on the hook for the full cost of ObamaCare policies.\n\nLast fall\u2019s collapse of healthcare.gov was the first in a series of government failures that many believe led to the Republican wave on Election Day.\n\nIndeed, the administration pushed back this year\u2019s open enrollment until after the election to spare congressional Democrats the blowback if things fell apart again this time.\n\nThat plan didn\u2019t work too well. Consumers should hope that the actual rollout goes a little better.\n\nMichael Tanner is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Saturday starts round two of ObamaCare open enrollment \u2014 and we may be one mouse click away from a repeat of last year\u2019s healthcare.gov debacle.\nThe administration claims that the Web site has", "title": "This year's glitch --- how ObamaCare will screw you now", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/health_care_analysis1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@nypost", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-7994069\"}", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,websites,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-13 19:31:10", "sailthru.title": "This year\u2019s glitch \u2014 how ObamaCare will screw you\u00a0now", "nypost-section": "Opinion", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/health_care_analysis1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "Saturday starts round two of ObamaCare open enrollment \u2014 and we may be one mouse click away from a repeat of last year\u2019s healthcare.gov debacle.\r\n\r\nThe administration claims that the Web site has undergone more rigorous testing this time around, but officials refuse to promise that all the \u201cglitches\u201d have been fixed.
