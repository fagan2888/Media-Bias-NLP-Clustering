One in nine poor infants has a mother with severe depression, and more than half live with a mother experiencing some level of depression.\n\nMany low-income mothers with depression, including more than a third with a major depressive disorder, go untreated. Unfortunately, untreated maternal depression hurts children, particularly young children, placing their safety and development at risk.\n\nWe need more states to join the nine that, according to a recent study by the National Center for Children in Poverty, already allow a family\u2019s trusted pediatrician to screen for maternal depression using the child\u2019s Medicaid coverage.\n\nBeyond screening, as noted in a recent Center for Law and Social Policy report, new provisions in the Affordable Care Act offer a large-scale opportunity to treat maternal depression so that mothers and children can escape poverty. The task force\u2019s recommendation underlines the urgency of these reforms.\n\nSHEILA SMITH\n\nOLIVIA GOLDEN\n\nNew York\n\nThe writers are, respectively, director for early childhood at the National Center for Children in Poverty and executive director of the Center for Law and Social Policy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nAs a mental health counselor providing in-home psychotherapy to pregnant and parenting women, I welcome the new recommendations for depression screening in pregnancy and postpartum issued by the United States Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nThey reflect a pressing need to identify the increasing number of mothers who struggle with mood disorders as well as infants and children affected by their mothers\u2019 mental state. It is important to recognize, however, that screening alone is an insufficient response to the severity of the mental health problems many new mothers face.\n\nTreatments tailored to the needs, schedules and limited energy of those recovering from birth and learning to care for a newborn are woefully lacking. Much is not reimbursed by insurance. The sizable work force of trained clinicians and peer counselors necessary to improve outcomes for women and children does not yet exist.\n\nUntil we combine screening with a commitment to provide essential, time-sensitive services, we run the risk of continuing to fail mothers and children.\n\nLISA McELANEY\n\nNewtonville, Mass.\n\nThe writer is a mental health clinician at the Center for Early Relationship Support, Jewish Family and Children\u2019s Service of Greater Boston.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160208032100, "twitter": {"description": "Policy experts say new provisions in Obamacare offer an opportunity to treat maternal depression, and a counselor calls for more treatment options.", "title": "Help for Depressed Mothers, and Their Children", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/opinion/help-for-depressed-mothers-and-their-children.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004173731"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/opinion/help-for-depressed-mothers-and-their-children.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004173731", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/opinion/help-for-depressed-mothers-and-their-children.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Help for Depressed Mothers, and Their Children", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 8, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Mental Health and Disorders,Depression (Mental),Parenting,Pregnancy and Childbirth", "news_keywords": "Parenting", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Policy experts say new provisions in Obamacare offer an opportunity to treat maternal depression, and a counselor calls for more treatment options.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Policy experts say new provisions in Obamacare offer an opportunity to treat maternal depression, and a counselor calls for more treatment options.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 8, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-02-08", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Pregnancy and Childbirth", "published": "2016-02-08", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "08Ldepress", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160208032100, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/opinion/help-for-depressed-mothers-and-their-children.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Policy experts say new provisions in Obamacare offer an opportunity to treat maternal depression, and a counselor calls for more treatment options.", "title": "Help for Depressed Mothers, and Their Children"}, "pdate": 20160208, "des": "Pregnancy and Childbirth", "articleid": 100000004173731, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Help for Depressed Mothers, and Their Children", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "Unfortunately, untreated maternal depression hurts children, particularly young children, placing their safety and development at risk.\nThey reflect a pressing need to identify the increasing number of mothers who struggle with mood disorders as well as infants and children affected by their mothers\u2019 mental state.\nUntil we combine screening with a commitment to provide essential, time-sensitive services, we run the risk of continuing to fail mothers and children.\nTo the Editor:Re \u201cPanel Urges Screening for Maternal Depression\u201d (front page, Jan. 27):The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendation for maternal depression screening is especially important for low-income families.\nMany low-income mothers with depression, including more than a third with a major depressive disorder, go untreated."}
