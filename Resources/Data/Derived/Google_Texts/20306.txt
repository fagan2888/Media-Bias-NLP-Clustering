Residents of Clinton can put down their picket signs – tonight the town Planning and Zoning Commission voted against bringing a propane unloading facility to the shoreline community.

Townspeople have been up in arms since the town started exploring a proposal from developer Global Companies, which sought to bring in propane by train, store it in a dozen 45,000-gallon tanks at the site of the former Stanley Bostitch manufacturing plant on Knollwood Drive, then distribute it by truck.

They crowded into two planning and zoning meetings earlier this summer to voice their concerns about industrial pollution, decreasing property values, heavier traffic and the potential for safety risks that could accompany the facility.

But Monday night the fight was over. In a closed-door meeting, the Planning and Zoning Commission voted 7-1 against bringing a propane facility to town.

Clinton Residents Still Do Not Want Propane Distribution Facility

“We are a residential town on the shoreline. We’re not Wallingford. We’re not an industrialized town. We are a bedroom community,” said Clinton resident Kathleen Skoczen, at a July 7 planning and zoning meeting.

Global Companies now has the option to appeal the decision, but it’s not clear if it plans to do so.
