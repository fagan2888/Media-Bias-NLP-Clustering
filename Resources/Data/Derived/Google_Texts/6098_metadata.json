Duke said his remarks were not an endorsement, but his support was enthusiastic nonetheless.\n\n\u201cVoting for these people [Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio], voting against Donald Trump at this point is really treason to your heritage,\u201d Duke said on February 24. Anyone who knows Duke and his decades of white supremacy knows that by \u201cheritage,\u201d he meant \u201cwhite heritage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I endorse everything about Trump,\u201d Duke added, \u201cin fact I haven\u2019t formally endorsed him. But I do support his candidacy, and I support voting for him as a strategic action. I hope he does everything we hope he will do.\u201d\n\nAfter initially rejecting Duke\u2019s endorsement, Trump appeared to backtrack in a CNN interview. Asked about Duke\u2019s quasi-endorsement last weekend, Trump replied, \u201cJust so you understand, I don\u2019t know anything about David Duke, OK?\u201d\n\nTrump eventually renounced Duke \u2013 he said, simply, \u201cI disavow\u201d \u2013 but offered nothing more than those words until after his Super Tuesday primaries victories in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia. Safely on the other side of March 1, but just days before Saturday\u2019s Louisiana primary, Trump finally coughed up a slightly more pointed renunciation on Thursday. \u201cDavid Duke is a bad person, who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThose were rather mild words from Trump, who is highly skilled in the art of the invective. What does it say about Trump\u2019s supposed disdain for Duke that he has unleashed venomous attacks in recent days against Mitt Romney and Rubio but could muster only that weak insult against the former KKK leader?\n\nTrump, however, was correct about one thing. He had, indeed, denounced Duke in 2000. That, however, was long before he launched his current White House bid and before we knew the real estate magnate as the racist he\u2019s become.\n\nDisavowing Duke while earning the votes of former and current Duke supporters has proved a bit more problematic. That may explain why he waited four long days to \u201cattack\u201d the former KKK leader. Did Trump defer criticizing Duke because he feared alienating the not-insignificant percentage of white voters in the South who have never been repelled by Duke and who are now attracted to Trump? Whatever the reason for Trump\u2019s hesitation, it did not appear to cost him many votes in the South on Super Tuesday.\n\nAs Public Policy Polling (PPP) reported in mid-February: \u201cTrump\u2019s support in South Carolina is built on a base of voters among whom religious and racial intolerance pervades.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean, exactly? PPP found that 70 percent of Trump supporters in South Carolina \u201cthink the Confederate flag should still be flying over the State Capital.\u201d Even worse, PPP reported, 38 percent of Trump voters \u201csay they wish the South had won the Civil War.\u201d\n\nIs there any doubt left that Trump\u2019s support, at least in the South, is built on a foundation of racism and xenophobia? All of which begs these questions: What is it about Trump that Duke so admires? And what about Trump appeals to former and current Duke disciples and other racists?\n\nHaving watched Duke for 25 years, I am certain he would not support Trump unless he firmly believed they held similar views on race. To say that Duke and his supporters care about race is like saying Alabama coach Nick Saban cares about football. Duke is obsessed with race \u2013 more specifically, he is rabid about safeguarding his perceived \u201cwhite heritage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "I've watched Duke for 25 years.
