The full title is the \"Second Sunday & Faith Weekend of Action Toolkit.\"\n\nThe items explain how to help people take advantage of a host of federal government-provided health programs. Specifically listed in the introduction of the toolkit are Medicaid, children's health programs, and ACA marketplace enrollment.\n\nFr. Robert Sirico, president of the Acton Institute, told LifeSiteNews that the toolkits \"put the church in the position of promoting government programs that are morally, highly problematic.\"\n\nMany denominational leaders, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, oppose the law's requirement to provide abortifacient drugs, contraceptives, and sterilization. Although the ACA is supposed to be walled off from subsidizing elective abortions, critics deride the measure as little more than an accounting gimmick, and even that has been breached in some areas.\n\nParishioners will be \"attentive\" to whether priests partner with the Obama administration, given that \"so much of this administration has been seen as hostile to traditional religious values,\" Father Sirico said. \"To then be asked to promote -- from the pulpit, no less, or in our bulletins -- this kind of program, would not only violate people's consciences, but create dissension within churches.\"\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom Senior Legal Counsel Erik Stanley told LifeSiteNews that the toolkits show hypocrisy on the part of the Obama administration. \u201cThe federal government only wants churches to have free speech rights if the church agrees to speak about things it thinks are acceptable,\" Stanley told LifeSiteNews. \"While it\u2019s not illegal for [the Department of Health and Human Services] to ask churches to talk about ObamaCare, it is ironic considering that the federal government, through the tax code, prohibits pastors from speaking freely from the pulpit on other issues.\"\n\nDue to the federal holiday, two calls and an email about the toolkit to Health & Human Services went unanswered on Monday.\n\nDespite opposition on the Left to anything that might be construed as a violation of the separation of church and state, other liberals such as Jim Wallis have encouraged pastors to \u201clink our pulpits with the bully pulpit\u201d by repeating the president's talking points on social spending programs.\n\nClick \"like\" if you are PRO-LIFE!\n\n\"A church and its pastor have the free speech right to talk about issues from the pulpit. But nowhere in the constitution is that only limited to talking about the president\u2019s agenda,\" said Stanley, whose organization opposes tax laws that require entities legally defined as churches to trade certain elements of free speech for tax-exempt status. \"We urge the Obama Administration to be consistent and oppose the IRS\u2019 power to censor churches\" through the tax code, Stanley said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "To", "title": "Obama wants your pastor to promote ObamaCare from the pulpit", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/Rural_wood_church_cross.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/obama-wants-your-pastor-to-promote-obamacare-from-the-pulpit-top-of-form", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "To"}, "description": "To", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff98\"", "article_summary": "Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Legal Counsel Erik Stanley told LifeSiteNews that the toolkits show hypocrisy on the part of the Obama administration.\n\"We urge the Obama Administration to be consistent and oppose the IRS\u2019 power to censor churches\" through the tax code, Stanley said.\nParishioners will be \"attentive\" to whether priests partner with the Obama administration, given that \"so much of this administration has been seen as hostile to traditional religious values,\" Father Sirico said.\nNewsPolitics - U.S.WASHINGTON, D.C., February 20, 2015 (LifeSiteNews.com) \u2013 The Obama administration has created a little-known \"toolkit\" encouraging and guiding pastors to promote ObamaCare to their parishioners, complete with bulletin inserts and talking points to be used from the pulpit.\n\"A church and its pastor have the free speech right to talk about issues from the pulpit."}
