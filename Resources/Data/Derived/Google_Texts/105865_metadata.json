Maybe you\u2019d like to try the Union Street Guest House. But be warned: The current forecast in town calls for a crapstorm.\n\nOn Monday, the New York Post\u2019s Page Six noted that the hotel, located \u201cnear Catskills estates built by the Vanderbilts and Rockefellers,\u201d had a written policy toward wedding guests warning them to \u201cPlease know that despite the fact that wedding couples love Hudson and our inn, your friends and family may not.\u201d And if they don\u2019t, there may be a problem. \u201cIf you have booked the inn for a wedding or other type of event and given us a deposit of any kind, there will be a $500 fine that will be deducted from your deposit for every negative review placed on any internet site by anyone in your party. (Please NOTE we will not charge this fee &/or will refund this fee once the review is taken down). Also, please note that we only request this of wedding parties and for the reasons explained above.\u201d The Post also noted, by the way, that the proprietors have responded to online criticism with claims of \u201cmean spirited nonsense\u201d and \u201cshe made all of this up.\u201d We haven\u2019t seen this much poor handling of social media since Amy Baking Co. went viral last year for its no \u201cSLUTTY BITCHES LIKE YOU\u201d policy toward its online critics.\n\nIf there are two things the Internet doesn\u2019t lack for, they\u2019d be amateur critics and people who don\u2019t like being told what to do. Within hours of the Page Six story, Yelp was teeming with reviews for the place \u2013 some just simple one-star affairs, others that more colorfully describe it as \u201cthe bobbing diaper floating in the belly of a porta-potty\u201d or a place whose \u201cvintage bed clothes gave me herpes.\u201d The Streisand Effect gets mentioned more than once too. My favorite is the reviewer who claims the hotel will also revoke your deposit \u201cIf, during \u2018Love Shack\u2019 by the B52\u2019s, any attendee shouts \u2018TIN ROOF RUSTED.'\u201d\n\nFacing an onslaught of online critics who haven\u2019t left them substantial deposits, the hotel had to move quickly to go into damage mode. (When Salon tried to call the hotel for comment Monday, no one answered the phone. A 2012 TripAdvisor post from the owners notes, \u201cYes, we do not return phone messages and we make that very clear,\u201d so perhaps not answering phones is their thing.) The policy about negative reviews, meanwhile, was scrubbed from its site \u2013 though you can still read it as evidence. It also still retains its unique cancellation policy, which warns, \u201cDue to our size, cancellations affect us greatly and we cannot make exceptions for any reason. This includes weather, family issues, personal issues, illness, or anything that is not something we can control.\u201d I\u2019m also intrigued by the note that \u201cWe are not responsible for left, lost or stolen Items. If you leave something in your room we will do our best to recover it for you. However, due to our small staff, we do not guarantee when or if it will indeed be returned.\u201d Indeed! And if you want to feel you\u2019ve stepped into another era, the Contact Us page features an image of a Radio Shack computer with the word \u201cEMAIL\u201d on it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A hotel feels the Internet's wrath for its reviews policy", "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A hotel feels the Internet's wrath for its reviews policy", "title": "How not to avoid a bad online review", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/04/how_not_to_avoid_a_bad_online_review/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/union_st_guest_house.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A hotel feels the Internet's wrath for its reviews policy", "creator": "@embeedub", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/union_st_guest_house.jpg", "title": "How not to avoid a bad online review", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "How not to avoid a bad online review", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Internet Culture, Retail, TripAdvisor, Yelp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb4af\"", "article_summary": "(Please NOTE we will not charge this fee &/or will refund this fee once the review is taken down).\n'\u201dFacing an onslaught of online critics who haven\u2019t left them substantial deposits, the hotel had to move quickly to go into damage mode.\nTopics: Internet Culture, Retail, TripAdvisor, Yelp, Life NewsStopping by Hudson, New York, and looking for a place to stay a spell?\nHowever, due to our small staff, we do not guarantee when or if it will indeed be returned.\u201d Indeed!\nThe policy about negative reviews, meanwhile, was scrubbed from its site \u2013 though you can still read it as evidence."}
