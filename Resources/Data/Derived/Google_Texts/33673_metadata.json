That\u2019s more than any movie released this year, with the exception of \u201cIron Man 3\u201d (which happens to be the fifth highest-grossing movie of all time). At this rate, \u201cGTA V\u201d could be a nontrivial contributor to the U.S. gross domestic product. It\u2019s a cultural event. Even Apple Inc. should be impressed.\n\nIt\u2019s not a stretch to think that the people who didn\u2019t go to the movies this summer might have said, \u2018you know what, I\u2019m skipping a few and using the cash for a different kind of blockbuster.\u2019\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nShould ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll\n\nIn that case, the most interesting number to keep in mind may be 100 -- the approximate number of hours of gameplay that \u201cGTA V\u201d reportedly offers. For those diligent and conscientious enough to explore all the side quests, excursions and games- within-the-game, it provides weeks of entertainment.\n\nThat makes the $60 retail price a bargain: 100 hours of gameplay at $0.60 an hour. Compare that with the price of admission to a movie, even a two-and-a-half hour megaproduction. The other advantage for video games -- driving the usage cost down even further -- is that buyers get to keep the game.\n\nSo, could the multiple box-office disappointments last summer reflect the beginning of a shift that goes well beyond blockbuster fatigue?\n\nMerging Forms\n\nThere\u2019s little reason to think that movies and video games couldn\u2019t continue to co-exist. But if audiences are becoming overly familiar with Hollywood\u2019s version of the three-act- structure and if games continue to grow as a form of narrative entertainment, it\u2019s tantalizing to think that the next few years or decades might bring some more serious attempts at experimentation and cross-pollination.\n\nIt\u2019s already been tried. Most of the results, however, have been marketing masquerading as \u201cinteractive storytelling.\u201d Despite efforts in both industries to find some creative alchemy, most attempts, though admirable for the effort, fall short of true invention. Movies made from games, games made from movies, movies and games released simultaneously with added content end up being less than the sum of their parts, more like two conventional forms of entertainment smushed together and repackaged as a new product.\n\nMovies and video games both take place in a larger, common universe of possible narratives. But are they fundamentally incompatible? Could anything interesting ever emerge from recombining the DNA of the two?\n\nThat\u2019s where a game such as \u201cGTA V\u201d breaks through. It\u2019s tempting to think of it as an open-ended movie: it\u2019s written and directed by storytellers skilled in the cinematic form and produced by an expert group of visual designers. In that sense it feels like a big movie production. As the scale and complexity of these games increase -- and as our ability to simulate and render nuance and emotion and ambiguity increases - - these games are starting to verge on something entirely new. Whatever one might feel about the storyline of \u201cGrand Theft Auto V,\u201d it is hard to deny that it is pushing the boundary of the form.\n\nOpen world games have come a long way in a short time, but as impressive as they are, they\u2019re still operated on rails -- theme-park rides rather than free-driving cars. \u201cGTA V\u201d points the way to games with a narrated openness in which players wouldn\u2019t be presented with options so much as they would have tools to model their experience. Giving players the ability to create their own stories within the connected world of a larger story creates a natural, social evolution within the system. In this sense, \u201cGrand Theft Auto V\u201d and \u201cMinecraft\u201d show us what may be coming when the mediums we have now are reimagined as virtual worlds that can grow and evolve over time.\n\nNext Generation\n\nIf anyone is going to invent a new form of entertainment from this model, she\u2019s probably 15 years old right now, unbound by the conventions and assumptions of received forms. She\u2019s growing up in a world in which a significant number of her interactions with other people are online (for better or worse). She consumes serialized programming in 13-hour blocks and doesn\u2019t really distinguish between TV shows, movies or Internet videos. She consumes these stories on her phone, tablet and laptop whenever she wants, a few minutes at a time or maybe three hours at a stretch. She makes calls on her computer and surfs the web on her television. She makes no distinction between screens, small or large.\n\nMaybe she\u2019ll be the first auteur of this new kind of entertainment -- an environment with infinite horizons. She may imagine a platform where players are both the creator and the narrator, able to write the game as they play through it. Perhaps she\u2019ll create the first Great American Possibility Space.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nShould ObamaCare Be Defunded?
