President Obama released a statement Sunday calling the death of a White House aide a "tragic loss" that has the left his administration mourning the young staffer.

Jake Brewer, 34, served as a senior policy advisor in the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and died Saturday when his bicycle collided with a car while on a charity bike ride.

Brewer was married to conservative commentator Mary Katharine Ham. The couple have a daughter, Georgia, and were expecting a second child.

"We set out to recruit the best of the best to join their government and help us harness the power of technology and data to innovate new solutions for the 21st century. Simply put, Jake was one of the best," Obama said in a statement. "Armed with a brilliant mind, a big heart, and an insatiable desire to give back, Jake devoted his life to empowering people and making government work better for them."

Brewer recently helped spearhead the administration's TechHire initiative and worked with federal agencies and stakeholders to accelerate the release and use of workforce data for training efforts, according to the White House.

Prior to joining the administration, Brewer worked in several roles, including as a general manager at Change.org and co-founder of Define American.

In a statement posted to Instagram, Ham remembered her husband as a man who lived a life that was "powerful and tender and fierce."

"I will miss him forever, even more than I can know right now," she wrote. "No arms can be her father's, but my daughter is surrounded by her very favorite people and all the hugs she could imagine."
