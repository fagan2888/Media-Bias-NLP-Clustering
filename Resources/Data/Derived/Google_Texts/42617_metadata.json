The city can't do better than zero dollars,\" city business administrator Joe DeMarco said Wednesday night.\n\n\"But that would translate to over $1.2 million in savings over the next two years.\"\n\nCity officials said that they had been in talks with CarePoint Health and McCabe Ambulance before making their decision, and that McCabe Ambulance will be rebidding for the contract, which Mickey McCabe confirmed yesterday.\n\nWhen asked about the council's decision, McCabe was unperturbed about the company's current contract with Bayonne ending earlier than scheduled.\n\n\"Now with Obamacare and with hospital affiliations, I'm in a much stronger position to say to the city 'Look, I no longer need your subsidy,'\" he said. \"The city has some financial concerns, and McCabe wants to help them with that.\"\n\n\"I'm always concerned that other people will bid,\" McCabe went on to say.\n\n\"However, I'm also very comfortable in the history of our service to the citizens and the community. ... There is no other company that can provide anything near what we provide to the citizens and the community.\"\n\nHe said McCabe Ambulance has served Bayonne for 41 years, and that it has won public bids for the city's ambulance services since 1982, when public bidding for the services was first introduced.\n\nIf McCabe Ambulance were to win this year's bid and end up offering ambulance services to Bayonne for free, no one working for the company would lose their jobs due to a drop in revenue, McCabe said.\n\n\"Everyone here would maintain their positions,\" he said. \"There would be no change in operations whatsoever.\"\n\nWhen contacted yesterday, JCMC-Barnabas Health spokesman Mark Rabson said the hospital will wait for Bayonne to issue a request for proposals, at which point it will consider whether to submit a bid.\n\n\"Now that the Bayonne City Council has recommended re-bidding the EMS contract we will await release of the RFP to evaluate whether we will extend the same quality emergency medical services and dispatch to the residents and businesses of Bayonne that we have taken pride to provide to the residents of Jersey City for the last 130 years,\" he said.\n\nDeMarco said Bayonne is looking for a 3- to 5-year contract for ambulance services to take effect starting on Jan. 1, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "bayonne", "title": "Bayonne City Council votes to put ambulance services contract out to bid", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Bayonne City Council votes to put ambulance services contract out to bid\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/10/bayonne_city_council_votes_to_1.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jjournal-news/photo/15136410-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14213427\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-17T07:02:14Z\", \"author\": \"Jonathan Lin | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"@hudson-county\",\"bayonne\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jjournal-news/photo/15136410-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The Bayonne City Council voted unanimously Wednesday night to put the city's contract for ambulance services out to bid, with plans in place to opt out of the existing five-year contract with McCabe Ambulance by the end of the year.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, October 17, 2014,  7:40 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jjournal-news/photo/bayonne-city-halljpg-435e674412c0410d.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"jclin\", \"author_nickname\": \"Jonathan Lin | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"11098115\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The Bayonne City Council voted unanimously Wednesday night to put the city's contract for ambulance services out to bid, with plans in place to opt out of the existing five-year contract with McCabe Ambulance by the end of the year.", "title": "Bayonne City Council votes to put ambulance services contract out to bid", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/10/bayonne_city_council_votes_to_1.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, October 17, 2014,  7:40 AM", "article_author": "Jonathan Lin | The Jersey Journal", "Description": "The Bayonne City Council voted unanimously Wednesday night to put the city's contract for ambulance services out to bid, with plans in place to opt out of the existing five-year contract with McCabe Ambulance by the end of the year."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5e11\"", "article_summary": "The Bayonne City Council voted unanimously Wednesday night to put the city's contract for ambulance services out to bid, with plans in place to opt out of the existing five-year contract with McCabe Ambulance by the end of the year.\n\"Our taxpayers are paying over $650,000 a year, when McCabe Ambulance gave a proposal to Jersey City for zero,\" City Council President Sharon Nadrowski told The Jersey Journal yesterday.\nDeMarco said Bayonne is looking for a 3- to 5-year contract for ambulance services to take effect starting on Jan. 1, 2015.\n\"If that's the trend, and they're going to provide services for free, then we would expect a comparable offer.\"\nHe said McCabe Ambulance has served Bayonne for 41 years, and that it has won public bids for the city's ambulance services since 1982, when public bidding for the services was first introduced."}
