But we'll always be best friends.\n\n\"Garth and I have always sort of been gypsies. If you do this for a living, home for us is really just where we are together,\" Yearwood reportedly told the website. \"\u2026There's an energy about Nashville that I love and I miss. And it's so awesome right now. It has a new energy that's so cool.
