He spoke a day before tens of thousands of soldiers and health inspectors were to take to the streets in an unprecedented drive to encourage residents to be vigilant for mosquito breeding sites. The goal: visit 3 million homes in more than 350 cities.\n\nBrazil is at the epicenter of a mosquito-borne virus that has been linked to rare birth defects known as microcephaly. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned pregnant women to avoid traveling to more than two dozen countries and territories in the Americas where active outbreaks are taking place.\n\nAlthough the link has not been scientifically proven and myriad questions remain, Castro said the half-year gap between the virus outbreak in South America\u2019s largest country and the spike in reported cases of microcephaly was not a coincidence.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely sure of the causal relationship between microcephaly and Zika,\u201d he said, adding that government researchers were unanimous in their assessment: \u201cIt has nothing to do with the environment, nothing to do with race, nothing to do with gender.\u201d\n\nClinical and preliminary laboratory evidence has shown that many mothers of children with microcephaly were infected with Zika during their pregnancies. Castro said more research was needed to determine whether additional factors may have also played a role in the spike of birth defects.\n\nTraditionally, Brazil had reported about 150 such cases of microcephaly a year. Since October, 5,079 suspected cases have been reported, according to the latest figures released Friday. Of those, 462 cases have been confirmed while 765 have been discarded. Of the confirmed microcephaly cases, 41 have been connected to Zika.\n\nIn response to criticism that Brazil was moving too slowly to confirm cases of microcephaly, Castro said the federal government was pushing states and local governments to speed up tests on newborns.\n\nCastro, who will be traveling to the capital of the northeastern state of Bahia to oversee the \u201cZero Zika\u201d campaign there, called on his compatriots to join the battle to eliminate Zika. He said that keeping homes free of mosquitoes was the most effective way to contain the virus until a vaccine is developed.\n\n\u201cIn this last 30 years we never managed to defeat the mosquito,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this time we\u2019re obligated to prevail because the mosquito has become much more dangerous.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, a top official from the World Health Organization said that a vaccine was approximately 18 months away.\n\nMarie-Paule Kieny, WHO\u2019s assistant director-general for health systems and innovation, said that 15 companies or groups have been identified as possible participants in the hunt for vaccines.\n\nCastro, a psychiatrist by training who has spent much of the last two decades in Congress, was named minister in October as part of a Cabinet shake-up giving more power to Rousseff\u2019s coalition allies in a bid to shield her from looming impeachment proceedings.\n\nHis remarks in the early days of the health crisis drew sharp criticism and added to Brazilians\u2019 anxiety. For example, he declared that Brazil was \u201closing ugly\u201d in the fight against the mosquito, and urged women to pick up Zika before getting pregnant to develop immunity against the virus.\n\nBut in recent weeks, he\u2019s helped mobilize the government to invest in the development of a vaccine with a Texas research lab, provide care to the hundreds of babies born with birth defects and deploy the military to carry out inspections for mosquito breeding sites.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brazil's health minister said Friday that authorities were \"absolutely sure\" that the Zika virus is connected to devastating birth defects and rejected criticism that the government was slow to investigate the surge of cases that set off international alarms.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Brazil\u2019s health minister said Friday that authorities were \u201cabsolutely sure\u201d that the Zika virus is connected to devastating birth defects and rejected criticism that the government was slow to investigate the surge of cases that set off international alarms.", "title": "Brazil minister says no doubt Zika connected to microcephaly", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/12/health-minister-urges-brazilians-to-join-zika-batt/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/26/colombia_zika.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/26/colombia_zika.jpeg", "description": "Brazil's health minister said Friday that authorities were \"absolutely sure\" that the Zika virus is connected to devastating birth defects and rejected criticism that the government was slow to invest", "card": "summary", "title": "Brazil minister says no doubt Zika connected to microcephaly"}, "Author": "Joshua Goodman", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Brazil, Marcelo Castro"}, "article_summary": "Of the confirmed microcephaly cases, 41 have been connected to Zika.\nBrazil is at the epicenter of a mosquito-borne virus that has been linked to rare birth defects known as microcephaly.\nTraditionally, Brazil had reported about 150 such cases of microcephaly a year.\nBRASILIA, Brazil \u2014 Brazil\u2019s health minister said Friday that authorities were \u201cabsolutely sure\u201d that the Zika virus is connected to devastating birth defects and rejected criticism that the government was slow to investigate the surge of cases that set off international alarms.\nIn response to criticism that Brazil was moving too slowly to confirm cases of microcephaly, Castro said the federal government was pushing states and local governments to speed up tests on newborns."}
