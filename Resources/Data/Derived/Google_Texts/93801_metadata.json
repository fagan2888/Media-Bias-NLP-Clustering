Known for his books like \u201cMystery Train,\u201d \u201cLipstick Traces\u201d and \u201cThe Old, Weird America\u201d (on Dylan\u2019s \u201cBasement Tapes\u201d), he\u2019s forged a personal brand of criticism that blends traditional close reading with the styles of Leslie Fiedler and Pauline Kael, as well as deep, almost free-associative mediations on American history.\n\nHis new \u201cThe History of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll in Ten Songs\u201d \u2014 as eccentric as any of his previous books \u2014 has drawn him more attention than anything he\u2019s written in a decade. These songs \u2014 whether by Joy Division, The Flamin\u2019 Groovies, Etta James \u2014 tell their stories through the context they summon around them.\n\nMarcus can be a bit like Van Morrison, the subject of his book \u201cWhen That Rough God Goes Riding\u201d: sometimes portentous and devoid of humor, but often lyrical and sometimes transcendent. \u201cThe History\u201d is Marcus at his best.\n\nWe spoke to the Berkeley-based Marcus from New York, where he is teaching this term. (Disclosure: Marcus and I are both published by Yale University Press.)\n\nLet\u2019s talk about \u201cThe History of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll.\u201d It\u2019s an understatement to say that, for you, a song is not just a number that was recorded once and that it belongs only to the first musician to perform it. What\u2019s a song to you, and how does that work in this history of yours?\n\nWell, I guess the way it works, in this book anyway, is that a song becomes a thing in itself. Yes, it\u2019s written by someone, it\u2019s performed by a person or a group and it goes into the world with various names attached to it. But it makes itself felt as a thing in itself, as its own object, as its own subject. People don\u2019t necessarily know or care, and there\u2019s no reason why they should, who the people making this record are, what their hopes and fears are, what their motives were, what situation in life they were in when the song came out of them, whether they were in a point in their career where they desperately needed a hit, or simply a matter of building on previous success, or if somebody was in rehab, or going through a divorce, or you know, had just signed up for a program to become an astronaut. People don\u2019t know and don\u2019t need to know any of that. That\u2019s irrelevant.\n\nThe song becomes a kind of repeating event out there in the world, and people make of it what they will. And often the people who are listening are other musicians. Or maybe they\u2019re not musicians yet or singers yet, but they want to be. And maybe it\u2019s this song or any other song that\u2019s made them want to do that. And maybe at some point in their lives that will happen. But in any case, musicians will take up these songs that are out there in the world and they\u2019ll try to play them. They\u2019ll feel that this song is not finished, this song, this story told isn\u2019t complete, that they have something to add to this story, they want to feel, they want to understand and experience what it would be like to sing this song as if it were their own, as if they had thought of it, as if it comes out of them completely new.\n\nIn a lot of ways, that\u2019s the story that this book traces again and again. It takes a song and then it look for, stumbles on or just reaches forward to other people who have taken up this song themselves, whether it\u2019s the Five Satins with \u201cIn the Still of the Night\u201d in 1956, and then this forgotten group of white guys from the University of Texas a year or two later, two or three years later, when their band, which came very close to having a national hit and then was completely and instantly forgotten, is on its last leg, they\u2019re about to break up, and they\u2019re rehearsing one afternoon. They\u2019re just singing all the songs that they use to warm up on, and it just so happens they\u2019re taping it when the band breaks up and they leave. The record company comes into possession of this rehearsal tape and then many, many decades later, an archivist is putting together \u201cThe Domino Records Story,\u201d the Austin, Texas, local label that this group called The Slades recorded for.\n\nAnd this archivist stumbles across this tape and he decides to put it out, he decides to put it on the \u201cThe Domino Records Story\u201d CD, and there it is again in the world. And it does add something new and completely different and kind of shocking to the song as everybody all around the world knows it, \u201cIn the Still of the Night.\u201d That\u2019s just one story.\n\nAnd I think you get at the way a song changes if it\u2019s taken up in a film or a novel, in the way that we can never hear Louis Armstrong\u2019s \u201cBlack and Blue\u201d in the same way because of the way it\u2019s used in \u201cThe Invisible Man.\u201d\n\nRight. Right. And whether it\u2019s \u201cMoney\u201d with Barrett Strong, and then the Beatles four years later, whether it\u2019s Buddy Holly\u2019s \u201cCrying, Waiting, Hoping,\u201d that he records singing into a tape recorded in his apartment in Greenwich Village in January of 1959, and he\u2019s dead a month later. And the Beatles stumbling on this song as they\u2019re about to break up, as their story\u2019s coming to an end during the \u201cLet It Be\u201d sessions, and giving it a sense of loss and tragedy that it never had before. And giving themselves a sense of loss and tragedy that their music never had before.\n\nI guess, without necessarily conceptualizing it, what I was looking for in this book was a way to let various songs tell their own stories, and then to argue or just to say \u2026 and this is what rock \u2018n\u2019 roll is. This is what rock \u2018n\u2019 roll is about. It\u2019s songs moving through time, sweeping up all sorts of people, and each song making its own history, which in itself contains the whole history that rock \u2018n\u2019 roll has made. In other words, ignoring chronology, ignoring genre, ignoring iconic performers. It\u2019s not about that at all.\n\nSo you mentioned chronology, genre, some other things. The conventional way to tell this story, if the story is the history of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, the conventional way to do it would be to start with the Sun Sessions, do a Chuck Berry song, do a Lennon-McCartney song, and so on. Why did that seem to you insufficient or maybe even a false way to tell this tale?\n\nI mean, there are two reasons. I don\u2019t know how long ago it was, but it was maybe in the late \u201960s, early \u201970s, when I was thinking about this stuff. And a phrase popped into my mind, that what rock \u2018n\u2019 roll is \u2014 really what any cultural form is \u2014 but I think particularly rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, and I\u2019m just talking about all pop music from the late \u201940s to the present that has any verve or edge or excitement or depth at all. Whatever shape it takes. Any art form. But with rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, more immediacy, more sense of the moment, more sense that whatever you\u2019re hearing could disappear at any time, because it\u2019s not something with a grand tradition behind it. It doesn\u2019t have scholarly industries propping it up; it\u2019s on its own as an art form. Put it that way.\n\nRock \u2018n\u2019 roll is a continuum of associations. It\u2019s a conversation going on between records and people and people and songs, wherever they\u2019re performed, wherever they\u2019re heard. It\u2019s a continuum of associations, it\u2019s not a chronology, it\u2019s not a conventional history, it\u2019s not a this, then and that, it\u2019s not a story of progress, you know, some kind of improvement, some kind of aesthetic development. It\u2019s not that at all. So that\u2019s one side of why I didn\u2019t write the kind of conventional book that you\u2019re talking about.\n\nThe other reason is, it\u2019s been done. It\u2019s been done over and over again. It\u2019s been done really well by, say, Nik Cohn or Jim Miller with the Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll. And it\u2019s been done really terribly. But whatever it is, we all know the story. We all know the narrative. It\u2019s a master narrative, it\u2019s been chiseled in stone. Who in their right mind would want to do that again?\n\nFair enough.\n\nPlus, I, just personally, I\u2019ve been doing this a long time. I\u2019ve already written a lot about a lot of people. And I\u2019ve done as well as I can. What was I supposed to do, go back and write about Elvis and pretend that like all the books on Elvis I\u2019ve written didn\u2019t happen, and now fake it and try to write something different? But I can\u2019t imagine why anybody would want to do that at this \u2026\n\nMmhmm. I\u2019m not sure who could pull it off, either.\n\nAll of the songs in your book are unexpected and some are genuinely obscure. Six of them originate in the period from \u201956 to \u201960. You work them through time, forward and back, so they\u2019re not limited to the late \u201950s. But I\u2019m wondering why do these ten songs seem like the right ones, and why does the late \u201950s produce so many of the songs you want to concentrate on, besides the obvious fact that it\u2019s beginning of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll history?\n\nWell, for me, the book just doesn\u2019t feel that way. I mean, I understand how it would seem that way to somebody opening it up. But for example, one of the songs you\u2019re talking about is \u201cAll I Could Do Was Cry\u201d by Etta James from 1960. So that\u2019s one of the six songs from 1956 to 1960. But I came to that song \u2026 you know, I must have heard it when it came out or in the years following. But it never made any impact on me. I never registered it, never thought about it, didn\u2019t own it. That song came to me because of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s performance of it in \u201cCadillac Records\u201d in 2008.\n\nSo it\u2019s the appearance of this \u2026 you know, for me \u2026 I read a wonderful piece the other day in The Pitchfork Review; it\u2019s this great new magazine that the Pitchfork music site has started putting out. And it\u2019s about a guy and how when he was 15 years old he hated \u201cAstral Weeks,\u201d and now he\u2019s 30, he\u2019s loves it, and why he hated it, and why he loves it now, and it\u2019s a wonderful little essay. But one of the things he says is really interesting. He says, \u201cThis album came out in 1968.\u201d He said, \u201cThat is an abstract concept to me. I was born in 1987. I can ask my parents about 1968, but it\u2019s not a marker in my life.\u201d He said, \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, \u2018Astral Weeks\u2019 came out when I first heard it. It came out in 1998, along with \u2026\u201d and he named five or six other things that either did really come out 1998 or that he just that he first heard there. And I thought, that\u2019s the right way to look at it.\n\nAnd so, in a way, for me, \u201cAll I Could Do Was Cry\u201d came out in 2008, not in 1960. Then I go back and discover the song, discover how great it is, discover the stories it tells, but without Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s version ever shrinking because of that, ever becoming less of an event. So I just don\u2019t \u2026 I know it\u2019s there, but it doesn\u2019t feel like that to me.\n\nOne of the songs is the Teddy Bears\u2019 \u201cTo Know Him Is To Love Him,\u201d which came out in 1958. There\u2019s no way on earth I ever would have written about that song. It\u2019s really terrible. It\u2019s embarrassing. I never would have written about that at all, except that in early 2013 while I was just beginning to write this book, I heard Amy Winehouse\u2019s version on the radio. She was already dead, she had recorded this in a disc-jockey studio in 2006. And I just heard it. And I heard what she did with it, and I heard the way she opened the song up as if she had spent years studying it. Years with the idea there\u2019s something more here than anyone\u2019s ever heard. I know it\u2019s there, I can\u2019t find it, I\u2019m gonna keep singing it, I\u2019m gonna keep rearranging it, until the song gives up its soul. And she did that. And I just said, \u201cI have to write about this.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a question of this as opposed to something else, or \u201cIs this really the song that I should include in this book?\u201d A lot of the songs in this book just appeared. Just made their way into it while I was working. There were a couple of songs, the first two that I write about, that from the time I came up with the idea of the book, I always knew I would include. They had to be there, and they had to be first. And after that, it was all \u2026 I didn\u2019t know what would be in the book. Didn\u2019t have a clue.\n\nYou use the phrase, for what I think is your second book, \u201cLipstick Traces,\u201d you call it a \u201csecret history.\u201d That phrase has caught on and been used by other people since. I\u2019m wondering A) where you got the phrase and B) if you see that as what you do in general as a writer on music and culture.\n\nWell, the phrase \u201csecret history\u201d has a long history. It refers to spycraft. There are lots of books, you know, \u201cThe Secret History of World War II,\u201d which means the espionage war. Or the secret history of Mata Hari, her life as a spy, that sort of thing. So it\u2019s a very conventional term in that way. But I got the title \u2026 or I got the phrase, the idea, whatever you want to call it, from a novel published in the late \u201970s by Robie Macauley, who was an editor, I believe, at Random House, but I think this was his only novel. He died not long after it was published. And it was called \u201cA Secret History of Time to Come.\u201d And it is a novel about the future, about what\u2019s left after a nuclear war, precipitated by a race war in the United States, wipes out civilization and what\u2019s left. And so \u201cA Secret History of Time to Come.\u201d\n\nAnd that phrase was so beautiful to me. It was so perfectly balanced, it was poetry and it just stayed with me. So I stole it. And as far as what I do, I know why I do what I do. I know why I\u2019m drawn to framing things as mysteries, as unfinished stories, as stories that need to be completed, as dead people who need to rise up and live their lives. I know why I\u2019m interested in what seems to be hidden or unspoken or occult. It\u2019s my own story, which there\u2019s no need to tell. But I\u2019ve always felt that neuroses aren\u2019t necessarily a bad thing if they don\u2019t completely rule your life. A neurosis, an obsession, whatever you want to call it, is a source of energy, it\u2019s a source of intellectual curiosity. And if you\u2019re aware of what your neuroses are, what the hell? Ride them. Make them into horses and get on them and let them take you where you want to go or where they want to take you.\n\nPeople \u2026 it\u2019s funny, people used to make fun of Pauline Kael because all of her book titles seem to have something to do with sex. You know, \u201cI Lost It At the Movies\u201d or \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang\u201d and on and on and on from there. And I\u2019m sure once that got going, Pauline had tremendous fun tweaking people by never giving up on that. But this book has a very nice, blank title. So there\u2019s nothing mysterious there.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Greil Marcus explains why the sick new American racism is only getting worse, and explores his brilliant new book", "author": "Scott Timberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Greil Marcus explains why the sick new American racism is only getting worse, and explores his brilliant new book", "title": "\u201cWhen that cop killed Michael Brown, and when George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin, they were killing Barack Obama\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/12/when_that_cop_killed_michael_brown_and_when_george_zimmerman_killed_trayvon_martin_they_were_killing_barack_obama/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/zimmerman_obama_wilson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Greil Marcus explains why the sick new American racism is only getting worse, and explores his brilliant new book", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/zimmerman_obama_wilson.jpg", "title": "\u201cWhen that cop killed Michael Brown, and when George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin, they were killing Barack Obama\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cWhen that cop killed Michael Brown, and when George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin, they were killing Barack Obama\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Bob Dylan, Books, Editor's Picks, Elvis Presley, Etta James, George Zimmerman, Greil Marcus, Joy Division, Lipstick Traces, Race, The Beatles, The Handsome Family, Trayvon Martin, Van Morrison", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d71\"", "article_summary": "This is what rock \u2018n\u2019 roll is about.\nIt\u2019s been done really well by, say, Nik Cohn or Jim Miller with the Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll.\nRock \u2018n\u2019 roll is a continuum of associations.\nThat song came to me because of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s performance of it in \u201cCadillac Records\u201d in 2008.\nAnd a phrase popped into my mind, that what rock \u2018n\u2019 roll is \u2014 really what any cultural form is \u2014 but I think particularly rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, and I\u2019m just talking about all pop music from the late \u201940s to the present that has any verve or edge or excitement or depth at all."}
