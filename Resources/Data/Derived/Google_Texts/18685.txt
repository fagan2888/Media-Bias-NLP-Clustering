Today’s employers have a much more paternalistic relationship with employees compared to when I joined the workforce. And, while I believe some Silicon Valley companies have gone overboard with free helicopter rides and concierge services, I commend the trend of companies going beyond traditional health coverage to provide additional perks that help employees optimize many aspects of their lives.

Beyond the enormity of managing all of these resources, an equally daunting task is educating and engaging employees in the benefits and resources offered to them, such as free flu shots, behavioral health support, and wealth management.
