She took seventh. ( Brandon Hopper / Daily Record )\n\nMatthew Miller during the Class 3A state track and field meet Saturday at Jeffco Stadium. He finished eighth. (Brandon Hopper / Daily Record)\n\nLakewood \u2014 Makenna Green's strategy starts long before she throws the shot put for the first time at the state competition.\n\nFor the third year in a row, Green stayed at home as the rest of the Huskies' state qualifiers got to Jeffco Stadium on Thursday.\n\n\"I just like to be able to get some sleep, be able to sleep in my own bed and not have to get up really early,\" Green said.\n\nCan't argue with results. The junior took seventh place in the shot put Saturday with a personal best throw of 37 feet, 3 1/2 inches.\n\nEvery year, the state track and field schedule is the same, and the girls Class 3A shot put is on Saturday afternoon. She did the same thing as a freshman and sophomore when she also qualified in the event.\n\nGreen's previous best was 36 feet, 11 inches, and she entered the meet seeded seventh.\n\nA slight surprise to even be competing Saturday, Matthew Miller made his races count. He took seventh in the 110-meter hurdles in an eight-person race, and he was eighth in the 300-meter hurdles that had the full nine competitors.\n\nMiller entered the meet ranked 13th in the 110s and 14th in the 300s.\n\n\"I came in at 13th so I was trying to be realistic about where I was going to be and I just happened to get that 9 seed (in the preliminaries),\" said Miller, adding that being the finals was the goal he had set for himself.\n\nAlso placing for the Huskies during the meet was Taylor Holand. She tied for third in the high jump Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_25784950/florence-huskies-junior-makenna-green-gets-7th-shot", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0517/20140517__19drftrw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Brandon Hopper \n \n  hopperb@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Lakewood \u2014 Makenna Green's strategy starts long before she throws the shot put for the first time at the state competition.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:25784950:view"}, "startDate": "2014-05-17T17:53:28-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_25784950/florence-huskies-junior-makenna-green-gets-7th-shot", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0517/20140517__19drftrw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Lakewood \u2014 Makenna Green's strategy starts long before she throws the shot put for the first time at the state competition.", "title": "Florence Huskies junior Makenna Green gets 7th in shot put"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Lakewood \u2014 Makenna Green's strategy starts long before she throws the shot put for the first time at the state competition.", "title": "Florence Huskies junior Makenna Green gets 7th in shot put", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_25784950/florence-huskies-junior-makenna-green-gets-7th-shot", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0517/20140517__19drftrw~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-05-17T17:53:28-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Florence Huskies junior Makenna Green gets 7th in shot put", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0517/20140517__19drftrw~2.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "modificationDate": "2014-05-17T17:54:00-0600", "endDate": "2024-05-17T17:48:38-0600", "byline": "By Brandon Hopperhopperb@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "pubDate": "2014-05-17T17:54:40-0600", "news_keywords": "Canyon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canyon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb941\"", "article_summary": "Makenna Green during the Class 3A state track and field meet Saturday at Jeffco Stadium in Lakewood.\nThe junior took seventh place in the shot put Saturday with a personal best throw of 37 feet, 3 1/2 inches.\n( Brandon Hopper / Daily Record )Matthew Miller during the Class 3A state track and field meet Saturday at Jeffco Stadium.\nShe took seventh.\nEvery year, the state track and field schedule is the same, and the girls Class 3A shot put is on Saturday afternoon."}
