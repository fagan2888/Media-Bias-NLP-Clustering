Michael Bennet said he has \u201cno answers\u201d for Coloradans who are suffering with the \u201cmost expensive health care on the planet\u201d from Obamacare.\n\nIn an interview with the editorial board of the Daily Sentinel in Grand Junction, Bennet said it is \u201cnext to impossible\u201d to fix the president\u2019s health care law.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is making headway against costs most everywhere but in western and central Colorado, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said Friday. Those areas have \u201csome of the most expensive health care on the planet,\u201d Bennet told The Daily Sentinel editorial board. Fixing the act, frequently referred to as Obamacare, is next to impossible in the politically charged atmosphere in Washington, D.C., in which Democrats refuse to change it at all and Republicans want to toss it wholesale, Bennet said. Grand Junction, which was touted as having some of the lowest Medicare costs, also has some of the highest health care costs overall, according to a database study of spending by insurance plans. Resolving such issues is no clear task, Bennet said. \u201cI don\u2019t have answers for Grand Junction, but I\u2019m aware of the problem,\u201d he said.\n\nUnitedHealth, the largest insurer in the country, recently announced it will leave most Obamacare exchanges by next year, citing huge loses. The company lost $475 million last year in the exchanges, and expects to lose another $500 million in 2016.\n\nOther companies are expecting \u201csubstantial increases\u201d for Obamacare premiums next year. The biggest co-op in Colorado\u2019s Obamacare exchange has already folded, leaving 83,000 people to searching for new health insurance.\n\nBennet voted for Obamacare and promised in 2009 \u201cif you have coverage and you like it, you can keep it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
