A new initiative to make sure the nation\u2019s public schools sing the \u201cright\u201d tune on global warming.\n\nEven U.S. News and World Report, not known as a rightwing rag, recognized the tactic well enough to subtitle its story \u201cThe administration wants students and teachers to toe the line on climate change,\u201d and the body of the report said the Administration \u201cwill distribute science-based information\u2014in line with the administration\u2019s position on the issue\u2014to students, teachers and the broader public\u201d [emphases added].\n\n\u201cUnder President Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan,\u201d the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy said in announcing the initiative, important steps have already been taken to cut carbon pollution, prepare for the impacts of climate change, and lead international efforts to fight this global challenge. Continued progress into the future will depend on ensuring a climate-smart citizenry and a next-generation American workforce of city planners, community leaders, engineers, and entrepreneurs who understand the urgent climate-change challenge and are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and training to seek and implement solutions.\n\nThat\u2019s why today, in support of the Obama Administration\u2019s steady efforts to address climate change, the [OSTP] is launching a new Climate Education and Literacy Initiative to help connect American students and citizens with the best-available, science-based information about climate change.\n\nLet\u2019s dissect a little of that language.\n\nFirst, a \u201cclimate-smart citizenry\u201d of course means one that agrees with Obama. Presumably it excludes those who are aware that:\n\nSecond, a \u201cnext-generation American workforce\u201d seems clearly to mean one molded by the Next Generation Science Standards, which are biased both scientifically (in favor of Darwinism and global warming alarmism) and religiously (in favor of naturalistic materialism, i.e., atheism) and so are being challenged legally.\n\nThird, those \u201ccity planners, community leaders, engineers, and entrepreneurs who understand the urgent climate-change challenge and are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and training to seek and implement solutions\u201d will certainly not include people who know the facts bulleted above. But you can bet those elites will share MIT health economist Jonathan Gruber\u2019s contempt for \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter,\u201d without which Obamacare \u201cwould not have passed.\u201d And you can bet they\u2019re depending on that same \u201cstupidity of the American voter\u201d to get suckered in on global warming.\n\nFourth, you can be quite certain that the White House\u2019s \u201cClimate Education and Literacy Initiative\u201d won\u2019t inform students of the facts bulleted above, despite their being among the \u201cbest-available, science-based information about climate change.\u201d\n\nSo, get ready, America. You were sold a bill of goods on Obamacare. Now you\u2019re being sold a bill of goods on global warming. Different issue.
