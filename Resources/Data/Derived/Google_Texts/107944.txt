1. Mary Jane’s Bridge

You can hear various stories about how the spirit said to haunt this small bridge on Bayou Tortue Road near Broussard became a spirt: a murdered prom date, the victim of a serial ax killer, and more. Former Daily Advertiser staffer Jim Bradshaw wrote that people sometimes see an apparition on the anniversary of the girl’s death. A former police officer wrote Bradshaw that he’d seen a girl, dressed in white with long brown hair, on the bridge on an inexplicably cold August night in 1985.

2. Chretien Point

An 1830s-vintage plantation, Chretien Point was a 3,000-acre cotton producer. The mistress of the plantation was Felicité Chretien, who worked like a man and joined her husband and his friends for cigars and poker in the 12-room mansion. Her husband died young, but Felicité carried on. When a bandit slipped into the home one night, Felicité shot him dead on the grand staircase that would later be the model for “Gone With the Wind.” The Chretien Point website says visitors report that Felicité appears now again to say, “I’ll see your hundred and raise you 20.”

3. Susie Plantation

This early 19th-century plantation home in Centreville is said to be haunted by a former slave and by a plantation mistress who died in childbirth a couple of years after her husband accepted the plantation as a dowry.

4. The Nichols Home

This house in the town of Washington is said to have served as a Civil War hospital. The ghost here is an amputee who was never properly discharged.

5. Shadows on the Teche

Poor Miss Mary Moore. She was the mistress of the New Iberia plantation, built in the 1830s. She died there when the home was occupied during the Civil War. Hauntedplaces.org says she shows up occasionally as a misty figure and as footsteps on the second floor and in the attic.
