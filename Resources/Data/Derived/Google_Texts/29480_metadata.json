Mike Huckabee (R-AR), Gov. Bobby Jindal (R-LA), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) brought the crowd to their feet several times while speaking at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa Saturday.\n\nHuckabee told the crowd that the basic unit of government is the family. \u201cA mother and a father and the children being raised to become the next generation, and those parents are there to train that generation to become the replacements for them,\u201d Huckabee explained.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHuckabee also got loud applause when he said he is the only GOP candidate that has run against the Clinton Machine when he ran for office in Arkansas and who \u201cconsistently defeated it\u2026 and most importantly lived to tell about it.\u201d\n\nThe FAMiLY Leader \u2013 a pro-life, pro-mariage, pro-family organization \u2013 sponsored the event, so it was clear the attendees supported Huckabee\u2014 an ordained Baptist minister \u2014 for his stance on religious freedom not being usurped by the federal government.\n\nGraham brought the crowd to their feet when he slammed Hillary Clinton on Benghazi. \u201cWhere the hell were you when those people needed you the most?\u201d Graham charged at Clinton, \u201cHow could you allow it to become a death trap?\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s attack on the Democratic frontrunner\u2019s handling of Benghazi during her time as Secretary of State got him a standing ovation.\n\nJindal brought the crowd out of their seats when he said the government shouldn\u2019t be getting into individual\u2019s religious rights or impeding the constitution.\n\nHe mentioned how God created the United States of America, and the next president will have to fight the New York Times, Washington Post, the ACLU, and anyone else who gets in the way. This again brought the crowd to their feet.\n\nJindal said he was ready for certain Democrats to lose their jobs, benefits, and go to prison, which provoked another ovation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m critical when the mainstream media doesn\u2019t apply the same standards to this president that they apply to the rest of us,\u201d he said. This statement led to the longest crowd ovation of the day.\n\nCruz also brought the crowd out of their chairs.\n\nHe spoke about the need for the people to take the country back \u2013 away from a ruling political class \u2014 and he also addressed the importance of religious liberty. \u201cNever ever ever shy away from defending religious liberty \u2013 ever,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cAnd I will tell you what my prayer is in the face of this disgraceful lawless decision,\u201d referencing the recent Supreme Court decision legalizing same sex marriage. Cruz continued, \u2018That it will awaken the body of Christ and lift us up to rise up for the \u2026evangelicals\u2026to say we will take this country back.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News spoke to several audience members about whom they favor in the GOP presidential race.\n\nMinnesota resident Linnea Burtch drove two hours to Ames, Iowa with her husband Keith to attend the Family Leadership Summit and hear several of the GOP presidential candidates speak.\n\nShe said she lives in a blue state, and she wished the GOP candidates would come campaign there. Burtch told Breitbart News, \u201cI do not like Bush.\u201d She\u2019s also not a fan of Cruz, Jindal or Rubio \u2013 but very supportive of Trump. \u201cI love him\u2026he says it the way it is.\u201d\n\nEven though Burtch supports Trump, she said her first pick for president is Dr. Ben Carson, and Trump is her second choice.\n\nWhen questioned about Trump\u2019s war hero comments about Sen. John McCain, Burtch didn\u2019t seem to care, as she isn\u2019t a big fan of McCain. Burtch said she wasn\u2019t there to watch Trump\u2019s speech, so she didn\u2019t see his comment, only heard about it when asked by Breitbart News.\n\nTwo 18-year-old voters also spoke to Breitbart News. Both David Bis and Shelby Vroman said they really like Carson, saying he seems more concerned with education. Vroman liked education being discussed, as she attended the event last year and didn\u2019t think it was brought up enough at that time.\n\nVroman added that she thought the GOP presidential candidates should go speak more at colleges. She said GOP candidates could get the younger vote if they were willing to come to college campuses, but they \u201cdon\u2019t think they\u2019ll get the vote, so they don\u2019t,\u201d she complained.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Huckabee, Jindal, Cruz, Graham Bring Family Leadership Summit Crowd to Their Feet", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Huckabee, Jindal, Cruz, Graham Bring Family Leadership Summit Crowd to Their Feet", "title": "Huckabee, Jindal, Cruz, Graham at Family Leadership Summit", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Ted-Cruz-L-and-Lindsay-Graham.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/18/huckabee-jindal-cruz-graham-bring-family-leadership-summit-crowd-to-their-feet/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Huckabee, Jindal, Cruz, Graham Bring Family Leadership Summit Crowd to Their Feet", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Ted-Cruz-L-and-Lindsay-Graham.jpg", "title": "Huckabee, Jindal, Cruz, Graham at Family Leadership Summit", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Family Leadership Summit, Gov Bobby Jindal, Gov.
