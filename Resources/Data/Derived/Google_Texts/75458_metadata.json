Both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main challenger, the centrist Isaac Herzog, will need Kahlon's party with them in order to create a viable governing coalition. Kahlon's emphasis is on economic issues; his foreign policy guru is Michael Oren, who is ranked fourth on the Kulanu list. Oren served as Israel's ambassador to the United States from 2009 until 2013, when he was replaced by Netanyahu's closest aide, Ron Dermer. It was Netanyahu and Dermer who helped force the most recent (and most serious) crisis in U.S.-Israel relations, and I called Oren last week in Jerusalem to discuss how the next government should go about repairing Israel's relationships in Washington. Here is our conversation: (Update: Since posting this, a number of people have asked me, not unreasonably, what Oren's immediate future holds, beyond a seat in the Knesset. The short answer is, I don't know. If Israel's government were organized in a semi-sane way, then Oren would obviously be the country's next foreign minister, or at least deputy foreign minister\u2014or, at the very least, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Managing Relations With Other People. But coalition politics are very complicated, so it's not clear exactly what role he would play, assuming his party enters the coalition. On to the interview.)\n\nJeffrey Goldberg: How much damage has been done to Israel's relations with the United States? Michael Oren: I think we\u2019re going to have to be proactive in order to get ourselves to a better place. I\u2019m not starry-eyed. I understand that there are structural differences between the U.S. and Israel. The United States is a big country, far from the Middle East, that isn\u2019t threatened the way Israel is. And there are ideological differences as well. But we must work to get this to a better place. Goldberg: How did you keep the relationship from falling apart when you were ambassador? Oren: I understood that preserving bipartisan support for Israel was a paramount strategic interest for us. And there was no place I wouldn\u2019t go in order to preserve that. Goldberg: But what were the mechanics of doing it? Oren: America is going through a period of deep polarization, and both parties were trying to use us as a wedge issue. Not just the Republicans. So I was always trying to balance this. But the much more serious challenge came from the right, not the left. That\u2019s something I found out when I got to Washington. Goldberg: A few years ago, we thought that J Street, the Jewish left, was going to drive the agenda. But now people to the right of AIPAC (the mainstream pro-Israel lobby) are doing much of the driving. How did that happen? \"The right is growing much more rapidly, even as a percentage within the Jewish community.\" Oren: There\u2019s a very simple answer to that. J Street\u2019s power derived from the fact that it is an extension of the Obama administration. The Obama administration invited J Street into the room with other Jewish organizations and sent high-level officials to speak at their conventions. But the reservoir of support for J Street is not particularly large. The American Jewish community is 5 million people. What percentage of that number is actually involved in Jewish affairs? What percentage of those are involved with Israel, and what percentage of people involved with Israel wake up in the morning saying, \u2018I care about Israel but I\u2019m pained by Israel\u2019s policies.\u2019 That\u2019s a very low percentage.\n\nThe right is growing much more rapidly, even as a percentage within the Jewish community. There\u2019s a greater percentage that is more religious, more conservative. That disparity is going to grow in favor of the right in coming years. Goldberg: If you had still been ambassador these past two months, do you think what happened would have happened, or would have happened in a way that didn\u2019t infuriate the White House and the Democratic Party? Oren: I\u2019m not going to criticize Ron Dermer. I worked very closely with him. Every ambassador brings his own skill set, his own worldview, and his own relationship with the prime minister. Ron has been a close adviser to the prime minister for more than a decade. It\u2019s a different relationship. I don\u2019t want to criticize Ron for certain assumptions that didn\u2019t pan out. My different approach stemmed from very fundamental conclusions I had made. Because I had taught in the United States in previous years, at Harvard, Yale, and Georgetown, I saw close up the transformations that had taken place in American society. This was not the America I had left in the 1970s. Many Israelis, particularly Israelis of my generation, remember a different America. And I knew that with all respect to President Obama, he was a symptom, rather than a cause, of these changes. Which is why I thought from early on that he would be a two-term president, and that his victory in 2012 would be more significant than his 2008 victory, because 2012 meant that some of these changes were quite permanent. And so I brought to the job of ambassador an understanding that the United States is moving in a new direction, and as the crucial ally of Israel\u2019s, we have to find out what direction the United States is moving in and then adapt ourselves to the greatest degree possible to this new direction in way consistent with our security interests. Goldberg: You mean multicultural sort of changes? Oren: Yes, among other things. As ambassador you have to build personal relationships, you have to invest a tremendous amount of time in the social life of Washington, you have to build a rapport with people with whom you might not agree all the time. But you have to be able to pick up the phone at any time, even in the middle of the night, and reach the people you need to talk to. You have to establish a level of personal trust.\n\nOne example is that we would actively reach out to different parts of the Democratic party, among them the black caucus. I spent a lot of time engaged in a dialogue with the Congressional Black Caucus. \"One of the principles of the U.S.-Israel relationship over the years has been \u2018No surprises.\u2019 And I did my best to pursue that principle.\" So in 2011, when the prime minister gave a speech to a joint meeting of Congress, I don\u2019t know that the White House was enthusiastic about it, but they were certainly kept in the picture. One of the principles of the U.S.-Israel relationship over the years has been \u2018No surprises.\u2019 And I did my best to pursue that principle. Goldberg: Do you think the White House is oversensitive to what it perceives to be personal slights? Oren: A primary difference in the political cultures of America and Israel is that Americans salute the rank, not the person. Israelis barely salute anyone. There is a tremendous amount of umbrage on the American side if you are seen to insult the presidency. A former president in America is addressed as Mr. President. A former prime minister in Israel is Ehud. It\u2019s very different. Goldberg: This is one of the reasons that (Georgia Democratic Representative) John Lewis stayed away from the Netanyahu speech. Oren: When I heard that John Lewis was staying away from the speech, I felt like I got punched in the gut. I am a great admirer of his, and his support for Israel is precious to me. Goldberg: Is it more the responsibility of Israel to fix this relationship than the U.S.'s? Oren: It\u2019s always on Israel, as the junior partner in the strategic relationship, to make the maximum effort. Goldberg: What does the next government have to do to fix this? Oren: It has to establish this as one of its top priorities, rectifying whatever damage was done and then strengthening the relationship, doing this with the knowledge that there will be ideological and structural differences. Goldberg: This is what I don\u2019t understand. How do you paper over real differences? This isn\u2019t just about being polite and not surprising each other.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michael Oren, the former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. and current candidate for Knesset, argues that it will crucial for his country&#39;s next government to get right with America.", "author": "Jeffrey Goldberg", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Michael Oren, the former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. and current candidate for Knesset, argues that it will crucial for his country&#39;s next government to get right with America.", "title": "Undoing Netanyahu's Damage to U.S.-Israel Relations", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/03/RTR30YB9/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/undoing-the-damage-netanyahu-has-done-to-us-israel-relations/387817/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/jeffreygoldberg182"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddfcc\"", "article_summary": "Jeffrey Goldberg: How much damage has been done to Israel's relations with the United States?\nOren served as Israel's ambassador to the United States from 2009 until 2013, when he was replaced by Netanyahu's closest aide, Ron Dermer.\nThe United States is a big country, far from the Middle East, that isn\u2019t threatened the way Israel is.\nBecause I had taught in the United States in previous years, at Harvard, Yale, and Georgetown, I saw close up the transformations that had taken place in American society.\nMichael Oren: I think we\u2019re going to have to be proactive in order to get ourselves to a better place."}
