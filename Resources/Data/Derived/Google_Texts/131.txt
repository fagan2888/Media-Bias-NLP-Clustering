The Boulder Sheriff’s Office and a trained rescue team worked into the night Saturday to pull stranded rock climbers from a steep-walled Flatiron peak.

The unknown climbers “were kind of ill-prepared and got stuck up there after dark,” Sgt. Brian Zierlein said at 9:40 p.m. “It sounds like they had only one rope.”

Zierlein said a highly trained Rocky Mountain Rescue team was on the famous Third Flatiron in search of an unknown number of people stuck somewhere high on its sheer rock slope.

“God bless these guys, climbing in the dark on this stuff,” he said. “I wouldn’t do it.”

The Flatirons are a series of sheer rock walls that jut almost vertically, like mammoth clothes irons, over the city of Boulder and the University of Colorado campus. The climbers called for help at the south end of the formation.

It was not immediately clear how many climbers were up there hours after sunset, exactly where they got stranded or whether the rescue team would try to pull them up or rappel them down. Because of pitch-dark conditions, the rescue effort progressed slowly.

Chris Baker, a dispatcher for the sheriff’s office, said it was not unusual for climbers to ascend the Flatirons late on warm Saturday afternoons.

“The weekends are pretty busy,” he said.

The Third Flatiron is among the steepest and busiest multi-pitch routes in the world. It is also a nesting site for falcons, which limits the climbing season.

The letters CU have been painted and removed from its face repeatedly during the last half-century.

While a rescue may take hours, the Third Flatiron’s slope lures some amazing fast speed-climbing athletes. The quickest ascent to date: 5 minutes and 59 seconds.
