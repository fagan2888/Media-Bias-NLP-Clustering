Then police charged them with trespassing, handcuffed them and hauled them out of the people\u2019s house.\n\nThese Moral Monday protesters didn\u2019t understand the situation as Tillis did or, for that matter, from the perspective of his fellow hardline Republicans from Wisconsin to Georgia. The way GOP hardliners see it, Tillis is the Speaker. He speaks, and everybody else shuts up and listens. These lawmakers don\u2019t represent constituents in a constitutional democracy. They are overlords. And as rulers over the people, they\u2019ve awarded themselves the power to muzzle and handcuff anyone who disagrees with them.\n\nWhile styling themselves as defenders of the constitution and protectors of individual rights, hardline GOPers, in practice, protect their own power and position by violating the Constitution and denying individuals their rights. Just take North Carolina for example.\n\nThere, Moral Monday activists gathered at the Capitol weekly for months last year, protesting the general assembly\u2019s voter suppression laws, cuts to unemployment benefits, denial of expanded Medicaid benefits to the working poor under the Affordable Care Act, repeal of the Racial Justice Act and tax cuts for the rich. These demonstrations resumed this year, with 80,000 rallying at the first one in Raleigh in February. And they\u2019ve spread across the south, to Georgia and South Carolina. In Alabama, the weekly events are called Truthful Tuesdays.\n\nLast year, police arrested 945 of these protesters when they entered the North Carolina Capitol to make their voices heard after congregating outside to chant, sing spirituals and hear speeches. They got lots of publicity. And their popularity soared while that of the GOP-controlled general assembly plummeted.\n\nThis, of course, annoyed hardline Republicans responsible for the policies the activists protested. So this year, they did something about it. No, they didn\u2019t \u201crepent, repeal and restore,\u201d as the activists requested. Instead, the hardliners attempted to repress, rescind and revoke the citizens\u2019 constitutional rights.\n\nThe Republican majority in the North Carolina legislature adopted rules making it a crime\u2014a misdemeanor\u2014for citizens to exercise their First Amendment rights to assembly, speech and protest in the Capitol, legislative office buildings and grounds.\n\nThe rules forbid citizens who enter the Capitol buildings from \u201cdisturbing\u201d lawmakers or their staff members. This includes singing, clapping, shouting and playing musical instruments. No Christmas carols in the North Carolina Capitol! Skulking lobbyists, however, are welcome.\n\nThat\u2019s not all, though. The rule says police may arrest and criminally charge a citizen who poses an \u201cimminent disturbance.\u201d The GOP neglected to define imminent disturbance, though. So, depending on the law enforcement officer, an imminent disturbance could be casting a dirty look at a lawmaker. It could be clutching a hymnal. It could be walking with two hands capable of clapping.\n\nThe rules also outlaw signs on sticks and placards that would \u201cdisturb\u201d a lawmaker or legislative staffer. So, basically, picketing at the state Capitol is barred. Under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment, North Carolina GOP State Senator Thom Goolsby was free to denigrate the activists as \u201cMoron Monday\u201d protesters in an op-ed published in the Chatham Journal. But if Goolsby were \u201cdisturbed\u201d by a citizen scrawling \u201cGoolsby is a moron\u201d on cardboard and carrying it in the Capitol, the legislative rules give the GOP lawmaker the power to order guards to confiscate it and charge the citizen with a crime.\n\nIn addition, the rules require protesters to get permits to rally on Capitol grounds from the very people who don\u2019t want them to rally on Capitol grounds. The GOP hardliners have invested in themselves the power to determine exactly who has and who does not have a First Amendment right to assemble on public property in North Carolina.\n\nThe GOP decrees violate virtually every protection in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\u2014the right to petition the government for redress of grievances, the right to peaceably assemble and the right of free speech.\n\nThis is Republican rule, not representative governance. This is the arrogance of King George, not the deference of a public servant. It\u2019s unconstitutional and un-American.\n\nIn May, immediately after Republicans in the legislature imposed the new rules, 1,500 Moral Monday activists met and broke bread in the Bicentennial Mall in front of the North Carolina Legislative Building. Then they covered their mouths with duct tape and marched silently through the Capitol, distributing bread to several lawmakers.\n\nThe Raleigh News & Observer described it this way in an editorial afterward: \u201cThese protesters have done a public service, pure and simple. They have spoken eloquently and loudly, even when they do not speak at all.\u201d\n\nAmericans cherish the idea that they live in a country that pulls up the downtrodden, protects the weak, and provides equal opportunity for all to succeed. They believe their government should work to fulfill these ideals. When it fails, Americans know their Constitutional protections, like the right to speak, protest and assemble, will help them get their representational democracy back on track.\n\nThe Moral Monday protesters are dissidents, defying overlords who are trying to shut them up and shut them down by denying them their most basic Constitutional rights.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://inthesetimes.com/article/16823/moral_mondays_be_silent_or_else", "image": "http://inthesetimes.com/images/made/images/Gerard_GOP_500_400_s.jpg", "description": "North Carolina residents are being denied First Amendment rights.", "title": "Message to \u2018Moral Mondays\u2019 Protesters: Be Silent\u2014Or Else"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ec6\"", "article_summary": "No Christmas carols in the North Carolina Capitol!\nLast year, police arrested 945 of these protesters when they entered the North Carolina Capitol to make their voices heard after congregating outside to chant, sing spirituals and hear speeches.\nJust take North Carolina for example.\nThese Moral Monday protesters didn\u2019t understand the situation as Tillis did or, for that matter, from the perspective of his fellow hardline Republicans from Wisconsin to Georgia.\nUnder the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment, North Carolina GOP State Senator Thom Goolsby was free to denigrate the activists as \u201cMoron Monday\u201d protesters in an op-ed published in the Chatham Journal."}
