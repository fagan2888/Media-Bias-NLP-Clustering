Incidents of skin cancer are on the rise, and protecting yourself from the damaging effects of the sun is more important than ever.\n\nHere's why you should care. More than 2 million Americans develop skin cancer each year. Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is the most common form of cancer for teenagers and young adults between 15 and 29 years old, and the leading cause of cancer death in women ages 25 to 29. Since 2000, the rates of new melanoma cases have climbed by 2 percent every year.\n\nThough there are a multitude of effective products on the market, the federal government has also been slow to approve newer and stronger sunscreen ingredients that are already available outside the U.S. An FDA spokesperson said on Thursday that the agency \u201crecognizes the public health importance of sunscreen use\u201d and has \u201cprioritized reviewing the safety and effectiveness of additional sunscreen ingredients as quickly as possible given its resources.\u201d\n\nRelated: CHART: How Climate Change Is Affecting Your Region\n\nNew technologies beyond plain-vanilla sunscreen are sprouting up to help you avoid skin damage \u2013 and in the worst case scenario, cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2008, 60 percent of adults over age 25 said they usually adopt sun-protective behaviors such as using sunscreen, sun-protective clothing or staying in the shade, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the younger people are, the less they protect their skin. Only 45 percent of Americans between ages 18 and 24 used one or more protective methods. Among high school students, 14.4 percent of girls and just 7.3 percent of boys reported routinely using a sunscreen with an SPF 15 or higher.\n\n\u201cIn general, the younger age group does tend to adopt riskier sun behavior,\u201d said David Andrews, chief scientist at Environmental Working Group. \u201cTan skin is considered a sign of health and beauty.\u201d\n\nRelated: What Climate Change Is Really Costing You\n\nEven if all Americans regularly wore sunscreen, the most protective products are not yet available to us.\n\n\u201cThe last time a new sunscreen product was approved was in 1999,\u201d said Yianni Varonis, spokesman for U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), who announced earlier this month that he\u2019s cosponsoring bipartisan legislation to strengthen the potency of sunscreen found in the U.S. The legislation would expedite the review process of sunscreen ingredients by the Food and Drug Administration. These products are manufactured in the U.S. in many cases but can\u2019t be sold legally here, yet they\u2019re widely available in Canada and Europe.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. sunscreen market is behind,\u201d Varonis added. The legislation would not just give consumers for choices for sunscreen products, it would also boost revenue for those U.S. companies manufacturing the ingredients and, in turn, help create jobs.\n\nHigh Tech and the Sun\n\nThe corporate world is fast trying to grab a piece of the sunscreen industry, which is estimated at $1.5 billion. Here are 5 innovations to know about:\n\nVending machines can dispense a 10-second sunscreen mist for $2. The mist machines come in different formats: Either you stand in a booth that rinses you and sprays you for a few seconds, or you use a pump to spray yourself. These machines are currently in operation in Florida, including one in the Central Florida Zoo.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first-ever drinkable sunscreen was recently released and sells for $30 for a 3.38-oz bottle. The makers of Harmonized UV Water claim that by simply drinking a few sips of the product along with water an hour before sun exposure and taking additional doses every three hours, you\u2019re \u201ccovered\u201d for the day. It\u2019s not yet FDA approved - and many suspect it sounds far too good to be true. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything credible on drinkable sunscreen,\u201d said EWG\u2019s Andrews.\n\n\n\n\n\nA myriad of apps for smartphones remind you when to reapply sunscreen or give you UV information about specific locations. \u201cThere\u2019s a role these apps can have in terms of monitoring UV exposure,\u201d said Andrews. \u201cHaving feedback on whether or not you are overexposed or whether you need to reapply is a good thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSome UV wristbands fulfill more or less the same function. Color-changing wristbands alert you to reapply sunscreen or seek shade. They\u2019re usually single use only, and at a couple of dollars each, this option can get pricey.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe June bracelet by Netatmo isn\u2019t available yet, but seems promising. It\u2019s a $100 jewelry-looking wristband that measures your exposure to the sun throughout the day and is linked to your smartphone, which sends you real-time advice on sun protection.\n\nFun-in-the-Sun Rules\n\nIf you decide to stick to good old sunscreen, remember some rules of thumb. The easiest way to choose sunscreen is to look at the sun protection factor, or SPF. The level of SPF protects against UVB, which gives you sunburns. To protect against the long-term effects of the sun from UVA, look for mineral ingredients.\n\nHere are some basic sun protection rules:\n\nDon\u2019t apply sunscreen on babies younger than six months. Keep them out of the sun, period.\n\nFor everyone else, rely primarily on clothing and stay in the shade, especially during the most intense hours of the day.\n\nLook for mineral-based protection that includes zinc oxide, titanium dioxide or 3 percent avobenzone.\n\nAvoid sunscreens that contain oxybenzone and vitamin A, which may increase skin cancer.\n\nReapply sunscreen every couple of hours, or more often if you\u2019re swimming or sweating.\n\nWear sunglasses and a hat.\n\nWhen in doubt about a safe product, refer to this list of sunscreens that passed the EWG test this year.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Summer is just around the corner and you may already be dreaming of lying on the beach or catching some rays in the park at lunchtime \u2013 but are you fully prepared to protect your skin and your health against the long-term damages of sun exposure?
