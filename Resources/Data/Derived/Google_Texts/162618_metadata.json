New coach Dave Paulsen expects celebrations to commemorate the occasion.\n\nThere was little celebrating during the past two seasons, which ended with at least 20 losses and helped end the tenure of coach Paul Hewitt.\n\nOn Wednesday, Paulsen was introduced as the 10th basketball coach in program history and referenced that successful team.\n\n\u201cThat group of people showed what can be created here, sustained here,\u201d Paulsen said at the press conference held on the basketball court. \u201cWe\u2019ve got everything we need to be atop the Atlantic 10 and compete nationally.\u201d\n\nPaulsen directed Bucknell to four Patriot League regular season titles and four postseason appearances during his seven seasons, including two NCAA tournament berths and the 2015 NIT.\n\nThe 50-year-old Paulsen previously coached Williams, his alma mater, to the 2003 Division III national championship. Though Paulsen said he passed on other coaching opportunities while at Bucknell, his mentality changed when representatives from the Atlantic 10 program called last week.\n\n\u201cI knew what Mason was, I know what Mason can become,\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cI said, \u2018Yeah, I would be kicking myself if I didn\u2019t have an initial conversation.\u2019\u201d\n\nGeorge Mason fired Hewitt last month after four seasons. The Patriots finished 66-67 in that span and 20-42 over the last two seasons. Hewitt replaced Jim Larranaga, who left for Miami five years after the Final Four ride.\n\nPaulsen isn\u2019t faced with the pressure of replacing the coach who put the Northern Virginia campus in the national spotlight. Yet don\u2019t expect him to shy away from school\u2019s past when hitting the recruiting trail.\n\n\u201dWe have a Final Four banner up here,\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of programs in the Atlantic 10 that cannot say the same thing. That much I know.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paulsen, who spent the previous seven seasons coaching at Bucknell, was introduced as the Patriots' 10th basketball coach at a press conference at the Patriot Center on Wednesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Paulsen, who spent the previous seven seasons coaching at Bucknell, was introduced as the Patriots\u2019 10th basketball coach at a press conference at the Patriot Center on Wednesday.", "title": "New George Mason coach Dave Paulsen: \u2018I know what Mason can become\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/1/new-george-mason-coach-dave-paulsen-i-know-what-ma/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/01/3fc54cbaa8496e0e720f6a706700fcdc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/01/3fc54cbaa8496e0e720f6a706700fcdc.jpg", "description": "Paulsen, who spent the previous seven seasons coaching at Bucknell, was introduced as the Patriots' 10th basketball coach at a press conference at the Patriot Center on Wednesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "New George Mason coach Dave Paulsen: \u2018I know what Mason can beco"}, "Author": "Benjamin Standig", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Dave Paulsen, George Mason, Paul Hewitt"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI knew what Mason was, I know what Mason can become,\u201d Paulsen said.\nNew coach Dave Paulsen expects celebrations to commemorate the occasion.\nOn Wednesday, Paulsen was introduced as the 10th basketball coach in program history and referenced that successful team.\nPaulsen isn\u2019t faced with the pressure of replacing the coach who put the Northern Virginia campus in the national spotlight.\nThere was little celebrating during the past two seasons, which ended with at least 20 losses and helped end the tenure of coach Paul Hewitt."}
