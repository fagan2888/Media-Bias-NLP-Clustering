We're talking to some of the larger school districts in Southern Colorado. We asked them if they have any plans to address their students because of the sexting scandal that's now under investigation in Cañon City.

District 60 in Pueblo told us, they are working to talk to their students in the coming week. District 49 in Falcon said they constantly have programs for students to hopefully prevent things like this.

We'll let you know what other school districts are doing when we talk with them Monday.

As we've been reporting, investigators say students swapped hundreds of nude and partially nude pictures of each other.

Investigators say a significant part of the student population is involved. Cañon City officials say this massive scandal has rocked their town.

Students were caught trading sexually explicit pictures on their phones.

"Were these students possessing these pictures on campus? The answer is definite yes," Superintendent George Welsh said.

At least 500 nude photos were taken or sent by students using a phone app called photo vault. Metro State security expert Steve Beaty said apps like these, are designed as a disguise to hide photos and messages.

"It might be funny or fun today but ten years from now is that really what you want to have out there?" Beaty said.

Beaty said parents need to know these apps are sophisticated. Some, have multiple password prompts. One password allows content to disappear, the other, brings everything back.

"You have to type in the exactly the right number to unlock and get behind and see the photos," Beaty said.

He also warns users of these types of apps, that in some cases, there's nothing stopping the developers from using*or sharing your photos.

The Cañon City scandal was discovered last Monday, a week ago, when an anonymous tip came in through Colorado’s "safe2tell" system.
