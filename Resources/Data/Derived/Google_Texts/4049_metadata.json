PETERSBURG \u2014 It was an unusual scene Saturday in Williams Park.\n\nThere were families with children all across its green lawns, sitting around the fountain and beneath shady trees, and laughing and jumping in an inflatable castle.\n\nOn the stage, opera singers and belly dancers performed before a mass of people. Many of them drank beer \u2014 that wasn\u2019t in a paper bag.\n\n\u201cThis is interesting, a different perspective of Williams Park,\u201d said St. Petersburg resident Wendy Bees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never actually been inside the park because I\u2019ve been too afraid to come through here.\u201d\n\nShe hopes what happened Saturday will become the norm for this park, known to many as a haunt of drug dealers and a preferred hangout for the city\u2019s homeless people.\n\nBees and her boyfriend, James Clements, sipped amber-colored India pale ale beers brewed by nearby Green Bench Brewing Co., standing behind a table of neatly-arranged bonsai trees for sale.\n\nThe couple was among 100 vendors, all local artisans and entrepreneurs, spread out through the park located in the heart of downtown St. Petersburg, just three blocks from the waterfront between First and Second avenues north.\n\nThe space looked every bit as crowded as in the vintage postcard that circulated around town to advertise the event: Williams Park in its heyday, a band filling out the stage beneath the arched shell with an audience seated shoulder to shoulder covering the lawn.\n\nThat\u2019s what Keep Saint Petersburg Local head Olga Bof envisioned for Localtopia, a festival celebrating two years for the city\u2019s growing independent business alliance.\n\nThe festivities also were meant to create a different image for the historic park than what often is captured in headlines.\n\nAbout one year ago, police arrested people in a drug sweep here. A couple of months later, the City Council passed an ordinance banning the sale of a synthetic marijuana commonly called spice, which had been rampant in the park.\n\nThe character of the park shifts when there is a planned event here. On Saturdays in the summertime, it is populated by food vendors and grocers from the popular downtown market that moves under the trees here to escape the heat of its winter location in Al Lang Stadium\u2019s parking lot.\n\nMarty and Mary Lisan say the park could sustain that more inviting, friendly atmosphere, \u201cIf they run more events like this (Localtopia).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good first start,\u201d said Marty Lisan, who lives in the city.\n\nMost of the time, police keep watch at the park, especially around the transit stops where drug deals are common. The park is the busiest bus stop for the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority with 17 routes.\n\nA stickier issue for the city is the large homeless population that congregates here every day, many of whom aren\u2019t causing problems, but add to some peoples\u2019 negative perception of the park.\n\nOn Saturday, a temporary metal gate surrounded the space on all four sides, with only two entry and exit points.\n\nCity Council member Steve Kornell, who was at Localtopia, emphasized everyone is welcome in this public park \u2014 except those breaking the law, of course.\n\n\u201cHomeless people are welcome in our city,\u201d Kornell said.\n\n\u201cBut not anybody who is doing drugs or selling drugs.\u201d\n\nIn the long-run, it might be the success of all the local merchants and the scores of people who came out to support them that transforms this park.\n\nLisa Trunzo remembers when both downtown and Williams Park were empty \u2014 a \u201cghost town.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis really is making my day,\u201d said Trunzo, who runs the non-profit Hannah\u2019s Homeless.\n\nShe admits it\u2019s a tricky balance for the park; most of the people she serves were nowhere to be seen among the young families toting babies.\n\nThough it\u2019s unlikely the scene on Saturday will be repeated immediately, the park, named for one of the city\u2019s founders, again might become what its original planners intended, said Peter Belmont, head of St. Petersburg Preservation.\n\n\u201cThis park has seen its ups and downs and it\u2019s a great city square,\u201d said Belmont.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure some day it will become somewhere that people will again enjoy on a regular basis,\u201d he said, \u201cand view as in some ways the heart of the city.\u201d\n\njboatwright@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-1277", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 01 Feb 2014 18:32:57 -0400", "Description": "ST.
