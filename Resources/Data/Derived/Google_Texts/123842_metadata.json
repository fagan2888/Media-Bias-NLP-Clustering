It would be $2,100, not $3,000. This version has been corrected.\n\nVirginia Senate candidate Ed Gillespie unveiled a health-care reform proposal Friday, offering an alternative to a law he would like to see repealed.\n\nGillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who is challenging Sen. Mark R. Warner (D), has made opposition to the unpopular Affordable Care Act a cornerstone of his campaign. Democrats have repeatedly challenged Republicans who oppose the health-care law to explain what they would do after a repeal. Gillespie is one of a handful candidates who have done so.\n\n\u201cWe can do much better, and my alternative would,\u201d he told about 100 business executives at the Virginia Small Business Partnership Summit in Tysons Corner.\n\nHis plan would end the individual mandate to buy health insurance, the health-care exchanges and all of the law\u2019s industry regulations. In their place, he would offer tax credits that increase with age and family size.\n\nAdults younger than 35 would get $1,200 a year. Those 35 to 49 would get $2,100 a year. Those 50 and older would get $3,000 a year. For every dependent child, the credit would increase by $900.\n\nWhile many individual premiums have gone up under the Affordable Care Act, Gillespie argued that competition \u2014 including across state lines \u2014 would help lower premium costs in the individual market. Citing Government Accountability Office numbers, Gillespie said the credits would be sufficient to buy coverage in most cases. This GAO report refers only to base rates, noting that actual premiums could be higher. In addition, under Gillespie\u2019s proposal, family plans would no longer be required to cover young adults until age 26.\n\nFor those with pre\u00adexisting conditions, Gillespie proposed that policies could be purchased during specific windows. Parents of newborns would have six months to obtain coverage for them. When children turn 18 or leave their parents\u2019 insurance, they would have six months to get coverage. People who lose employer-based insurance would have two months. Once those policies were in place, they could not be revoked.\n\n\u201cNo one with continuous coverage could be dropped from their insurance or be repriced due to a pre\u00adexisting condition,\u201d he said.\n\nThat policy would perform some of the same functions as the individual mandate, Gillespie said: ensuring that people don\u2019t \u201cgame the system by going without insurance but then trying to buy it after a costly diagnosis.\u201d\n\nFor those with pre\u00adexisting conditions who can\u2019t afford insurance with a tax credit, Gillespie would set aside $75 billion over 10 years to set up state-run high-risk pools.\n\nInstead of the so-called Cadillac tax on very expensive \u00ademployer-offered plans, Gillespie would cap the tax exclusion for those at $20,000 per family plan and $8,000 per individual plan.\n\nMedicaid, expanded in some states under Obamacare, would go back to its previous eligibility levels. The 11 million people who the Congressional Budget Office estimates would sign up for Medicaid by 2015 would be eligible for tax credits instead.\n\nThe plan is modeled on one created by the conservative 2017 Project. That plan was scored by the Center for Health and Economy as saving taxpayers $1 trillion compared with the Affordable Care Act. The think tank was founded by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist.\n\nDemocrats argued that a plan such as Gillespie\u2019s would push too much cost on consumers while exposing them to the vagaries of a less-regulated marketplace.\n\n\u201cEd Gillespie\u2019s plan would take us back to the days when insurance companies could deny coverage for pre\u00adexisting conditions, charge women more than men for the same care and impose caps that cut off coverage just when you need it the most,\u201d said Warner spokesman David Turner. \u201cSenator Warner is working to keep what\u2019s good in the health-care law and fix what isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThis plan would be \u201cvery bad for the country, very bad for individuals, and would actually be very bad for the health-care industry as well,\u201d state Sen. George L. Barker (D-Fairfax) told reporters on a conference call.\u201cIt would add substantially to the deficit,\u201d he said, by spending on expensive high-risk pools. Such pools were opened as a temporary measure under the Affordable Care Act but wound down this year.\n\nWhile President Obama is in office, any discussion of repeal is academic because of his veto power. But should Republicans take control of the Senate, retain control of the House and win the White House in 2016, such a repeal could be possible.\n\nGillespie has been fleshing out his policy proposals as Election Day nears. On Thursday, he gave a foreign-policy speech at George Mason University, criticizing defense cuts. He and Warner debated Tuesday and will again Monday. Polls suggest Gillespie faces an uphill battle against Warner, a popular former governor, but the race has narrowed in the past few weeks.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ed gillespie, gillespie, ed gillespie health care, gillespie health care, ed gillespie health care plan, ed gillespie obamacare, va politics", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Senate hopeful in Virginia is one of the few Republicans to offer a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "An Obamacare alternative?
