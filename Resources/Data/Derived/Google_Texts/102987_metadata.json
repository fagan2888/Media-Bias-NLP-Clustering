The service is geared toward employers, augmenting SeeChange\u2019s data analytics that helps both employers and health plans better predict when patients might face risk for costly claims, or help steer the employee toward a more cost-effective provider.\n\nDoctor on Demand will become part of SeeChange\u2019s FlyWheel health improvement platform, a cloud-based, mobile service for consumers that combines various data sets together, including claims, lab, pharmacy, health and biometric data gleaned from wearable devices and self-reported patient data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom that wide range of data, SeeChange CEO Martin Watson said the goal is to detect and predict chronic conditions, engage more healthful actions by intervening with preventive care, medication adherence efforts and personalized incentives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built this software engine that just consumes tons of data,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe\u2019re mining that data to look at the clinical needs in the near term or the long term.\u201d\n\nThe company also sees potential in the emerging private health exchanges, where employers and health plans will be looking for evidence-based options for the variety of health plan options. Conceivably, large employers could use analytics platform alongside a health plan, or a health plan could demonstrate better results to the employer.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge change for the payer world,\u201d Watson said. \u201cNow you\u2019re in a world of \u2018How do I engage with consumers and how do I help them go to the right provider? I think it will be interesting to see the evolution of those exchanges.

In a survey of 1,000 U.S. employers, 37 percent said they expect to offer employees telemedicine consultations by next year as a low-cost alternative to emergency room or physician office visits for non-emergency health issues.\n\n\u201cTelemedicine has the potential to do much more than bring convenience and predictable prices for medical services,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt can help transform us into a wellness culture by delivering preventive screenings, remote monitoring and ongoing management for chronic care patients.\u201d\n\nSeeChange also recently announced a partnership with Family Health Hawaii, a health insurance provider with more than 8,000 members that will similarly use its data analytics for preventive and wellness efforts and engagement.\n\nTo that end, SeeChange published a white paper that showed hospital utilization decreased downward between 10 and 20 percent, including bed days and ER visits, over a one-year period. Over three years, hospital readmission rates were down by 50 percent.\n\nThe study evaluated a sample of approximately 120,000 members across three employers over a three-year period starting in 2010. The three employers covered an array of industries incuding finance, car rental, and health insurance with a population size ranging from 15,000 to 100,000 members\n\nBy the end of 2012, all three employers completed their third year of the incentive program.
