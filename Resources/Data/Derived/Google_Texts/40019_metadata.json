Perry and many other Republicans have continually claimed that Obamacare symbolizes what they see as the president's executive overreach.\n\n\"It\u2019s a continuation of actually what we saw, Hugh, going all the way back to Obamacare, and forcing something through,\" Perry said.\n\nAs soon as the nuclear agreement was announced on Tuesday, Republican presidential candidates issued statements of condemnation, accusing the U.S. of ceding too much to Iran and creating the potential for more tensions in the Middle East. Perry told Hewitt that he feared the deal would strengthen rather than weaken Iran's nuclear capability.\n\n\"They are celebrating today in the streets of Tehran because of this agreement,\" Perry said. \"They know that they just got a 'get out of jail free pass' from the president of the United States.\"\n\nIn Washington, congressional Republicans vowed to obstruct approval of the deal. On Wednesday, Obama implored them to read the details of the deal and put aside politics.\n\n\"I'm hearing a lot of talking points being repeated about this is a bad deal,\" Obama said to reporters. \"What I haven\u2019t heard is, what is your preferred alternative?\"\n\n\"My hope is that everyone in Congress also evaluates this agreement based on the facts -- not on politics, not on posturing, not on the fact that this is a deal I bring to Congress as opposed to a Republican president, not based on lobbying, but based on what\u2019s in the national interest of the United States of America.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 2016 GOP candidate slammed the Iranian nuclear deal.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-07-16 21:47:41 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The 2016 GOP candidate slammed the Iranian nuclear deal.", "title": "Rick Perry: Obama Is 'A Very, Very Naive Man'", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rick-perry-barack-obama_us_55a6df30e4b0896514d04c83", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55a6fd411200002c00135009.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 2016 GOP candidate slammed the Iranian nuclear deal.", "creator": "@marinafang", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55a6fd411200002c00135009.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Rick Perry: Obama Is 'A Very, Very Naive Man'", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-15 21:47:41 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_55a6df30e4b0896514d04c83", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Rick Perry,rick perry 2016,Barack Obama    ,iran deal,Iran nuclear deal", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Rick Perry,rick perry 2016,Barack Obama    ,iran deal,Iran nuclear deal", "published_time": "2015-07-15 21:47:41 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-07-15 21:47:41 -0400", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marina.fang"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdafb1\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry on Wednesday called President Barack Obama \"very, very naive\" for supporting the historic nuclear deal with Iran.\n\"I'm hearing a lot of talking points being repeated about this is a bad deal,\" Obama said to reporters.\n\"They are celebrating today in the streets of Tehran because of this agreement,\" Perry said.\nOn Wednesday, Obama implored them to read the details of the deal and put aside politics.\nPerry compared Obama's defiance of an adversarial Congress with the president's earlier efforts to pass his signature health care law."}
