Setting the record straight on Amendment 69

In response to Rep. Jim Wilson's commentary on March 8 about ColoradoCare — Amendment 69 — it is obvious that he is misinformed about the amendment. He makes statements that aren't strictly accurate:

1."Amendment 69 is Single Payer Health Insurance" - Not exactly.

• ColoradoCare would replace private insurance, but Medicare, VA, and other federal government payment plans would stay in place. However, for most Coloradans the current bewildering and expensive array of private insurance plans would be replaced with one simple plan covering every Colorado resident.

2."ColoradoCare would carry a price tag of approximately 1 ½ times the total budget of the state of Colorado" — False.

• ColoradoCare would cost $25 billion a year — coincidentally, that is approximately the same as the state budget. But that money has nothing to do with the state budget. The money would go directly to ColoradoCare. And, $25 billion is $4.5 billion less than Coloradans currently spend on private, for-profit, health insurance..

Here are some facts about ColoradoCare:

• It is simple and it covers everyone — if you are a Colorado resident, you are covered.

• You will have high quality coverage like the Platinum Plus plan now available from private insurance companies.

• You can choose any doctor — there are no narrow networks.

• There are no co-pays for primary and preventative care and no deductibles.

• It saves Coloradans money — about $4.5 billion a year over our current private insurance system.

• Medicare coverage for seniors (including those in PERA) will not change — but ColoradoCare will pay for the supplemental insurance that seniors now pay for.

• ColoradoCare will replace the private insurance plans that working PERA members now purchase.

Find out more about ColoradoCare at coloradocare.org or attend an informational meeting at 3:30 p.m. March 18 at the Cañon City library. Former State Sen. Jeanne Nicholson will talk about ColoradoCare and answer any questions you have.

Jim Wilson: please attend. We look forward to seeing you there.
