Repass & Partners conducted the poll for the Charleston Daily Mail.\n\nIn that poll, 49 percent of those questioned said they would support Capito, a Republican, 38 percent said they would support Tennant, a Democrat, and 13 percent said they were undecided with the Nov. 4 general election scheduled for more than five months from now.\n\n\u201cIf you look at likely voters, particularly by age demographics, and those are the ones that are most likely to vote \u2014 persons who are 45-plus in age \u2014 then there is a 51 percent to 59 percent support for Shelley Capito,\u201d said Rex Repass on Tuesday\u2019s MetroNews \u201cTalkline.\u201d\n\n\u201cShelley Moore Capito is working tirelessly to get her message out to West Virginians,\u201d said Amy Graham, a spokesperson for the Capito campaign, when asked about the poll on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious her proven record of standing up for West Virginia values, and her tough stance on Obamacare, jobs and the War on Coal is resonating with voters despite months of baseless and negative attacks on her record.\u201d\n\nThose with the Tennant campaign, though, pointed to the number of total votes Tennant received in the May primary election \u2014 30,000 more votes compared with Capito\u2019s vote total. In 36 of West Virginia\u2019s 55 counties, Tennant\u2019s votes exceeded Capito\u2019s votes.\n\n\u201cThe primary turnout proves Natalie has the votes to win,\u201d said Jennifer Donohue, spokesperson for the Tennant campaign, in a statement sent to MetroNews. \u201cThose same voters will turn out to vote for Natalie\u2019s \u2018West Virginia First\u2019 message in November because they are tired of Congresswoman Capito doing Wall Street\u2019s dirty work at their expense.\u201d\n\nAbout half of West Virginia\u2019s 1.2 million voters are Democrats.\n\nBut Repass said the advantage Democrats have in registrations is not a deciding factor anymore. \u201cWhile that\u2019s important and Natalie Tennant has certainly had strong support in statewide elections in the past, it\u2019s not as important as it used to be and independent voters are becoming even more important,\u201d said Repass.\n\nAmong independent voters, those who make up the largest block of undecideds, Repass said Capito holds a 14 point lead in the poll.\n\nThe poll of 400 registered West Virginia voters from R.L. Repass & Partners had a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was conducted for the Charleston Daily Mail.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "It was conducted for the Charleston Daily Mail.", "title": "Double-digit lead for Capito over Tennant in the West Virginia Poll", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2014/05/27/double-digit-lead-for-capito-over-tennant-in-the-west-virginia-poll/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Decision2014_capitotennant.png", "height": 350}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Decision2014_capitotennant.png?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-27T16:33:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T16:48:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde7fb\"", "article_summary": "The poll of 400 registered West Virginia voters from R.L.\nBy Shauna Johnson in News | May 27, 2014 at 12:33PMCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 Eleven percentage points separate Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito and Secretary of State Natalie Tennant in the West Virginia Poll \u2014 the latest poll on the U.S. Senate race.\nAmong independent voters, those who make up the largest block of undecideds, Repass said Capito holds a 14 point lead in the poll.\n\u201cThe primary turnout proves Natalie has the votes to win,\u201d said Jennifer Donohue, spokesperson for the Tennant campaign, in a statement sent to MetroNews.\n\u201cThose same voters will turn out to vote for Natalie\u2019s \u2018West Virginia First\u2019 message in November because they are tired of Congresswoman Capito doing Wall Street\u2019s dirty work at their expense.\u201dAbout half of West Virginia\u2019s 1.2 million voters are Democrats."}
