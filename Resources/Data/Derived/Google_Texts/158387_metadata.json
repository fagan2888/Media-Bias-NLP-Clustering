Who in fact are we really supporting with this new policy?\u201d said Ana Quintana, an analyst specializing in Latin America policy at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nKerry said he would meet with dissidents during a reception at the chief of mission\u2019s residence following the embassy ceremony, after it was demanded he explain how normalized relations will improve human rights standards.\n\n\u201cI look forward to meeting whoever I meet and listening to them and having, you know, whatever views come at me,\u201d Kerry said.\n\nJohn Suarez, the international secretary at the Cuban Democratic Directorate, said under President Barack Obama\u2019s diplomatic policies with Cuba, human rights have \u201cdeteriorated.\u201d\n\nSince Obama announced the U.S.\u2019s plan to normalize relations with Havana in December, Suarez said violence against activists has escalated, nearly 4,000 politically motivated arrests have occurred as a result of dissident demonstrations, and \u201cCubans continue to be killed for trying to leave the island.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe current U.S. policy on Cuba will strengthen and legitimize the dictatorship and is undercutting Cuban democracies,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is the son of Cuban exiles, called the State Department\u2019s decision to exclude dissidents in the ceremony a \u201cslap in the face\u201d and said it marked the event as \u201clittle more than a propaganda rally for the Castro regime.\u201d\n\nKerry highlighted opponents\u2019 concerns during the ceremony, calling for a \u201cgenuine democracy\u201d in Cuba that includes free elections, freedom of religion and speech, and human rights improvements.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona joined Kerry\u2019s delegation in Havana, splitting from the majority in his party to laud the embassy opening.\n\n\u201cThe United States will be able to do much more to protect and serve U.S. citizens in Cuba and encourage a better future for the Cuban people with an American flag flying over our embassy in Havana,\u201d he said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The American flag was raised over the U.S. embassy in Havana, but Cuban dissidents who have influenced U.S.-Cuban relations were barred from the event.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The American flag was raised over the U.S. embassy in Havana, but Cuban dissidents who have influenced U.S.-Cuban relations were barred from the event.", "title": "Cuban Dissidents Barred From US Embassy Opening", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150814_CubaEmbassy_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PdkKMt"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The American flag was raised over the U.S. embassy in Havana, but Cuban dissidents who have influenced U.S.-Cuban relations were barred from the event.", "title": "Cuban Dissidents Barred From US Embassy Opening", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150814_CubaEmbassy_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "latin america", "published_time": "2015-08-14T15:43:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Cuba, Havana, Cuban embassy, John Kerry, Engage Cuba, Marco Rubio, Jeff Flake"}, "article_summary": "The American flag was raised next to the U.S. embassy in Havana for the first time in 54 years Friday, but Cuban dissidents who have influenced U.S.-Cuban relations for decades were barred from the event.\n\u201cIt truly shows the administration\u2019s priorities when there\u2019s space at the flag-raising ceremony for business interests and anti-embargo lobbyists, yet there\u2019s no space for Cuban dissidents.\nRepublican Sen.
