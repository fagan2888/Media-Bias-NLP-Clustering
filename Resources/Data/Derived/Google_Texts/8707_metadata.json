In the fall, regulators shut down the state\u2019s nonprofit insurance co-op, leaving some 80,000 residents to find other coverage. Many of those people were left to shop for new plans on the state\u2019s insurance exchange, which has been slated for an expanded audit after an initial review a year ago found serious concerns. Most significant of all, state residents will vote in the fall on a plan to create a new single-payer universal healthcare system, funded by about $25 billion in taxes. The debate over the referendum is likely to be one of the major political stories in the state all year.\n\nBut one of the state\u2019s best sources for health news won\u2019t be around to cover it. In October, Health News Colorado, one of the many nonprofit news services that sprouted around the country over the last decade, closed its doors. The site\u2019s leading supporter, the Colorado Health Foundation, had changed its grant-making priorities, and editor Diane Carman was unable to raise enough money from other sources to keep the operation alive.\n\nThough other outlets will cover the big stories, the demise of Health News Colorado leaves the state\u2019s most dedicated readers without an important source of comprehensive, aggressive coverage of the insurance exchange and other health policy news. The site\u2019s experience, meanwhile, highlights both the promise and the pitfalls of foundation-backed nonprofit journalism.\n\nHealth News Colorado launched in 2010, and it was always dependent on support from the Colorado Health Foundation, which provided $500,000 over the years, or about half the site\u2019s budget. The goal in supporting the news outlets was to increase coverage of health policy news and \u201cbroaden the audience\u201d for it, Amy Latham, the foundation\u2019s vice president of philanthropy, told me. It\u2019s a pattern we saw in several places around the country, as the debate over the Affordable Care Act sparked a surge of interest just as newspapers were undergoing wrenching job losses.\n\nWith the money, Health News Colorado did deliver increased coverage\u2014including some gutsy work from reporter Katie McCrimmon about struggles at the state\u2019s health insurance exchange that angered state officials and often brought uncomfortable pushback. As I wrote last year, the site\u2019s skeptical reporting stood out from the cheerleading that has marked too much Obamacare coverage around the country. And it was apparently finding an audience. Carman told the Colorado-based media writer Jason Salzman that the site\u2019s stories \u201cwere routinely getting 20,000 or 25,000 hits.\u201d\n\nIt was clear some time ago, though, that that coverage was on shaky footing. Shortly after making its second grant to Health News, the foundation gave Carman a heads-up that funding was not likely to be renewed again. The decision was part of a \u201cstrategy refresh\u201d that included a shift away from supporting nonprofit news. Another startup, the I-News Network, also lost its funding from the foundation, but a merger with Rocky Mountain PBS in 2013 avoided a difficult situation, said Laura Frank, the outlet\u2019s president and general manager for news. And a foundation grant to support health coverage at Colorado Public Radio is scheduled to end next year, Latham said. (Support for Health News and a handful of other journalism projects never amounted to more than a fraction of the foundation\u2019s giving, which has topped $97 million in a single year. The foundation\u2019s giving priorities are healthcare services, health coverage, and healthy living; it also provides support to the advocacy group Healthier Colorado.)\n\nAnother local foundation that was a smaller supporter of Health News also reduced and then ended its funding as part of a strategy shift, Carman said.\n\nThe foundation-backed public radio project operates in partnership with Kaiser Health News, and it produces some policy coverage, like this piece comparing the failure of Colorado\u2019s co-op with the apparent success of one in Connecticut. There\u2019s other health coverage in the state, too. Both The Denver Post and KUSA, a Denver TV station, have reported on concerns over the proliferation around the state of costly freestanding emergency rooms, for example, and both have followed developments at the exchange, from the latest enrollment numbers to a typo that sent customers to a phone sex line. The Post\u2019s investigations desk has turned out a number of health-related projects, including coverage of care for inmates and problems with a new VA hospital. When the failing co-op cut off payments to brokers, the Post covered the story, and Frank told me her outlet is working on a major package about infant mortality.\n\nStill, the tenacious, detail-oriented coverage of the day-to-day operations of the state\u2019s health agencies that Health News Colorado provided will be missed.\n\n\u201cNobody does it now as regularly, reliably, or as comprehensively,\u201d said T.R. Reid, a former Washington Post reporter who is now spearheading the campaign to enact universal health coverage in the state. \u201cIt\u2019s a loss. Is anybody going to fill that gap?\u201d\n\nThe site\u2019s trajectory highlights some of the challenges faced by nonprofit sites more broadly, especially those with a niche focus. As both for-profit and nonprofit outlets struggle to identify new revenue sources, foundations can provide essential support. But in many places, the list of local foundations that might support journalism is not especially deep. When one or two change directions, it can be hard to recover.\n\nLatham, of the Colorado Health Foundation, said that when the foundation supports a project, it always asks about sustainability. \u201cWe can\u2019t make promises of funding in perpetuity,\u201d she said.\n\nHealth News had tried to develop a broader funding base, Carman told me. Her initial vision included a job-listing service and public media-style sponsorships. But regulations at Colorado University\u2019s Denver School of Public Affairs, where they were based, prevented those approaches, she said. \u201cOne after another the options disappeared, and we were left with foundation funding solely.\u201d\n\nCarman also had talks with Kaiser officials about bringing the Colorado site under their umbrella. There was mutual interest, but she needed to secure two years of funding from local sources. Even without the Health Foundation money, she had some commitments\u2014but ultimately, not enough.\n\nCarman is now doing media relations consulting. When I spoke with McCrimmon, the reporter, late last year, she was doing PR on a short-term contract for the non-profit Nurse-Family Partnership. Health News Colorado had folded just about the same time as the state\u2019s insurance co-op, she noted. \u201cIt really killed me not to do the story.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, when Health News launched, \u201cit was a fertile period for nonprofit journalism and there was lots of experimentation and a great deal of optimism that we could make this work,\u201d Carman said. For five years, they did. And even if it wasn\u2019t sustainable in the end, Carman believes they had an impact.\n\n\u201cI think we really did succeed in our mission to increase public awareness and discussion,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe did it by creating a competitive environment where other media felt compelled to cover health policy more intensively.\u201d\n\nLove news about local news?
