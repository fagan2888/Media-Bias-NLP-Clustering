He is best known as the author of \u201cThe Skeptical Environmentalist\u201d and his skepticism is welcome, but insufficient.\n\nFirst of all, climate change is a very long-term process and always has been. The climate takes decades and centuries to change, largely based on well-known warming and cooling cycles. During the course of these cycles, both related to comparable cycles on the Sun, all manner of climate-related events occur, from hurricanes to blizzards. Nothing new here.\n\nThe problem with Lomborg\u2019s commentary is that he confuses climate change with global warming, the hoax concocted in the late 1980s by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in order to have an international tax imposed on \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions\u201d, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), that the IPCC guaranteed was going to heat up the Earth in a few decades unless greatly reduced. Lomborg even cites the IPCC which has grown notorious for its lies.\n\nThe predictions about when the heat would become lethal ranged from ten to fifty years as the amount of CO2 increased. The problem for Lomborg and others is that CO2 has been increasing in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere without any evidence of the predicted heating. That explains why Lomborg and other \u201cWarmists\u201d don\u2019t refer to global warming anymore. As for the increase, the latest, best science points to the fact that CO2 has no affect whatever on the climate.\n\nLomborg wrote, \u201cA well-meaning environmentalist might argue that, because climate change is a reality, why not ramp up the rhetoric and focus on the bad news to make sure the public understands its importance.\u201d Even Lomborg acknowledged that is exactly what the environmentalists have been doing for the past twenty years.\n\n\u201cThe public has been bombarded with dramatic headlines and apocalyptic photos of climate change and its consequences. Yet despite endless successions of climate summits, carbon emissions continue to rise, especially in rapidly developing countries like India, China, and many African nations.\u201d That\u2019s called development and that requires electricity and other means of powering manufacturing and transportation.\n\nOne thing Lomborg got right is that \u201cAlarmism has encouraged the pursuit of a one-sided climate policy of trying to cut carbon emissions by subsidizing wind farms and solar panels.\u201d These are two of the most costly and worthless forms of energy generation and Lomborg notes that even the International Energy Agency doesn\u2019t expect them to provide any more than \u201ca minuscule 2.2% of the world\u2019s energy by 2040.\u201d\n\nLomborg continues to do his best to be on both sides of the issue of \u201cclimate change\u201d when, in fact, it is not an issue because there is nothing humans anywhere on planet Earth can do to have any impact on it. What we can do, however, is encourage the development which he points to. \u201cThis is important because if we want to help the poor people who are most threatened by natural disasters, we have to recognize that it is less about cutting carbon emissions than it is about pulling them out of poverty.\u201d\n\nIt has nothing about cutting carbon emissions because that is not a threat. Indeed, without CO2 all life on Earth would cease to be. It is the gas on which all vegetation depends, just as mammals and other creatures depend on oxygen.\n\n\u201cIn short, climate change is not worse than we thought. Some indicators are worse, but some are better. That doesn\u2019t mean global warming is not a reality or a problem. It definitely is,\u201d says Lomborg.\n\nNo, despite his science credentials and the two books he has written, Lomborg is just dead wrong. Global warming is neither a reality nor a problem because the Earth has been in A COOLING CYCLE for nineteen years at this point and one might think Lomborg would know this; particularly since his views are being published in an eminent U.S. newspaper that should also know this.\n\nH. Sterling Burnett, the Managing Editor of Environment & Climate News, took note of the current weather, saying \u201cDespite the cold, temperatures in the U.S. at present are closer to the normal winter range than they were in 2014 during the depth of the polar vortex,\u201d adding a tweak to the Warmists, saying \u201cSeems like a good time to protest global warming.\u201d\n\nThe real issue for Americans is an Obama administration that is imposing regulations based on the utterly false assertion that greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced because of global warming.\n\nIn June 2014, James Delinpole, wrote: \u201cHere is the Obama administration\u2019s green strategy reduced to one damning equation: 19 million jobs lost plus $4.335 trillion spent = a reduction in global mean temperature of 0.018 degrees C (0.032 degrees F). These are the costs to the U.S. economy by 2100 of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s regulatory war on carbon dioxide, whereby all states must reduce emissions from coal-fired generating plants by 30% below 2005 levels.\u201d\n\nIf you still wonder why the U.S. economy has just barely begun to pull itself out of the Great Recession triggered by the 2008 financial crisis, the answer is the Obama administration\u2019s spectacular failures typified by massive wasteful spending, ObamaCare\u2019s impact on the healthcare sector, and its continuing attack on the energy sector.\n\nOnly Congress and the courts stand between us and Obama as he pursues the destruction of the nation while claiming he is acting to \u201ccombat climate change.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/02/lukewarm-about-climate-change/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Cartoon-Climate-Change-Warmer-Winters.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Lukewarm About Climate Change"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb02f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe public has been bombarded with dramatic headlines and apocalyptic photos of climate change and its consequences.\nFirst of all, climate change is a very long-term process and always has been.\n\u201cIn short, climate change is not worse than we thought,\u201d wrote Bjorn Lomborg in a recent issue of The Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cIn short, climate change is not worse than we thought.\nOnly Congress and the courts stand between us and Obama as he pursues the destruction of the nation while claiming he is acting to \u201ccombat climate change.\u201d"}
