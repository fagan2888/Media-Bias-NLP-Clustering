The term is a euphemism for replacing private insurers with a powerful government that prescribes the medicine and pays the bills. It\u2019s how Britain and Canada do it, and soon, the idea could spread to Vermont, where the state Senate Finance Committee plans to vote Friday to advance \u201cGreen Mountain Care\u201d to march the state yet closer to the single-payer dream.\n\nThree years ago, the Vermont legislature adopted a suite of minimum health benefits for residents as a first step. This was a bold scheme trumpeted by Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat who campaigned on a platform of importing Canadian-style health care. \u201cWhat we want to do here in Vermont,\u201d he said, \u201cis to ensure that health care is a right, not a privilege.\u201d No one goes to Canada or Britain for advanced health care, which ought to tell Vermonters something.\n\nThe message is nevertheless powerful in Vermont, one of only a handful of states where President Obama\u2019s approval rating is above water and where the state\u2019s junior U.S. senator, Bernie Sanders, is an out-of-the-closet Socialist. Vermont, which is more boutique than state, wants to be first with a single-payer system, though Avalere Health estimates that it will cost the state upward of $2.2 billion.\n\nGiving away free stuff is great politics, as long as the recipients of the free stuff don\u2019t understand they\u2019ll be paying for it with higher taxes. Gov. Shumlin\u2019s momentum for re-election has been blunted by his having to explain how he\u2019ll pay for this generosity. State Rep. Jim Cordon, a Democrat, wants answers. \u201cThe deadlines for proposing financing have been missed two years in a row now,\u201d he told Vermont Watchdog, \u201cso to me that\u2019s very disappointing. It\u2019s becoming clearer and clearer that there is no financing plan.\u201d\n\nFree is popular, taxes aren\u2019t. Paying for a $2.2 billion scheme will be difficult considering Vermont collects about $2.8 billion per year from its various income, sales and business taxes. There\u2019s no way to provide \u201cfree\u201d health care without doubling each of those sources of revenue. That will be a tough sell, even in a boutique where 67 percent of Vermonters voted to re-elect Mr. Obama.\n\nThe Obama administration gives no evidence that it cares that its health care numbers don\u2019t add up. Before implementation of Obamacare, four out of every five Americans were satisfied with their health insurance. The White House plunged ahead anyway, imposing a broken scheme that has caused millions of Americans to lose their plans. Those lucky enough to keep them face enormous premium increases.\n\nGovernment tinkering in the marketplace never turns out well, so with the election nearing Democrats recognize the need to \u201cfix\u201d Obamacare. There will be frantic calls for more government intervention to fix the problems created by government intervention. The left\u2019s proposed \u201csolutions\u201d will look a lot like what\u2019s being proposed in Vermont.\n\nPresident Obama thinks he can make boutiques of the rest of the states, and there\u2019s to be \u201ca transition period\u201d before single-payer kicks in. Asked whether Obamacare is that transitional step, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid answered emphatically: \u201cYes, yes. Absolutely yes.\u201d\n\nVermont demonstrates there\u2019s no such thing as free health care. Someone ultimately has to pay, so there\u2019s a search for a way to double every tax with no one noticing. Liberals thought Vermonters would be perfect guinea pigs, to show that the government can run a health care system. Three years on, Vermont is proving once more, for all the slow learners, why the government should stay out of everyone\u2019s health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Single-payer health care is the left's holy grail.
