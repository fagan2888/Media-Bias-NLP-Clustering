The President chalked up what appeared to be the selective targeting of tea party groups by the IRS as simply being a case of low-level IRS functionaries being confused and misguided about how to implement new rules.\n\nAfter April 15th, if the IRS should call you about errors or other red flags your return raised, try giving them the same answer Obama gave. Try telling the agents that any errors or omissions were the result of innocent confusion over the instructions and forms. Try telling them that there was not even a smidgen of corruption or your part and see if you get invited to one of their party junkets - or get audited.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "editorial-cartoon, fallon, irs-targeting-scandal, leno, obama-smidgen, opinion", "title": "Obama's more than a smidgen of spin on IRS targeting: Editorial cartoon", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "If Obama does nothing more he will go down in history for... possibly being the first President to use the word \"smidgen.\"", "title": "Obama's more than a smidgen of spin on IRS targeting: Editorial cartoon", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/darcy/index.ssf/2014/02/obamas_smidgen_of_spin_on_irs.html", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/darcy/photo/14232874-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If Obama does nothing more he will go down in history for... possibly being the first President to use the word \"smidgen.\"", "creator": "@Darcycartoon", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/darcy/photo/14232874-standard.jpg", "title": "Obama's more than a smidgen of spin on IRS targeting: Editorial cartoon", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, February 07, 2014,  5:22 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, February 07, 2014,  5:32 AM", "article_author": "Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com", "Description": "If Obama does nothing more he will go down in history for... possibly being the first President to use the word \"smidgen.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37b9\"", "article_summary": "Recently Obama declared that there was not even a \"smidgen\" of corruption involved in the IRS targeting scandal.\nTry telling the agents that any errors or omissions were the result of innocent confusion over the instructions and forms.\nTry telling them that there was not even a smidgen of corruption or your part and see if you get invited to one of their party junkets - or get audited.\nAfter April 15th, if the IRS should call you about errors or other red flags your return raised, try giving them the same answer Obama gave.\nThe President chalked up what appeared to be the selective targeting of tea party groups by the IRS as simply being a case of low-level IRS functionaries being confused and misguided about how to implement new rules."}
