Shigella is currently circulating domestically. And these two are neither the first nor last superbugs we\u2019ll hear of.\n\nA Bug\u2019s Life\n\nDr. Steven Gordon, chairman of the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s infectious disease department, told Medical Daily superbugs are clinically known as multidrug-resistant organisms; it\u2019s a term that signifies there are a limited number of treatment options. Resistance can actually be encoded in some bacteria and viruses, Gordon said, making it easier for the bacteria to multiply in the face of antibiotics. But other resistance stems results from a bacteria\u2019s genetic mutation or acquired resistance from another bacteria species.\n\nTuft University\u2019s Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics (APUA) cited mutations \u201coccur in about one in one million to one in ten million cells,\u201d with \u201cdifferent genetic mutations yield different types of resistance.\u201d And the process of bacteria species acquiring resistance from another species is known as conjugation. APUA added bacteria have the ability to acquire \u201cfree\u201d DNA from the environment, too.\n\nAntibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria may seem like a fairly new phenomenon, but Gordon said shortly after Alexander Fleming introduced penicillin in the late 20s, there were rumors of resistant organisms within a couple of years. Now, some believe antibiotics are overprescribed, and too much of a certain antibiotic is how resistance spreads.\n\nA study published in the journal Infection and Immunity recently reported antibiotic resistance is further complicated when exposed to cigarette smoke, specifically methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In addition to harming the human respiratory and immune cells, it literally stresses out resistance bacteria and makes it more aggressive.\n\nThat said, resistance can also be reversed albeit more slowly. Tufts cited \u201cantibiotics cause a selective pressure by killing susceptible bacteria, allowing antibiotic-resistant bacteria to survive and multiply,\u201d and if this pressure is removed, the bacterial population can potentially revert to one that\u2019s responsive to antibiotics.\n\nSuper Side Effects\n\nFor Scrubs Magazine, critical care nurse Kati Kleber wrote resistant strains forces nurses and otherwise health care practitioners \u201cto use much more toxic and potent antibiotics, which \u201cmeans we have to use heavy-hitter antibiotics for infections that at one time were easily treated.\u201d Not only do these strains require more toxic (possibly more expensive) antibiotics, but they potentially increase mortality rates, the overall cost and stay of hospital admission. Plus, nurses working with multiple patients have to be extra careful they don\u2019t spread the resistant strains patient to patient.\n\n\u201cThis means more patients are placed on isolation precautions, meaning direct care workers must wear appropriate protective equipment. This includes isolation gowns, gloves, masks (for droplet and airborne precautions) and disposable equipment (e.g., stethoscopes),\u201d Kleber wrote. \u201cNot only is this costly, but it\u2019s tedious for the staff.\u201d\n\nGordon said this presents an opportunity for all health care practitioners, which is to start using antibiotics judicially. He said most people expect antibiotics for, say, a cold, when most colds aren\u2019t bacterial; they\u2019re viral. Of course, once superbugs find their way to a community, practitioners and clinicians are going to want to do what\u2019s best for their patient. But there are different classes of antibiotics, and the one that\u2019s most prescribed may not always be the best option.\n\nPrevention Is Key\n\nPresenting problematic symptoms to your primary care physician is an important step for people who suspect they have a superbug. But, Gordon said, even more important than that is an emphasis on education and prevention.\n\nGordon\u2019s preventative tips mostly involve lifestyle changes, including no smoking, exercising, eating in moderation; keeping \u201cfingers, fork, and feet,\u201d clean and healthy. Additionally, paying attention to global health makes a difference. Shigella, for example, is a severe foodborne disease causing painful stomach cramps, diarrhea, and fever. It\u2019s associated with international travel, but there are cluster outbreaks happening in the US. Staying on top of international outbreaks and diseases can better inform healthy habits to maintain at home, such as hand hygiene.\n\n\u201cDiseases don\u2019t respect borders,\u201d Gordon said.\n\nThough global health concerns shouldn\u2019t only be focused on what\u2019s happening among humans.\n\n\u201cWe tend to only worry about what happens to humans, but we also need to worry about animal and plant life,\u201d he added. \u201cEighty percent of antimicrobials are being used for aqua culture in the food industry.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization deems some of these antimicrobials \u201ccritically important\u201d to human medicine; if humans are additionally exposed to them in their everyday food, this likely leads to resistance. Gordon referred to McDonald\u2019s newly announced vision for antimicrobial stewardship in food animals, in which they\u2019ll phase out chicken raised with antibiotics within two years.\n\nTo Gordon, these preventative measures are the cure. He, and presumably other practitioners and clinicians, would rather prevent disease than treat it. Empowering people to share in their health could reduce the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria and viruses, as well as lead to new, cost-effective treatments, especially now that healthcare is relatively expensive.\n\nGordon wants to see patients and doctors working together, as partners, when it comes to patient health.
