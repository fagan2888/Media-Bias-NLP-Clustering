A Thornton man was killed and two others seriously injured in a head-on crash north of Boulder early Sunday, the State Patrol said.

About 2:30 a.m. near the intersection of U.S. 36 and Neva Road, a 2006 Toyota drifted into oncoming traffic and hit a 2013 Hyundai, according to the State Patrol.

The passenger in the Hyundai, Lester Williams, 38, was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver, Kurt Rose, 35, of Longmont, was taken to a hospital with serious injuries, the patrol said.

The driver of the Toyota, Jeremy Schepps, 44, of Boulder, also was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.

U.S. 36 was closed for about five hours while troopers investigated.

Alcohol and drugs are suspected, said Sgt. Rob Madden. Officials are determining if charges will be filed.
