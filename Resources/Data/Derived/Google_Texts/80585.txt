The Piedmont community is mourning after the tragic death of 16-year-old Justin Oliver. The Woodmont High School sophomore was killed in a car accident on Friday.

The driver survived, and was airlifted to Greenville Memorial Hospital. The S.C. Highway Patrol has said the crash occurred around 4:50 p.m. Friday at Piedmont Golf Course Road and Old Pelzer Road.

Oliver spent two years playing basketball for the SC Raptors Elite and the president Lamont Simmons said Oliver had a promising future.

"He was the type of kid that a lot of kids can learn from these days, he was determined, he was willing to take constructive criticism and he was willing to do whatever it took in a positive way to get to where he wanted to be," said Simmons.

Woodmont High School posted to their Facebook page saying, "please pray for the students at Woodmont High School."

Simmons said Oliver's family may hold a vigil in the future. He said the team will support whatever the family decides to do.
