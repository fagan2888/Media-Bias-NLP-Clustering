Lee, along with fellow Tea Party movement star Senator Ted Cruz, was instrumental in the ill-fated attempt to defund Obamacare, the popular name for the healthcare reform law championed by President Barack Obama.\n\nPalin told the Christian conservatives in attendance it was time to \"stiffen our spines\" for the 2014 elections.\n\n\"I want to encourage you to make your voice heard, to hold politicians accountable,\" Palin said.\n\nThe bulk of Palin's speech was focused on the nation's current political climate. She drew thunderous applause with her sharp attack on Republicans in Congress who voted in October to raise the nation's debt ceiling and reopen the government.\n\n\"They promised that they would do everything in their power to fight against socialized medicine, against Obamacare, but when it came time to stand and defund it, they waved the white flag of surrender and they threw under the bus the good guys who did stand up and fight for us,\" Palin said.\n\nPalin named Lee and Cruz as leaders in that fight. Last month, Cruz also made a stop in Iowa, a key state in presidential campaigns because the Iowa caucuses are the first electoral event in the nominating process.\n\nIn 2010 Lee defeated three-term Republican Senator Bob Bennett in a primary on his way to winning the Senate seat.\n\nIn his speech on Saturday, he called on Republicans to offer up \"market-based alternatives\" that could replace Obamacare if the Republicans hope to have success at the polls in 2014.\n\n\"Frustration is not a platform. Anger is not an agenda and outrage, as a habit, is not even conservative,\" Lee said.\n\n(Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kay Henderson", "Author": "Kay Henderson", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, who rallied members of the Tea Party in their failed effort to defund Obamacare, lashed out on Saturday against members of the Republican Party who agreed to end the government shutdown.", "title": "Sarah Palin tells Iowa conservatives it's time 'to stiffen our backs'", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20131110&t=2&i=810538583&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBRE9A90G8S00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
