(In case you missed the videos, Cortney has you covered here). The legislation is co-sponsored by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul and five other Republicans.\n\n\"A bill to prohibit Federal funding of Planned Parenthood Federation of America,\" the legislation states. \"IN GENERAL.\u2014Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal funds may be made available to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, or to any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, or clinics.\"\n\n\n\nThe legislation is set for a vote early next week ahead of the August recess.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) fast-tracked the legislation Tuesday night using Rule 14 of Senate procedure, setting up a procedural cloture vote to move the bill to the floor as early as Monday. That all but assures the bill will get a final vote before Senators depart for August recess.\n\nMeanwhile, Planned Parenthood and other abortion supporters are scrambling to defend themselves after the undercover sting. The pro-abortion political outfit EMILY's List sent a frantic fundraising email early this morning warning about the legislation.\n\nPlanned Parenthood receives more than $500 million per year in taxpayer funding. The organization receives enough money from donations every year to survive without it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Action.  .05/26/2016 3:41:42AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Action.", "title": "- Senate To Vote on Defunding Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/07/29/senate-to-vote-on-defunding-planned-parenthood-n2031855", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/206/a30ad42f-d68f-40e6-b418-60fdfb47266c.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Action.", "title": "- Senate To Vote on Defunding Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/07/29/senate-to-vote-on-defunding-planned-parenthood-n2031855", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/206/a30ad42f-d68f-40e6-b418-60fdfb47266c.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Senate To Vote on Defunding Planned Parenthood, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb537\"", "article_summary": "Planned Parenthood receives more than $500 million per year in taxpayer funding.\nMeanwhile, Planned Parenthood and other abortion supporters are scrambling to defend themselves after the undercover sting.\n\"IN GENERAL.\u2014Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal funds may be made available to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, or to any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, or clinics.\"\n\"A bill to prohibit Federal funding of Planned Parenthood Federation of America,\" the legislation states.\nThe legislation is set for a vote early next week ahead of the August recess."}
