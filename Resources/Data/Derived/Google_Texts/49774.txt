The return of Saturday Night Live brought with it a “Cold Open” featuring CNN’s take on the presidential race, this time exclusively with Donald Trump.

The opening had Kate McKinnon as CNN’s At This Hour’s Kate Bouldon, who’s “got the brain for MSNBC, but the hair for Fox News, so here I am at CNN.”

Cecily Jones appeared as Scottie Nell Hughes, a female Trump supporter. She started off by mentioning how “as a woman I like Donald Trump, but as a full-blown nut job, I freaking love him.”

Hughes was willing to defend Trump on everything, with her responses getting more ridiculous as the segment went on. She assured Bouldon that “I’ll be able to” defend whatever it was, before she even heard Bouldon’s charge against Trump. She tried to assure Bouldon “you can’t break me, Kate, because I’m crazy, and crazy don’t break!”

Hughes claimed that Trump retweeting the unflattering photo of Heidi Cruz next to Melania Trump “was an accident, okay, because Donald’s hands are just so big, he can’t see everything his fingers retweet.”

On Trump’s initial answer that women who have had abortions should be “punished,” Hughes chalked it to up to an April Fool’s joke. He made those comments on March 30 as Bouldon pointed out, but with crazy laughter, Hughes tried to answer “that’s why it’s so funny.”

The segment also got into how Trump flatters his daughter, Ivanka, perhaps a bit too much. Darrell Hammond as Trump is shown at a rally complimenting his daughter, which includes “what a rack,” which is “just tremendous” since she just had a baby.

Hughes said such comments were “beautiful,” and that Bouldon “is just trying to work it, but is it worth it? You put his thing down, flipped it, and reversed it.” She also offered that Trump at least “is creating a dialogue about women.”

Bouldon and Hughes were at least able to agree Trump “is way better than Ted Cruz” at the segment’s close.
