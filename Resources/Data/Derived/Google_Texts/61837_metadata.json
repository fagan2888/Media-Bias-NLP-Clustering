A Detroit man erected a huge statue flipping the bird and placed in his ex-wife\u2019s line of sight, aiming it at her home next door.\n\nThe man, believed to be strip club mogul Alan Markovitz according to multiple reports, bought the home adjacent to his ex-wife in Oakland County, Mich. Upon moving in with his daughter Tiffany, Markovitz erected an expensive-looking bronze statue of a hand giving the middle finger on his back porch, Gawker reported.\n\nThe photo was first tweeted by a woman claiming to be the ex-wife\u2019s daughter, Lenka Tuohy.\n\n\u201cHow psychotic do you have to be to buy the house directly next to your ex wife and then put a statue up like that?!?! Real classy alan,\u201d Tuohy wrote on Twitter on Nov. 11.\n\nBut Markovitz didn\u2019t stop there. He made sure his ex-wife could always see the statue and installed a giant spotlight, making it visible at night, too.\n\nTuohy again took to Twitter, saying it was \u201chard for me to enjoy my baths now because my fav tub is in my moms bathroom which faces out towards tif and alans house:(\u201d\n\nAccording to Deadline Detroit, Tiffany is Markovitz\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage. He met his now ex-wife, who is from Slovakia, at a birthday party, but she was cheating on him with someone Markovitz knew.\n\n\u201cHe broke the Man Code. He\u2019s a total freakin\u2019 a**hole,\u201d Markovitz told Deadline Detroit. \u201cReal men don\u2019t do that to another guy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Talk about expert trolling.
