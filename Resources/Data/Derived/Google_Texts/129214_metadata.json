The Nuggets are 9-8 in their last 17 games, and there are many reasons why.\n\nOn Sunday, it had a lot to do with the man drafted to lead the revolution: point guard Emmanuel Mudiay.\n\nHe has been solid in many late-game situations already this season, but he wove his best late fourth quarter of the season on the NBA\u2019s biggest stage: Madison Square Garden.\n\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher Dempsey\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a good experience,\u201d Mudiay said. \u201cPlaying in New York is something that I always liked to do, even in AAU, Elite 24 \u2014 it\u2019s always fun playing here. It\u2019s the Mecca of basketball.\u201d\n\nFrom the 6:20 mark of the fourth to the end of the game, the rookie basically laid waste to the Knicks\u2019 defense, which to that point in the second half had been fairly solid.\n\nMudiay entered the game and immediately hit a jump shot.\n\nThen a step-back 3-pointer.\n\nTwo shots later, Mudiay pierced the defense for a reverse layup.\n\nTwo minutes later, Mudiay picked up the degree of difficulty on another reverse layup.\n\nMudiay scored nine of the Nuggets\u2019 11 points in roughly 3\u00bd minutes after he re-entered the game. The Nuggets, in that time, went from two points down to seven points up.\n\n\u201cI just feel like I had to take control of the game, being the point guard,\u201d Mudiay said. \u201cI knew the ball was going to be in my hand and I knew they were switching. I just had to play downhill basketball, be as aggressive as I can and try to make plays.\u201d\n\nThe Knicks tried to rally late, but Carmelo Anthony missed a 3-pointer that would have tied the game with 11.8 seconds to go. The Nuggets rebounded, and Will Barton was fouled with 7.8 seconds. He made both, and the Nuggets held on for a victory, snapping a two-game losing streak at the Garden.\n\nMudiay finished with 15 points, nine assists and not one turnover. He shot 2-of-12 going into the fourth quarter but made 4-of-6 shots in the final period to help the Nuggets seal the deal.\n\n\u201cI thought Emmanuel Mudiay was terrific, made some huge plays down the stretch,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cNine assists, zero turnovers for a 19-year old rookie point guard is outstanding.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets were led by Will Barton\u2019s 19 points and 11 rebounds. Danilo Gallinari also had 19 points.\n\nExcept for the third quarter, in which they were outscored 30-17, the Nuggets rolled most of the day.\n\nKnicks rookie star Kristaps Porzingis found points difficult to come by until the third. He went off there, though, making 6-of-9 shots in the quarter and scoring 13 points. Porzingis gave the Knicks their first lead of the game at 4:37 in third. Both he and former Nugget Arron Afflalo were huge in the third, helping the Knicks erase an 11-point halftime lead to take a two-point lead going into the fourth. Porzingis finished with 21 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nBut the Nuggets made the plays in the fourth to come out with a much-needed win.\n\n\u201cWe are getting better and better every game,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cEspecially in late-game situations, we\u2019re getting better.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nDENVER AT BROOKLYN 5:30 p.m. Monday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Brook Lopez:\n\nThe Nuggets will go from one Lopez brother (Robin, with the Knicks, on Sunday) to the other, Brook, who anchors the middle for the Nets. Brook Lopez has been solid as one of the few traditional centers left in the NBA, with averages of 20.3 points and 8.4 rebounds per game this season. He is shooting 50 percent from the field.\n\nChristopher Dempsey, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Emmanuel Mudiay\u2019s fourth quarter puts Knicks defense to shame in Nuggets win", "title": "Emmanuel Mudiay\u2019s fourth quarter puts Knicks defense to shame in Nuggets win", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/07/emmanuel-mudiays-fourth-quarter-puts-knicks-defense-to-shame-in-nuggets-win/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160207__e77423cee56dcb068f0f6a706700fca3p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160207__e77423cee56dcb068f0f6a706700fca3p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-07T13:44:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:11:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He has been solid in many late-game situations already this season, but he wove his best late fourth quarter of the season on the NBA\u2019s biggest stage: Madison Square Garden.\nHe shot 2-of-12 going into the fourth quarter but made 4-of-6 shots in the final period to help the Nuggets seal the deal.\nOn Sunday, it had a lot to do with the man drafted to lead the revolution: point guard Emmanuel Mudiay.\nMudiay scored nine of the Nuggets\u2019 11 points in roughly 3\u00bd minutes after he re-entered the game.\nBut the Nuggets made the plays in the fourth to come out with a much-needed win."}
