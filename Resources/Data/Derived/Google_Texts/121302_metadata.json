Credit: Associated Press\n\nBy of the\n\nSochi, Russia \u2013 Jillert Anema would not last two minutes in Green Bay.\n\nNot to mention Tuscaloosa, Happy Valley, Pittsburgh, Ann Arbor, Dallas or Baton Rouge.\n\nAnema, a speedskating coach for the Netherlands, dislikes the U.S. brand of football and indirectly blames Americans' obsession with it for Team USA's miserable performance in long-track races at the Sochi Games.\n\n\"You have a lot of attention on a foolish sport like American football and you waste a lot of talent, athletic talent, on a sport that is meant to kill each other, to injure each other,\" Anema said in an interview on CNBC. \"You're so narrow-minded and then you want to compete against the world (in other sports) when you waste a lot of time, good talent on a sport that sucks.\"\n\nHe added, \"You've got all the money into that sport so there's not a lot of money in the other sports. Nobody in the world wants to compete in that sport with you.\"\n\nThe Dutch have dominated speedskating and have won 23 long-track medals after sweeping the finals of men's and women's team pursuit. That's a record for medals by any country in one sport at the Winter Olympics. The U.S. was shut out at Adler Arena and picked up just one medal in short-track.\n\n\"If you are not interested in being the best in the world, then stay in your country and do your own sport,\" Anema said. \"Don't compete with the rest of the world. And don't ask the question why you didn't win any medals.\"\n\nAnema failed to note that the Netherlands hasn't won a single medal in any other sport and that the U.S. has won 27 and counting. He also conveniently forgot to mention that Shani Davis and Chad Hedrick whipped Dutch skaters for eight years and combined to win nine Olympic medals, though he did concede, \"Davis, I think, is the best skater there ever was.\"\n\nBut he couldn't resist taking more shots at football.\n\n\"Americans always believe they're right, always believe they're the best, but that's not true,\" he said. \"When you go abroad and you look at the rest of the world, yeah, you can stay inside your own country and make your own game, like American football. Do it your own and think you're the best in the world.\n\n\"But no way. When you play soccer, man, you're just not half, you're not in the top 30 of the world. Every four years you come to Olympic stadium and you want to fight the rest of the world, then you know your place. You got zero medals. Zero, man.\"\n\nAnema said he did appreciate basketball and has attended Milwaukee Bucks and Utah Jazz games when the Dutch have competed at the Pettit National Ice Center and in Salt Lake City.\n\nHe also let it slip that he was glad the Seattle Seahawks won the Super Bowl \"because they were the underdogs.\"\n\nSo does he follow American football, at least a little bit?\n\n\"No, no, no, no,\" he said. \"I like the commercials very much. There is a lot of humor involved.\"\n\nAnema had an animated and often humorous exchange with Joe Kernen, the host of CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" and at one point said, \"You can't stand losing. You must be an American.\"\n\nKernen replied, \"Anything else you're good at, tulip bulbs, anything, you just let us know.\"\n\nAnema shot back, \"You just envy us for our medals. No big deal.\"\n\nOne thing is certain: we'll never see Anema dot the 'i' at Ohio State.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Dutch coach blames football for U.S. Speedskating's troubles", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/olympics/dutch-coach-blames-football-for-us-speedskatings-troubles-b99211194z1-246672541.html", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/36168049-ap_joy_of_victory_photo_gallery.jpg", "height": 1441}, "type": "article", "description": "Jillert Anema, a speedskating coach for the Netherlands, dislikes the U.S. brand of football and indirectly blames Americans\u2019 obsession with it for Team USA\u2019s miserable performance in long-track races at the Sochi Games.", "title": "Dutch coach blames football for U.S. Speedskating's troubles"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/36168049-ap_joy_of_victory_photo_gallery.jpg", "description": "Jillert Anema, a speedskating coach for the Netherlands, dislikes the U.S. brand of football and indirectly blames Americans\u2019 obsession with it for Team USA\u2019s miserable performance in long-track races at the Sochi Games.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Dutch coach blames football for U.S. Speedskating's troubles"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba8e\"", "article_summary": "The Dutch have dominated speedskating and have won 23 long-track medals after sweeping the finals of men's and women's team pursuit.\nAnema, a speedskating coach for the Netherlands, dislikes the U.S. brand of football and indirectly blames Americans' obsession with it for Team USA's miserable performance in long-track races at the Sochi Games.\n\"If you are not interested in being the best in the world, then stay in your country and do your own sport,\" Anema said.\nHe added, \"You've got all the money into that sport so there's not a lot of money in the other sports.\nWhen you play soccer, man, you're just not half, you're not in the top 30 of the world."}
