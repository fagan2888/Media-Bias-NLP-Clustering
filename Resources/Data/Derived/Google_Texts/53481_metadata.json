Bush.\n\nCalls for the Republican-led House to impeach Obama are coming from Sarah Palin and other harsh conservative critics at the height of midterm campaigning. His administration\u2019s handling of the immigration crisis on the southern border has amplified the small chorus.\n\nHowever, such a step is considered far-fetched, especially after House Speaker John Boehner expressed disagreement with the premise in this case.\n\nObama has clashed repeatedly and sharply with Republicans during his presidency.\n\nCheney, however, did offer limited support for House Republican efforts to sue Obama over their claims he has abused his authority on a number of occasions by unlawfully going around Congress to carry out policy.\n\nThey\u2019re focusing their unusual legal action on a piece of Obamacare, a major political flashpoint between the GOP and the President and his supporters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see the House Republicans are challenging him at least legally at this point. But I think that gets to be a bit of a distraction just like the impeachment of Bill Clinton did,\u201d Cheney said.\n\nClinton was impeached over the Monica Lewinsky affair, but not convicted by the Senate.\n\nDefiant Cheney accepts no blame for Iraq\n\nCheney also said that the Bush administration left Iraq in reasonably good shape after years of war, and blamed Obama for not getting a security agreement from Iraqi leader Nouri al-Maliki to keep some U.S. troops there after combat operations ended to help ensure stability.\n\nResurgent Sunni extremists have swept through parts of northern and central Iraq in recent weeks, exposing serious shortcomings in Iraqi security and governance.\n\nObama has sent military advisers to assess the situation, but pledges no new ground troops.\n\nThe debacle has opened another front for Republicans in criticizing the administration\u2019s foreign policy.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s failure to provide for a stay-behind force is what created the havoc we see in Iraq today,\u201d Cheney said.\n\n\u201cWhen we left Iraq was a relatively stable place. We defeated al Qaeda, we had a coalition government in place,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked whether some of the decisions made by him and Bush are responsible for the upheaval in Iraq now, Cheney deflected blame.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s primarily Maliki, and Obama. That\u2019s what I believe, and that\u2019s what the history books will show,\u201d Cheney said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "(CNN) -- Although a fierce critic of Barack Obama, former Vice President Dick Cheney does not support calls from some on the far right of his party to impeach him, saying it would simply create a distraction.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=", "og": {"site_name": "Q13 FOX News", "description": "(CNN) \u2014 Although a fierce critic of Barack Obama, former Vice President Dick Cheney does not support calls from some on the far right of his party to impeach him, saying it would simply creat\u2026", "title": "Dick Cheney: Don\u2019t impeach President Obama", "url": "http://q13fox.com/2014/07/16/dick-cheney-dont-impeach-president-obama/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dick-cheney-2.jpg", "identifier": "http://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dick-cheney-2.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dick-cheney-2.jpg?w=1400", "site": "@q13fox", "card": "photo", "creator": "@q13fox"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Seattle and Western Washington's source for breaking news, weather, and sports.
