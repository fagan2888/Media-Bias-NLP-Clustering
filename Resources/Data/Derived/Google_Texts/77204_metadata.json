Providers working in community clinics and those in states that expanded their Medicaid programs are more likely to report such increases. Nearly half of physicians (44 percent) and more than half of nurse practitioners and physician assistants (54 percent) report an increase in the total number of patients they see.\n\nThe 2015 National Survey of Primary Care Providers provides a detailed assessment of frontline providers\u2019 experiences with, and views of, the Affordable Care Act and other changes occurring in healthcare delivery and payment, as well as their perspectives on the future of primary care. This report is the first in a series about the survey.\n\n\u201cMillions of Americans have gained coverage since the Affordable Care Act took effect, and previous surveys have shown that most have been able to find doctors and get the healthcare they need,\u201d said Commonwealth Fund President David Blumenthal, M.D. \u201cThis study provides evidence that primary care providers have been able to maintain quality of care for all of their patients, including those with Medicaid and new coverage.\u201d\n\nThe survey finds that one year into the Affordable Care Act coverage expansions, most providers do not report any overall change in quality of care or patient satisfaction. This is true even among those who reported increases in newly insured or Medicaid patients.\n\nMost doctors (59 percent) and nurse practitioners and physician assistants (63 percent) report no change in their ability to provide high-quality care to all patients since January 2014. About one in five in each group says care has improved and similar shares say it has gotten worse, according to the news release. Most doctors (61 percent) and other practitioners (63 percent) also say their patients\u2019 satisfaction and care experiences have not changed since January 2014. Equal shares of doctors say satisfaction has improved and gotten worse, while nurse practitioners and physician assistants are somewhat more likely to say it improved.\n\nThe survey also finds primary care providers nearly evenly divided in their overall view of the Affordable Care Act. Among physicians, 52 percent express an unfavorable view of the law and 48 percent a favorable one.\n\n\u201cPhysicians are highly trained professionals, but when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, they turn into partisans, the same way the general public does,\u201d Kaiser Family Foundation President and CEO Drew Altman said. \u201cThe survey finds that physicians who are Republicans are much more likely to perceive negative effects from the law, while those who are Democrats are far more likely to see positive ones.\u201d\n\nThe survey finds that a large majority of primary care providers, regardless of party affiliation, say they are satisfied with their medical practice. Satisfaction levels among physicians have increased from 68 percent in 2012 to 83 percent in 2015. Still, a sense of pessimism exists among physicians; with nearly half (49 percent) saying they would not advise a young person to pursue a career in primary care. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants are more optimistic; with the vast majority (85 percent) saying they would make such a recommendation.\n\nFollow ACA on Twitter @ACAIntl or Facebook for news and event updates.
