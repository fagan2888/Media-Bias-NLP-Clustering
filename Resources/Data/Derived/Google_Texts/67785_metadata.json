In a laboratory study last year, researchers scanned the brains of 34 young volunteers playing car racing video games.\n\nDagfinn Moe, a senior researcher with independent research group SINTEF, has for years studied the risk-taking behavior of adolescents and young adults in work that draws from neurobiology, psychology, and the social sciences. For the study, he and his colleagues made a comparison between 17 risk-averse volunteers and another 17 with a lower tolerance for risk, as measured by psychology tests. A higher tolerance for risk is generally associated with the maturing brain of the adolescent, as evidenced by myriad research studies.\n\nHere, volunteers drove their simulated vehicles along a section of road at a pre-set speed before eventually coming to a junction presenting two options: to run the yellow light and risk a crash, or wait three seconds before preceding.\n\n\u201cIf he runs a yellow light causing a collision, he has to wait six seconds before driving on. It takes three seconds to stop and wait for green, so by far the fastest way of completing the course is to run yellow lights without colliding,\u201d Moe said in a statement describing the experiment.\n\nAs shown through brain scanning technology, the biological mechanism controlling human decision-making lies within the brain\u2019s frontal lobe. However, the brain considers other information \u2014 including the emotions \u2014 before making a decision. In that process, two-way communication occurs between the limbic system and frontal lobe.\n\n\"All our lives we have to make balanced decisions, and emotions of all kinds are always linked to this process,\u201d Moe said. \u201cIn many cases our emotions will take the upper hand, causing us to take risks and act rashly and foolishly.\u201d\n\nAmong young men in the study with a higher tolerance for risk, cognition was apparently dominated by motivation and emotion, effectively \u201cblinding\u201d the young driver to the inherent risks of driving a motor vehicle. \"Risk-averse drivers consider and balance their assessments to a much greater degree before they decide whether to stop or drive on,\u201d Moe said. \"The high-risk group is dominated by motivation and emotions encouraging them to take a chance and drive on regardless \u2014 and experiences no decisive dilemma when approaching the yellow light.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers also found that those in the higher-risk group experienced a quicker maturation of neural networks known as \u201cwhite matter\u201d connecting various areas of the brain. Though it might seem paradoxical, Moe said, higher tolerance for risk is sometimes associated with heightened brain activity \u2014 no matter how \u201cstupid\u201d the decision\u2019s outcome.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "younger drivers, young drivers and risk, young drivers make decisions, decision making and young drivers", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Among adolescent drivers with a high tolerance for risk, the brain's frontal lobe asks for input from the emotional limbic center before making any decisions.", "title": "Younger Drivers Lack Self-Control", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/younger-drivers-emotions-affect-decision-making-disrupt-rational-thinking-274876", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/06/younger-drives-lack-self-control-their-emotional-brain.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Among adolescent drivers with a high tolerance for risk, the brain's frontal lobe asks for input from the emotional limbic center before making any decisions.", "title": "Younger Drivers Lack Self-Control", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/younger-drivers-emotions-affect-decision-making-disrupt-rational-thinking-274876", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/06/younger-drives-lack-self-control-their-emotional-brain.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/06/younger-drives-lack-self-control-their-emotional-brain.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-04-06T19:24:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-06T19:24:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Among adolescent drivers with a high tolerance for risk, the brain's frontal lobe asks for input from the emotional limbic center before making any decisions."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced48\"", "article_summary": "In a laboratory study last year, researchers scanned the brains of 34 young volunteers playing car racing video games.\nA higher tolerance for risk is generally associated with the maturing brain of the adolescent, as evidenced by myriad research studies.\n\"All our lives we have to make balanced decisions, and emotions of all kinds are always linked to this process,\u201d Moe said.\nThough it might seem paradoxical, Moe said, higher tolerance for risk is sometimes associated with heightened brain activity \u2014 no matter how \u201cstupid\u201d the decision\u2019s outcome.\nAs shown through brain scanning technology, the biological mechanism controlling human decision-making lies within the brain\u2019s frontal lobe."}
