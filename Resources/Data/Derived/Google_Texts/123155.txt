Two people have been charged in connection with the fire at Inland Marina on February 14th. William Marver and Brenda Harris face arson-related charges, accused of intentionally setting the fire that destroyed a dock and four boats.



Marver was booked into the Vanderburgh County Jail on Monday afternoon on charges of arson, arson for hire and arson with intent to defraud. Harris, who is from Hatfield, Indiana, is in custody, according to Evansville fire officials. Harris faces the same three charges as Marver.



The fire caused roughly $5 million in damage at Inland Marina, which is off of Waterworks Road near downtown Evansville. The wreckage from the sunken boats was pulled from the bottom of the marina in March.
