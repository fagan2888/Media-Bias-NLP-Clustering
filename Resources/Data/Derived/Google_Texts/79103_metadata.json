Thousands of Islamists have been arrested and hundreds killed, with authorities accusing the group of being behind militant violence. The group was effectively outlawed under a new constitution voted in by 98.1-percent last week.\n\nA fresh wave of violence erupted on Friday, when a truck bomb went off in the capital, Cairo, killing 6 and injuring dozens. That bombing was one of several within a 10-hour period that targeted police and other officials.\n\nAfter the blast, angry Cairo residents took to the streets, joining police to confront Muslim Brotherhood protesters. Fourteen people were killed in nationwide clashes.\n\nMany fear the military government will use an increase in bloodshed leading up to the four-year anniversary to put stricter controls in place and solidify their power.\n\nGovernment supporters are also planning giant rallies on Saturday to show their backing for the military \u2013 and to call for army chief el-Sissi to run for president.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An alliance of supporters backing ousted Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi have called for a fresh round of sit-in protests around the country, raising already", "og": {"site_name": "The Right Perspective", "description": "An alliance of supporters backing ousted Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi have called for a fresh round of sit-in protests around the country, raising already heightened tensions following the outlawing of the Muslim Brotherhood.", "title": "Pro-Morsi Alliance Calls For Protests", "url": "http://www.therightperspective.org/2014/01/25/pro-morsi-alliance-calls-for-protests/", "image": "http://www.therightperspective.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/TRP_Logo_100x1001.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.therightperspective.org", "description": "An alliance of supporters backing ousted Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi have called for a fresh round of sit-in protests around the country, raising already heightened tensions following the outlawing of the Muslim Brotherhood.", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/newsguy2005", "image": "http://www.therightperspective.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/TRP_Logo_100x1001.jpg", "title": "Pro-Morsi Alliance Calls For Protests", "site": "@http://www.twitter.com/newsguy2005", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.therightperspective.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cropped-TRP_Logo_512x512-270x270.jpg", "keywords": "egypt,mohammed morsi,muslim brotherhood,egypt\\'s national alliance to support legitimacy,,middle east", "article": {"tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2014-01-25T15:27:48Z", "modified_time": "2014-01-25T15:47:28Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfaf7\"", "article_summary": "The pro-Morsi group says its protests are aimed at toppling the \u201cmilitary rule\u201d that removed Morsi from power on July 3, 2013.\nAn alliance of supporters backing ousted Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi have called for a fresh round of sit-in protests around the country, raising already heightened tensions following the outlawing of the Muslim Brotherhood.\nSince the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s removal, supporters have held daily protests across the country.\nDemonstrations during the same time frame four years ago ushered in the democratically-elected Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood.\nThousands of Islamists have been arrested and hundreds killed, with authorities accusing the group of being behind militant violence."}
