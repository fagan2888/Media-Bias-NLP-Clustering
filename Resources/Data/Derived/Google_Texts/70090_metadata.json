For many, it's a fun reason to get all dressed up and dance, but only after you've found the perfect dress.\n\nStacey's in Urbandale has thousands of dresses and plenty of different styles, including the classic four styles. A line dresses are always popular, they are clean-cut and simple and very easy to spice up with beading, straps and fun colors. The ball gown style is always popular for prom, they're long and flowing and can be thin or big depending on preference.\n\nThe straight or sheath dress is a classic look, more stylish and sexy than traditional but always a fun look. Sheath dresses can easily add sleeves, an open back or lots of lace and they are great for taller girls. The mermaid dress is a classic look for prom and can fit girls of any height. Stacey says the mermaid style tends to look better on curvy girls but anyone can wear it.\n\nThis year's big trends in dresses include beading, sparkles, corset backs and lace.
