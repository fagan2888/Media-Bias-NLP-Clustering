No investor will own more than a 2.8% stake in the unit.\n\nThe investors run the gamut of industries\u2014life insurance, technology, appliance making and juice production, among others\u2014and include a number of companies that already have been announced as Sinopec\u2019 s \u201cstrategic partners.\u201d One investor is a fund that counts Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, +1.29% among its shareholders.\n\nMore than half of Sinopec\u2019s 25 newest investors are incorporated in China, with the other half incorporated offshore but ultimately related to Chinese entities. Earlier this year, Sinopec Chairman Fu Chengyu said the stake would be open to both foreign and domestic investors.\n\nThe announcement caps a process that began in February, when Sinopec said it was following directives laid out in China\u2019s landmark reform blueprint issued in November, which called for private companies to play a larger role in a mixed-ownership economy. Sinopec has the largest petroleum sales-and-distribution network in China, based on the number of its fuel stations, which the company pegs at 30,532 at the end of last year. The associated convenience-store network is the biggest in the country, with a footprint 12 times as large as 7-Eleven\u2019s, according to brokerage firm Bernstein Research.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"site": {"id": 624413}, "domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BH116_sinope_MG_20130821095522.jpg", "height": 398}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "China\u2019 s largest oil refiner says it will sell almost a 30% stake in its sales-and-marketing unit for 107.094 billion yuan ($17.44 billion) to 25 investors as part of Beijing\u2019s efforts to inject private capital into state-owned enterprises to boost returns and efficiency."}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "parsely-author": "Wayne Ma", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-09-14T13:00:00-04:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sinopec-to-sell-almost-30-of-sales-and-marketing-unit-2014-09-14-101035446", "author": "Wayne Ma", "parsely-title": "Sinopec to sell almost 30% of sales and marketing unit", "description": "China\u2019 s largest oil refiner says it will sell almost a 30% stake in its sales-and-marketing unit for 107.094 billion yuan ($17.44 billion) to 25 investors as part of Beijing\u2019s efforts to inject private capital into state-owned enterprises to boost returns and efficiency.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "article.section": "Industries", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "China\u2019 s largest oil refiner says it will sell almost a 30% stake in its sales-and-marketing unit for 107.094 billion yuan ($17.44 billion) to 25 investors as part of Beijing\u2019s efforts to inject private capital into state-owned enterprises to boost returns and efficiency.", "title": "Sinopec to sell almost 30% of sales and marketing unit", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sinopec-to-sell-almost-30-of-sales-and-marketing-unit-2014-09-14-101035446", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BH116_sinope_MG_20130821095522.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BH116_sinope_MG_20130821095522.jpg"}, "article.id": "9944A8F6-3C1A-11E4-A378-00212804637C", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1be\"", "article_summary": "China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, SHI, +0.68% said it would retain a 70.01% stake in the unit, known as Sinopec Sales, which operates more than 30,000 gasoline stations and 23,000 convenience stores in some of the richest areas of China.\nEarlier this year, Sinopec Chairman Fu Chengyu said the stake would be open to both foreign and domestic investors.\nNo investor will own more than a 2.8% stake in the unit.\nSinopec has the largest petroleum sales-and-distribution network in China, based on the number of its fuel stations, which the company pegs at 30,532 at the end of last year.\nBloomberg /file 2012 A Sinopec gas station in Hong Kong."}
