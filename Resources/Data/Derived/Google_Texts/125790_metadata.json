But try watching before moonrise on the evening of November 11, and even after the moon rises, you still might catch some bright meteors in the wee morning hours of November 12.\u201d\n\nBefore that, Earthsky.org notes, the Southern Taurids are due between midnight and dawn on November 5, and might even produce fireballs. However that will mostly be visible below the equator, thus entertaining aboriginals in Australia and elsewhere.\n\nBoth Taurid showers are \u201clong-lasting but modest,\u201d Earthsky.org says, with the peak for the North Taurids being just seven meteors hourly at best.\n\nNovember\u2019s pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, though, comes later in the month, with the Leonids, which have been known to dazzle and even intimidate with thousands of meteors per hour, or even per minute in a brilliant year. Comprised of debris from comet Tempel-Tuttle, the shower peaks late in the night of November 17-early 18.\n\nStay tuned for more on that in a couple of weeks, but in the meantime, remember to set the clocks back an hour at 2 a.m. on November 2, or before bedtime on Saturday November 1.
