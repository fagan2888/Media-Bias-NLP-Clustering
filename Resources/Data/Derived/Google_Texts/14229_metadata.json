Both have attracted overflow crowds: Trump at large halls and stadiums; Cruz in countless coffee shops, convenience stores, churches and diners.\n\nThe Texas senator and the billionaire have been quietly circling one another as they work to win over voters in the final stretch leading to the caucuses.\n\nTrump late last year began efforts to undermine Cruz, questioning the senator\u2019s religion and accusing him at recent events of stealing his idea to build a wall along the Mexico border. The intensity escalated this past week when Trump questioned whether the Canadian-born Cruz was eligible to be president.\n\nCruz has been careful not to take on Trump directly even as a few other rivals have savaged him. He chalked up the comments about his eligibility to the political \u201csilly season\u201d and said it\u2019s a non-issue.\n\nBut he appeared to offer a counterpunch on Friday, when he suggested that Trump wasn\u2019t devoting the time and energy to wooing Iowa voters that history shows is needed to win.\n\n\u201cThere is an Iowa way of campaigning and deciding caucuses,\u201d Cruz told supporters packed into a basement of a pizza restaurant in Decorah. \u201cI believe the only way to compete and win in the state of Iowa is to come and spend the time asking the voters for their support. Looking them in the eye.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s often asked how he can beat Trump.\n\n\u201cYou know we are gonna continue doing exactly what we are doing,\u201d he said in a Charles City coffee shop Friday when the question came up again. \u201cYou come here, you have the humility to stand before the men and women of this state and answer your questions. And you have the strength and courage of your convictions to say I can defend my record. And I can answer the hard questions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iowa voters experience Cruz, Trump divergent campaign styles", "author": "Scott Bauer and Jill Colvin", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Iowa voters experience Cruz, Trump divergent campaign styles", "title": "Iowa voters experience Cruz, Trump divergent campaign styles", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/09/iowa_voters_experience_cruz_trump_divergent_campaign_styles/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/gop-2016-trump.jpeg9-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iowa voters experience Cruz, Trump divergent campaign styles", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/gop-2016-trump.jpeg9-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Iowa voters experience Cruz, Trump divergent campaign styles", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Iowa voters experience Cruz, Trump divergent campaign styles", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, News, Politics NewsWAUKON, Iowa (AP) \u2014 On a collision course all week, Republican presidential front-runners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz were giving Iowa voters a look at their contrasting campaign styles Saturday.\n\u201cThere is an Iowa way of campaigning and deciding caucuses,\u201d Cruz told supporters packed into a basement of a pizza restaurant in Decorah.\nThe intensity escalated this past week when Trump questioned whether the Canadian-born Cruz was eligible to be president.\nBoth have attracted overflow crowds: Trump at large halls and stadiums; Cruz in countless coffee shops, convenience stores, churches and diners.\nBut he appeared to offer a counterpunch on Friday, when he suggested that Trump wasn\u2019t devoting the time and energy to wooing Iowa voters that history shows is needed to win."}
