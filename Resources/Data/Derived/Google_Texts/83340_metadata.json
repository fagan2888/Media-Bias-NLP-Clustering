The Affordable Care Act has really had a positive impact for us, and we need more space,\" the health center's Merrill Thomas said Thursday.\n\nCommunity health centers were a product of Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty.{}\n\nFifty years ago, they were set up to serve neighborhoods that were short on doctors and treat patients who have little or no insurance. They've treated millions of patients, including Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza.\n\n\"I speak as a patient alumnus,\" Elorza said. \"Personally, I thank you for everything you did for me and people like me.\"\n\nRachel Kaprielian, the regional director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, learned how many people in Providence depend on these providers.\n\n\"This health center, I learned this morning, serves one-third of the people who live in this city,\" Kaprielian said. \"That is extraordinary work.\"\n\nDr. Jose Polanco knows first-hand. He grew up in this neighborhood, and received his passport to education at this same health center.\n\n\"I still have my vaccine records, and it was our ticket to our schools. You couldn't go to school if you didn't get your vaccines,\" Polanco said.\n\nThere are nine health centers in Rhode Island, and they make up the largest network of primary care doctors in the state. By using electronic records and integrated health care, they are part of the future of health care in this country and efforts to reduce the cost of keeping Americans healthy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health care delivery is changing rapidly, but a mainstay turned 50 years old this week.", "title": "50th anniversary of community health centers marked in Providence", "og": {"site_name": "WJAR", "description": "Health care delivery is changing rapidly, but a mainstay turned 50 years old this week.", "title": "50th anniversary of community health centers marked in Providence", "url": "http://turnto10.com/features/health-landing-page/50th-anniversary-of-community-health-centers-marked-in-providence", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/6e5dd9f2-ca77-46e2-a4e0-cb1079be4c21-8563165_G.jpg?1440788751553", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nbc10", "image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/6e5dd9f2-ca77-46e2-a4e0-cb1079be4c21-8563165_G.jpg?1440788751553", "description": "Health care delivery is changing rapidly, but a mainstay turned 50 years old this week.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "50th anniversary of community health centers marked in Providence"}, "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 1681968455380874}, "keywords": "features,health check,health landing page,RI", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nbc10", "published_time": "2015-08-13T22:27:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "article_summary": "The campus is new at the Providence Community Health Centers on Prairie Avenue, and the need is expanding.\nCommunity health centers were a product of Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty.\nBy using electronic records and integrated health care, they are part of the future of health care in this country and efforts to reduce the cost of keeping Americans healthy.\nThere are nine health centers in Rhode Island, and they make up the largest network of primary care doctors in the state.\nThe Affordable Care Act has really had a positive impact for us, and we need more space,\" the health center's Merrill Thomas said Thursday."}
