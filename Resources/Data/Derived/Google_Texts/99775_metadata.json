The insurance companies set those prices in order to be able to offer more affordable plans in a competitive marketplace.\n\nSantorum made the claim on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d during a spirited back-and-forth with Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor who once chaired the Democratic National Committee, over the merits of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSantorum, Dec. 1: And here\u2019s the thing that, again, no one\u2019s talking about. The networks, in other words the doctors and hospitals that are in these exchange products, are dramatically smaller. In other words, yes, you\u2019ll be able to get your preventive care from your doctor, but if you want to go to the children\u2019s hospital, sorry, you can\u2019t get that kind of specialized care from specialized doctors. Why? Because the Obama bill set prices at such levels that doctors and hospitals, particularly the ones that are in high demand, do not participate in these programs. So you\u2019re going to see the end result be higher costs, less care, and then as a result, because they\u2019re narrow networks, longer waits and longer lines. This is just beginning, the disaster of Obamacare.\n\nNo statistics are publicly available to substantiate whether the plans on the exchange are offering more limited networks, but there is anecdotal evidence that some insurance providers are offering plans that restrict choices to a relatively small network of doctors and hospitals. As Jonathan Chait of New York magazine wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s making customers more sensitive to price. Of course, the flip side of this dynamic is that the ruthless price competition is encouraging insurers to squeeze doctors and hospitals. The most affordable plans on the exchanges often exclude more expensive providers.\u201d\n\nContrary to Santorum\u2019s assertion, however, the Affordable Care Act does not set the price levels for care. The law requires insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on health costs \u2014 as opposed to spending on administration, marketing, and profit. But the actual prices for medical services are set by insurance companies offering plans on the exchanges; and those same insurance companies decide what doctors and hospitals will be in the network. In Missouri, for example, Anthem BlueCross BlueShield excluded one of the state\u2019s top hospital systems from policies it offered on the exchange.\n\n\u201cThe ACA does not set prices related to commercial insurance, for either premiums or payment for care,\u201d Deborah Chollet, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research, a nonpartisan research firm, wrote to us in an email. \u201cThe narrow-network plans offered by some issuers are intended to (a) maximize negotiating leverage with providers by narrowing their PPOs; and (b) thereby reduce premiums to attract consumers. So, this is not regulation; it is competition at work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat said,\u201d Chollet added, \u201cconsumers need to be aware that if they want to go anywhere to buy care, they will have to pay more for it in premiums, out of pocket, or both.\u201d\n\nKaren Pollitz, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, echoed those sentiments.\n\n\u201cThe ACA does not set prices for health insurance policies,\u201d Pollitz told us in an email. \u201cRather, market competition drives insurers to seek ways to hold down premiums. It\u2019s too early to say how many plans offered on Exchanges have narrower networks (compared to, say, what insurers had offered previously on the nongroup market, or compared to what employer plans offer).\u201d\n\nIn Maine, for example, Pollitz said, Anthem \u201chas gotten lots of press for limiting the number of network hospitals; but a new co-op health plan offered in Maine offers a significantly broader network.\u201d\n\nExperts we spoke to agreed that while there are no hard statistics yet on the extent to which plans on the exchanges have limited the doctors and hospitals in their networks, Santorum is correct that there seems to be a trend among insurers participating in the exchanges of limiting those networks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the case (based on conversations with insurers and with providers) that insurers have decided to limit networks in some instances in order to price their health plans more competitively,\u201d Pollitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s also definitely the case that some providers have declined to participate in some of the new health insurance networks, holding out for higher fees from some insurers in return for a promise to participate exclusively in their networks. This is market competition at work \u2014 not entirely transparent, unfortunately, so it\u2019s not yet clear what the impact will be on patients.\u201d\n\nPaul Ginsburg, president of the nonprofit Center for Studying Health System Change, said the exchanges and the structure of subsidies \u201chave created a highly competitive environment for insurers.\u201d In order to keep premiums low, many insurers have excluded some expensive providers from their networks.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s hospitals have a reputation for being particularly expensive,\u201d Ginsburg wrote to us in an email.\n\nThe New York Times recently detailed how some in-demand hospitals are able to charge significantly higher prices for medical services than their competitors.\n\nWhile Santorum\u2019s comment makes it seem as though doctors and hospitals opted out, it is insurance companies that ultimately decide what doctors and hospitals will be in their network.\n\n\u201cThe only role that doctors and hospitals play is deciding whether to offer lower rates to get into these limited networks,\u201d Ginsburg said.\n\nAnd while the process may lead to fewer choices, it\u2019s not all bad for consumers, Ginsburg said. Some hospitals have discounted their rates in order to be included in networks.\n\n\u201cCompetitive pressure is leading to lower prices, which are pursued through limiting the network,\u201d Ginsburg said.\n\nAnd Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said: \u201cI do believe there are stronger competitive forces operating on insurers in the individual market, and that is helping to keep premiums down.\u201d\n\nLimiting networks is nothing new, a fact that was highlighted in a story in the New Republic.\n\n\u201cVirtually all insurance now sold includes a limited network of doctors and hospitals (i.e., PPOs, HMOs, POS, and EPOs), and that was true before the Affordable Care Act as well,\u201d Levitt said.\n\nThe bottom line: It appears to be true that some plans sold on the exchanges will restrict access to hospitals and doctors, but contrary to Santorum\u2019s claim, it\u2019s not because the Affordable Care Act sets prices in a way that discourages doctors and hospitals from participating. The plans are being limited by insurance companies seeking to offer more competitively-priced plans.\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd168b\"", "article_summary": "The private insurance companies participating in the exchanges set prices, which doctors and hospitals can balk at.\n\u201cThe ACA does not set prices for health insurance policies,\u201d Pollitz told us in an email.\nThe insurance companies set those prices in order to be able to offer more affordable plans in a competitive marketplace.\nBecause the Obama bill set prices at such levels that doctors and hospitals, particularly the ones that are in high demand, do not participate in these programs.\nRick Santorum wrongly claimed health plans on the health care exchanges are offering more limited networks of doctors and hospitals \u201cbecause the Obama bill set prices at such levels\u201d that some doctors and hospitals \u201cdo not participate in these programs.\u201d The Affordable Care Act does not set prices for medical care."}
