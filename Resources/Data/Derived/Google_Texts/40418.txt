The Pentagon announced Monday that U.S. military airstrikes have killed senior al Qaeda leaders in Somalia.

The Defense Department confirmed the death of Abdirahman Sandhere, known as "Ukash," who was a senior leader of Al Shabaab, al Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia. The strike was taken on Dec. 2, said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis.

"His removal from the battlefield is a significant blow to al Shabaab and reflects the painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals, and it's an important step in the fight against al Shabaab," Davis said.

"The United States will continue to use all the tools at our disposal to fight that organization," he added.

Davis said two other al-Shabaab-affiliated associates were also killed in the strike, but that it specifically targeted Sandhere.

The Pentagon on Monday also confirmed the death of Abu Nabil, the senior ISIS leader in Libya who was targeted on Nov. 13 in Derna.

The U.S. military had announced targeting Abu Nabil at the time, but did not confirm his death.

Normally, the targeting of senior terrorist leaders are not announced before their deaths are confirmed, but the Paris terrorist attacks on the same day may have prompted the announcement.
