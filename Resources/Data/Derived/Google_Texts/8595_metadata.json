Gilead Sciences/The Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nSovaldi, last year\u2019s wonder drug, has been pushed aside by a successor called Harvoni, made by the same company. The sticker price for Harvoni is $1,350 a pill.\n\nThe fast-paced changes in hepatitis C treatment are being watched closely amid fears that breakthrough drugs could reignite the rise of U.S. health care costs. Other medications that could turn into cost drivers include a new treatment for melanoma and a cholesterol-lowering drug awaiting approval. More hepatitis C drugs are also headed to market.\n\nHepatitis C affects some 3 million people in the U.S. and claims more lives here than AIDS. With the new drugs, patients finally have a choice among highly effective cures with minimal side effects. Previous treatments were hit or miss, and many patients couldn\u2019t tolerate the side effects. But newfound choice doesn\u2019t seem to have led to widespread price competition.\n\n\u201cAs a society we need a way of determining what is a reasonable price at the time of introduction of a new drug,\u201d said Stephen Schondelmeyer, a University of Minnesota professor who specializes in pharmaceutical economics. \u201cWe have expanded coverage, but we haven\u2019t done anything to control costs on the pricing side.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press asked two companies that track the prescription drug market for a hepatitis C update. IMS Health collects data on pharmacy prescriptions and sales, while DRX surveys prices paid by private health plans and prescription benefit managers. What they found:\n\nSURGE OF PATIENTS\n\nThe number of prescriptions filled for hepatitis C drugs has more than doubled, from an average of 20,600 a month during the first three months of last year to a monthly average of 48,000 for the same period this year, according to IMS.\n\n\u201cPeople are coming in who never wanted to be treated before,\u201d said Dr. Douglas Dieterich, director of outpatient liver disease treatment at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \u201cWhen I started in 1989, I used to have a 3 percent cure rate. Now I have a 3 percent failure rate.\u201d\n\nSIMPLICITY\u2019S APPEAL\n\nHarvoni, the new pill from California-based Gilead Sciences, accounted for about three-fourths of the prescriptions filled for hepatitis C drugs in the first three months of this year, IMS said.\n\nA big part of the reason is simplicity, explained Dieterich. Patients on Harvoni need only take a single pill daily, for 12 weeks in most cases. Previously, patients took combinations of drugs.\n\nHarvoni quickly rose to the top after its approval last fall, with monthly sales crossing the $1-billion mark by January.\n\nAnother new drug, Viekira Pak, is gaining market share but appears to be far behind. It\u2019s an equally effective cure and priced lower.\n\nStill, Viekira Pak is a four-pill daily combination, and patients have to take another antiviral drug as well. It was introduced late last year by Illinois-based AbbVie.\n\nThe extent of Viekira Pak\u2019s inroads is hard to discern. The company has not disclosed prescription volumes. And a major pharmacy that promotes the drug does not report hepatitis C data to IMS.\n\nNOT MANY DEEP DISCOUNTS\n\nDRX\u2019s analysis of prices paid by private health plans shows the median discount for Harvoni was 13.7 percent between April and June.\n\nThat reflects a modest price break for most insurers, including those delivering Medicare\u2019s prescription drug benefit, said DRX executive vice president Jim Yocum.\n\n\u201cThis sets the stage for some of the new cancer drugs coming out, both in terms of a vast improvement in effectiveness and a vast increase in prices,\u201d said Yocum. \u201cThis is a concern not only for commercial health plans, but for Medicare.\u201d\n\nMedicare is barred from negotiating drug prices.\n\nState Medicaid programs, however, and the federal Veterans Affairs health system are legally entitled to deep discounts.\n\nMatt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said competition from Viekira Pak has enabled states to win bigger rebates from the manufacturers. But Salo says cost remains a \u201cmajor, major problem\u201d because of the large number of people with hepatitis C. At the median discounted price, a 12-week treatment regimen of Harvoni costs about $98,000.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some fear breakthrough drugs like a new $1,350 hepatitis C pill could drive up U.S. health care costs.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Some fear breakthrough drugs like a new $1,350 hepatitis C pill could drive up U.S. health care costs.", "title": "Pricier treatment overtakes $1,000-per-pill hepatitis C drug - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 677, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/674116_Hepatitis-Drug.JPEG-0da61.jpg", "height": 999}, "updated_time": "2015-07-11T19:37:31-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/07/12/pricier-treatment-overtakes-1000-per-pill-hepatitis-c-drug/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some fear breakthrough drugs like a new $1,350 hepatitis C pill could drive up U.S. health care costs.", "title": "Pricier treatment overtakes $1,000-per-pill hepatitis C drug - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/674116_Hepatitis-Drug.JPEG-0da61.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "published_time": "2015-07-12T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-11T19:37:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "More hepatitis C drugs are also headed to market.\nHepatitis C affects some 3 million people in the U.S. and claims more lives here than AIDS.\nThe fast-paced changes in hepatitis C treatment are being watched closely amid fears that breakthrough drugs could reignite the rise of U.S. health care costs.\nThe new leading pill for hepatitis C is more expensive, and the number of patients seeking a cure has surged.\nAnd a major pharmacy that promotes the drug does not report hepatitis C data to IMS."}
