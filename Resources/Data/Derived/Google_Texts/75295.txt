The National Right to Life Committee, the oldest and largest pro-life group in the nation, today endorsed Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land in her campaign for United States Senate.

“Michigan voters will identify with Terri Lynn Land’s desire to protect innocent human lives – unborn children, and medically dependent or disabled persons,” said Carol Tobias, National Right to Life president. “They will be shocked to learn the extreme pro-abortion policies of her opponent, Gary Peters.”

Terri Lynn Land’s strong pro-life position differs sharply from the position of Rep. Gary Peters, who has a 100% pro-abortion voting record in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Terri Lynn Land opposes using taxpayer dollars to pay for elective abortion, and she supports the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act – groundbreaking legislation to protect unborn children from abortion after 20 weeks, when they are capable of feeling excruciating pain during abortions.

Gary Peters voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R.1797, Roll Call No. 251, 6/18/13). Peters also voted to allow taxpayer funding of elective abortion (H.R.7, Roll Call No. 30, 1/28/14).

Gary Peters’s pro-abortion position is so extreme that he is a co-sponsor of H.R. 3471, which National Right to Life has referred to as the “Abortion Without Limits Until Birth Act.” This extreme bill, if enacted, would invalidate nearly all state and federal limitations on abortion, including laws that protect individuals and private hospitals from being compelled to provide or participate in abortions.

Gary Peters voted to enact Obamacare, which provides government funding for health plans that pay for abortion on demand, and will result in the rationing of lifesaving medical treatments. Terri Lynn Land is needed in the U.S. Senate to help reverse the abortion-expanding and healthcare rationing effects of that law.
