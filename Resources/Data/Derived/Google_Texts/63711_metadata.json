Here\u2019s our best effort to explain what the GOP presidential contender really meant:\n\n1. On choosing a Supreme Court nominee: \u201cThe fruit salad of their life is what I would look at.\u201d\n\nThis is a clear case of Dr. Carson getting a bad rap from an inept mainstream media with no sense of historical context. We imagine that in Carson\u2019s mind, he was simply adopting a presidential tone by harkening back to the (questionably accurate) tradition of fruit salad in American politics.\n\nHere\u2019s a little revisionist history lesson (that we kinda wish was actual reality) that Carson might have schooled us with if we\u2019d only given him the chance:\n\n\u201cThough historians have traced this thread all the way back to the fruit salad shared by pilgrims and Native Americans at the first Thanksgiving, the first president to invoke the delicacy was James Monroe. In 1821, Monroe issued a controversial executive order that banned cantaloupe from inclusion in fruit salad and described the melon as \u2018fucking gross.\u2019 The order (later overshadowed by the more famous Monroe Doctrine) was subsequently overturned by Andrew Jackson.\n\nOther notable historical examples include William Jennings Bryan\u2019s famous \u2018crucified upon a bowl of fruit salad\u2019 speech and Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s farewell address, in which he warned of the growing influence of the military-industrial and fruit salad lobbies.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cCan somebody attack me please?\u201d\n\nLike a world-class judoka or a counter puncher \u00e0 la Sugar Ray Robinson, Dr. Carson is looking to use his opponents\u2019 momentum to his advantage. Carson lures in would-be attackers with his cucumber-cool facade only to strike back with his sharp wit. Admittedly, the strategy is less effective when no one ever attacks you because you\u2019re polling in single digits.\n\n3. On the American people: \u201cMany of them are stupid.\u201d\n\nWell, Ben Carson did lead in the polls for the GOP presidential nomination at one point\u2026\n\n4. \u201cMy own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids in order to store grain.\u201d\n\nAnother case of the lamestream media making a mountain out of a molehill. Dr. Carson clearly misspoke. Simply replace \u201cJoseph\u201d with \u201cEgyptians\u201d and \u201cgrain\u201d with \u201cthe mummified remains of dead pharaohs\u201d and this quote makes total sense.
