That\u2019s probably part of the reason nearly a quarter of workers freelance, either full- or part-time. They make good money, too. Almost half earn six figures.\n\nThe downside is making up for all the benefits that employers typically provide. That means figuring out health care coverage (which at least is now easier \u2014 if not cheaper \u2014 than it was before Obamacare) and setting up retirement accounts.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a workplace 401(k), a lot of the heavy lifting for retirement planning is already done for you,\u201d says Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar. \u201cThat makes it easier to overcome some of the barriers around getting started with retirement planning.\u201d\n\nRelated: 13 Tax Tips for Self-Employed Workers in 2016\n\nThat\u2019s not the case for self-employed workers. More than three out of 10 freelancers said they were anxious about saving money for retirement, and more than half reported being behind, according to a November study by TD Ameritrade. By contrast, Americans with access to a workplace retirement plan were more than twice as likely to be very confident about having enough money to retire, according to a separate study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute.\n\nThe good news is that saving for retirement is not impossible when you\u2019re working on your own, though it may require more effort. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nYou\u2019ll need to put away even more. Financial advisers recommend that savers stash away at least 15 percent of their income for retirement, including their own money as well as any employer match. Freelancers have to sock away even more income to make up for not getting an employer match. That\u2019s on top of building an emergency fund with at least six months\u2019 worth of expenses that can help weather a dry spell.\n\nIt\u2019s important for freelancers to factor the cost of those savings into their business budget, says Randi Merel, a financial advisor for Merrill Lynch. \u201cYou have to make sure that you\u2019re earning enough money to cover your benefits,\u201d she says.\n\nRelated: This Is Why Freelancing Is the Hot Work Trend\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve got several options. There are several ways freelancers can save money for retirement. Here are three to consider:\n\n1) A traditional or Roth IRA: If you already have one of these accounts and aren\u2019t making a ton of money, you can just continue putting aside retirement income there. With a traditional IRA, any withdrawals will be taxed, but you can deduct your contributions.\n\nWith a Roth (you\u2019re eligible if your income is less than $120,000), you pay taxes now on your contributions, but the money grows tax-free. You also can make tax-free withdrawals on the principal, so it can double as an emergency fund for new freelancers, although you\u2019ll want to keep the investments fairly conservative. \u201cThen when you start taking on more projects and making more money, you can have a dedicated retirement fund,\u201d says Randall Greene, CEO of Greene Financial Management in Altadena, Calif.\n\nAnnual contribution limits for both accounts are $5,500 for younger savers and $6,500 for those over 65.\n\n2) SEP IRA: The most common plan for freelancers and sole proprietors, SEP IRAs allow contributions up to about 20 percent of your compensation, or $53,000, that grow tax-free. There\u2019s a complex formula to determine your contribution based on your compensation as a self-employed person. Use this calculator to find the exact amount.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Who Is Winning in the Gig Economy\n\nA nice benefit of SEP IRAs is that the deadline for contributions is either Tax Day or when you file your taxes. So, you could put away just 5 percent of your income all year, but decide in February to put another 20 percent in because you find that you have the extra income. That can help you make up for any leaner years when you couldn\u2019t contribute as much. (The same benefit applies to IRAs and Roths, but at much lower limits.)\n\nYou can set up a SEP IRA with almost any bank or brokerage, and fees tend to be minimal. \u201cIt\u2019s a very cost-effective option,\u201d says Douglas Boneparth, a financial advisor and partner with Longwave Financial.\n\n3) Solo 401(k): Also known as an individual 401(k), these accounts let you put away $18,000 as an employee. Additionally you can contribute about 20 percent of your compensation (again, use the above calculator to determine the exact amount) or $53,000, whichever is less, as your own boss. Those over age 50 can put in an extra $6,000, and spouses who work together can both put in $53,000.\n\nA Solo 401(k) may cost more to set up and require additional paperwork at tax time, but its assets are protected from creditors under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Contributions must be made before the end of the calendar year.\n\nMany Solo 401(k)s also offer the option to borrow against your retirement savings, although experts say that doing so is rarely the best financial move.\n\nSkip automation. Most retirement accounts offer an auto-fund option allowing you to set aside a predetermined amount of money each month. That can be more difficult for freelancers, since your income fluctuates. Instead, consider making contributions a few times a year, recommends Gage DeYoung, a certified financial planner and founder of Prudent Wealthcare in Aurora, Colorado. \u201cPlan on doing it at the same time that you pay your estimated quarterly taxes,\u201d he says.\n\nPlan to work longer. Since freelancers control their schedules and how much work they take on, they\u2019re ideally situated to ease into retirement. If you plan to continue working (even if you\u2019ve scaled back) to delay drawing down your retirement funds, then you can retire more securely on a relatively smaller nest egg.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Working for yourself comes with lots of perks: setting your own hours, your own dress", "title": "Self-employed?
