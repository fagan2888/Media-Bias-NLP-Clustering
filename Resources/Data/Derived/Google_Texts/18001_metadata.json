Increasingly grim economic pressures, growing popular resistance, and the efforts of government regulators have all shocked the energy industry. Oil prices are falling, colleges and universities are divesting from their carbon stocks, voters are instituting curbs on hydro-fracking, and delegates at the U.N. climate conference in Peru have agreed to impose substantial restrictions on global carbon emissions at a conference in Paris later in the year. All this has been accompanied by what might be viewed as a moral assault on the very act of extracting carbon-based fuels from the earth, in which the major oil, gas, and coal companies find themselves portrayed as the enemies of humankind.\n\nUnder such pressures, you might assume that Big Energy would react defensively, perhaps apologizing for its role in spurring climate change while assuming a leadership position in planning for the transition to a post-carbon economy. But you would be wrong: instead of retreating, the major companies have gone on the offensive, extolling their contributions to human progress and minimizing the potential for renewables to replace fossil fuels in just about any imaginable future.\n\nThat the big carbon outfits would seek to perpetuate their privileged market position in the global economy is, of course, hardly surprising. After all, oil is the the most valuable commodity in international commerce and major producing firms like ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Shell regularly top lists of the world\u2019s most profitable enterprises. Still, these companies are not just employing conventional legal and corporate tactics to protect their position, they\u2019re mounting a moral assault of their own, claiming that fossil fuels are an essential factor in eradicating poverty and achieving a decent life on this planet.\n\nImprobable as such claims may seem, they are being echoed by powerful officials around the world \u2014 typically, the leaders of carbon-producing nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia or the representatives of American energy-producing states like Texas and Kentucky. Count on one thing: this crew of fossil fuel enthusiasts is intent on ensuring that any path to a carbon-free future will, at best, be long and arduous. While you\u2019re at it, add top Congressional leaders to this crew, since many of the Republican victors in the 2014 midterm election are from oil and coal-producing states and regularly laud carbon production for its contribution to local prosperity, while pocketing contributions by Big Oil and other energy firms.\n\nUnless directly challenged, this pro-carbon offensive \u2014 backed by copious Big Energy advertising \u2014 is likely to attract at least as much favor as the claims of anti-carbon activists. At this point, of course, the moral arguments against carbon consumption are \u2014 or at least should be \u2014 well known. The oil, gas, and coal companies, it is claimed, are selfishly pursuing mega-profits at the expense of the climate, the environment, our children and grandchildren, and even possibly a future of any reasonable sort for humanity as a whole. \u201cBasically [the big energy companies have] said, we\u2019re going to wreck the planet, we don\u2019t care what you say, we think we can, and we dare you to stop us,\u201d observed climate activist and 350.org cofounder Bill McKibben in a recent interview. This outlook was reflected in many of the signs carried by the estimated 400,000 demonstrators who participated in the People\u2019s Climate March in New York City last September.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry is often also portrayed as the nucleus of a global system of wealth and power that drags down democracy and perpetuates grotesque planetary inequalities. \u201cFossil fuels really do create a hyper-stratified economy,\u201d explained Naomi Klein, author of the bestselling book This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of the resources that they are concentrated, and you need a huge amount of infrastructure to get them out and to transport them. And that lends itself to huge profits and they\u2019re big enough that you can buy off politicians.\u201d\n\nViews like these animate the struggles against \u201cfracking\u201d in the United States, against the transport of tar-sands oil via the Keystone XL pipeline, and against the shipment of coal to ports in the Pacific Northwest. They also undergird the drive to rid college and university endowments and other institutions of their fossil fuel stocks, which gained momentum in recent months, thanks to the decisions of both the Stanford University board of trustees to divest from coal company stocks and of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund to eventually rid itself of its fossil fuel stocks and invest in alternative energy.\n\nOnce upon a time, the giant carbon companies like Exxon sought to deflect these attacks by denying the very existence of climate change or the role of humans in causing it \u2014 or at least by raising the banner of \u201cuncertainty\u201d about the science behind it. They also financed the efforts of rogue scientists to throw doubt on global warming. While denialism still figures in the propaganda of some carbon companies, they have now largely chosen to embrace another strategy: extolling the benefits of fossil fuels and highlighting their contributions to human wellbeing and progress.\n\nAt the moment, this carbon counterattack is most clearly and fully articulated in the speeches of top industry officials and in various corporate publications. Of these, the most recent and authoritative, ExxonMobil\u2019s The Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040\u00ad, was released in December. Described as a planning guide for future corporate investment and decision-making, the Outlook combines an analysis of global energy trends with a summary of the company\u2019s pro-carbon ethos \u2013and so offers us a vivid look at where Big Energy is heading in its counterattack on the climate movement.\n\nIf a climate movement is going to challenge the energy powers of this planet effectively, it\u2019s crucial to grasp the vision into which Big Energy is undoubtedly planning to sink incredible resources and which, across much of the planet, will become a living, breathing argument for ignoring the catastrophic warming of the planet. They present it, of course, as a glowing dreamscape of a glorious future \u2014 though a nightmare is what should come to mind.\n\nHere, then, in a nutshell is the argument that Big Energy is going to seed into the planet for the foreseeable future. Prepare yourself.\n\nNo Growth Without Us\n\nThe cornerstone of the Exxon report is its claims that ever-increasing supplies of energy are needed to sustain economic growth and ensure human betterment, and that fossil fuels alone exist in sufficient quantity (and at affordable enough prices) to satisfy rising international demand. \u201cForecasting long-term energy trends begins with a simple fact: people need energy,\u201d the report asserts. \u201cOver the next few decades, population and income growth \u2014 and an unprecedented expansion of the global middle class \u2014 are expected to create new demands for energy.\u201d\n\nSome of this added energy, Exxon acknowledges, will come from nuclear and renewable energy. Most, however, will have to come from fossil fuels. All told, the Outlook estimates, the world will need 35% more energy in 2040 than it does today. That would mean adding an additional 191 quadrillion British thermal units (BTUs) to global supplies over and above the 526 quadrillion BTUs consumed in 2010. A small percentage of those added BTUs, about 12%, will come from renewables, but the vast majority \u2014 estimated by Exxon at 67% \u2014 will be provided by fossil fuels.\n\nWithout fossil fuels, this argument holds, there can be no economic growth. Here\u2019s how Exxon CEO and Chairman Rex Tillerson puts it: \u201cEnergy is fundamental to economic growth, and oil is fundamental because to this point in time, we have not found, through technology or other means, another fuel that can substitute for the role that oil plays in transportation, not just passenger, individual transportation, but commercial transportation, jet fuel, marine, all the ways in which we use oil as a fuel to move people and things about this planet.\u201d\n\nNatural gas is equally essential, Tillerson argues, because it is the world\u2019s fastest-growing source of energy and a key ingredient in electric power generation. Nor will coal be left out of the mix. It, too, will play an important role in promoting economic growth, largely by facilitating a rapid increase in global electricity supplies. Despite all the concern over coal\u2019s contributions to both urban pollution and climate change, Exxon predicts that it will remain\u201cthe No. 1 fuel for power generation\u201d in 2040.\n\nYes, other sources of energy will play a role in helping to satisfying global needs, but without carbon-based fuels, Exxon insists, economic growth will screech to a halt and the world\u2019s poor and disadvantaged will stay immersed in poverty.\n\nPropelling the New Global Middle Class\n\nIf there is one overarching theme to the new Exxon ethos, it is that we are witnessing the emergence of a new global middle class with glittering possibilities and that this expanding multitude, constituting perhaps one-half of the world\u2019s population by 2040, will require ever greater quantities of oil, coal, and natural gas if it is to have any hope of achieving its true potential.\n\nCiting data from the Brookings Institution, the company notes that the number of people who earn enough to be considered members of that global middle class will jump from approximately 1.9 billion in 2010 to 4.7 billion in 2030 \u2014 representing what it calls \u201cthe largest collective increase in living standards in history.\u201d China and India will be the two countries adding most substantially to the global middle class, with each acquiring hundreds of millions of newly affluent citizens, but substantial gains will also be achieved by such \u201ckey growth\u201d countries as Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, Thailand, and Indonesia.\n\nThe emergence of a middle-class bulge on a planetary scale, representing a kind of consumerism gone wild, is something to be celebrated the company insists in its new report, echoing the words of the U.N. Development Programme: \u201cWhen dozens of countries and billions of people move up the development ladder, as they are doing today, it has a direct impact on wealth creation and broader human progress in all countries and regions of the world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rather than retreating, Exxon and other companies are going on the offensive as mankind hangs in the balance", "title": "\u201cWe dare you to stop us\u201d: Inside Big Oil\u2019s sinister plan to derail the anti-carbon movement", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Rather than retreating, Exxon and other companies are going on the offensive as mankind hangs in the balance", "title": "\u201cWe dare you to stop us\u201d: Inside Big Oil\u2019s sinister plan to derail the anti-carbon movement", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/10/we_dare_you_to_stop_us_inside_big_oils_sinister_plan_to_derail_the_anti_carbon_movement_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/shutterstock_205601335.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rather than retreating, Exxon and other companies are going on the offensive as mankind hangs in the balance", "title": "\u201cWe dare you to stop us\u201d: Inside Big Oil\u2019s sinister plan to derail the anti-carbon movement", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/shutterstock_205601335.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael T.
