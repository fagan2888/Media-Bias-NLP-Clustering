The fine for this year is $325.\n\nIn San Diego, premiums offered by the Affordable Care Act can be inexpensive for those who qualify. According to the CSU, premiums for a 21-year-old student earning $18,000 or the typical family of four earning $45,000 are virtually $0 in San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose and Sacramento.\n\nVanessa Grau, manager of statewide student outreach for the Health Insurance Education Project, said 12 of the 23 CSU campuses are staffed with coordinators that primarily give presentations within classes about health care options and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAside from presenting information in classes, SDSU\u2019s two campus coordinators, Brittnie Bloom and Kim Benzie, posted fliers around campus and hosted several events, including a salsa performance at the Conrad Prebys Aztec Student Union.\n\n\u201cWe had a little bit of extra money, so we thought why not throw a concert?\u201d Bloom said. \u201cWe thought about the population we were trying to reach, and trying to think of a genre that would draw that crowd out, and we got this amazing salsa band.\u201d\n\nBloom said getting word out on a campus as big as SDSU proved to be more difficult than expected for two coordinators.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we thought it would be as hard as it was,\u201d she said. \u201cBut toward the end, students starting recognizing us.\u201d\n\nPublic health junior Nick Grossberg said the program is beneficial, but there is room for improvement.\n\n\u201cFirst step to getting people on board is outreach,\u201d Grossberg said. \u201cPrograms like that are beneficial. I think it was a good start, but I don\u2019t think it was perfect by any means.\u201d\n\nThe CSU Health Insurance Education Project is still counting the number of students who signed up for insurance with help from the program.\n\n\u201cThe numbers look good, we definitely reduced uninsured rates,\u201d Grau said. \u201cHundreds of students were assisted, and a lot applied on their own.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bloom, CSU coordinators visited approximately 1,200 classrooms combined, and they reached about 38,000 students.\n\n\u201cIn college-age students, the uninsured rate is usually 20-30 percent,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cAfter looking at preliminary data, the number might be down to single digits.\u201d\n\nAlthough the program officially ended Feb. 28, health care education won\u2019t disappear from campuses. The Health Insurance Education Project will provide enrollment services, aside from solely resources, in the future.\n\n\u201cWe aim to educate students,\u201d Grau said. \u201cHopefully they take initiative to enroll and stay enrolled.\u201d\n\nThe Health Insurance Education Project has been educating CSU students about their health care options and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act since the fall of 2013. A grant provided by Covered California funds the program.", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Aztec", "description": "A California State University program helped educate students about the Affordable Care Act prior to the\u00a0Feb. 15 open enrollment deadline.
