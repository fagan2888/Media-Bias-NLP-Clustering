ROSEBURG, Ore. -- There's just about a month left to file your 2014 tax return, and AARP chapters across the state can help you file for free by April 15th.



The AARP Foundation Tax-Aide Program helps seniors and low to moderate income taxpayers.



AARP volunteers understand filing taxes can sometimes be stressful, especially with the new requirements from the Affordable Care Act.



"We all have to file our taxes and many many people are intimidated by the IRS and the state tax revenue department and there is a fear and if we can release that fear and put some of the confidence back in them that's what we're here for," said district coordinator Lynda Frommer.



There are four locations in Douglas County where you can make an appointment: Roseburg, Sutherlin, Winston and Riddle.
