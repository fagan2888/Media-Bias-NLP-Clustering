(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nMost of the legislators ordered back to the Capitol to revamp Virginia\u2019s congressional map will arrive Monday bent on remaking the state\u2019s highest court instead.\n\nA federal court ordered the General Assembly to draw a new map by Sept. 1 to replace one deemed to have been illegally gerrymandered along racial lines. But virtually no one expects the special session to produce one.\n\nAny plan agreeable to the \u00adRepublican-led House and Senate is widely expected to be vetoed by Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), which would prompt a panel of judges to take over the job.\n\n\u201cI have not talked to anybody in either party that doesn\u2019t think this thing is going to wind up with a three-judge panel drawing the district,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why we\u2019re even going to Richmond.\u201d\n\nRepublicans did not see a reason for the session, either \u2014 until McAuliffe inadvertently gave them one that they found far more appealing than mapmaking. By appointing Fairfax Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush to the state Supreme Court two weeks after he called the special session, McAuliffe handed Republicans a chance to unseat her and one-up him.\n\nRepublicans appear to have the muscle to remove Roush, even if, with the potential defection of one or two moderate Senate Republicans, they fall short of their goal of installing Virginia Court of Appeals Judge Rossie D. Alston Jr. in her place.\n\n[GOP legislator hints he will not go along with party\u2019s plan to replace Roush]\n\nThe removal of a sitting Supreme Court justice would be unprecedented in modern Virginia history and represent a new low in relations between McAuliffe and Republican leaders.\n\nThe General Assembly usually elects judges, but governors may fill vacancies when the legislature is not in session, as McAuliffe did in Roush\u2019s case July 27. Those recess appointments expire 30 days after the legislature comes back into session unless members affirm the choice by permanently electing the judges to their posts.\n\nHad McAuliffe not called the special session, that clock would not have started ticking until the legislature convened for its regular session in January. Republicans still could have moved to oust Roush then, but it would have been tougher at that point because she would have been on the bench for months.\n\nRealizing that McAuliffe had endangered his court pick by calling legislators back to Richmond, his top staff searched for ways to cancel the session after he had formally ordered it in July, according to four people with direct knowledge of the matter. That, too, would have been a first in Virginia, although governors of other states have called off special sessions.\n\nMcAuliffe ultimately decided against canceling, according to the four, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\nChristina Nuckols, a spokeswoman for McAuliffe, did not dispute that people suggested canceling the session, but she said that McAuliffe never pursued that option. \u201cThe governor received advice from a variety of individuals and certainly appreciates and listens to all of that advice, but he never even made the slightest gesture in that direction,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily regrettable that Republicans would attempt to fire a highly qualified justice with overwhelming support in the legal community and across the commonwealth,\u201d she added. \u201cThe governor continues to call for full and fair consideration of this fine justice.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe and Republican leaders have fought before, most bitterly over the governor\u2019s thwarted effort to expand Medi\u00adcaid under the Affordable Care Act. But there were differences in policy and ideology behind that battle.\n\nWhen it comes to the Supreme Court, Republicans have no beef with McAuliffe\u2019s pick. They express a preference for Alston, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes a stint with a right-to-work group. But their chief issue is one of protocol: McAuliffe did not consult with House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) or Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City) ahead of time, nor even give them a courtesy call once he had made his choice.\n\nThe perceived misstep drew a public rebuke from former governor L. Douglas Wilder (D) and private criticism from several fellow Democrats. McAuliffe has dismissed the GOP\u2019s complaints as a \u201cpolitical temper tantrum.\u201d\n\n[Doug Wilder blasts McAuliffe\u2019s handling of Supreme Court pick]\n\nThe administration acknowledges that it did not contact GOP leaders but has said that it was no secret Roush\u2019s appointment was in the works and that Republicans voiced no objections.\n\nNuckols said that Roush called Howell and Norment while she was still one of several candidates in the mix. Howell spoke with Roush in May and said that he had heard good things about her, that Del. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) would submit a letter on her behalf and that the appointment was the governor\u2019s prerogative, Nuckols said.\n\nHowell does not recall the phone call, said his spokesman, Matthew Moran. Even if it happened, Moran said, the point is that the administration never discussed the appointment with Howell.\n\nAs for Norment, Nuckols said that Roush phoned the majority leader while she was being considered for the job and again on the day of her appointment but that he did not return either call.\n\nNorment\u2019s spokesman, Jeff Ryer, said that Norment does not remember receiving the first call and admits to ignoring the second.\n\n\u201cThe calls customarily come beforehand, and they customarily come from the governor,\u201d Ryer said.\n\n[Why Republicans want to oust McAuliffe\u2019s Supreme Court pick]\n\nThe administration did give a heads-up to Albo and another Republican legislator who had advocated for Roush\u2019s appointment, inviting them to be present when McAuliffe announced Roush as his choice. Albo, chairman of the House Courts of Justice Committee, attended. The other was Del. Gregory D. Habeeb (R-Salem), a lawyer who has long been impressed with Roush and encouraged her to seek a spot on the state Supreme Court.\n\nA few days before the announcement, McAuliffe\u2019s chief of staff, Paul Reagan, called Habeeb to offer the invitation. Just returning from a vacation, Habeeb was unable to attend but told Reagan that the governor had made a great choice. Habeeb said he also cautioned Reagan to get Republican leaders on board.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I hope you\u2019ve gotten buy-in,\u2019 and the answer was, \u2018We\u2019re good,\u2019 \u201d Habeeb said.\n\nReagan said he recalled only that Habeeb \u201cexpressed very positive feelings about Justice Roush. I thought that was very good.\u201d\n\nJenna Portnoy contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Virginia\u2019s GOP lawmakers prefer to use a special legislative session to oust a state Supreme Court justice.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Virginia\u2019s GOP lawmakers prefer to use a special legislative session to oust a state Supreme Court justice.", "title": "Fight over Gov.
