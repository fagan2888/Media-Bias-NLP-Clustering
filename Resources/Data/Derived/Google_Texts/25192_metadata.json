Contemplate these words: I don\u2019t know what will happen now. We\u2019ve got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn\u2019t matter with me now, because I\u2019ve been to the mountaintop. And I don\u2019t mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I\u2019m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God\u2019s will. And He\u2019s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I\u2019ve looked over. And I\u2019ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land!\n\nThose words were spoken by the late, great Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior. Those words were delivered by him on April 3rd, 1968 at the Mason Temple (Church of God in Christ Headquarters) in Memphis, TN. It was to be his final public appearance in life. Hours later, he would be felled by an assassin\u2019s bullet. By morning, Dr. King would be dead.\n\nI\u2019m writing this Op-Ed piece in stream-of-consciousness fashion. It\u2019s the afternoon of Friday, April 4th. Today is the 46th anniversary of MLK\u2019s assassination. An existential question lingers on my mind: just why is it that so many people don\u2019t appreciate something until it\u2019s gone? Critics of Reverend Dr. King were innumerable during his life. I consider myself something of a scholar as it relates to the topic of Dr. King\u2019s life and civil rights efforts. His enemies were black, white, both, and neither. His opponents were both progressive and conservative. His detractors were young, old, and in-between.\n\nHe was called many names \u2013 most of which remain as despicable as they are unprintable in any newspaper. Even his supporters must have wondered at times if Dr. King was too radical, too intelligent, too articulate, too polished, too well-dressed, and/or too educated to advocate for civil rights on behalf of Black Americans in the 1950s and 1960s. Even his friends must have questioned if Dr. King pushed the envelope too hard. Did they ask him to slow down? Did they ask him to pull back? Did they warn him not to anger White people (i.e.: the establishment) back then? Absolutely. Did Dr. King listen? Absolutely not.\n\nProvided I have the money, I can dine in virtually any restaurant; shop in virtually any store, stay in virtually any hotel. These facts are due in great part to the sacrifices of Dr. King \u2013 and to the countless Christian soldiers of all backgrounds, all ethnic origins, all socioeconomic subgroups, all systems of faith, all educational levels, and all political affiliations who stood with Dr. King. Many God-fearing, law-abiding, tax-paying, patriotic Americans paid a heavy price for moving this nation towards equality. Some people were beaten, incarcerated, and killed. Other people were ruined financially, socially, and politically. Some were disappeared \u2013 never to be seen or heard from again. I am keenly aware of all these things whenever I dine out and shop and travel.\n\nChange frightens people. President Obama referenced his own political enemies/critics in an address on the Affordable Care Act last week: \u201cA lot of times folks would prefer the devil they know to the devil they don\u2019t.\u201d During the civil rights movement \u2013 misguided individuals and groups didn\u2019t use the ballot box to affect change. Some used pipe bombs instead. Some used burning crosses. Some used high-powered rifles.\n\nEven in the midst of death threats by mail, by phone, and in person, Dr. King stated: \u2026as I move to my conclusion, we\u2019ve got to give ourselves to this struggle until the end. Nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in Memphis. We\u2019ve got to see it through. And when we have our march, you need to be there. If it means leaving work, if it means leaving school \u2013 be there. Be concerned about your brother\u2026 either we go up together, or we go down together.\n\nI\u2019m convinced that Dr. King knew with certainty that he would be killed. And yet, there he was in Memphis \u2013 demanding fair wages and benefits for the city\u2019s Sanitation workers: the white ones and the black ones. That is a singular courage which must be honored. MLK was not a perfect man; but he literally gave his life to make America a more perfect union: Let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness. Let us stand with a greater determination. And let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge to make America what it ought to be. We have an opportunity to make America a better nation.\n\nThank you, Reverend Dr. King. I salute you as the bravest of men. Rest in peace, sir.\n\nStaff Writer; Arthur L.
