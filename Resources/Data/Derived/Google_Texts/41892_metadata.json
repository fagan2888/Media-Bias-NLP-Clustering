Seven of those were in Boston, where Cubs executive Theo Epstein was the general manager of two Red Sox clubs that won it all with Ramirez playing a key role and earning a World Series MVP award.\n\nSEE ALSO: Josh Beckett throws no-hitter for Dodgers against Phillies\n\n\u201cWhile Manny is not and will not be a fit on the Cubs\u2018 major league roster, we do think at this stage of his life he\u2019s a nice fit as a mentor for some of the young talented hitters we have in the organization,\u201d Epstein said in a statement. \u201cManny will coach full-time and play part-time in a limited role that does not take at-bats away from our prospects.\n\n\u201cIf he shows there is still some magic in his bat, perhaps he will find his way to the major leagues and help another team, but that is not why he is here. We are thrilled that he wants to work with our young hitters and make a difference.\u201d\n\nRamirez most recently played in the big leagues in 2011, with Tampa Bay. The 12-time All-Star had a minor league with Texas before the Rangers released him last August.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at the stage of my life and career where I really want to give something back to the game that I love \u2014 the game that has meant so much to me and done so much for me and my family,\u201d he said in a release. \u201cI know I am nearing the end of my playing days, but I have a lot of knowledge to pass on to the next generation \u2014 both what to do and what not to do.\u201d\n\nRamirez was suspended for 50 games in 2009 while with the Los Angeles Dodgers after testing positive for a banned drug. He retired in April 2011 instead of serving a 100-game ban for a second positive test while with Tampa Bay, but later agreed to a reduced 50-game suspension and played in the minors for Oakland in 2012.\n\nThe teaching role for Ramirez is a bit of a gamble for Epstein, who is depending on Chicago\u2019s rich farm system to turn around the floundering franchise. The Cubs lost 197 games over the previous two seasons, and began Sunday in last place in the NL Central with an 18-29 record.\n\n\u201cThe reality is he is a great, great hitter who can provide valuable insight and knowledge,\u201d Chicago manager Rick Renteria said before the game at San Diego.\n\nChicago\u2019s top hitting prospects at Iowa include infielders Arismendy Alcantara and Javier Baez, a first-round pick in 2011 who is off to a slow start after he was a late cut by the Cubs following a solid spring training. Third baseman Kris Bryant, the No. 2 overall selection in last year\u2019s draft, is one of the top hitters in the Double-A Southern League and could make it to Iowa by the end of the season.\n\n\u201cThe Cubs have some very talented young hitters, and I would love nothing more than to make a positive impact on their careers,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cI am passionate about baseball and about hitting, and I have a lot to offer. While I would love to return to the major leagues, I leave that in God\u2019s hands. My focus will be on working with the young hitters, making sure they don\u2019t make the same mistakes I made, and helping the team any way I can.\u201d\n\nRamirez was selected 13th overall by the Cleveland Indians in the 1991 amateur draft and rose quickly through the minor leagues, with a youthful exuberance and natural charisma that endeared him to just about everyone he met. He signed with the Red Sox as a free agent in December 2000, helping the franchise win an elusive World Series championship a few years later, then doing it again in 2007.\n\nRamirez led the American League with a .349 batting average in 2002, finished second the next year, and had an AL-best 43 home runs in 2004. But there was another side to Manny \u2014 his lackadaisical play, particularly on defense and the basepaths, rubbed some managers and teammates the wrong way.\n\n\u201cManny has made real mistakes in the past but he has owned up to them and moved his life in a positive direction the last couple of years,\u201d Epstein said in a release. \u201cHe is in a really great place right now and wants to share the lessons he\u2019s learned along the way. We think he deserves another chance and that our young hitters will benefit from it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 41-year-old Ramirez is a .312 hitter with 555 home runs in 2,302 games covering 19 major league seasons.
