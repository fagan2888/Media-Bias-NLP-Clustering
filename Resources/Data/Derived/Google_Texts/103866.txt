Railroad crews were called to the scene. Railroad officials said the hopper cars were filled with cement material headed to Ash Grove in Chanute, Kansas.

The Peoria railroad crossing was reopened at about 5:30 a.m.

The South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad, based in Cherryvale, Kansas says the cause of the derailment remains under investigation

The railroad says a derailment crew is expected to have rail line reopened by Saturday.
