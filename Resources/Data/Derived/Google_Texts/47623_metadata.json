Everything from heart-shaped cards and boxes of chocolate candy to plastic flowers and teddy bears clutching plush red hearts will be 50 percent off because Valentine\u2019s Day comes but once a year. And Valentine\u2019s Day is over.\n\nObama\u2019s love for America also comes but once a year. He tosses it into a speech in the Midwest when his poll numbers are down and then it goes into the clearance box where you can buy his love and his patriotism for 50 percent off. And it\u2019s still expensive at the price because the heart-shaped box is empty.\n\nGreeting card sentiments come easily to the man who will say anything. Obama promised to eliminate income tax for seniors making less than $50,000, vowed transparent open government and promised that you could keep your doctor. His words were empty promises.\n\nLove, of a person or of a country, is not judged by what we say. It is judged by what we do.\n\nEvery politician with ambition claims to love America. Most only love themselves. Some love other things. No one can know what is it in Obama\u2019s heart, which is why the media\u2019s shrill demands that Scott Walker affirm Obama\u2019s love for America are silly and cynical, but we can certainly follow his passions.\n\nWe show our passions in the things that we really care about. We all have our duties and obligations. Obama\u2019s obligations include delivering speeches praising America, occasionally placing his hand on his heart during the pledge of allegiance (when he can find it) and badly saluting soldiers with a latte cup.\n\nBut are these the things he loves and cares about?\n\nWe can follow Obama\u2019s passions the way that an adulterer\u2019s trail to his mistress can be followed no matter how many cards or stuffed bears he gives to his wife.\n\nWhat are the things that Obama is passionate about?\n\nIn his first days in office, he signed a number of executive orders. Of his first five orders, three involved Muslim terrorists captured and held in Gitmo. His third executive order was about the \u201chumane\u201d treatment of terrorists. His fourth executive order sought to close Gitmo. Like the man who can\u2019t wait to get away from his wife so he can call his mistress, Obama made his priorities clear from the start.\n\nIt took Obama a month to set up the Economic Recovery Advisory Board. It took him two days to set up a Special Interagency Task Force on Detainee Disposition to free Gitmo terrorists.\n\nObama prioritized helping Muslim terrorists over the economic recovery. Why? Because that was a subject he was passionate about.\n\nPeople will always prioritize what they are passionate about over what they aren\u2019t. It\u2019s easy to look at a mission shift and see the choice that has been made.\n\nFor example, is Obama passionate about space exploration? He told the head of NASA that his \u201cforemost\u201d priority was making Muslims feel good about themselves.\n\nObama is more passionate about Muslim self-esteem than he is about visiting other planets.\n\nIs he passionate about god and religion? That depends on which god and which religion.\n\nObama left out \u201cUnder God\u201d when reciting the Gettysburg Address. The DNC\u2019s platform initially left out \u201cGod\u201d and booed the reinsertion. Obama\u2019s invocation at his inauguration also dropped \u201cUnder God\u201d.\n\nHowever Obama cheerfully recited \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d, the opening of the Islamic supremacist call to prayer, and called it \u201cone of the prettiest sounds on Earth.\u201d He had a man jailed for making a YouTube video attacking Mohammed and blamed him for Muslim acts of terror against America.\n\nObama\u2019s religious beliefs, such as they are, remain locked in his head. But there is only one religion that he is passionate enough to protect by imprisoning those who blaspheme against it.\n\nHe may botch salutes and the pledge of allegiance, but he has retained the ability to chant \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d with a \u201cfirst-rate accent\u201d.\n\nHe may think that the \u201cgood book\u201d says \u201cdon't throw stones in glass houses\u201d, but he accurately quotes the Koran. The things that we remember are the ones that we really care about.\n\nObama has an obligation to reference the Gettysburg Address, to wait out the pledge of allegiance and to praise America. He has no obligation to quote the Koran or chant \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d. These are things that he does because he wants to do them. They are the things that he is actually passionate about.\n\nDoes he love them more than he loves America? No one can know what is in another person\u2019s heart.\n\nThere are married couples who have lived together for decades only to discover that the love of their life had been cheating on them all along. And who is to say that the adulterer doesn\u2019t love? We can\u2019t pass a final verdict on his feelings. But we can know his faithlessness by his deeds.\n\nWe can say of him and of Obama that they broke faith with the covenant that they had entered into. We can say that they betrayed those who trusted them, lied to them, used and abused them, and then feigned outrage when their actions were questioned.\n\nCan the media\u2019s furious talking heads denouncing Giuliani deny that Obama lied to Americans? Can they deny that he harmed them? Can they deny that he refused to take responsibility for his actions?\n\nThe facts are clear. Only the interpretation is in doubt. And the interpretation is what we are debating.\n\nDoes Obama lie to Americans because he loves them? Does he weaken America abroad because he loves it? And if Obama loves America, what does he love about it and how does he show that love? Does he love the Constitution? If he did, he wouldn\u2019t constantly violate it. Does he love Americans? Which Americans? The ones whose health plans he took away for ObamaCare or the ones whose jobs he took away to legalize illegal aliens? The ones whose votes and wishes he ignores and snidely mocks?\n\nIs it the Americans who no longer believe in the future under his rule that he loves? Is it the unemployed Americans he loves? Is it the Americans he jailed under his new laws and regulations that he loves?\n\nIf Obama loves Americans, then it\u2019s a clear case of hurting the ones you love.\n\nAnd if Obama doesn\u2019t love Americans, what America does he love; the rock band or the Walt Whitman poem, the town America in the Netherlands or the Neil Diamond song?\n\nQuestioning Obama\u2019s love for America is alleged to be unacceptable gutter politics, but accusing his critics of being racists is a standard debating tactic for those same outraged media talking heads.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t gutter politics when Obama claimed that the national debt under Bush was \u201cunpatriotic\u201d. Is Obama at least as \u201cunpatriotic\u201d for increasing the debt by 70 percent? Is it possible that his spending spree proves that he doesn\u2019t love America? Or is indebting our children the way that he shows his love?\n\nCan we question the patriotism of a man who frees terrorists or only of a man who locks them up?\n\nIs asking whether Obama loves America an unacceptable question because the answer is obvious or because it isn\u2019t?\n\nObama will go on making speeches in which he claims to love America while making the country poorer, more dangerous and weaker. He will also go on making speeches praising Islam while increasing the power, influence and wealth of Muslims in America and around the world.\n\nAs the clearance box after Valentine\u2019s Day shows, anyone can buy a card or a teddy bear. It\u2019s the actions that count. It\u2019s not what we say that shows love. It\u2019s what we do that shows what we truly care about.\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.\n\nSubscribe to Frontpage's TV show, The Glazov Gang, on YouTube and LIKE it on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Can we question the patriotism of a man who frees terrorists?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Can we question the patriotism of a man who frees terrorists?", "title": "Does Obama Love America or Islam?", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/251858/does-obama-love-america-or-islam-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:36-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/251858/does-obama-love-america-or-islam-daniel-greenfield", "description": "Can we question the patriotism of a man who frees terrorists?", "card": "summary", "title": "Does Obama Love America or Islam?"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-22T19:21:16-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb24\"", "article_summary": "And if Obama loves America, what does he love about it and how does he show that love?\nAnd if Obama doesn\u2019t love Americans, what America does he love; the rock band or the Walt Whitman poem, the town America in the Netherlands or the Neil Diamond song?\nIs asking whether Obama loves America an unacceptable question because the answer is obvious or because it isn\u2019t?\nObama will go on making speeches in which he claims to love America while making the country poorer, more dangerous and weaker.\nEvery politician with ambition claims to love America."}
