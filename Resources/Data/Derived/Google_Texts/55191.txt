The Israeli military launched a ground offensive into Gaza Thursday, hours after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended.

The order was given by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his office said, after a ceasefire plan offered by Egypt was refused by Hamas.

“In light of the despicable and relentless aggression by Hamas and the dangerous infiltration into Israel, Israel is obliged to protect its citizens,” a statement from the office, according to the AP.

Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington talked with Hari Sreenivasan Sunday and put the fighting between Israel and Hamas into context.
