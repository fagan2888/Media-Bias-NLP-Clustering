At the same time, they offered a proposal that is vague and unclear.\u201d\n\nOnce illegally gathered part-petitions are disqualified, the initiative fails to meet Ohio constitutional requirements, he said. If the court rules that these petitions are invalid, supporters then would get the chance to gather more signatures in a lawful manner and resubmit a petition that complies with Ohio law.\n\nSecretary of State Jon Husted (R) sent the initiated statute to the Legislature in early February, following an unprecedented second review of the signature petitions by all 88 county boards of election .\n\nInitiated Statute Process\n\nUnder Ohio\u2019s initiated statute process, lawmakers have four months to pass a citizens-proposed law; if they don\u2019t, supporters may gather another 92,000 signatures on top of those already collected and put the question on the ballot.\n\nAugsburger said submission of the petition to the Ohio General Assembly was premature, adding that the proposal, as written, won't achieve lower drug prices.\n\nThe initiative wouldn't benefit the vast majority of Ohioans, those covered by private employer plans or Affordable Care Act policies, said Augsburger. Moreover, he said, \u201cbecause the proposal offers few details and no clarity on how drug pricing from the Veterans Affairs department would even be obtained, there are reservations about whether the state could ever implement the statute.\u201d\n\nCritic: Desperate Move\n\nAccording to the measure\u2019s supporters, VA pricing is believed to be 20 percent to 24 percent lower than for almost any other government program.\n\nAttorney Don McTigue, who has been working on behalf of the ballot initiative supporters, said the lawsuit\u2019s claims regarding the laws governing citizen petitions are wrong, as evidenced by the Secretary of State\u2019s determination that the initial ballot petition was valid and that it contained sufficient valid signatures.\n\n\u201cThis is a desperate move by the pharmaceutical industry and the special interests who support them to keep Ohioans from voting on a proposed law that would dramatically lower prescription drug costs for consumers,\u201d said McTigue, adding, \u201cit is unclear whether they have even filed in the correct court.\u201d\n\nMichael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), the Ohio initiative\u2019s primary financial supporter, called the lawsuit \u201can act of desperation\u201d by the drug industry. It is a clear indication that the pharmaceutical industry knows that it can't win its case on drug pricing with the public at the polls in November, Weinstein said in a prepared statement.\n\nHe called for the Ohio General Assembly to take swift action on the initiative and, if it is voted down, let supporters begin the next round of collecting signatures needed to put the issue before voters in November.\n\nBricker & Eckler LLP in Columbus represents the industry groups, which are termed relators, in the lawsuit.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Bebe Raupe in Cincinnati at braupe@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Brian Broderick at bbroderick@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/industry-sues-block-n57982068090/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Opponents of a drug price relief proposal heading for November\u2019s ballot want the Ohio Supreme Court to take a look at the underlying initiative...", "title": "Industry Sues to Block Ohio's Drug Pricing Initiative"}, "csrf-token": "Qh8_ePHYuJ5ivFBeIYqQ2162zlT98ziPKG5NNNW0jtT80s2sozvqBMBmhSrzNtiiT5k-pVWGJ70zW_3EG5Cyvcz_5NNOeRA3jmjD3BggJ4M1:Dq332FYYALSzmnJL13G1Z6ob-F2ZFTZkqJYFgSOuxE6O8VSVGspsdUGOGJxmzq-KIockI5NIfmFZHhOfs3OnT50AKv0gws0KXcMQk9cTOpQ1", "description": "Opponents of a drug price relief proposal heading for November\u2019s ballot want the Ohio Supreme Court to take a look at the underlying initiative", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "Laws IgnoredRyan Augsburger, public policy chief for the OMA, told Bloomberg BNA March 1 that the group objects to the fact that laws governing a ballot initiative weren't followed.\n\u201cElection rules exist because changing law through initiated petition is serious business,\u201d Augsburger said.\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the Ohio Manufacturers\u2019 Association (OMA) and the Ohio Chamber of Commerce filed suit Feb. 29 with the state's high court, challenging the petition initiative.\nBy Bebe RaupeMarch 2 \u2014 Opponents of a drug price relief proposal heading for November\u2019s ballot want the Ohio Supreme Court to take a look at the underlying initiative petitions.\nAugsburger said submission of the petition to the Ohio General Assembly was premature, adding that the proposal, as written, won't achieve lower drug prices."}
