If the winter blues is lingering and you’re in desperate need of Vitamin D, it’s time to book a spring break getaway. Kayak has compiled a list of the top 10 destinations for spring break based on its travel search engine.

Still, Florida destinations represent half of this list; Fort Lauderdale, which has been a spring break destination in the U.S. since the 1950s, made it to second position proving that good old traditions never die.

One non-U.S. destination made the list, but don’t worry -- it’s just south of the border.
