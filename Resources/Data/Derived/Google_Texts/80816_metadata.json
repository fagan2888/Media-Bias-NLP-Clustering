The stoppage could total nearly $2 million, and brokers fear they will never recover that money.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern,\u201d said Tammy Niederman, legislative director for the Colorado State Association of Health Underwriters. \u201cSome brokers are going to be losing up to $10,000 a month.\u201d\n\nShe was bombarded with phone calls Wednesday morning after the nonprofit insurer made the disclosure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad. A lot of us trusted what the co-op was telling us,\u201d she said.\n\nBrokers received about 6 percent of premium payments to the cooperative from individuals they signed up. Statewide, HealthOP payments to brokers averaged about $900,000 a month.\n\nThe insurer enlisted many Colorado residents seeking health insurance by offering low coverage rates. It did so while anticipating a large reimbursement from a federal program intended to help newcomers to the insurance market. But when that payment was unexpectedly low, HealthOP finances quickly unwound.\n\nVincent Plymell, a spokesman for the state Division of Insurance, said the cooperative has paid brokers through Oct. 20, but they will not get commissions from November and December premiums.\n\nLast month, the insurance division ordered the insurer to shut down because it lacked required capital reserves to issue policies in 2016.\n\nThe cooperative\u2019s closing costs have mounted since then as some members stopped paying premiums while others hurried to get medical treatment before their insurance expires.\n\nA receiver, Joe Holloway, has been appointed to manage its finances until it goes out of business.\n\nStephen Cox, a longtime Lafayette insurance broker, said the nonprofit dropped \u201cthe bombshell\u201d during a morning webinar.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in much worse financial shape than we thought,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all in shock.\u201d\n\nHealthOP board president Chuck Holum expressed regret about the payment stoppage.\n\n\u201cI feel terrible about this too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe brokers helped us succeed.\u201d\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or @dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado health insurance cooperative cuts off payments to brokers", "title": "Colorado health insurance cooperative cuts off payments to brokers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/18/colorado-health-insurance-cooperative-cuts-off-payments-to-brokers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151016__coloradohealthopp1.jpg", "height": 271}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151016__coloradohealthopp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-18T17:34:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T04:26:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fd7\"", "article_summary": "Colorado\u2019s failing health insurance cooperative told insurance brokers Wednesday that it will withhold their payments for the final two months of 2015.\nHealth insurance brokers helped sign up many of Colorado HealthOP\u2019s 83,000 members, and they collect fees from members\u2019 premium payments.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern,\u201d said Tammy Niederman, legislative director for the Colorado State Association of Health Underwriters.\nBrokers received about 6 percent of premium payments to the cooperative from individuals they signed up.\nThe insurer enlisted many Colorado residents seeking health insurance by offering low coverage rates."}
