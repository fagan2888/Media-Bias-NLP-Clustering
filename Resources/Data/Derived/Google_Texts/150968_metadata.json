But if even only part of the long list of nuclear and missile work that the North has boasted of successfully completing since its fourth nuclear test in January is true, Pyongyang would seem to be barreling ahead toward its goal of nuclear-armed long-range missiles.\n\nThe claim Saturday of a successful ground test of an intercontinental ballistic rocket engine, if true, would be another big step forward for young leader Kim Jong Un. But South Korean officials say North Korea doesn\u2019t yet have a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile, let alone the ability to arm it with a nuclear warhead.\n\nPHOTOS: In latest claim, N. Korea says it tests new rocket engine\n\nThe problem, as always, is that nothing has come close to checking North Korea\u2019s advance. International nuclear disarmament talks have been stalled for years, and round after round of tough U.N. sanctions have done little to halt the North\u2019s nuclear tests and long-range rocket launches, both of which are crucial to developing a nuclear missile arsenal.\n\nThe engine test, announced by the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency, follows last month\u2019s launch of a medium-range ballistic missile that violated U.N. Security Council resolutions that prohibit any ballistic activities by North Korea. It was the North\u2019s first medium-range missile launch since early 2014.\n\nNorth Korea has also threatened pre-emptive nuclear strikes against Washington and Seoul and fired short-range missiles and artillery into the sea in an apparent response to ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills and tough U.N. sanctions imposed over the recent nuclear test and a long-range rocket launch.\n\nIn Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner called on North Korea to \u201crefrain from actions and rhetoric that further destabilize the region and focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its commitments and international obligations.\u201d There was no immediate comment by the South Korean government over the North\u2019s announcement.\n\nSome analysts think Kim\u2019s belligerent stance is linked to a major ruling party congress next month meant to further cement his grip on power. The outside pressure and anger caused by bombastic threats and repeated nuclear-related tests, the argument goes, is meant to rally the North Korean people around Kim as he stands up to powerful enemies that Pyongyang says are trying to crush the North.\n\nIt is also possible that efforts to promote military accomplishments to a domestic audience are meant to make up for a lack of tangible economic achievements ahead of the Workers\u2019 Party congress, the first since 1980, said Kim Dong-yub, a North Korean expert at Seoul\u2019s Institute for Far Eastern Studies.\n\nWith typical rhetorical flourish, the North\u2019s KCNA said that Kim was delighted as the \u201chigh-power\u201d rocket engine spewed out \u201chuge flames with (a) deafening boom\u201d during the ground test at the Sohae Space Center in the country\u2019s northwest, the site of its February long-range rocket launch. KCNA did not say when the test was conducted.\n\nThe news agency quoted Kim as saying that the North can now tip intercontinental ballistic missiles with more powerful nuclear warheads that could keep the U.S. mainland within striking distance and \u201creduce them to ashes so that they may not survive in our planet.\u201d\n\nThe North\u2019s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper published photos of Kim smiling widely and clapping with officials. A burst of flames can be seen coming out of an object strapped to what appears to be an outdoor vertical tower structure. The veracity of the photographs could not be independently confirmed.\n\nWhile the newspaper\u2019s photos provided only limited information of what North Korea had done, they do indicate that the country is trying to create a different long-range rocket engine from the ones it has used on its space launch vehicles, said Lee Choon Geun, an analyst at South Korea\u2019s state-funded Science and Technology Policy Institute.\n\nHe pointed to differences in the rocket engines\u2019 shape and size and the way flames come out of them. It\u2019s impossible to tell how successful the North\u2019s recent test was without detailed data, Lee said.\n\nExperts say a militarized version of the rocket the North used to put its second satellite into orbit in February would potentially have the range to reach the U.S. mainland. However, North Korea\u2019s possible candidates for an intercontinental ballistic missile have never been tested \u201cend-to-end,\u201d from launch through re-entry and warhead delivery, to show they actually work.\n\nThe North has gone to great lengths in recent months to tout alleged advancements in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Those claims have often been met with doubt by South Korean officials and experts.\n\nThe North\u2019s official media on March 9 showed a smiling Kim posing with nuclear scientists beside what appeared to be a model trigger device of a nuclear warhead. Kim declared that warheads had been miniaturized for use on ballistic missiles.\n\nThe North has also claimed to have mastered a re-entry technology designed to protect a warhead from extreme heat and other challenges when it returns to the atmosphere from space following a missile launch. It also said it had successfully conducted a high-powered, solid-fuel rocket engine test. Solid-fuel missiles are generally harder to detect before they are launched than liquid-fuel missiles.", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Korea's latest belligerent declaration -- that it successfully tested a new long-range rocket engine that could allow nuclear strikes on the U.S. mainland -- leaves outsiders in a familiar predicament.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "North Korea\u2019s latest belligerent declaration \u2014 that it successfully tested a new long-range rocket engine that could allow nuclear strikes on the U.S. mainland \u2014 leaves outsiders in a familiar predicament.", "title": "North Korea says it tests new rocket engine in its latest claim", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/9/in-latest-claim-n-korea-says-it-tests-new-rocket-e/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/08/south_korea_koreas_tensions.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/08/south_korea_koreas_tensions.jpeg", "description": "North Korea's latest belligerent declaration -- that it successfully tested a new long-range rocket engine that could allow nuclear strikes on the U.S. mainland -- leaves outsiders in a familiar predi", "card": "summary", "title": "North Korea says it tests new rocket engine in its latest claim"}, "Author": "Foster Klug, Kim Tong-Hyung", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, North Korea"}, "article_summary": "PHOTOS: In latest claim, N.
