FORT JACKSON, S.C. (AP) - Actor Gary Sinise and his Lt. Dan Band are putting on a free concert for soldiers at Fort Jackson, the Army’s largest training installation.

The concert will be held Saturday at Hilton Field. The USO is the sponsor.

Army spokesman Pat Jones says the event is open to all with a Department of Defense identification card. Veterans and family members are also able to attend.

The band is named for the wounded military veteran whom Sinise portrayed in the movie “Forrest Gump.”
