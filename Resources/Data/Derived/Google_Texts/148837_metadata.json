At the Republican National Convention in 1988, George H.W. Bush famously said, \u201cRead my lips: no new taxes.\u201d Two years later, he signed a budget deal that raised taxes in order to reduce the deficit. President Obama, for his part, promised Americans that, under Obamacare, they always could keep their health plans if they liked them. That proved untrue\u2014and he was forced to announce an administrative fix to quell the ensuing political firestorm.\n\nThis past week, Obama has made another promise that he may not be able to keep. \u201cI want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d the president said last week when he announced the new strategy to degrade the Islamic State. \u201cIt will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil.\u201d While those two sentences may assuage the public, they are disingenuous. We don\u2019t know how these military engagements will unfold. If we\u2019ve learned anything from Iraq and Afghanistan, it is that the Middle East is unpredictable and we must be prepared for everything.\n\nOn Tuesday at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, demonstrated just how quickly \u201cno boots on the ground\u201d can change. \u201cMy view at this point is that this coalition is the appropriate way forward. I believe that will prove true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it fails to be true, and if there are threats to the United States, then I, of course, would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of U.S. military ground forces.\u201d These comments provoked an immediate backlash as they seemed to contradict the White House\u2019s position. The Pentagon and White House both attempted to walk back those comments later, but neither actually refuted what Dempsey said.\n\nThis is emblematic of the inherent contradiction in Obama\u2019s strategy. He can promise no troops on the ground, but cannot be certain of it. That\u2019s effectively what General Dempsey is saying\u2014and he\u2019s correct. For the same reason, Obama\u2019s commitment to \u201cdegrade and ultimately destroy\u201d the Islamic State makes little sense if he rules out putting boots on the ground. Robert Gates, Obama\u2019s first defense secretary, said as much Wednesday when he said, \u201cThere will be boots on the ground if there's to be any hope of success in the strategy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "American history is full of presidents making promises they cannot keep.
