The Sapulpa Police Department is continuing its investigation after two men were found shot Thursday afternoon. Officers said the shootings occurred in the 1800 block of East Jackson Street North at about 4:15 p.m.

Police Major Jeff Gilliland says an “ongoing feud” between two men got physical and both drew handguns and opened fire at each other. Both men suffered gunshot wounds to their arms and hips.

Gilliland says their injuries are non-life threatening.

Police say a witness drove one of the men to the hospital and the other man was taken by an ambulance.

Gilliland did not release the men’s names, but said his department will turn their report on the shooting into the Creek County District Attorney’s Office Friday afternoon.
