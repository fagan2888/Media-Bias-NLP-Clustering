Every year the efforts of extraordinary individuals who changed the world are acknowledged. Since 1901, the Nobel Peace Prize has promoted the virtues of peace and the selfless acts of individuals for the good of mankind.\n\nSo, it may come as a surprise to learn that Gandhi himself never received the Peace Prize.\n\nSince it was first awarded, critics have challenged whether each nominee and laureate has rightfully met Alfred Nobel\u2019s principles of national fraternity, abolition of warfare and peace promotion.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nOf the 259 Nobel Peace Prize nominees this year, over 100,000 petition signatures supported the candidacy of U.S. soldier Chelsea (formerly known as Bradley) Manning for the release of controversial government files, diplomatic cables and brutal combat videos to WikiLeaks. But despite public applause for Manning\u2019s military exposure of war crimes, she is currently serving a 35-year prison sentence over crimes of espionage, theft and fraud \u2014 which exposed certain non-peaceful actions of President Obama, who happens to be the 2009 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\u201cOn the world stage, acknowledging Manning\u2019s acts could prevent a monopoly on cultivated ignorance,\u201d said Merrill Aldigheiri, creator of a prominent Facebook page supporting advocating for Mannings nomination. \u201cFor the USA, knowing that a Nobel Peace Prize winner, President Obama, is jailing a new winner of this same prestigious medal would have to get people thinking. We need to stimulate critical thinking.\u201d\n\nThis year brings the highest number of candidates ever, surpassing the previous record of 241 candidates in 2011. The list includes Myanmar President Thein Sein and the youngest-ever nominee, 16-year-old Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani girl shot in her head and neck by the Taliban while advocating for education and women\u2019s rights.\n\nEach year the committee and the world opinion struggle to find an ideal on how individuals should be selected that is free from the influences of power and national authority. But as stated in Nobel\u2019s will, the acts of the deserving medalist must have in their actions \u201cconferred the greatest benefit to mankind.\u201d\n\nCandidates, courage and controversy\n\nMany human rights groups feel Manning is a model for justice, both in terms of gender expression and equality as well as exposing government lies.\n\n\u201cEvery president who wants to launch another war can\u2019t abide whistleblowers,\u201d said Norman Solomon, RootsAction co-founder. \u201cThey might interfere with the careful omissions, distortions and outright lies of war propaganda, which requires that truth be held in a kind of preventative detention.\u201d\n\nSolomon presented five thousand pages of Manning supporter\u2019s signatures to the committee in Oslo, Norway. Although the petition was for Manning, her win could be seen as a vindication for fellow whistleblowers like Edward Snowden, who was a potential nominee this year, and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, a 2011 nominee.\n\n\u201cI think many people in Norway have some sympathy for the actions of Bradley Manning, and especially Edward Snowden,\u201d said Asle Sveen, author of various Nobel Peace Prize texts and former Norwegian Nobel Institute Research Fellow. \u201cHowever, it is highly unlikely that Manning, Snowden or Assange will be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The members of the Nobel Committee are almost all former politicians who view the alliance and close ties between the USA and Norway as crucial for Norwegian security.\u201d\n\nIn the eyes of some army veterans, Manning signed a contract to serve and protect the U.S. and broke it, while claiming the leaks of over 700,000 documents were \u201csloppy\u201d and \u201cfoolish,\u201d marking Manning as a traitor. Critics allege the leaks put ground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan in danger after classified material was released in one massive document dump.\n\nWhen the Taliban located Malala Yousafzai, she was on her school bus in Pakistan\u2019s Swat Valley. The Taliban opened fired on her and shot her in head and neck. Her crime was for advocating that girls receive an education \u2014 but perhaps more to the point for criticising the militant group in her online diary. Appearing originally on BBC Urdu, Yousafzai wrote under a pen name accusing the Taliban\u2019s of imposing strict prohibitions on girls from attending schools in Pakistan\u2019s northwestern Swat district.\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2009, she wrote\n\n\u201cI am afraid. I had a terrible dream yesterday with military helicopters and the Taleban. I have had such dreams since the launch of the military operation in Swat. My mother made me breakfast and I went off to school. I was afraid going to school because the Taleban had issued an edict banning all girls from attending schools.\u201d\n\nPakistan ranks as the country with the second-most children not in school, with 23 percent of girls aged 3 to 16 not receiving education, according to the National Status Education Report for Pakistan last year. The majority of schools in the country are government institutions, but of those schools, 54 percent are boys-only, 30 percent are coeducation while 16 percent are girls-only, leaving a gap between the education of girls and boys in Pakistan.\n\nYousafzai was 11 years old when she started spreading her message in Pakistan, encouraging people to stand up against the Taliban in spite of the militia\u2019s raids on homes for books and school materials. When they discovered her identity, the Taliban attacked Yousafzai last October, leaving her in intensive care at a Pakistani hospital until she was transferred to care in the U.K, where she now lives.\n\nAfter a difficult recovery, Yousafzai continued her activism. In an address to the United Nations, she said, \u201cThe terrorists thought that they would change our aims and stop our ambitions but nothing changed in my life except this: Weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born.\u201d\n\nEven a letter written to Yousafzai from a senior Taliban commander doesn\u2019t seem to change her stance either. Rather than criticizing her education efforts, the note said, \u201cThe Taliban believe you were intentionally writing against them and running a smear campaign to malign their effort to establish an Islamic system in Swat Valley, and your writings were provocative.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sveen, Yousafzai\u2019s presentation and work in the U.N. \u201chas increased her candidacy for the Peace Prize, despite her young age. She has obviously grown into a role model for young people \u2014 here in Norway especially for immigrant girls from Muslim countries.\u201d\n\nAn online petition for Yousafzai helped push her nomination by the Canadian Federal Party, which was encouraged by Canada-born Pakistani writer and activist Tarek Fatah. Having already received awards including Pakistan\u2019s first National Youth Peace Prize, there is worry that this spotlight might make her a bigger target for groups affiliated with the Taliban and that the award, despite her worthiness, may be too burdensome for a young girl.\n\nSome question the nomination of Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) President Thein Sein. Many recognize the nation as a whole has improved relations with the international community since Sein took power in 2011. His reforms include scaling back repressive laws, releasing thousands of political prisoners and making steps to diminish internal conflicts.\n\nBut with Sein\u2019s background in the country\u2019s military junta, he is still viewed as a consort with militia leaders who broke down democratic uprisings. Today Myanmar;s government is accused of taking part in incitement against local Muslims, including allegedly providing fanatic Buddhists with petrol containers to torch homes of Muslim villagers in June, adding to the thousands seeking refuge in camps after riots in March resulted in dozens of deaths as Buddhists burned Muslim homes, mosques and schools.\n\nKristian Berg Harpviken, head of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo (PRIO) placed Sein on his shortlist along with five other Nobel Peace Prize recipients. Sein is the fifth selection of the group for \u201cspearheading a gradually evolving peace process in the country,\u201d including reconciliation with the junta opposition National League for Democracy, despite his military ties.\n\nAccording to PRIO, \u201cthe committee has often insisted that the prize is not to be for saints only, and has in recent years been particularly eager that it makes a difference in processes unfolding, even if that may carry high risk.\u201d\n\nIs this a new shift away from initial aims of Alfred Nobel? In such a large nomination pool, are individual\u2019s most recent activities toward peace, rights and reconciliation more important than widespread opposition and a violent past?\n\nThe nominations unfold\n\nThe current members of the 2012-2014 Norwegian Nobel Committee are Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland, Kaci Kullmann Five, Inger-Marie Ytterhorn, \u00c5got Valle, Gunnar St\u00e5lsett and Berit Reiss \u2014 Andersen, the first four also having served the 2009-2011 term.\n\nWhen deliberation of nominees takes place, Geir Lundestad, Director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute and Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee Awards Prize said reports from academic and international experts are what lead up to the final decision announced in October.\n\nFor petitions like the one for Manning\u2019s nomination, it is \u201cperfectly legitimate to submit signatures of support for candidates of the Nobel Peace Prize. This happens every year and some of these campaigns can be really comprehensive,\u201d Lundestad said.\n\nAlthough Solomon collected over 100,000 signatures for Manning, Lundestad said other campaigns for peace prize nominees have had more than 200,000, with the record being 750,000 signatures for one candidate who did not get the award.\n\nFor many of Manning\u2019s supporters, the award would mean a big comeback on Obama\u2019s win in 2009, when he was honored the prize for his \u201cextraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\u201d Then only about eight months into his presidency, some argued Obama\u2019s record was unproven.\n\nFrom the time Obama was in office ,the number of troops deployed to Afghanistan were and remain the highest since 2001. Between 20,000 and 35,000 troops were deployed through 2005-2009, but troop levels peaked at 100,000 in 2011 before decreasing to 60,000 today, according to the Brookings Institution Afghanistan Index.\n\nCIA drone strikes in Pakistan were also highest during those years. From 2004 through 2008 there were a total of 49 strikes, but from 2009 to 2013 there have been 322 strikes documented by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.\n\nManning supporter Aldigheiri feels that a presidential pardon from Obama is deserved, but even if the award is honored to Manning while behind bars, she wouldn\u2019t be the first laureate to accept it while detained.\n\nLiu Xiaobo, who was awarded the prize in 2010, is a Chinese activist for constitutional freedoms who spent 20 years fighting for a more open and democratic China. Arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 11 years in prison for his manifesto advocating shifts toward democracy in the country, the government called him a dissident, but the Nobel committee saw him for his long and nonviolent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.\n\nIn 1991, the prize was awarded to Aung San Suu Kyi, who was under house arrest in Myanmar by the regime. A founder of the National League for Democracy opposition and inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, she nonviolently urged military leaders to leave power in the hands of a civilian government for aim of an established democratic society and free ethnic groups from oppression.\n\nOf all the Nobel Peace Prize laureates, only 12 are women, making a case for supporters who say it\u2019s Yousafzai\u2019s time.\n\nBut no matter who wins the award this year, as nations and systems change and as revolutions unfold, defining the most prominent peace endeavours will be hard to judge.\n\n\u201cWe start of course with Alfred Nobel\u2019s will,\u201d Lundestad said. \u201cHe mentions three criteria specifically in his will \u2014 fraternity between nations, reduction of standing armies, the holding of peace conferences \u2014 but these three criteria have to be interpreted in the light of today\u2019s situation, and that is what the committee is trying to do the best it can.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A look at three leading contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize., Alfred Nobel, Chelsea Manning, Malala Yousafzai, Nobel Peace Prize, Obama, peace, Thein Sein,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Lentsch", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "A look at three leading contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize., Alfred Nobel, Chelsea Manning, Malala Yousafzai, Nobel Peace Prize, Obama, peace, Thein Sein,", "title": "A Whistleblower, A 16-Year-Old Girl, A President: And The Prize Goes To\u2026", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/2013-nobel-peace-prize-nominees/168530/", "image": "http://mnpprodpublic.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/082213_PODmanning_915x482-690x364.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-20T09:57:14-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A look at three leading contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize., Alfred Nobel, Chelsea Manning, Malala Yousafzai, Nobel Peace Prize, Obama, peace, Thein Sein,", "title": "A Whistleblower, A 16-Year-Old Girl, A President: And The Prize Goes To\u2026", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/082213_PODmanning_915x482.jpg", "creator": "@KtLentsch", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Foreign Affairs", "tag": "Thein Sein", "published_time": "2013-09-09T05:00:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-20T09:57:14-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee2b\"", "article_summary": "A Whistleblower, A 16-Year-Old Girl, A President: And The Prize Goes To\u2026A look at three leading contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize.\nOf all the Nobel Peace Prize laureates, only 12 are women, making a case for supporters who say it\u2019s Yousafzai\u2019s time.\nSince 1901, the Nobel Peace Prize has promoted the virtues of peace and the selfless acts of individuals for the good of mankind.\nKristian Berg Harpviken, head of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo (PRIO) placed Sein on his shortlist along with five other Nobel Peace Prize recipients.\nSo, it may come as a surprise to learn that Gandhi himself never received the Peace Prize."}
