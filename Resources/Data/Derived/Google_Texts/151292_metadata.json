Nowadays, she\u2019s too popular to be cool. The performance art world would seem to agree. Marina Abramovi\u0107 has, for four decades, been a noted figure in performance art, and among its most extreme practitioners. Abramovi\u0107 is known for extreme acts; she\u2019s stripped and starved herself, often over long periods of time. Her art sits at the juncture of theater, spirituality, and masochism. If you remember that long scene in My Dinner With Andre, where Andre Gregory describes being buried alive as part of an artwork\u2014Marina Abramovi\u0107 is like that, but with more blood and nudity. Related Story Maybe It's Time for Lady Gaga to Disappear But today, she\u2019s often accused of being a sellout; the art magazine Hyperallergic referred to Abramovi\u0107\u2019s short dance with Jay Z \u201cthe day performance art died,\u201d and even The New York Times has divided her career into two parts, bisected by the 2010 retrospective and exhibit \u201cThe Artist Is Present.\u201d In the first, she\u2019s an \u201cavant-garde, inward-looking Belgrade-born experimentalist.\u201d But since 2010, she\u2019s a \u201ccelebrity darling.\u201d Something did change with the 2010 show at the Museum of Modern Art: At age 64, Abramovi\u0107 got discovered. The show was a combination of a retrospective of 40 years of work (actors restaged some of Abramovi\u0107\u2019s most notorious performance pieces: standing naked in doorways, lying naked with skeletons, etc.) and a new performance piece in which Abramovi\u0107 sat motionless, staring into the eyes of anyone who wanted to sit opposite her. As it turns out, thousands of people did, and waited up to six hours for the privilege. Since The Artist is Present, Abramovi\u0107 has collaborated with Lady Gaga, chilled with James Franco (and worked on a movie about his life), and announced the founding of the Marina Abramovi\u0107 Institute, a school in Hudson, New York, where she will teach her method to students.\n\nWell, if you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em. While it predates some of the most recent anti-Abramovi\u0107 hype, you can\u2019t help but feel that The Life and Death of Marina Abramovi\u0107, is in on the joke. It begins with the artist\u2019s funeral\u2014attended by three dogs, wandering on the stage of the Park Avenue Armory\u2014and it seems to wink at the haters, to acknowledge the transition of the last few years and to revel in it. Life and Death is actually less Abramovi\u0107\u2019s own creation than that of her artistic collaborators, a kind of hipster all-star cast featuring theater producer/auteur Robert Wilson (Einstein on the Beach), singer Antony, and actor Willem Defoe. According to the program notes\u2014formatted as a large-size newspaper with Abramovi\u0107\u2019s obituary on the front page\u2014Abramovi\u0107 only provided a few basic incidents from her life, leaving her collaborators to decide what to do with them. She has done this before\u2014offer up her life as the basis for a work created by others\u2014though never at this high a wattage. Has she sold out? That very question seems anachronistic. It implies that there is \u201chigh art\u201d at MoMA, and then \u201clow culture\u201d at the Barclays Center, and never the twain shall meet. The result, unsurprisingly, feels a lot more like Robert Wilson than like Marina Abramovi\u0107. Stunning tableaus, slow-moving gestures that are at once poignant and absurd, brilliant lighting and staging, and an elliptical form that asks as many questions as it answers. Willem Defoe is unbelievably brilliant, narrating the show in a variety of personas, and rapid-firing bewilderingly complex instructions to Abramovi\u0107\u2019s performance pieces; a blizzard of dates, affairs, and breakups; and repeated lines which function as mnemonic devices, jogging memory and giving birth to the scenes on stage. Antony\u2019s music, partly performed by the singer himself (who looks oddly like Abramovi\u0107), is as haunting and unexpected as ever. And Abramovi\u0107, playing her mother in the first act and herself in the second, is a terrifying presence.\n\nAnd yet, there is something odd about the show\u2019s first act, which focuses on Abramovi\u0107\u2019s unhappy childhood, marked by abusive, violent parents. The abuse is horrible, the staging is brilliant, and yet, it\u2019s unclear what the point of this narrative is. That Abramovi\u0107\u2019s self-endangering art really is masochistic after all? Or, worse, a reenactment of her childhood? Really? It\u2019s only in the second act that Life and Death begins to cohere. Abramovi\u0107 is brought out on a tableau, reclining like an icon. She is assumed into heaven, like an icon. And that\u2019s who\u2019s dead: the icon, the unhappy artist with the unhappy childhood, the character, the clich\u00e9. Marina Abramovi\u0107. It\u2019s this character who chants \u201cSalt\u2026 salt in my wounds,\u201d only to switch the words to \u201cGold\u2026 gold in my wounds.\u201d It\u2019s this character who is perhaps Abramovi\u0107\u2019s longest-duration performance piece yet\u2014an artifice, like Andy Kaufman\u2019s Tony Clifton, or the Bob Dylans of Todd Haynes\u2019s I\u2019m Not There or Dylan\u2019s own Masked and Anonymous. The hype is the art is the persona is the performance. For some time now, the question surrounding Abramovi\u0107 has been, Has she sold out? But that very question seems anachronistic. It implies that there is \u201chigh art\u201d at MoMA, and then \u201clow culture\u201d at the Barclays Center, and never the twain shall meet. Never mind that Warhol guy, or Keith Haring, or Takashi Murakami, or the plethora of artists who have thrived at the intersections of popular and elite culture. For that matter, maybe Michelangelo \u201csold out\u201d when he took that commission from the Medicis. The reality is, art has always sold out, and contemporary art has recognized that. Would it be better for Abramovi\u0107 to fund her new center with government grants, if the often-erotic artist could ever score one to begin with? Surely Abramovi\u0107 is using Lady Gaga for the publicity, exposure, and funding as much as Gaga is using Abramovi\u0107 for artistic credibility, shock value, and cool factor\u2014and surely both of them realize that and celebrate it. \u201cArtpop,\u201d indeed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The performance artist has raised eyebrows by working with Jay Z and Lady Gaga, but her new show embraces the age-old necessity of commodifying art.", "author": "Jay Michaelson", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The performance artist has raised eyebrows by working with Jay Z and Lady Gaga, but her new show embraces the age-old necessity of commodifying art.", "title": "Yes, Marina Abramovi\u0107 Is Selling Out\u2014and That's OK", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/marina/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/12/yes-marina-abramovi-is-selling-out-and-thats-ok/282476/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddcc8\"", "article_summary": "Marina Abramovi\u0107 has, for four decades, been a noted figure in performance art, and among its most extreme practitioners.\nMarina Abramovi\u0107.\nThe result, unsurprisingly, feels a lot more like Robert Wilson than like Marina Abramovi\u0107.\nWhile it predates some of the most recent anti-Abramovi\u0107 hype, you can\u2019t help but feel that The Life and Death of Marina Abramovi\u0107, is in on the joke.\nThe performance art world would seem to agree."}
