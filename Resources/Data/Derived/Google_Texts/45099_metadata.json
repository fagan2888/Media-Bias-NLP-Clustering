Hammons scored 19 points to lead five Purdue players in double figures, and the 20th-ranked Boilermakers held on for an 83-79 victory over No. 10 Maryland on Saturday.\n\nSophomore guard Dakota Mathias added a career-best 17 points for Purdue (22-7, 10-6 Big Ten), Rapheal Davis and Vince Edwards each scored 11 points and Caleb Swanigan had 10 points in Purdue\u2019s second victory over a top-10 opponent in 18 days.\n\nThe Boilermakers defeated No. 6 Michigan State on Feb. 9. It is also Purdue\u2019s school record-tying 16th home victory this season.\n\nHammons made a free throw with 1:49 left to break a 76-76 tie, and a layup by Johnny Hill made it 79-76 with 1:16 to go.\n\nDavis and Edwards each made two free throws in the final 23.1 seconds to help the Boilermakers withstand a late charge from Maryland (23-6, 11-5 Big Ten).\n\nMelo Trimble led the Terrapins with 19 points, Diamond Stone scored 18 points and Jake Layman added 15 points.\n\nThe Terrapins used a 12-2 run to tie it at 76-76 on a layup by Layman with 2:12 remaining. That 12-2 burst was fueled by five Purdue turnovers in two minutes after building a 10-point lead.\n\nA 9-3 burst helped Maryland cut the Purdue lead to 58-56 with 10:36 to play, but Swanigan hit a 3-pointer and a layup off a perfect pass from Mathias to push the lead to 63-56 with 9:49 left.\n\nPurdue extended its lead to 71-62 with 6:02 left on a putback by Hammons and to 74-64 on a 3-pointer by Hammons with 4:13 remaining.\n\nWith Mathias making five consecutive shots and scoring 12 first-half points, the Boilermakers led, 44-39, through 20 minutes, during which they shot 57.6 percent from the field. Purdue outrebounded the Terrapins, 21-9, in the first half.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hammons scored 20 points, making a free throw with 1:49 left to break a tie, and foul shooting over the rest of the game helped Purdue hang on for a 83-79 victory over No. 10 Maryland.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hammons scored 20 points, making a free throw with 1:49 left to break a tie, and foul shooting over the rest of the game helped Purdue hang on for a 83-79 victory over No. 10 Maryland.", "title": "A.J.
