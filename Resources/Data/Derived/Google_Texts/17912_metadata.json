He is a native Denverite who turned into a newspaper institution with an encyclopedic knowledge of sports from kids to pros. Now 81 years old, he still has ink running through his veins and remains a combination of bulldog and gentleman.\n\nHis name is Homer (you know him as Irv) Moss, fittingly the first Denver Post sportswriter to be inducted into the Colorado High School Activities Association Hall of Fame, which will occur Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI really feel good about the fact that I started out in this business covering the high school sports,\u201d Moss said. \u201cI think there\u2019s an element there that if you don\u2019t do it, you miss out.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of college, the 1952 graduate of Denver\u2019s West High was drafted into the Army while working at The Post. He eventually reported on servicemen playing sports overseas for a military publication while stationed in Germany.\n\nWhen he returned in March 1959, the former copy boy said \u201cthey put me in sports and I\u2019ve been there ever since.\u201d Moss said he had a large crew that he supervised, including Joe Sanchez, Michael Knisley, Terry Anderson and Mike Monroe.\n\nMoss said those were the glory days. He could write \u2014 and did \u2014 chapter and verse about all that was happening on the Colorado sports landscape. He witnessed the height of the Denver Prep League before suburbia took over. He saw the old Parochial League. Opposing coaches would whine about the DPL\u2019s advantage playing in the old Auditorium Arena \u2014 it would help them in the state tournament. A Saturday meant covering four consecutive city football games.\n\nCoaches? Moss knew Pat Panek. Tom Hancock. Dick Yates. Still talks with Guy Gibbs and Fred Tesone. And he presented The Denver Post Gold Helmet, which had switched from the Thom McAn shoe or boot, to Wheat Ridge\u2019s Fred Steinmark before he died of cancer. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ll always remember,\u201d Moss said.\n\nHe convinced The Post to sponsor an all-star baseball game that began with public schools vs. private schools, then the city against the suburbans, and was one of the most popular events of any school year. After 1968, he switched to covering Wyoming sports, then handled his beloved Air Force Falcons from 1970 to a couple of years ago, notably the football teams coached by Ben Martin, Ken Hatfield and Fisher DeBerry.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not the most talented guys around, but when they can beat Notre Dame four straight years, that\u2019s amazing for Air Force to be able to do that,\u201d Moss said.\n\nHe had only spot duty covering ice hockey and the Broncos, but he remains convinced that he was first with a source in the meeting that led to the birth of the Rockies and later broke the story of which colors Denver\u2019s first major-league baseball team would sport.\n\nIn addition, his Colorado Classics, which still grace these pages \u2014 and our website \u2014 continue as one of his great sources of pride, periodic offerings on individuals, blasts from the past with a sense of authentication because, well, Moss was there covering that person.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been accepted well by readers,\u201d he said. \u201cI get something on them all the time. People say they\u2019re new in town and it kind of gives them a way of hearing what happened in the past.\u201d\n\nHaving worked alongside hundreds of peers, several sports editors and for many newspaper ownership groups, Moss will continue writing. Even with the newspaper industry in constant change, Moss said the rounds of buyouts over the years as an incentive to leave or take retirement \u201cweren\u2019t for me.\u201d Recently, he was honored with the Football Writers Association of America lifetime achievement award.\n\nLike his current column, Moss is a Colorado Classic.\n\nNeil H.
