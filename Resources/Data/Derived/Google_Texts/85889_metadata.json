Workers who want extended benefits can then \u201cbuy up\u201d using their own money for a richer suite of coverage. Private exchanges are a diverse, flexible marketplace: Some offer plans from just one insurer, other sell plans from various insurers, and the choices can include self-insured plans.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe interest in private exchanges is like nothing we\u2019ve seen in recent memory,\u201d said Eric Grossman, exchange business leader for Mercer\u2019s health and benefits business. The company launched its Mercer Marketplace private exchange for the 2014 health plan year and has so far signed up 90 employers with 290,000 lives. Mercer, which offers plans from 30 insurance companies, has members in New Jersey, but doesn\u2019t report enrollment by state.\n\n\n\nHorizon launched its HorizonSelect private exchange in the spring of 2013 and it has been very well received, according to spokesman Tom Vincz. Horizon declined to provide enrollment figures, but said they are up six-fold since the launch last year.\n\n\n\n\u201cBusiness clients range from 40 employees to 1,000 employees, and are located in multiple regions throughout the state and are engaged in multiple industries,\u201d Vincz said.\n\n\n\nGrossman said Mercer Marketplace employers on average have lowered their annual medical cost by $800 per employee. About 70 percent of the savings went to the employers, while the rest benefited employees through lower contributions to their health plan.\n\n\n\n\u201cMost of that cost saving is coming from helping employees recognize that in many cases they have been over-insured,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cWe help them to right-size their coverage to more appropriate levels.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE to subscribe to the free NJBIZ email newsletters\n\n\n\nOften employees cut their premiums by selecting a higher deductible plan, which potentially will increase their out-of-pocket costs. Grossman said, \u201cIf the employees are concerned they are taking on too much risk, they can use some of their savings to buy a supplemental health policy, such as an accident insurance policy, to protect against that risk.\u201d\n\n\n\nGrossman said, \u201cAt the end of the day we expand choice for the employees and in many cases the best choice will be a lower and less costly level of coverage than what they have today.\u201d\n\n\n\nHealth policy experts see private exchanges playing a key role in keeping employers in the health insurance game. The idea is that the employer\u2019s health care costs will be more predictable, and thus make employer-sponsored health insurance more attractive going forward.\n\n\n\nThe private exchange \u201cis an innovative product that helps businesses control their health care costs while doing right by their employees to offer health insurance coverage,\u201d Vincz said.\n\n\n\nVincz said Horizon is \u201cseeing tremendous interest and appetite for HorizonSelect in the medium to large business group markets,\u201d and the company will hold a webinar explaining HorizonSelect on July 15. The company also created a dedicated website, ChooseHorizonSelect.com.\n\n\n\nAmeriHealth New Jersey launched its private exchange in 2013. Mike Munoz, senior vice president, sales and marketing, said: \"We are very pleased with the performance of our private exchange, MyAHNJ, to date. We aim to provide maximum choice to New Jersey businesses and their employees, and our private exchange offers employees affordable options to select the health plan that most closely matches their needs.\"\n\nThe alternative for employers is to drop health coverage altogether and let workers buy their own policies on the federal government\u2019s public exchange at HealthCare.gov, where insurers sell health plans that are subsidized by the Affordable Care Act. In its first year in New Jersey, the federal government reported that 162,000 New Jerseyans signed up for coverage at HealthCare.gov, with the majority getting federal subsidies to make that coverage more affordable.\n\n\n\nIn 2015 employers with 50 or more full-time-equivalent workers have to offer health plans or pay penalties, and employers who don\u2019t offer health insurance lose the tax deduction for their share of the cost.\n\n\n\nAccording to a survey last year by the Private Exchange Evaluation Collaborative, 45 percent of employers will either consider or actually switch to a private exchange by 2018. The collaborative is made up of four nonprofit business coalitions and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm; PwC does not offer a private exchange.\n\n\n\nAetna spokeswoman Susan G. Millerick said in addition to surveys showing widespread interest in private exchanges among employers, research indicates that \u201cthe majority of surveyed employees are willing to embrace this change.\u201d She said the trends reflect \u201ca shift to greater consumer choice and engagement.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe said Aetna offers plans on about 20 third-party private exchanges in addition to its own proprietary private exchange, Aetna Marketplace: \u201cWe believe private exchanges can offer significant value for both employers and consumers and we are continuing to actively participate in this growing distribution channel.\u201d\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nCongoleum warns of potential job cuts\n\nSuddenly, developer is flush with industrial space\n\nPharma company completes headquarters move from Houston to Morristown", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "Employers across a wide spectrum of sizes and industries are exploring private exchanges, where workers shop for their own health plans and can select one that fits their medical needs and their hous", "title": "Private exchanges gaining popularity in health plan world | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20140709/NJBIZ01/140709794/private-exchanges-gaining-popularity-in-health-plan-world", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140709/NJBIZ01/140709794/AR/0/AR-140709794.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "Employers across a wide spectrum of sizes and industries are exploring private exchanges, where workers shop for their own health plans and can select one that fits their medical needs and their hous", "creator": "@bethfitzgerald8", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140709/NJBIZ01/140709794/AR/0/AR-140709794.jpg"}, "title": "Private exchanges gaining popularity in health plan world | NJBIZ", "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Employers across a wide spectrum of sizes and industries are exploring private exchanges, where workers shop for their own health plans and can select one that fits their medical needs and their household budget.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0326\"", "article_summary": "A private exchange may be a \u201cdefined benefit\u201d plan in which the employer gives workers an allowance to shop for a health plan.\nAccording to a survey last year by the Private Exchange Evaluation Collaborative, 45 percent of employers will either consider or actually switch to a private exchange by 2018.\nThe idea is that the employer\u2019s health care costs will be more predictable, and thus make employer-sponsored health insurance more attractive going forward.\nPrivate exchanges are a diverse, flexible marketplace: Some offer plans from just one insurer, other sell plans from various insurers, and the choices can include self-insured plans.\nHorizon launched its HorizonSelect private exchange in the spring of 2013 and it has been very well received, according to spokesman Tom Vincz."}
